Shelly Hubbard: Thank you, operator, and welcome to Pentair's first quarter 2025 earnings conference call. On the call with me are John Stauch, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Bob Fishman, our Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, we will provide details on our first quarter performance, as outlined in this morning's press release. On the Pentair Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings release and slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provide a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures that we will reference. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the impact these items and events have on the financial results. Before we begin, let me remind you that during our presentation today, we will make forward-looking statements which are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Pentair. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-Ks. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call up for questions. Please limit your questions to two and reenter the queue if needed to allow everyone an opportunity to participate. I will now turn the call over to John.
John Stauch: Thank you, Shelly. Good morning, everyone. Let's turn to the Q1 executive summary on Slide seven. We delivered our twelfth consecutive quarter of margin expansion and another strong quarter of earnings growth while operating in a dynamic environment. Our businesses and functional teams continue to execute with agility across our Move, Improve, and Enjoy Water segments to mitigate tariff impacts, launch innovation, win awards, generate new accounts, expand existing key accounts, deliver margin expansion driven by transformation, and continue to implement 80/20. I am very grateful for how our teams continue to rise to the challenge and deliver for customers while creating value for shareholders. In the first quarter, sales were down 1% and were better than expected with pool growing 7%, offset by difficult comparisons in commercial water within Water Solutions, and continued challenges in residential and irrigation markets within Flow. Adjusted operating income increased 12% to $243 million, ROS expanded by 260 basis points to 24%, and adjusted EPS was $1.11, up 18%. We repurchased $50 million of shares and increased our dividend for the 49th consecutive year, further solidifying our dividend aristocrat status. Lastly, we maintained our full-year 2025 sales and adjusted EPS guidance of $4.65 to $4.80, which is up approximately 9% at the midpoint year over year. Let's move to the tariff and inflation update on slide eight. We are remaining agile in a rapidly changing environment. Bob will provide more detail on our estimated tariff impact and mitigation strategies in a moment. Our initial guidance on February 4 incorporated estimated impacts from tariffs and an expectation that volume would likely decline as prices rose. As a result, while the tariff amounts by country have changed since our last earnings call, some tariffs have been paused, we feel comfortable maintaining our initial 2025 sales and adjusted 2025 EPS guidance with the current tariff impacts. We have taken several steps to mitigate tariffs across our portfolio and continue to position our businesses to be successful in both the short term and the long term. We believe we have multiple advantages, including a two-step distribution model representing about 75% of our sales that generally enables us to pass along price increases when we are not uniquely dealing with inflationary pressures. A high recurring revenue base generated from a majority of non-discretionary replacement products, a global supply chain with reduced reliance on China, a strong U.S. manufacturing footprint, strong free cash flow, a solid balance sheet, and a well-balanced capital deployment strategy across debt repayment, dividends, share repurchases, and M&A. We are also applying our prior inflationary learnings to manage our channel and maximize our performance. Let's turn to Slide nine. Despite a dynamic environment, we continue to deliver on our transformation goals to drive margin expansion. In 2023 and 2024 combined, we saved $174 million due to our transformation initiatives, and we expect to deliver another $80 million this year net of investments. We expect our sourcing waves one and two to continue to contribute to these savings. We are implementing wave three, which we expect will begin to add another layer of saving in 2025 and beyond. Looking at operational excellence, we are driving operational efficiency with our factories through lean practices, automation, digital transformation, and optimizing our operational footprint. We expect to rapidly accelerate productivity when volumes within our core markets return to normalized levels. As we continue to implement 80/20, we expect to drive high-value core sales growth long term by overserving our best customers and optimizing the rest. We have taken actions to transition our quad three and four lower margin to purchase directly from our top distributors or accept new terms and conditions that we expect to enable us to become a larger and more profitable business. We are also optimizing the selection of products we offer, reducing complexity within our operations, and advancing productivity. Additionally, 80/20 actions have helped us to absorb higher inflation and see 80/20 as an enabler to transformation by reducing complexity and streamlining our businesses. Let's turn to Slide ten. Before I hand the call over to Bob, I wanted to reiterate some key takeaways. We had solid execution across all three of our segments. In Q1, pool grew 7% while transformation and strong execution drove triple-digit margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth for Pentair. We delivered better than expected productivity savings from transformation despite lower volumes. We are maintaining our initial sales and adjusted EPS 2025 guidance provided on February 4, which includes estimated tariff impacts, mitigation strategies, and the use of our 80/20 and transportation toolkit. We continue to build a foundation of optimal operational efficiency that can be leveraged when volume returns to normal. We have a balanced water portfolio with a capital-light business model and the ability to mostly pass along price. And finally, we have strong free cash flow, a solid balance sheet, a low net debt to EBITDA leverage ratio, and a balanced capital deployment strategy. As a water company providing solutions to move, improve, and enjoy water, we continue to believe that we are well-positioned to address opportunities from favorable secular trends by getting water to where it needs to be, away from where it doesn't, and by filtering and improving water for people to drink and enjoy. I will now pass the call over to Bob, who will discuss our performance and financial results in more detail. Bob?
Bob Fishman: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide eleven. We delivered another strong quarter of quality earnings with triple-digit margin expansion and double-digit adjusted income and EPS growth despite lower volume. Sales, margin, and adjusted earnings outperformed our expectations. In Q1, sales were $1 billion, down 1%. Adjusted operating income increased 12% to $243 million, ROS expanded 260 basis points to 24%, driven primarily by transformation, and adjusted EPS increased 18% to $1.11. Core sales were down 1% year over year, driven by 4% growth in pool, which was offset by a 3% decline in flow and a 4% decline in water solutions. Pool and water solutions outperformed our expectations while Flow was in line with our guidance. Please turn to slide twelve. Flow sales declined 4% year over year. Within flow, residential sales were down 6%, as higher interest rates continued to pressure residential end markets. Commercial sales rose 3%, marking the eleventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales growth. And industrial sales were down 9%, driven by a focus on profitable and higher-margin business. Segment income grew 8%, and return on sales expanded 260 basis points to nearly 23%. The strong margin expansion was a result of continued progress on our transformation initiatives. Flow continued to benefit from changes the segment made in its go-to-market strategies over the last two years and its focus on complexity reduction. Please turn to slide thirteen. In Q1, water solution sales declined 5% to $258 million, which outperformed our expectations. Sales in commercial filtration increased year over year while ice performed as expected and residential performed better than expected. As a reminder, the ICE business faced difficult year-over-year comparisons as Q1 in the prior year included a larger rollout in China. We expect ICE to begin to return to more normalized growth rates going forward. Segment income grew 9% to $61 million, and return on sales expanded 310 basis points to 23.5%, driven by higher productivity from transformation and 80/20 actions in Q1. Please turn to Slide fourteen. In Q1, pool sales increased 7% to $384 million, driven by price, volume, and our Q4 2024 acquisition. Segment income was $126 million, up 14%, and return on sales increased 200 basis points to 32.8%, driven by sales growth and transformation. Please turn to slide fifteen. We are well into our transformation journey and continue to see strong results. Last quarter, we increased our 2026 ROS target from 24%, as provided in our March 2024 Investor Day, to 26%. Our goal is to drive incremental sales growth through value-based pricing and 80/20 and to deliver a return on sales of 26% in 2026, or margin expansion of over 700 basis points since 2022, utilizing the four pillars of transformation. We achieved 23.5% in 2024 and expect to deliver approximately 25% in 2025. We've made great progress as our teams have continued to succeed. Please turn to Slide sixteen. Our balance sheet remains strong, and our return on invested capital continued to improve, nearly reaching 16% in Q1. Long term, we continue to target high teens ROIC. Our net debt leverage ratio is 1.6 times, down from 2.1 times a year ago. During the quarter, we repurchased $50 million of shares. Over the last two years, our strong free cash flow has enabled us to deploy approximately $1.4 billion in capital via debt pay down, dividends, share repurchases, and a strategic acquisition. We plan to remain disciplined with our capital and have additional flexibility to strategically allocate capital to areas with the highest shareholder returns. Let's turn to our outlook on slide seventeen. For the full year, we are maintaining our adjusted EPS guidance of $4.65 to $4.80, which is up roughly 7% to 11% year over year. Also, for the full year, we are maintaining our sales guidance of approximately flat to up 2%, which assumes FX and tariff-related price increases are roughly offset by anticipated tariff-related volume declines. We expect adjusted operating income to increase approximately 6% to 9%, which includes the assumption that price increases are offset by higher tariffs net of mitigation actions and associated volume drop-through. We continue to expect to drive approximately $80 million in net of investment. For the second quarter, we expect sales to be up approximately 1% to 2%. We expect pool sales to be up approximately mid-single digits, and water solutions and flow sales to be roughly flat. We expect second-quarter adjusted operating income to increase approximately 5%, and we expect margin expansion across all three segments in Q2. We're also introducing adjusted EPS guidance for the second quarter of approximately $1.31 to $1.35, up roughly 7% to 11%. Let's turn to slide eighteen. The purpose of this chart is to highlight the estimated tariff impact based on what we know today. The estimated tariff impact of roughly $140 million net of mitigation actions is primarily from China, as you can see on the left-hand side of the chart. The remainder of the tariffs include smaller amounts from Mexico, Europe, the rest of the world, and the steel and aluminum tariff. In our initial 2025 guidance, we had included an estimated impact of enacted and potential tariffs, and we began taking actions in Q1 to mitigate risk. We've taken further actions to mitigate the impacts of tariffs. Some examples of these include tariff-related price increases, inventory pre-buys, and capping orders to optimize our supply chain inventory and production. Over 90% of goods that we import to the US from Mexico qualify under the current USMCA. And through our transformation sourcing initiatives, we have already lowered our supply and production from China over the last three years. We also expect that we can pass along pricing through our channel, as 75% of our sales are to two-step distribution, in which we sell into distribution, who then sells to dealers and ultimately the end consumer. As a reminder, over 75% of our sales are also aftermarket or break-fix related revenue. We continue to monitor the rapidly changing landscape and remain agile to quickly adjust as necessary. We believe that we are taking the right actions to mitigate tariff impacts. We have a strong balance sheet and a balanced capital allocation strategy. Our significant free cash flow enables us to continue to pay down debt, increase our dividend, repurchase shares, and remain strategic on M&A. We plan to continue to deploy capital in areas that drive the highest return for our shareholders while being mindful of protecting capital during periods of macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for Q&A, after which John will have a few closing remarks. Operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we'll begin the question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, you may do so by pressing star and then one using a touch-tone telephone. We do ask that you please pick up your handset before pressing the keys to ensure the best sound quality. We do ask that you please limit yourself to a single question and a follow-up. To withdraw your questions, you may press star and two. Once again, that is star and then one to join the question queue. Our first question today comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.
Julian Mitchell: Hello? Julian, your line is open. Hi. Good morning. Sorry about that. Maybe just my first question would be around the assumptions on organic sales as you're going through the year. You know, and help us understand the volume of some growth sales guide, do you assume a sort of offset, you know, one for one of higher price of, say, three points offset by lower volume.
John Stauch: Yeah. Julian, as a reminder, I think when we started this year, we did not anticipate that we would see recovery in the North American residential housing, which is roughly 50% of our revenue. And we counted on it a little bit last year and thought we'd see lower interest rates. When we entered this year, we've kind of put that on the upside to our original guide. As you take a look at the way tariffs are coming through, they're different than what we anticipated on February 4, but they still are going to lead to higher prices through the channel. And we think we could see de-featuring. We think we could see consumers defer. So we're anticipating that. We don't know that, but that is the assumption in our current guide is that the more price goes up, the more volume we'll likely see start to soften.
Julian Mitchell: That's helpful. Thank you. And then just to understand on the tariff element, the sort of $140 million gross, is that an annualized number or is that sort of in year in fiscal 2025? And any help you could give us on differences in sort of phasing of the offsets through the year or differences in sort of offsets by segment? Any sort of color around that, please?
John Stauch: Yeah. I'll start off, and I'll give it to Bob. I mean, you know, you're right on your assumption it is the in-year 2025 number. I mean, I think it would be slightly higher on an annual basis. We are getting some small benefits related to mitigation of buy-aheads and things that we bought in Q1 and also the fact that we do have inventory on hand. So as you think about the tariffs, it'll mostly hit the second half of the year as it unfolds. And then our pricing has stayed between April actions, May actions, and potentially June actions if necessary. And so those as we head into 2026, more than offset the tariffs, they more than offset this year as they phase in. Julian. And then, Bob, you wanna give it by segment?
Bob Fishman: Yeah. I think the only thing I would add is that we think of that $140 million net of mitigating actions as split about a third, a third, a third between flow, water solutions, and pool.
Operator: And our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.
Andrew Kaplowitz: Hey. Good morning, everyone.
Bob Fishman: Hi, Andy. How are you?
Andrew Kaplowitz: Good. John and Bob, you're assuming you could absorb the entire $140 million of incremental tariffs in your margin guidance, which I think is decently higher than your original tariff assumption from last quarter. And I think today, you Bob, you got it to the higher end of your margin range, 25%. Is that basically all the prices that get you there? Do you have higher embedded productivity in your forecast? And how much of it all is currency helping you in terms of talent?
Bob Fishman: Yeah. From a I'll start with the last one. Currency helps a little bit. I think of it as, you know, being roughly 50 basis points, but, you know, not much help to the income or the bottom line. I would say that, you know, to John's point, it's primarily us pricing to exceed the tariffs, a volume drop that's, you know, roughly in line with that. We do benefit slightly from mix. That's helping us out a little bit. But overall, we feel good that, you know, we're closer to that 25% ROS as we run the different scenarios.
Andrew Kaplowitz: Helpful. And then, John, you didn't change your pool forecast growth for 2025, but maybe give us a little more color into what you're seeing as the selling season develops here in Q2 as rates, you know, they look like they wanna stay relatively high. Is it 60k in pull still the right number, positive break and fix? Just any color be helpful in the year.
John Stauch: Yeah. And I think we saw, you know, as we normally see, you know, if there was any movement in Q1, most of the movement that we saw in the sell-through sell-in was more what we think is weather-related. In certain regions getting off to a slower start. As we head into Q2, we're thinking that we're right in line with where we thought we were before as the season unfolds, most of those pools were already being built or the permits were in place and they needed to get finished. And then we would anticipate in this particular outlook that we would see some softening in either the remodeling aspect of the pool or as I said earlier, some discretionary push-outs on some larger ticket items as it relates to even the break and fix in the back half of the year. So those price increases will go in, and then we would expect that consumers will look for the best timing of when they should replace their product. So I think that's a fair balanced approach. I think it's still a good industry in the sense that, you know, we're at a more of a historical low level. So significant downside from here is hard to see. And we're gonna have to work harder on getting consumers and getting our dealers to sell the high-end features that we want within this environment.
Andrew Kaplowitz: Thanks, John. Appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Bob Fishman: Morning, Dean.
Deane Dray: Hi, Dave.
John Stauch: Hey. I was hoping to get some more color regarding your prepositioning of inventory. You had a tariff. So what was the impact there? And then there's in the release, you talk about also capping orders for customers. Just, you know, what's the strategy there? How is that played out? And I was curious if anyone any of your suppliers were capping any of your orders for prepositioning.
John Stauch: Yeah. You know, Dean, I mean, just on the mitigating thing, think about a couple months of inventory being pretty basic throughout the channel and, you know, given the fact that we're talking about the substantial tariffs coming from China, most of the things are preordered and on their way so that that's it's a modest amount of number, but it does help you from a timing and a delay perspective. Especially given the fact that most of it is raw materials, which is a subcomponent of a subcomponent. So it's I wouldn't say it's really in the action we took on. It's just the normal part of the supply chain that we were dealing with. You know, as far as the overall environment of what we're looking at, I would say that we're capping the order strategy primarily the learning from the last supply chain issue we had where if we let the channel just buy whatever it wants to buy, it's gonna get try to get ahead of all of the potential increases and you create shadow inventory and inventory. So we're working with our top customers and giving them an ability to order at sell-through rates which then gives them the necessary inventory they have to meet the demand. But doesn't get us in a situation where we get behind or disruptive in the supply chain again. Just the learning from the last go around.
Deane Dray: Got it. And then just broadly, what's your expectation for the businesses? Any demand destruction that's happened from all the tariff uncertainty? And are you seeing any project push-outs, cancellations? Anything that would be material in your outlook?
John Stauch: Not yet, Dean. I mean, we are definitely looking for the fact I mean, we are a small part of usually a project, and we are, you know, definitely more of the break and fix of the needed components. But we're keeping an eye out on the future projects where, you know, a large project could be paused or deferred. And this would be on more on the, you know, food and beverage side and or the large infrastructure pump sides. We have not yet seen anything, but we're keeping an eye on it and making sure that we're looking through sell-throughs and making sure we're looking at front log orders to make sure we're not, you know, in an adverse position there. Now most of those projects are local for local. So they're not necessarily impacted by each tariffs.
Operator: And our next question comes from Mike Halloran from Baird. Please go ahead with your question.
Mike Halloran: Hey. Good morning, everyone.
Bob Fishman: Good morning, Mike.
Mike Halloran: Hey, Mike. So a little bit of a follow-up to that. How's the channel reacting at this point? I know you've limited, you know, are limiting the amount they can pre-buy. Is there any sense that they're trying to take inventory down at any levels? Are they responding? And, you know, earlier you mentioned about Salesforce having to be a little bit more proactive to upsell. You know, have you put that in place in how are you interacting with the channel when it comes to managing a lot of say this in a flipper joking way. This is probably the most exhaustive quarter I can ever remember participating in. I say that because we run so many different scenarios and so many different alternatives of what this could be. I mean, think about the way this quarter played out. You know, the way the announcements came, the way you heard about them, the reactions, the counter tariffs, the retaliatory, tariffs are in, they're paused. And so I think the right answer to say is everybody's looking and seeking that solution. Like, I think right now, as I mentioned, I think a lot of projects that are getting completed now were put in motion a while ago, and you're just to the stage where you're gonna finish pool or you're gonna finish that, you know, particular need in that housing development. I think the bigger decisions and the way the channel gonna react is still out there. In a couple quarters. Like, depending on what scenario we see play out. Just being honest.
Mike Halloran: Yeah. No. And that makes sense. And that makes sense. On the capital usage side, any change in how you're thinking about buybacks in the short term I'm guessing no shift on the M&A side. But if anything's interesting on that side, certainly curious there too.
Bob Fishman: Yeah. You probably noticed that we did do a $50 million share buyback in Q1. That's a little unusual for us. Usually, we wait till our bigger free cash flow quarter in Q2, but we felt good about the free cash flow. It's at, you know, $70 million better than the prior year. But overall, I would say we're continuing to be disciplined around our capital allocation, continuing to do debt pay down, share buyback. We increased our dividend by 9%. And, you know, looking at strategic bolt-on M&A if they come our way. So that balanced approach has been good to us, and I think we'll continue to look at ROIC, which was close to 16% in the quarter. And stay very focused on shareholder returns.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.
Steve Tusa: Hey. Good morning, guys.
Bob Fishman: Like this morning.
Steve Tusa: Can you hear me okay?
Bob Fishman: Yes. Now we can.
Steve Tusa: Yep. Hey. Sorry about that. So I just wanted to make sure from an annual base you guys didn't provide the profit bridge in the deck. Just wanted to make sure that the kind of $80 million of productivity is still there, kind of the core inflation number think it was roughly that, is also still there. And then I guess if we just assume the $140 gets entirely offset at the price that would get us to, like, a 5% year-over-year price number for the company in total. Is are those you just stick on the $140 of tariff headwind. Is that are those kind of the moving parts of the bridge and then you back out volume?
John Stauch: Well, we didn't provide a bridge, but if we were, that would be pretty close to it.
Steve Tusa: Yeah. Steve, I'd answer yes, yes, and yes.
Bob Fishman: You know, your price assumption makes sense to us. The productivity has stayed at $80 million net of investment, and we're off to a pretty fast start here in Q1 versus certainly versus last year. And then the core inflation number, you know, prior to tariffs makes sense as well.
Steve Tusa: Got it. Okay. And then just one last one just on pool. I'm not sure if I caught this before, but what is the, like, channel telling you about? I think you would that if you address these tariffs, you would expect some demand destruction. Is any feedback on the channel on that so far?
John Stauch: Not yet, Steve. I think we're well-positioned. I mean, 80/20 has been a great tool for us. Keep in mind, we're really only shipping to a handful of key distributors now directly, you know, as part of the 80/20 effort. And so it's a lot less channel partners that we have to work through. And I think in our perspective, we think all of them think they're being treated fairly, and I think right now, what you're hoping for is that you don't see large price increases that would be disruptive by having price decreases in the future. And so we've paced out the price increases, and I think we've done that in a thoughtful way. And I think so far, it's given the channel a heads up on what's coming. And I think they're prepared for it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond from Auto Markets. Please go ahead with your question.
Jeffrey Hammond: Hey, good morning, guys.
Bob Fishman: Hi, guys.
Jeffrey Hammond: Hey, just the tariff details, Greg. Can you just level set us on what percentage of your cost of goods sold's sourced from China today versus, you know, three years ago, it seems like you've been moving it. And then if we kinda live in this world going forward, what are the big changes you're contemplating to your sourcing and manufacturing footprint long term?
John Stauch: Yeah. I mean, mathematically, Jeff, when you calculate, you'll see that it's just less than $100 million that's sourced from China. Doesn't seem like a lot, but you put a big pretty hefty tariff on there, and it starts to impact us. It also is one of those situations where very little of it's finished goods. So a lot of it is a subset of a subset, which means it's spread across a lot of different products and a lot of different motors and items like that that take time to actually unwind, Jeff, in the sense that we have to get certifications. We have to get approvals, we have to reengineer. So we're in a situation where even though it's not a lot, it's still enough to be annoying. And we're working through that. Answer your other question, it would have been about two and a half times that. We would have gone back three or four years ago. And as we were looking through our transformation process, we were able to mitigate a lot of that single country exposure. Did not think this was gonna come. Not gonna say that's why we did it. We really just wanted to spread out the purchase by across many different suppliers so that we weren't in any one single risk situation.
Jeffrey Hammond: Okay. That's helpful. And then is there anything in the guide contemplated around restructuring actions you might take if you do see that demand destruction and any kind of ability to pull forward or ramp up transformation above that $80 million if we do start to see that demand destruction?
Bob Fishman: Yeah. Jeff, we're in the process of looking at all that. You know, we don't forecast the actual transformation impact, but I think the next wave of projects would be probably relative related to how do we reposition our supply chains and how do we reposition our factories to be more effective. Most of that would be realized in 2026 and beyond. Because it would take time to actually benefit from that cost out.
John Stauch: Yeah. And from a transformation perspective, we're always working on a funnel that's two to three times higher than our commit. And so that gives us the flexibility to use transformation as we need to.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nathan Jones from Stifel.
Nathan Jones: Good morning, everyone.
Bob Fishman: Good morning.
Nathan Jones: I'll start with a question on competitive differences. I'm sure your supply chain is not always exactly the same positioning as your competitor's supply chain. Are there places where you see either risks or opportunities given an advantaged or disadvantaged supply chain relative to your competitors?
John Stauch: Yes. I mean, it is why I chose the wording I chose in that second bullet on the slide we're gonna position ourselves to be the best for our businesses in the short run and long run, meaning some of our businesses don't have the ability to just pull the price lever. They're gonna have to compete, and we're likely to see some margin challenges there as we work through the longer-term actions and some of our businesses aren't in a situation where price might actually exceed the tariffs.
Nathan Jones: Okay. And I guess then on the China sourcing, you know, it's less than it used to be, but still when you put a 145% tariff on it, pretty material. Are there already plans enacted to move more of that supply chain out of China? Can you get the whole lot out of China? Are there things that you know, you can only get from China? How should we think about that? I know you said, you know, that's probably until 2026, and you can't snap fingers to make it happen.
John Stauch: Yes, yes, and yes to what you just said. There's things we can only get from China. You know, we're gonna have to make a determination if customers still want that product. You know, embedded in some of that volume, which is some of the mitigating aspects is we just might not be able to carry that product line going forward because we can't be competitive. It's the only place it could be sourced at. And then that addresses the mix issue that Bob said. How do we move somebody to a, you know, it might be a more expensive product line on a normalized basis, but probably less expensive given the tariffs and probably provides a better solution. And then that helps free up what the supply chain could look like in the future, and then we could start to assess what we need to do longer term.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Blair from Oppenheimer. Go ahead with your question.
Brian Blair: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Bob Fishman: Hi, Brian.
Brian Blair: Obviously, you're pacing ahead of the $80 million in guidance. Transformation benefit for the year. And if we assume that $80 million is the number and that that does not move higher, how should we think about the phasing or cadence of the remaining $56 million or Q2 to Q4? And how does that shake out by segment?
Bob Fishman: That $56 million would be pretty evenly spread for each of the quarters. And, you know, by segment, it continues to be, you know, a flow play. Water solutions also have some complexity reduction. So I usually look at flow and water solution first, and then, you know, pool, this will be if they drive the growth that we forecasted in Q2, this will be their fifth consecutive quarter of top-line growth, and that certainly helps the leverage. So again, feel good about all three segments participating in the transformation.
Brian Blair: Understood. Appreciate the detail. And you maintain the consolidated ROS outlook for the year actually signaled the higher end is of the range, which is encouraging. Is there any change in expectation by segment you had? Last quarter, I believe, broken out around 100 basis points in the pool, roughly equal contribution from the other segments. Just curious with everything that's going on and the moving parts of navigating this environment, if the platform level expectations have shifted.
Bob Fishman: Not really. Those estimates continue to track well for this forecast.
Brian Blair: Understood. Thank you again.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Krill from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.
Andrew Krill: Hi. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So let's step back and take a slightly longer-term view, but I know you mentioned again your 2026 targets, including the 26% margin. And then think as of last earnings, you know, you said low single-digit growth this year and next year was kind of the path and assumption to get there. So just what's your level of confidence is still hitting that margin target in 2026? And, like, say we did have some form of a, you know, mini recession here, like, you still think you have enough contingency in those plans to get to that 26% margin next year? Thanks.
Bob Fishman: Yeah. We continue to feel good about that 26%. So, you know, something around 25% this year. 26% led by transformation next year, so I had that in my prepared remarks. And we continue to feel good about the 26 in 2026.
Andrew Krill: Okay. Great. And on just April, I know it's early in the quarter, but just any, you know, anything going poorly in the first week or two you might have some information on April trends?
John Stauch: Yeah. No. Our guide includes all that. Obviously, you know, we'll expect to see a lot of different order patterns here in Q2. Depending on, you know, how the channels are working through the various tariff impacts. And we're looking at sell-through, we're looking at all the data, and we think our Q2 is the best practical guide we have, and full year is the best.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Giordano from TD Cowen.
Joe Giordano: Hey, good morning, guys.
Bob Fishman: Morning. Hi, Joe.
Joe Giordano: John, you were around during the Tyco days. So to say that this is, like, the most exhausting quarter you can you remember that's a strong statement.
John Stauch: That is true. And I had a dual job back in those days too. But, yes, it is the most exhausting. And by the way, I don't mean that for me. I worry about all the finance teams and the operations and sourcing teams. I mean, you're doing transformation and then layer on top of that, you know, relooking at the supply chain again and all the different impacts. Couldn't be more proud and grateful for the work that the entire team has done.
Joe Giordano: So just curious, on these price increases, are they different than normal ones? Like, how specifically tied are they to tariffs? Like, if something happened tomorrow and tariffs go away, do you have to go back out and cancel these price increases?
John Stauch: No. I mean, we generally don't have a channel that loves the charge or, you know, a specific incremental amount that's tied to a particular product line. It's easier to do more across-the-board types of actions. What I would say is different this time, and we are pacing them out, so we have more of 30-day increments, which allows us to continue to react to what's known and to anticipate what could happen. And I think that allows the channel to generally get ahead a little bit of where they need to be. So there's about 75% of the price actions to cover everything that's included or been actioned already, and the rest has been notified that it's still coming.
Bob Fishman: Yeah. We really like the phased approach around pricing. It allows us to react to the changing circumstances. So I would say that's something different than what we've done in the past.
Joe Giordano: And is there something is there exposure we need to consider on stuff that's currently on hiatus, like some of the electronics that are on temporary exclusions from tariffs that may need to come in? And would that be already contemplated in the price increases you've announced?
John Stauch: You know, I think it's not meaningful. You know, I would tell you I had a worst-case scenario at one point, and it literally said worst-case scenario, and then this exceeds the worst-case scenario. So I won't say that this is the final final. I think we're gonna see lots of movements, and we're gonna have to capture by channel and by product line and by source. Those movements are and react accordingly. I do think if more tariffs come in, there's a likelihood that maybe some tariffs go away and have to look at what the net net of those impacts are.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Lee from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
Nick Cash: Hi, everyone. This is Nick Cash on for Brian Lee. Can you guys hear me?
Bob Fishman: Yep. Yes. Hi, Nick.
Nick Cash: Hey. Just wanted to circle back, you know, on one of the 80/20 questions earlier. I guess, you know, what impact is are you seeing, if any, on, you know, progress in relation to the tariffs and timing and not sure if we're thinking about this the right way, but if you're mitigating tariffs with price and one of the tactics is to move, you know, from, you know, quad four customers to quad three or push them out by raising prices, could this potentially accelerate 80/20 in that sense? Color would be helpful. Thank you.
John Stauch: Yeah. It does, and it will get captured. The volume. I don't think it's an intentional, you know, acceleration of letting our customers go. It's the natural reaction to we wanna take care of Quad One, which are our best customers and our best products. And that's where the majority of the, you know, 80s are, and that's our focus. So we wanna get that right. And we can't necessarily continue to make or produce or source a lot of the Quad four product because of the impact that tariffs have on it. So just discontinuing it, which is part of the volume drop, is one solution. Raising those prices and moving the customers around the quadrants is another solution, but feel really good about having the 80/20 toolkit at our disposal. And I'm really happy that it's part of the Pentair business system given what we're dealing with.
Nick Cash: Awesome. I appreciate that color. That is all for me. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Buscaglia from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead with your question.
Andrew Buscaglia: Hi. Good morning, guys.
Bob Fishman: Morning.
Andrew Buscaglia: So just based on holding guidance and some of your commentary, I would assume you probably have some negative full volume going forward or slightly negative. Are your pricing strong? So how do you think about, you know, being able to expand margins, especially relative to the comps you have in the back half of this year? Is that the goal here still?
Bob Fishman: Yeah. We still feel good about that, you know, approximately 100 basis point improvement in pools. Return on sales. Again, there's not just the volume, but in addition to that, a number of the transformation pillars that they've been working on as well. So, you know, to drive the ROS improvement, continuing to be very focused on, you know, costs and the mix of the business as well.
John Stauch: You know, I'd add to it that we, you know, we look at this as net of investment. And there's a fair amount of growth investment in the transformation number. And those growth investments are what we call sales plays, where we'll sample a particular sales play in a different region, and then we'll scale it and clearly water solutions, parts of flow and pool had the majority of that. If it's an environment where no matter what effort we're trying to put at it, we're not gonna see that incremental volume, then that's another lever we have at our disposal as the year unfolds.
Andrew Buscaglia: Okay. And then, you know, I was surprised to see, you know, the commentary around your distributors and raising prices. I would think you'd have some pushback. So I guess my question is do you
John Stauch: Nobody wants them, I'll be honest. Yeah. I think it's it's amount, you know. First of all, do we have to do them? And if you have to do them, you know, are they being fairly implemented? And is everybody still feeling like they're getting the best possible price for their relationship? And that's that's what I'm responding to, not that anybody welcomes them or wishes for them.
Andrew Buscaglia: Yeah. I guess that was I was wondering, like, the difference between the price increases and then, like, the actual price realization. It doesn't seem like there's a big delta there. Your the distributors are generally taking it in without a ton of pushback is what is what the takeaway is.
John Stauch: Yeah. Because everybody's doing it. And I think we're all in a situation where we're getting hit with, you know, these are stunning numbers. Right? And they come at you this quickly, I mean, there's only one way to respond. And then I think they'll be looking for longer-term solutions. And wanting to make sure that we're partnering to give the best possible value to their customer customers and their customers' customers, which is still an obligation we have. As we go forward into 2026 and 2027.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Graham from Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead with your question.
Scott Graham: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to understand something. You guys said that you were sort of gapping out pacing the pricing, but you also said 75% have been actioned, 25% notified. Can you explain what you mean by that?
John Stauch: Yeah. We went out with significant price increases in April across all the different businesses. And we have, as we mentioned, be stream between both mitigating things, having the inventory on hand and also the timing of the tariffs, notified that if things don't change, and the assumption here is they don't, then we would be back out with modest price increases in May. And then if things don't change again, we'd have more modest increases in June. So 75% actioned. And the other 25% still coming in May and June time frame.
Scott Graham: That's clear. That's much clearer. Thank you. Last time we talked about the pool markets components you're thinking on the market was low single digits for the three components. I'm assuming that, you know, with sales potentially having a little bit of destruction demand-wise, that do all three of them come down, or is it more focused on the remodeling side?
John Stauch: Don't know. I mean, right now, we're guessing at what that impact would be. So we very limited volume growth in this particular forecast. We're expecting that, you know, break and fix will still happen, and the new pool side is relatively flat. If we see softness, we, as I mentioned earlier, might be in the remodeling side or it might be in what I'd call a discretionary purchase. I think we'll have more clarity as the year unfolds, obviously. But right now, it's way too early in the season to tell.
Operator: And our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question.
Nigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning. Just a couple of quick ones for me. So just to double clarify on the pricing actions, John, that these are regular price actions, not surcharges. And just the question really is, you know, if there's a de-escalation in these China tariffs, that the prices would remain in effect.
John Stauch: That is correct.
Nigel Coe: Hello?
John Stauch: Oh, I'm here. I said that is correct.
Nigel Coe: Can you hear me?
John Stauch: Yes.
Nigel Coe: Okay. Did you get the question?
John Stauch: Yes. And I agreed with you. I said that is correct. Your assumption is correct.
Nigel Coe: Okay. Sorry. I you didn't come through. Okay. Great. And then just maybe again, I'm sorry if I missed this. Kind of how should we think about capital allocation in light of the balance sheet strength that you have, Karen, into the year? Especially with the pullback in stock price. Just wondering if, you know, obviously, I saw $50 million of surplus share purchase this quarter or last quarter. Any thoughts on that?
Bob Fishman: Yeah. In the previous question, we discussed the balanced capital allocation strategy. So, again, nice mix of debt pay down, share repurchase, we've increased the dividend. And then if the opportunity comes up for bolt-on M&A, maybe similar to what we did in Q4, all four of those make a lot of sense to us.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we've reached the end of the question and answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to John Stauch for any closing remarks.
John Stauch: Thank you for joining the call today. In closing, I want to reiterate some key themes on slide nineteen. Delivered our twelfth consecutive quarter of margin expansion and Pool Grids top line 7%. We maintained our sales and adjusted 2025 EPS outlook. We expect a long runway of productivity savings driven by transformation in 80/20. Our focused water strategy and strong execution continue to build a solid foundation to drive long-term growth, profitability, and shareholder value. And we believe we are well-positioned to effectively manage the challenges from the current volatility. Thank you, everyone. Have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference call and presentation. We do thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.

John Stauch: Thank you, Shelly, and good morning, everyone. It has been a crazy last 96 hours and we are excited to finally share our 2024 results and 2025 guidance with you. Our guidance, as shared today, includes the recently announced China tariffs and we believe we have captured the risk of the potential Canada and Mexico tariffs within our 2025 EPS guidance range. Bob will provide more detailed information within his remarks regarding this dynamic situation. 2024 is another transformative year for Pentair and we are very pleased with the strong performance of our balanced Water portfolio. We were excited to share our vision in March at our Investor Day and we exceeded our financial goals driven by Transformation and executing our strategy, as evidenced by record profitability and cash flow in 2024. We continue to demonstrate resilience across our Move, Improve and Enjoy Water segments as we diversified and mitigated risk amidst the dynamic macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. Within Flow, we continue to grow our commercial business and launched cutting-edge innovation with our Xcentric Impeller, while evolving our go-to-market strategy in industrial solutions to drive profitability. In Water Solutions, our commercial filtration business posted strong sales and we launched our first commercial PFAS-certified filtration product, which continued to gain momentum. And in Pool, the aftermarket drove strong sales growth despite weakness in new and remodeled pools, which were impacted by higher interest rates. We also focused on new product development, with new launches planned for 2025. Overall, we finished 2024 in a stronger financial and operational position than we started the year. I'm very proud of our entire team at Pentair, who continue to deliver for our customers while creating value for our shareholders. Let's turn to the Q4 executive summary on Slide 4. We posted record Q4 adjusted operating income and ROS, marking the 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year ROS expansion. We also delivered triple-digit margin expansion across our Flow, Water Solutions and Pool segments, which led to record ROS for all three segments, driven by our Transformation initiatives. In the fourth quarter, sales were down 1%, but better than expected from the beginning of the quarter even with FX headwinds. Adjusted operating income increased 17% to a Q4 record of $231 million. ROS expanded by 370 basis points to a fourth quarter record of 23.8%. And adjusted EPS was $1.08, up 24%, another Q4 adjusted EPS record. Let's move to the full year executive summary on Slide 5. 2024 was another record year for adjusted operating income, ROS and adjusted EPS despite sales ending down 1%. Our team was very successful at mitigating top line risk amidst macroeconomic weakness globally. In full year '24, we delivered sales of $4.1 billion, record adjusted operating income of $959 million, up 12%, record ROS at 23.5%, expanding 270 basis points, and record adjusted EPS of $4.33, up 15%. At our 2024 Investor Day, we disclosed our thee-year targets with a goal of 24% ROS by 2026 year-end. From solid execution across our Flow, Water Solutions and Pool segments which drove triple-digit margin expansion through Transformation and early 80/20 progress, we continue to drive operational efficiencies that exceeded our goals in 2024 especially record ROS of 23.5% which nearly hit our target two years early. We are now increasing our 2026 ROS target to 26%. Bob will provide more details in a moment on why we have increased our confidence in achieving a higher ROS target by 2026. In 2024, we generated record free cash flow of $693 million and increased our dividend by approximately 9%, with 2025 marking the 49th consecutive year of dividend increases, further solidifying our status as a dividend aristocrat. Lastly, we are introducing 2025 adjusted EPS guidance of $4.65 to $4.80 up 9% at the midpoint. We expect that Transformation and 80/20 can deliver our targeted margin expansion in 2025 and beyond. Let's turn to Slide 6. Over the last five years, we have increased sales by over 6.5% compounded annually while expanding margins 600 basis points. Nearly 500 of the 600 basis points were delivered in the last two years. All three of our segments have produced strong sales growth and significant margin expansion since 2019. We continue to expect great opportunity ahead to drive long-term sales growth across Flow, Water Solutions and Pool through organic growth and potential tuck-in or bolt-on acquisitions. Let's turn to Slide 7. We are helping the world sustainably Move, Improve and Enjoy Water, life's most essential resource, through our three segments, each with over $1 billion in sales in 2024 and together creating a balanced and resilient Water portfolio. We are pleased with the ROS achievements of each segment. We believe Transformation and 80/20 will continue to drive higher profitability going forward. Let's turn to Slide 8. In 2024, our Transformation program continued its momentum, delivering over $100 million in productivity savings, net of investments. All four of our Transformation pillars, which include pricing excellence, sourcing excellence, operational excellence and organizational effectiveness contributed to these productivity savings. As we continue to focus on reducing complexity, streamlining our operations and optimizing our organization for future growth, we expect to deliver $80 million net of investments and productivity savings in 2025, driven by Transformation and accelerated through 80/20. In early 2024, we began to implement 80/20 across our three segments with staggered implementation plans. I'm happy to share that our segments have moved beyond the stage of analysis, assessment and are all developing action plans to implement these efforts into our operations. By year-end, all segments have begun their Quad 4 exits, while simultaneously improving our service and operations to better serve our Quad 1 customers. We expect these actions to drive core growth and profitability in 2025 and beyond while simplifying our business and operations. Let's turn to Slide 9. Before I hand the call over to Bob, I wanted to reiterate some key takeaways. 2024 demonstrated another year of record adjusting operating income, ROS and adjusted EPS, driven by Transformation and continued execution across all segments. We drove record free cash flow and we took a balanced approach to capital deployment through organic growth investments, dividends, share repurchases and a small tuck-in acquisition in Pool. We expect 80/20 to accelerate our Transformation initiatives to drive focused profitable growth in '25 and we are introducing full year 2025 guidance reflecting growth in adjusted EPS of approximately 9% at the midpoint. Lastly, we continue to believe that we are well positioned to address opportunities from favorable secular trends, which include concerns about access to clean and reliable water, increased awareness of human-made contaminants impacting water quality, aging commercial public and municipal infrastructure, interest in outdoor healthy living with people gathering at pools for exercise and fun, and favorable housing migration to the Sun Belt states, which represents a large mix of our Pool sales. I will now pass the call over to Bob, who will discuss our performance and financial results in more detail. Bob?
Bob Fishman: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 10, titled Q4 2024 Pentair Performance. I will also be discussing our full year performance on Slide 11. We delivered another strong quarter of margin expansion and adjusted EPS growth despite sales being down slightly. These results were driven by Pool sales growth and triple-digit margin expansion across each of our Flow, Water Solutions and Pool segments. Sales for Q4 were down 1%, which was slightly better than we guided, driven by higher than expected Pool sales, which nearly offset an expected decline in Flow and Water Solutions sales. Fourth quarter adjusted operating income increased 17% to $231 million and return on sales expanded 370 basis points year-over-year to 23.8%. This improvement was driven primarily by our Transformation initiatives. Adjusted EPS of $1.08 was up 24% versus the prior year. For the full year, sales were down 1% at $4.1 billion, with core sales flat, driven by growth in Pool, which offset lower Flow and Water Solutions sales. Our residential businesses continue to be impacted by higher interest rates. Adjusted operating income grew 12% and return on sales expanded 270 basis points to a record 23.5%. All three segments significantly expanded margins and set new annual ROS records. Adjusted EPS increased to a record $4.33 up 15% versus the prior year. Please turn to Slide 12, labeled Q4 2024 Flow Performance. In addition to the fourth quarter performance for Flow, I will also be referencing the full year performance on Slide 13. In Q4, Flow sales were down 5% to $361 million. Commercial sales were up 7%, reaching a new annual sales record. Residential sales were down due to higher interest rates and industrial solutions sales were impacted by delayed CapEx spend. At this time, we do expect certain delayed industrial projects to begin in 2025. Reportable segment income was up 13% and return on sales increased 320 basis points to 20.4% driven by Transformation. For the year, Flow sales decreased 4% to $1.5 billion as a decline in residential and industrial solutions sales more than offset an increase of 5% in commercial. Residential sales decline in Flow remained consistent each quarter in 2024, which we believe suggests stabilization within end markets impacted by higher interest rates. Full year reportable segment income grew 13% and return on sales increased 320 basis points to 21%, a record margin for Flow driven by Transformation. Please turn to Slide 14, labeled Q4 2024 Water Solutions Performance. In addition to the fourth quarter performance for Water Solutions, I will also be referencing the full year performance on Slide 15. In Q4, Water Solutions sales decreased 4% to $258 million. Commercial sales were down 5% reflecting a decline in commercial ice, which more than offset sales growth in commercial filtration. Manitowoc Ice performed as expected, with sales down mid-single-digits in 2024, following two consecutive years of 20% growth each. Reportable segment income grew 21% to $62 million and return on sales expanded 500 basis points to 24.1%, a new quarterly record, driven primarily by productivity from our Transformation initiatives. For the year, Water Solutions sales decreased 4%, reportable segment income grew 3% and return on sales increased 160 basis points to 22.6% a new full year record. Please turn to Slide 16, labeled Q4 2024 Pool Performance. In addition to the fourth quarter performance for Pool, I'll also be referencing the full year performance on Slide 17. In Q4, Pool sales grew 5% to $354 million, driven by both price and volume. Reportable segment income increased 14% and return on sales increased 250 basis points to 33.8%. Demand increased more than expected, partially driven by the impact on the Florida hurricanes in late September and early October. For the year, Pool sales grew 7%, driven by price and volume. Reportable segment income increased 14% and return on sales increased 220 basis points to 33.2%, a new annual record, driven by growth and Transformation. Please turn to Slide 18, labeled Transformation Initiatives and 80/20. At our 2024 Investor Day, we provided a ROS target of 24% by full year 2026, while providing a path to 26%. I'm excited to say that we are now increasing our target to 26% by full year '26 year-end, even though we do expect slightly lower sales by 2026 and we outlined at Investor Day due to continued higher interest rates and a deferred residential recovery. We are pleased that we expect to be able to protect our profitability as was outlined at our 2024 Investor Day, even with macroeconomic uncertainty. If interest rates in residential markets improve, we expect to further benefit from our Transformation initiatives at these higher productivity levels across all three segments. Over the last two years, we have driven nearly $175 million in productivity savings, which has led to our confidence in our 26% ROS target by 2026. We expect full year '25 ROS to be approximately 24.5% to 25%. I'll provide more detail on our full year '25 guidance in a moment. Please turn to Slide 19, labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. We closed 2024 in a very strong financial position, with strong free cash flow and cash flow margin, a low leverage ratio and a higher return on invested capital. In 2024, our free cash flow was $693 million, up nearly 26% year-over-year. Our cash flow margin was 17%, which reflects a capital light model. Our net debt leverage ratio was 1.5 times, down from two times at 2023 year-end. Our ROIC was 15.5%, up from 14.3% in 2023. With a focus on being good stewards of capital, we continue to target high-teens ROIC longer term. In 2024, we repurchased 1.6 million shares for a total of $150 million. We have $450 million available under the current authorization. We also increased our dividend approximately 9% for 2025. This marks the 49th consecutive year of a dividend increase and reaffirms our dividend aristocrat status. As we begin 2025, we are committed to maintaining our disciplined capital allocation strategy. We believe our strong free cash flow allows us ample opportunity and flexibility to invest in organic growth, make tuck-in or bolt-on acquisitions, repurchase shares, and pay a dividend. We plan for these actions to be guided by our high-teens ROIC target. Moving to Slide 20, titled Q1 and Full Year 2025 Pentair Outlook and Expectations. We also provide more detailed guidance on Slide 21. For the full year, we are introducing our adjusted EPS guidance range of approximately $4.65 to $4.80, which represents a year-over-year increase of 7% to 11%. We expect total Pentair sales in fiscal 2025 to be approximately flat to up 2% including FX headwinds. We expect Flow sales to be up slightly. Water Solutions sales are expected to be down approximately low-single-digits to flat and Pool sales are expected to increase approximately 4% to 5% in full year '25. We expect total Pentair adjusted operating income to increase approximately 6% to 9% with ROS expansion of roughly 125 basis points at the midpoint to approximately 24.5% to 25%. Also for the full year, we expect corporate expense of approximately $85 million, net interest expense of roughly $80 million, with a weighted average interest rate of slightly over 5%, and adjusted tax rate of approximately 17%, up slightly from 16.5% in 2024, and a share count of approximately 166.5 million. For the first quarter, we expect sales to be down approximately 3% to 4% to between $975 million to $985 million. We expect Pool sales to grow approximately 3% to 4%. Water Solutions sales to be down approximately high-single-digits and Flow sales to be down approximately mid-single-digits. As a reminder, in Q1 2024, Water Solutions was shipping ice backlog and current orders. By Q2 2024 Water Solutions had entered a more normalized operating environment. In Flow, higher interest rates, FX and delayed CapEx are expected to impact sales in Q1 2025 for residential and industrial solutions. 80/20 actions are expected to impact both Water Solutions and Flow in Q1. These 80/20 actions are expected to improve profitability as the year progresses. We expect quarterly sales to increase year-over-year, beginning in Q2, with the growth rate improving in Q3 and Q4. We also expect normal seasonality in sales in 2025 whereby Q2 is typically our highest sales quarter, followed by Q3 and then Q4. We expect first quarter adjusted operating income to be up 3% to 5% due to lower sales and higher ROS. We expect strong ROS expansion in Q1 for total Pentair, including ROS expansion in each of our three segments. Similar to sales, we expect ROS to follow a normal seasonality pattern, with the highest rate in Q2, followed by Q3, then Q4. We're also introducing adjusted EPS guidance for the first quarter of approximately $1 to $1.02 an increase of approximately 6% to 9%. In the first half of 2025, we expect adjusted EPS to be slightly less than 50% of our full year adjusted EPS guide, roughly in line with our historical norm. Q1 is expected to be the lowest quarter for sales, adjusted operating income, ROS, and adjusted EPS, as compared to the remaining three quarters and full year '25. We are targeting strong free cash flow in 2025 of 100% of net income. As a reminder, Q1 is a cash use quarter in any given year, while Q2 is typically our highest cash generation quarter. At this time, our 2025 adjusted EPS guidance range for the full year includes what we know today concerning tariffs, including a 10% tariff on roughly $200 million of products sourced from China. We have approximately $300 million of product manufactured and purchased from Mexico. We believe we have captured the impact of a 25% tariff in Mexico within our adjusted EPS guidance range for 2025. We have no significant spend in Canada. We have been effective in the past with the use of pricing to offset higher cost, since approximately 75% of our revenue goes through two-step distribution. We have continued to accelerate Transformation funnels, implement 80/20, and remain focused on investing in the long-term growth of our company. Moving to Slide 21. We have provided additional detail for our guidance. On the left hand side of the chart, you can see the sales walk. We expect total Pentair sales in fiscal 2025 to be up approximately 1% at the midpoint. We expect volume to be up slightly, price to read out between 1.5% and 2% and FX to be a one point headwind. We expect Flow sales to be up slightly, reflecting approximately low-single-digit growth in commercial, down low-single-digits in industrial solutions and approximately flat in residential. Water Solutions sales are expected to be essentially flat. Commercial sales in full year '25 are expected to be up low-single-digits and residential to be down low to mid-single-digits. Pool sales are expected to increase approximately 4% to 5% in full year '25. We expect new and remodeled pools and the aftermarket to each be up low-single-digits and we expect our recently completed December acquisition to contribute approximately 2% sales growth. As a reminder, new and remodeled pools represent about 40% of sales and aftermarket is about 60%. Our sales guidance reflects continued macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty and cautious optimism of residential end market recovery in the second half of 2025. On the right hand side of the chart, you can see the walk on adjusted operating income. We expect adjusted operating income to increase approximately 8% at the midpoint and ROS to be approximately 24.5% to 25%, up 125 basis points year-over-year at the midpoint. The volume price acquisitions column is primarily price, which is expected to offset inflation. We expect Transformation and 80/20 to drive approximately $80 million of productivity savings, which is the main ROS expansion driver. We are very pleased with our strong performance and finish in 2024. Our Transformation program exceeded our expectations and is expected to continue to drive momentum into 2025. We have built a strong foundation and believe we can continue to drive long-term growth, profitability and shareholder value. I'd now like to turn the call over to the operator for Q&A, after which John will have a few closing remarks. Jamie, please open the line for questions. Thank you.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Brett Linzey from Mizuho. Please go ahead with your question.
Brett Linzey: Hey, good morning, and congrats on a great quarter.
John Stauch: Good morning. Thank you.
Brett Linzey: Wanted to square some of the moving pieces on the legacy Transformation program versus the new 80/20. I guess of the incremental $80 million, how is that split between the two savings buckets? And then if you could just help frame the cumulative value savings you think for the 80/20 program over a multiyear period?
John Stauch: Yes. So first of all, 80/20, we're excited to have it. Launched in all of our businesses and we've gone through the analysis. And as you know, it puts your revenue in quadrants and you do that both by part and by customers. So we're just going to keep the benefits of Transformation and the productivity column, regardless if it's 80/20 or Transformation. What 80/20 does do, though, Brett, is it helps us focus the business. And so identifies what we really want to grow and where we don't want to spend our time growing, which has benefits to all four of the pillars under Transformation. So we would expect over time that this is another additive to our Transformation expectations, but it's going to be captured in that productivity column as we go forward.
Brett Linzey: Okay. Got it. And then I guess just shifting over to price, obviously, a lot of moving pieces with tariffs. I appreciate the bottoms up view for the segments, I guess, how are you thinking about price as a contributor in those segments? And then maybe if you could parse out what's normal course of business price versus tariff related pricing to offset the stated tariffs that you're embedding in the guidance?
Bob Fishman: Yes. Thank you for the question. So we've guided to 1.5% to 2% price. Think about that as being pretty consistent across the segments. We did mention that tariffs are included in our adjusted EPS guidance. Think about the fact that we can use price to offset any additional tariff costs. So price for us would be additive to that 1.5% to 2% guidance. And you would expect revenue to float higher if tariffs do happen.
John Stauch: We do have $20 million of price captured in the 1.5% to 2%, which is the 10% on the China tariffs, but we don't have anything related to Mexico and Canada yet in the price line.
Brett Linzey: All right. Got it. Thanks. Best of luck.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.
Julian Mitchell: Hi. Good morning. Maybe just, first off, I wanted to try and understand the seasonality a little bit and what's being assumed there. So I think the Q1 is a little bit lighter share of the year than normal because of currency and perhaps a tough start in commercial in Water. Maybe help us kind of understand how you're thinking about the first half as a share of the year in terms of earnings? And when we're thinking about the phasing of the tariff headwinds, when are you assuming that comes into the company and starts affecting sales and earnings?
John Stauch: Yes. So I mean, as you remember last year, we had anticipated that we would see and the industry anticipated that they would see some type of recovery in residential channels. So what happened was we saw a little bit of loading in the distribution channels in anticipation of the residential recovery, which did not materialize. So we have our last quarter of headwinds in Q1, which is why you see that as a little bit more challenged. In addition, we had one program in Ice China that rolled off, and that was just last quarter contribution. Outside of that, sequentially moving to Q4 to Q1, we're generally seeing things the same. So we see Q2 as the recovery back to easier comparisons as we move through the year. And as far as your questions on tariffs, we'll see some minimal impact in Q1, but the majority of it will roll out pretty consistently between Q2, Q3 and Q4.
Julian Mitchell: That's helpful. Thank you. And then just maybe following up on the Pool market outlook. Maybe help us understand kind of where inventories as you see it among your distributors right now? How much kind of early buy occurred in Q4 versus normal? And what's the assessment on sort of new build market health this year?
Bob Fishman: Yes. I would say that we're staying cautious even though you've got new pool builds in 2024 really at historical lows, we're trying not to get ahead of ourselves. So our view is for new pools and remodels, up low-single-digits, aftermarket up low-single-digits, and then we have the benefit of the December acquisition. Our view is that early buy was at historical levels as well as the inventory that sits within the distributors and dealers also at historical levels.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.
Stephen Tusa: Hey, good morning.
John Stauch: Hey, Steve.
Bob Fishman: Hi, Steve.
Stephen Tusa: Interesting 96 hours. It's been an interesting four to five years I think. Don't you agree with that?
John Stauch: Every year, there's something, right, Steve?
Stephen Tusa: Every day, there's something. Yes. So just trying to like really squint at the bridge on 21, Slide 21. Where are the tariffs embedded there? I guess it's like $95 million. Is that kind of the simple math on the tariffs? That's kind of the dumb math I guess. But is that embedded in inflation?
John Stauch: No. So right now, we would have roughly, as Bob said, we have roughly $200 million of China that would have $20 million more of inflation in it. And then you would expect that $20 million to be in price as a general view. If we were to see the Mexico and Canada, it's primarily all Mexico for us. You would see additive price and you'd see added inflation, Steve.
Stephen Tusa: Okay. So you're not. I got you.
John Stauch: Source and purchase products and depending on where that lands you can do the math and that's how we're thinking about it.
Stephen Tusa: I got it. So you're not embedding the Mexico yet. You're embedding the China, that's an inflation and then you're offsetting that with price and that would be your lever if Mexico comes around?
John Stauch: Exactly.
Bob Fishman: That's right. But our view is we've got the EPS protected because, again, we would offset the tariff costs with the price.
Stephen Tusa: With the price, right? And I guess just backing up to the bridges here and the rate of inflation that you're seeing, how do you tease out that like rate of inflation versus what you're getting into the numbers from sourcing? It just seems like the inflation, where are you seeing the most inflation? It just seems a bit high relative to our expectations at least. And how are you kind of like teasing that out?
John Stauch: Yes. So we were seeing moderating inflation clearly. I think what we're anticipating is that we're going to get that little bit of China tariff. But as you know, Steve, most people reflect and raise their commodity prices equal to what happened from those sourced products. So you're going to see a little bit of an uptick in inflation across the board as people try to take advantage of getting a little bit more price. So freight was the other area that we were seeing a little bit of uptick in. Outside of that, we were seeing moderating to slightly declining inflation as we're moving through the business model in Q4.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bryan Blair from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question.
Bryan Blair: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
John Stauch: Hey, how are you?
Bryan Blair: Doing well. Thanks. Just want to follow-up on Transformation for a bit. If we look at the segment income and ROS walk you provided at Investor Day, is there any meaningful shift in segment contribution through 2026 now that you officially revised the medium-term ROS targets to the 26% level?
Bob Fishman: We continue to believe that each of the segments will participate within the ROS expansion story. If you think about, we laid out a path to the 26% by 2026 at Analyst Day. And we just delivered $107 million, we're guiding to $80 million. So that puts us at, call it, $187 million, $190 million. So again to get to that $260 million take another $70 million of Transformation. Obviously, we'll build funnels that are higher than that. That will help us mitigate any risk that we might have or provide upside, but we are on a very good path to continue a sustainable journey on Transformation.
John Stauch: And I would add that part of the confidence is the introduction of 80/20 allows us to focus and identify and see more opportunities. But also just as a reminder, we're doing this without the benefit of growth. And Transformation will show up as a form of scale across our existing factories and overhead costs when we do get that contribution for revenue. And we believe it's out there. We just don't know when it's going to come and we need some help on interest rates and some efforts in the residential housing side. So that's our encouragement. And I think as we continue to move along, we feel good that the programs that we've introduced have created structural changes and we believe we're going to benefit from those when the growth comes forward.
Bryan Blair: I certainly see it in the numbers. And maybe offer some color on G&F? I know this was a smaller deal, but speak to the assets, strategic fit, how it enhances your Pool offering? And then how we should think about growth rates, ROS contribution, any accretion? Thank you.
John Stauch: Yes, we're really excited. It's an example of taking a look across a product line and understanding where you might have opportunities. And while we're really strong in heater positions in most of the markets, in Florida and in some of the south, heat pumps, which are more electric based, are the preferred option. And it wasn't the strength in our product line. And so we had the opportunity to add and solidify some really important positions in Florida, and that's what Gulfstream represents. And it's an example of a really nice tuck-in acquisition that really fits nicely with our strategy, business model and financial expectations.
Bob Fishman: Yes. Just roughly from a numbers perspective. We closed that acquisition at the beginning of December. We expect in 2025, roughly $35 million would come from that acquisition of top line revenue with about $5 million included in 2024 in that one month of December. So we're expecting a net benefit of the $30 million and that's the two points of growth that Pool would see. It's roughly a 30% ROS business. And we bought it at about 10 times EBITDA. So a really nice bolt-on acquisition for us expanding again our portfolio within the heater area.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your question.
Jeffrey Hammond: Hey, good morning, guys.
John Stauch: Good morning, Jeff.
Jeffrey Hammond: Just on margin expansion. I think you're calling for 125 basis points all-in. Any kind of way to think about how the segments play out either order of magnitude or are they all kind of equal contributors?
John Stauch: Yes. I think equal. I think Pool has done a really nice job driving value and we're continuing to invest in growth in Pool both trying to drive automation and new products. So think about Pool being closer to 100 basis points and the other two being equal in their contribution roughly to the difference, Jeff.
Jeffrey Hammond: Okay. Great. And then Water Solutions, I just want to unpack what you're seeing in resi because we've seen kind of two down years, you're expecting another down year? Is it just rates or is there something else going on there? And then just on the commercial side, it seems like you're through, after 1Q, you'll be through the backlog drawdown in ice. But just what are you seeing in that commercial foodservice space from a fundamental standpoint?
John Stauch: Yes. I'll answer the residential one first. I mean, as you can imagine, our favorite types of residential housing for residential filtration and even Flow our rural homes that have a well and most all wells have water softening and then filtration. When you get into the urban environment, water is generally acceptable to the people who drink it, and therefore, you don't see the same level of filtration penetration. So the interest rates have really hurt that urban sprawl and the farther out builds and that's where I think the residential business has been hit harder. The second element is a lot of water softeners are financed. And the consumer financing challenges have led to lower demand in that particular space. What we've been also doing is spending 80/20 to think through the product portfolio and be very thoughtful about where we want to play long-term. And so you're seeing some top line headwind in lieu of getting more margin expansion so we can operationalize our footprint a little bit better, Jeff. As far as the commercial, North American ice performed just slightly down for the year last year. Most of the year-over-year challenges in the commercial was related to, as I mentioned, China. And that was a large local coffee rollout that happened in 2023. That was pretty lumpy to the year-over-year effect of how we compared against that in 2024. But when you take a look at the North American ice market, it actually outperformed our expectations last year and we just had that headwind related to China.
Jeffrey Hammond: Do you see more of that continuing?
John Stauch: We have one more quarter of challenged year-over-year, which is Q1, which is the last quarter for that. And then we'd expect to get to more of that mid-single-digits normal growth rate that ice has generally benefited from.
Operator: Your next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question.
Nigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Nigel Coe: So another tough question. So I mean, this is a nerdy question, but do you price it through a regular price increase and therefore you have to give customers the customary notice or would it be a surcharge, which might be more immediate? So just wondering on that. And then thinking about the exposure across the three businesses, I think we would all have seen that the Pool business has more Mexico and China exposure. Just maybe just any color there would be helpful.
John Stauch: Yes. So first of all, we have, in normal conditions, 30 to 60 day notice periods across most of our dealer/distributor relationships. Obviously, when these types of events happen, we skew them more closer to the 30 day window for most of our largest customers. So that gives you a level. Usually, we have enough inventory in hand to mitigate any timing impact there. As far as exposure, I mean, interestingly, our Water Solutions business would be the most exposed to Mexico given the fact that most of all the residential products are made in Mexico and then we have our North American ice manufacturing in Mexico. And so those would be the -- so they will have a little bit more effort to recover the tariffs. And we feel like the other two businesses don't have that same level of exposure.
Nigel Coe: Okay. That's great. And then just my follow-on is the $80 million of initiatives, the benefit in 2025. Are there any, just to be clear, are there any investments against that $80 million or is that a clean number that flows through to the bottom line?
John Stauch: Yes. Thanks for asking. That's the net impact. So that will have both positive benefits from Transformation, net of any strategic growth investments. And, yes, we are making strategic growth investments, primarily in Water Solutions and in Pool. And so you can think about Transformation being a little bit higher and then being offset by incremental investments to longer-term growth programs.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nathan Jones from Stifel. Please go ahead with your question.
Adam Farley: Good morning. This is Adam Farley on for Nathan. I wanted to follow-up on 80/20. Which of the segments are seeing the most near-term revenue headwinds from Quad 4 actions? And then also have Quad 1 actually identified any areas that can potentially benefit from additional growth investments?
John Stauch: Yes. So 80/20 in itself is not a growth limiter. Quite frankly, there isn't, in the base program itself, there's not really a view that you lose revenue. That being said, our various acquisitions over time create more of a portfolio opportunity. So Water Solutions is seeing some exits of revenue that will help drive margin performance and lead to better productivity paths by exiting out to Quad 4. Everybody else is a combination of moving Quad 4s to Quad 3s, which are changing the way that you transact with customers. And all of the businesses have seen early signs of customers in Quad 1 that like what we're doing and feel like there's opportunities to partner more effective with us.
Adam Farley: All right. Thank you for taking my question.
John Stauch: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning everyone.
John Stauch: Good morning, Deane.
Deane Dray: Hey, I just want to circle back on Pool and the growth rates assumed and I recall it was not too long ago right after COVID, where there was this worry that there'll never be another pool built because everyone that could build, possibly build one had done it. But now we're look to be at a more normalized level. So what's on low-single-digits for new and remodeled and aftermarket. Is that -- are we at sort of a normalized rate given demographics and regional? Is it -- does it reflect interest rate pressures or labor shortages and the contractors especially on the new build? Just kind of are we at a normalized level here or are there still some headwinds?
John Stauch: Deane, this is John. I want to jump in here. I feel strongly, we're not. I mean if you go back to 2019, which we always point to is what we would say is a more normal year for both North American housing starts and pool starts, when you look at 2019, both of those views to 2025, we're down 24% in housing starts and 23% down in new pool builds. It's not surprising because pool builds generally are a percentage of new housing starts, given that most homes built in the South have pools attached to them. So we have a long way to go to get back to normal. What we see in 2025, though, is flattish overall new pool builds, slightly higher new remodels and the ongoing benefit of aftermarket, which just feels good for a change, given what we've struggled with in '24 and '23.
Deane Dray: That's really helpful. And the second question, I'm not sure how much you can comment on this, but there's been press reports of a very large asset that's being shopped that does food and beverage, water treatments. And just kind of high level thoughts? Is this an opportunity for you? Might there be a competitive impact if this business actually gets acquired by what would be a more natural owner versus where it is presently? So just how do you think this all plays out.
John Stauch: Yes. Not aware of that at all, Deane. But I mean we continue to be focused on taking our businesses, especially the ones that we love that are focused on our Move, Improve and Enjoy. And we're in the bolt-on mode. And so not aware of any assets, so no comment on that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.
Andrew Kaplowitz: Hey, good morning everyone.
John Stauch: Hi, Andy.
Andrew Kaplowitz: Maybe just a little bit more on Flow. When you're assuming CapEx delays might begin to subside there within the industrial businesses? And we know you've been continuing to streamline your overall Flow business. So what is the ongoing impact of that in 2025?
John Stauch: First of all, Andy, thank you for that. It's a small part of our business, roughly $200 and some million that's really related to food and beverage and industrial. So they tend to be a little bit more projects related to expansion of beer. And obviously then we sell beer membrane filtration. And then ultimately, a lot of our CO2 and gas management aspects. So it's a smaller piece of our portfolio, but we are happening to see delays in those projects, and we're not counting on those delays to recover here in the near-term. Really related to financing and the overall expansion of their business models globally.
Andrew Kaplowitz: And then, John, to the point of new pool sort of standing at these very low levels, you've guided to break and fix and remodeling up low-single-digits for '25. Are you seeing or when should we see like sort of pent-up demand as everybody is just sitting there, could we see a little bit of improvement? Because there just hasn't been a lot of new pool activity in break and fix and remodeling. How are you thinking about that? And then have you seen any impact from hurricanes or maybe any thought process around potentially replacing the wildfire areas in California on the Pool side?
John Stauch: Yes. So real quick. We think we're in at least the second half before we see meaningful recovery in the residential side. I think as rates start to come down or equity markets stabilize, which are the two funding sources for our general pool owners, we believe stabilization leads to decisions, which lead to them moving forward with projects. And so I think we remain optimistic that aftermarket remodels will continue as people take advantage of their lower mortgages in their existing home base in the short run. And then hopefully, we'll see the builds as we go forward. As far as hurricanes, yes, we did benefit in Q4, slightly from the hurricanes, obviously, tragic events that we don't root for. And we imagine that most of the housing rebuilds in California will also once again have pools as they remodel. Obviously, horrific situation. So our hearts go out to those people. But either of those events will have some longer term penetration aspect to them.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Krill from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.
Andrew Krill: Hi, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Let me go back to the, I guess, updated 2026 margin targets. Just like can you flush out like what sales growth are you assuming for 2026 in order to hit this new 26% margin? And is there any new contingency in there similar to what you provided at the Investor Day? Thanks.
Bob Fishman: Yes. Again, just as a reminder, at Investor Day, we talked about mid-single-digit growth. We just guided 2025 to flat to up 2%. So we've assumed something similar at this point for 2026 to achieve the profitability targets that we need. Again, hopefully, we'll be surprised on the upside. The deferred residential recovery comes back, Pool starts to grow it. More historical rates, but continuing to drive that transformation program to deliver the bottom line.
Andrew Krill: Okay. So it's fair to assume that if we go back to your mid-single-digit growth target, there's a little bit of upside to that 26%?
John Stauch: I don't, I mean, right now, we're updating that we feel good about the 26% ROS. I think embedded in those numbers, as Bob and I said in Investment Day, was growing about $100 million of EBITDA per year through 2026. So you could calculate how you get back to what the revenue number is and that's really a reflection of the fact that we didn't get the mid-single-digit growth recovery earlier in this three-year window that we had hoped for. So we're not raising our overall expectations. We're saying there's a different path to achieve it.
Andrew Krill: Understood. And then real quickly, just on 80/20, is it fair? I don't think it was commented on explicitly, but is it about a two-point headwind in the sales bridge you're assuming or about half of the Quad 4 sales? Thank you.
John Stauch: No, that's for, maybe a business. But overall we would expect to see no more than roughly one point of headwind from Quad 4 exits from an overall Pentair perspective. And those are embedded in our volume assumptions and our current guide.
Operator: And our next question comes from Joe Giordano from TD Cowen. Please go ahead with your question.
Vince Valentini: Hi. Good morning. This is Vince on for Joe. I wanted to start with this. Should we be expecting some significant debt paydown during this year? And does the guide assume any debt reduction?
Bob Fishman: We will continue to drive the leverage ratio down as a combination of just having more EBITDA and slight debt paydown. So again, when we look at our capital allocation strategy, it's increasing the dividend to the 9% that we talked about, it's share repurchases to offset dilution. It's some debt paid down and bolt-on acquisitions. So really balanced capital allocation strategy.
Vince Valentini: Got it. Thank you for that. And you mentioned the residential end market improvement in the second half is included in the guide. Could you help frame how we view Q2 in terms of the bridge? Do you see Q2 improving a little bit, but most of the improvement in the second half, or no improvement until the second half in the residential model?
John Stauch: We see really, really modest improvements as we move to the second half. We're not anticipating a significant amount of rate reductions, which is what we really would like to see to get the jump start going. So what we have is a lot easier comparisons year-over-year and a lot more valuable contribution to the revenue streams.
Vince Valentini: That was helpful.
Operator: Our next question comes from Saree Boroditsky from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.
Saree Boroditsky: Thanks for fitting me in. So just building on 80/20, you talked about focusing on profitable growth. Can you talk about how you're driving growth in those top clients and products? What are some of the investments required? And how are you incentivizing teams to adhere to the strategy?
John Stauch: Yes. I'll do it as quickly as possible. I mean it's really about identifying what it was that people really saw in your strength as a company, and they started buying core products, for core and marks from you. And then over time, you added a bunch of complexity and in alternatives. So it's really getting back to your strengths. And then working and partnering with, as you said, incentivizing the dealer, incentivizing the distributor and making sure you're incentivizing your salespeople to push through your top products to your top customers.
Saree Boroditsky: And then quickly back on the tariffs. You talked about potential pricing actions, but just wanted to see how you're thinking about sourcing given some of the work you've done on that previously? And maybe any changes on how you're thinking about producing water treatment products in Mexico? Thank you.
John Stauch: Yes, I would say that structurally, we thought we had a really good situation. We've worked under the agreement that was put in place and this was a really good alternative to service North America, both from a standpoint of not just access to products, but also access to labor. Because we're pretty tight in some of the manufacturing and labor markets that we participate in. So right now I think we would react accordingly with dealing with what we need to do in the short run and then look longer term strategically what the best alternatives would be.
Operator: And our next question comes from Brian Lee from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
Brian Lee: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just two quick ones. I might have missed it, but on the Pool view for 2025, fair to assume sort of a normalized two to three points of price and the rest is volume?
Bob Fishman: Yes. For Pool, it's more like consistent with the overall company, 1.5 to 2 points of price is what's expected.
Brian Lee: Okay. Fair enough. And then I know a lot of focus around the tariffs and sourcing and cost risk. There is a larger fairly large European player that you compete with. I'm not sure if as all the dust settles on the tariff situation, if the EU were to get involved or get caught up in this. Does that become a potential market share tailwind for you guys, depending on kind of how all the balls fall in place here sort of what products were could you maybe stand to benefit? Just trying to understand the competitive dynamic if certain regions like Mexico and Canada maybe don't end up seeing tariffs in other regions like the EU and China, do you see tariffs? Just trying to wonder about some of the permutations that might actually be to your advantage potentially.
John Stauch: Yes. It's hard to speculate. I would say that we're looking at those and strategizing. I think the bigger challenge is when we have these types of actions, you can get disrupted in supply chains and give temporary advantage or disadvantage to different regions. But we're a large global player as well. And we have a large global manufacturing footprint and global capabilities. And so when we have more certainty of what's going to happen and will react accordingly.
John Stauch: Okay. Thank you for joining the call today. In closing, I want to reiterate some key themes on Slide 22. We delivered record earnings as a result of solid execution and transformation. We drove significant margin expansion across our balanced Water portfolio despite continued macroeconomic headwinds. We ensured performance accountability across the organization. We ended the year with an even stronger balance sheet and record free cash flow and we maintained a disciplined capital allocation strategy with a focus on driving higher return on invested capital. And finally we believe our focused growth strategy and solid execution are building a solid foundation for long-term growth, profitability and shareholder value. Thank you, everyone. Have a great day.

John Stauch: Thank you, Shelly, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with the executive summary on Slide 4. We are very pleased with the strong performance of our balanced water portfolio, the success of our transformation initiatives and solid execution in a dynamic global macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. Our resilient strategy across our move, improve and enjoy Water segment was evident in our ability to diversify and mitigate risk as we drive long-term shareholder value. For example, in the third quarter, we delivered double-digit adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS growth year-over-year, the triple-digit margin expansion despite slightly lower sales. Adjusted operating income was up 13% and adjusted EPS was up 16%, while ROS expanded 310 basis points to 24.1%. Both Flow and Pool delivered triple-digit margin expansion and Pool grew sales by 7% in Q3. We achieved record free cash flow so far this year, totaling $629 million. This sets a record post the nVent spin-off from Pentair in 2018. We continue to follow a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation and are very proud of our dividend aristocrat status, marking a 48-year streak of rising dividends. For our over 10,000 Pentair employees, I want to thank you for your dedication to deliver for our customers and create value for our share owners. Your tireless hard work led to another quarter of impressive results. Thank you. I also want to extend my heartfelt sympathies for those affected by the recent hurricanes. I can only imagine how scary and devastating that can be. Moving to guidance. We are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance to around $4.27, representing an approximate 14% increase year-over-year. This is due to our strong performance year-to-date and confidence in our ongoing ability to operate effectively in a changing environment. Bob will provide more details later in the call. Let's turn to Slide 5. As noted last quarter, when we look at each of our three segments and the verticals within each, we have seen areas of great opportunity and some that have remained slightly pressured. For example, in Flow, our commercial vertical reached another new sales record. Higher interest rates in a slow housing market continued to impact our residential vertical, and our industrial vertical has experienced the effects of delayed CapEx spend from customers. Within Water Solutions, our commercial filtration business remains strong, and our Manitowoc Ice business performed well amidst the normalizing environment and difficult year-over-year comparison. Higher interest rates continue to impact our residential business and global economic pressures have affected international business. Our first commercial PFAS certified filtration product that was launched in Q2 had a solid start. We now have 10 products that meet the new NSF certification standard of 20 parts per trillion. Given the increasing focus on water quality and the rising interest in point-of-use filtration systems, we are enthusiastic about the long-term growth potential of these products. Lastly, in Pool, while sales grew year-over-year for the second consecutive quarter, sustained higher interest rates and a slower housing market continue to impact pool demand, predominantly in new and remodeled pools. As mentioned last quarter, new in-ground pool builds in 2024 are expected to be near the 60,000 range compared to roughly 72,000 in 2023 to 78,000 in 2019 per industry data. That said, our aftermarket business continued to perform well in Q3. We believe the pool industry is highly appealing with favorable megatrends and unique competitive advantages for Pentair. For instance, with climate change being an important issue, we believe Pentair is in a strong position to meet the growing demand for smart, sustainable products. We have led the way by pioneering variable speed pumps that conserve energy and reduce costs, and we are continuing to innovate with smart, sustainable products. And we expect to continue to benefit from a favorable housing migration to the Sun Belt states, which represents a large mix of our pool sales. Despite the near-term economic challenges that we expect for new and remodeled pools, we remain confident in Pentair's ability to drive long-term growth and margin expansion. In general, we are very pleased with success and diversification across our move, improve and enjoy water segment as we believe it enables us to manage risk effectively. Let's turn to Slide 6. We have made steady progress with our transformation initiatives. As mentioned during our March 2024 Investor Day, we anticipate that the most substantial productivity savings for us will come from sourcing and operational excellence. To date, we have successfully completed and integrated a majority of Wave 1 and 2 in sourcing. We are also optimizing our global footprint to better align with our focused and balanced water portfolio. We have implemented strategic value-based pricing across our portfolio, and we have taken actions to drive efficiencies across the organization to meet our strategic objectives. We've also made progress on 80/20 even though it is still early in the stages. During Q3, we completed the 80/20 analysis across most of our revenue streams, and we trained additional employees, bringing the total to over 1,200. We are executing action plans to achieve quick wins, such as exiting unprofitable and less profitable revenue in Quad 4, while focusing on driving profitable core sales growth in Quad 1 and 2. We are greatly motivated by the early insights of 80/20 and the proactive measures our teams are implementing to drive sustainable, profitable growth. Before I turn it over to Bob, let's turn to Slide 7, which highlights our third quarter key takeaways. Importantly, transformation continued to drive strong margin expansion, adjusted operating income and earnings growth despite little benefit from volume growth. Early insights into 80/20 are driving further confidence that it can accelerate our transformation initiatives to drive more focused and profitable growth. We increased our full year 2024 adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $4.27, reflecting an approximate 14% increase year-over-year driven by solid execution and strong year-to-date free cash flow. Lastly, we believe we are well positioned to address opportunities for favorable secular trends, which include concerns about access to clean, safe and reliable water; increased awareness of human-made contaminants impacting water composition, taste and quality; growing environmental concerns driving consumers' desire to reduce their carbon footprint; aging commercial, public and municipal infrastructure; interest in outdoor healthy living with people gathering at pools for exercise and fun; and favorable housing migration of the Sun Belt states, which represents a large mix of our pool sales. I will now pass the call over to Bob will discuss our performance and financial results in more detail. Bob?
Robert Fishman: Good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 8. We achieved another strong quarter of quality earnings with triple-digit margin expansion and double-digit adjusted income and EPS growth despite lower volume. Sales outperformed our expectations as did margin and adjusted earnings. In Q3, sales were $993 million, down 2%. Adjusted operating income increased 13% to $239 million. ROS expanded 310 basis points to 24.1%, driven primarily by Transformation and adjusted EPS increased 16% to $1.09. Core sales were down 1% year-over-year, driven by 8% growth in Pool, which was offset by a 7% decline in Flow and a 3% decline in Water Solutions. In the prior year period, both Flow and Water Solutions were able to ship orders from a larger backlog as the supply chain improved. In 2024, our backlogs returned to more normalized levels. Similar to John's earlier comments, our results continue to highlight the power of our balanced water portfolio, the success of our transformation initiatives, and the dedication and hard work of our entire Pentair team globally. Please turn to Slide 9. Flow sales declined 7% year-over-year compared to a near record quarter last year. Residential sales declined 11% as higher interest rates continued to pressure residential end markets. Commercial sales rose 3%, marking the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales growth. And industrial sales were down 10%, driven largely by delayed CapEx. As we noted last quarter, we were starting to see signs of economic uncertainty causing the delay in projects that we had scheduled for the second half of 2024. Segment income grew 7%, and return on sales expanded 280 basis points to 22.2%, marking the first time Flow's ROS has reached or exceeded 22%. The strong margin expansion was a result of continued progress on our Transformation initiatives and favorable mix. Please turn to Slide 10. In Q3, Water Solutions sales declined 3% to $290 million, driven by declines in both commercial and residential. We expected our commercial business to be down in 2024 in light of a record prior year, which was driven by Manitowoc Ice's ability to deliver on significant backlog orders and a larger commercial services project rollout. Manitowoc Ice continued to exceed our expectations by achieving our acquisition business case target two years early in 2023. Within Commercial Water Solutions, filtration sales grew again in Q3. Segment income declined 6% to $64 million and return on sales contracted 80 basis points to 22.2% as higher productivity was more than offset by higher inflation and lower volume. ROS has expanded 820 basis points over the last three years. Please turn to Slide 11. In Q3, Pool sales increased 7% to $331 million. Segment income was $113 million, up 24% and return on sales increased 470 basis points to 34%, driven by sales growth and Transformation. Please turn to Slide 12. We are very pleased with the success of our Transformation initiatives. We are committed to a goal of 24% return on sales by 2026 year-end as mentioned at our March 2024 Investor Day. We are off to a fast start after increasing our initial 2024 ROS guide of 22% to our current guide of 23%. We have achieved $70 million of Transformation savings year-to-date on our way to an expected $100 million for the full year. These 2024 savings are part of our aspiration of $260 million of savings by 2026 year-end, which, in that case, would drive a ROS of approximately 26%. Please turn to Slide 13. On the left side, the four quadrants illustrate how we are prioritizing our business through the lens of customers and products. Those that fall in Quadrant 1 are our highest revenue customers and products, while those in Quadrant 4 reflect the opportunity to reduce the complexity and cost to serve across our portfolio. As we take actions across all four quadrants, we expect 80/20 to accelerate our Transformation efforts and drive core sales growth and further margin expansion in the years ahead. As John mentioned, we are in the early stages of 80/20 and making good progress. Please turn to Slide 14. In Q3, we delivered strong free cash flow of $234 million, driven by higher net income from continuing operations and significant improvement in working capital. Year-to-date, we achieved record free cash flow of $629 million post the nVent separation. We also deployed capital through reinvestment to drive future growth, repay variable rate debt, repurchase shares and pay quarterly dividends. Our net debt leverage ratio is now 1.4x, down from 2.1x a year ago. During the quarter, we repurchased $50 million of shares for a total of $100 million this year. We have an additional $500 million available on our share repurchase program. Lastly, our ROIC was over 15%. Long term, we are targeting high teens ROIC. We plan to remain disciplined with our capital and have flexibility to strategically allocate additional capital to areas with the highest shareholder returns. Moving to Slide 15. For the full year, we are increasing our adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $4.27, which is up roughly 14% year-over-year. Also for the full year, we expect sales to be approximately $4.75 billion to $4.85 billion or roughly flat to down 1%, driven by a challenging economy. This is unchanged from our previous guidance. We expect adjusted operating income to increase approximately 11%. We continue to drive approximately $100 million in transformation savings this year. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to be approximately $965 million to $975 million, down approximately 1% to 2%. We expect fourth quarter adjusted operating income to increase approximately 13%. We're also introducing strong adjusted EPS guidance for the fourth quarter of approximately $1.02, up roughly 17%. This guidance reflects continued global macroeconomic challenges and strategic actions to improve our water portfolio's profitability and growth opportunities. We're excited about the progress we have made this year on transformation, which has been a significant cultural change for our company. We're also very pleased with the early stages of 80/20 and expect the long-term benefits of both Transformation and 80/20 to drive long-term shareholder value. I'd now like to turn the call over to the operator for Q&A after which John will have a few closing remarks. Operator, please open the line for questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
John Stauch: Morning, Dean.
Deane Dray: Maybe we can start with value-based pricing because this can really be a needle mover for you. Can you give us a sense of how much of this is automated? Can you size the impact? And just to confirm, is this now enterprise-wide the implementation?
John Stauch: So thank you for the question, Deane. I think, first of all, I'd say it is going to be and can be a value mover. But I would say to your second part of that question, we're in the early stages. And as a reminder, across all these Transformation initiatives, it's what prompts me to go back to 80/20 because it's a lot easier to do the value-based pricing in Quad 1 and to make sure that you're getting that right on those products that are most desirable to your customers and they go to your -- pretty standard and best customers versus trying to focus your time on Quad 4, 2 and 3. And I think when we started the value-based pricing exercise, we were doing it pretty much across all quadrants. We have introduced and rolled this out, this playbook, to every business. But I think we're farther along in areas like pool and some of the global businesses are further behind, Deane. So great opportunity in the future for sure.
Deane Dray: Great to hear. And then just can you give some context about -- there was reference about some delays in CapEx spending by customers. We're not surprised. Maybe it's related to the election, but can you just tie that together in terms of demand sentiment, projects getting pushed, et cetera?
John Stauch: Yes. I mean this primarily relates to our Flow business and some of the larger projects on beer membranes and some of our larger beverage customers. And I think that we still feel optimistic that we're going to see those projects come through. But I think the investment profile isn't at the level for our customers that they're comfortable with yet. So I think they're delaying them several quarters. That's really what it relates to, Deane.
Deane Dray: Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Andrew Kaplowitz: Good morning, everyone.
John Stauch: Hi, Andy.
Andrew Kaplowitz: John could you talk about what you're seeing in Pool after your price increase in early September and how you would assess the channel inventory headed into '25 in Pool? And then obviously, you mentioned strong price in Pool overall. I think in the past, you've been a bit concerned regarding price versus inflation, but would you say pricing is holding up well versus inflation at this point?
John Stauch: Yes, I'll take the first part. I'll let Bob chime in here a little as well. I think, first of all, I think the market and the industry is playing out generally the way we expected it to after we tweaked it slightly after our Q2 earnings. We're seeing some of the stronger key states continue to have sell-through, and we feel like the inventory is pretty well balanced. And then I think we're going to see a little bit extra demand coming out of Florida here with hurricanes, and we got to make sure we're ramping up and able to facilitate that as well. On the pricing side, they have, as I mentioned earlier, have been further along in the value-based pricing, and we also have pretty good mix that we're able to pull the levers on to help optimize the pricing overall, which is really just the overall receipts of the revenue and making sure that our customers and customers' customers are buying the higher-end solutions. So overall, I think the year is playing out where we wanted it to, and we're still very optimistic that next year will be even a better year since we think the overall pool builds are at a lower end. And we're going to see a recovery in the aftermarket and the remodeling next year. So we're feeling pretty optimistic about 2025. Bob, I don't know if you want to add?
Robert Fishman: Yes, just on price and inflation, I would say we've done a pretty good job of forecasting price and inflation. We had said roughly 2 points would read out at the company level. And that's about what we saw. We saw 3 points in Q1, 1 point in Q2, 2 points in Q3 and then, call it, 1 to 2 points in Q4. Some of that movement is due to product mix in the quarter. Some of it is due to the compare versus the previous year. But overall, it's been pretty level pricing at that 2 points. From an inflation perspective, we had guided to 2% to 3% of the total cost, and that's roughly how it's playing out as well.
Andrew Kaplowitz: John, I know it's early, but can I ask you a follow-up on the hurricane impact, like maybe what you've seen in the past, give us some perspective on what it could look like? I assume there's a delayed sort of remodeling impact or something like that, that maybe impacts next year? And any sizing might be helpful.
John Stauch: Yes. First of all, hurricanes is devastating for those involved. So we certainly don't root for weather events. But we're servicing a channel and servicing dealers, and it's all hands on deck to make sure that our customers are being able to serve their customers. So we usually see pumps, which are the main demand product that could be affected, certainly from water damage. And people, if they can, want to get those pools up and running and make sure that they stay clear. So every hurricane is different, there is no playbook and model. Florida is a pretty important pool state for us, and I'm sure we'll see some -- a little bit of demand here that we factored into our guide.
Andrew Kaplowitz: Appreciate the color.
Operator: The next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Julian Mitchell: Hi. Good morning. Maybe just first off, I wanted an update on the productivity savings outlook. I think before you guided about $100 million for the year, so maybe 30 million or so left in Q4. It's a strong run rate entering the new year next year. So maybe help us understand kind of what sort of productivity we should expect in '25 when you're taking the aggregate of 80/20 and the base Transformation plan, please?
Robert Fishman: Yes. Thanks for the question, Julian. Again, we were very pleased with the Transformation readout in the third quarter, to your point, are tracking towards that $100 million of Transformation savings this year after doing roughly $70 million last year, which means another $30 million in Q4. Overall, back at the March Investor Day, we had talked about driving to an aspirational 26% ROS, which would include $260 million of savings in '24, '25 and '26. By doing $100 million this year, I would say, we're off to a good start. So think about $160 million spread over the next two years, call it, $80 million, $80 million would be a good starting point from a Transformation perspective. And again, we're not committing to the 26% right now. We're still on that 24%. But overall, this fast start to the transformation savings is giving us a lot more confidence.
Julian Mitchell: Thanks very much for that color. And maybe just my follow-up would be around the pace of sort of revenue turnaround in Water and Flow. Understanding Flow, you've got these project delays and maybe a low visibility on where the projects start to move more freely. And then Water, you had the sort of the tough comp in Manitowoc Ice, for example. Maybe just help us understand kind of the confidence in either of those seeing a positive sort of sales trend year-on-year in the next 12 months?
John Stauch: Yes. First of all, I think that we're very pleased with the way our commercial revenue streams have held up and even though we had some more difficult year-over-year comps, we're still seeing sequential movement that gives us an encouraging outlook for those businesses. We are still 50% exposed across the portfolio to residential. And that's where we've seen almost six to seven quarters in a row now of year-over-year challenges. And clearly, as a company, we're rooting for interest rate movements and hoping that mortgage rates decline and overall get a little jump start in the residential movement, meaning people removing houses or people building houses. And we still think that's several quarters away. And so we're continuing to work the Transformation levers. We are encouraged by the prospects of growth next year and we do see early signs that, that will be achievable. And as a reminder, to add to Bob's Transformation, growth will help productivity. So we've been doing a lot of this without the contribution of growth in the Transformation. So if we can continue these programs and get growth on top, we're pretty encouraged on what we can achieve.
Julian Mitchell: That’s great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Steve Tusa: Hi, guys. Good morning. Can you just clarify maybe how much of the revenue decline in Flow and Water the non-pool stuff was? Is that all market? Or is that some of this 80/20 initiative? And then just on the pool pricing, I mean it did accelerate quite a bit here. I think quarter-to-quarter, what do you expect for Pool pricing heading into the fourth quarter and into next year?
John Stauch: I'll take the first one, and I'll have Bob answer the second one. This is generally what I would say is all market, primarily residential and agriculture spaces, Steve, and we're probably thinking in the second half, we'd see better forms of recovery here, and we just haven't -- as we adjusted in the 6 plus 6, we're not counting on that now. And so I think they're doing a good job on cost, and they're working through this. Obviously, these are easier comparisons as we wrap into next year. But right now, it's pretty much the residential and agricultural markets that are challenged.
Robert Fishman: And on pricing for Pool to get to the 2% for the total company, Pool will be somewhere for the year between 2.5% to 3%. And again, they've gone from 4% in Q1 to 1% in Q2 to 4% here in Q3, and then that moderates a little bit in Q4. So that lumpiness, again, attributable to value-based pricing, the mix of the products, those types of things and the compare versus the prior year. So overall, feeling good that 2.5% to 3% price reading out for Pool this year after such large increases in the previous years.
Steve Tusa: Great. Thanks a lot.
Robert Fishman: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Bryan Blair with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Bryan Blair: Thank you. Good morning. To level set on Transformation, Bob, you mentioned the $160 million remaining, $80 million, $80 million or thereabout in terms of the 2025, '26 outlook? Is it fair to say that you're pacing ahead of the initial plan and perhaps there's as much as you've been referencing the 26% and the $260 million contribution toward that is aspirational that you're perhaps going to see runway above that in terms of Transformation savings and an even higher ROS target in time?
Robert Fishman: Certainly, that's our goal. I mean, again, we're looking to return to growth and drive Transformation. The $260 million that we gave back at Analyst Day, got off a faster start. We had guided to $75 million at the beginning of the year and are now at $100 million. So the Transformation savings were led by sourcing. If you'll remember, Wave 1 and Wave 2 are complete this year. Wave 3 will complete next year, and then we'll start that process over again. What I really liked about the third quarter, though, is we had balanced really across sourcing, manufacturing and operational spend below the line. So good balance across those three areas from a Transformation perspective. The other thing that's really increasing our confidence is 80/20 and that being an enabler to the Transformation. While it really is a growth play, we are very focused right now on Quad 4 and reducing a lot of the complexity within Quad 4. There's a number of techniques now that we've rolled out the 80/20 training to over 1,200 people in the company, there's different techniques that we're using in Quad 1 versus Quad 4. And again, think of Quad 4 as being our B customers, our B products, roughly 4% of our revenue. And we're looking at things there like reducing the number of SKUs, being able to price, providing a standard size, minimum order quantities, extending lead times, offering fewer but standard options. So those are the techniques that the teams are using there. Again, our goal is to treat all of our customers fairly, but differently. So there is an opportunity to reduce the complexity in Quad 4. As a reminder, the cost to serve in Quad 4 is somewhere between 15% to 25% of our overall costs. And so that creates an opportunity as well. And we have lots of really great examples so far now that we've rolled it out to the team, we've freed up capacity in a number of our manufacturing sites. We've reduced the resources to support. We've reallocated dollars from Quad 4 to improve the customer experience in Quad 1. So it's really starting to take traction and improve our overall Transformation story. And again, once we eliminate that complexity in Quad 4, we can start to spend more time on improving the customer experience, which we've already started in the first quadrant. And so again, think about 65% of our revenue sitting in that Quad 1, where we have the opportunity to improve product availability, lead times, on-time delivery, provide better service to our channel, either through automation, to training, insight into their businesses, product information. So again, it's a major cultural change as we embark on 80/20. And we think that's going to be a huge accelerator for the Transformation plan.
Bryan Blair: That all makes sense, and trends are very encouraging. Given the operational cadence that you now have, if we do have a stronger growth environment in 2025, you're obviously well positioned to lever that. In addition, your balance sheet is now in pretty good shape. I can't imagine that being any pushback there. How is your deal pipeline looking at this point? And is your team focused on capital deployment over the near term to hopefully further lever a stronger demand environment going forward?
John Stauch: Always looking. Right now, I think, we are very mindful of making sure that anything we look at has to drive returns. And I would say the pipeline is a trickle. It isn't gushing and so we're mindful of how precious our capital is, and we're putting it to the best use possible given all the global and economic environment that we're working within.
Robert Fishman: And to answer your question, we are very pleased with the leverage within the company. When we closed on the Manitowoc deal back in July of 2022, we had levered up to 2.7, 2.8x. A year ago, we were at 2.1 and now we're at 1.4x. So it really is a testament to the EBITDA that we've driven, the EBITDA will be over $1 billion this year and driving that free cash flow to repay the debt and overall, improve our leverage multiple. The balance that we had in Q3 from a capital perspective was very strong. We were able to continue to invest in growth. We paid down some of the debt, continued with the share repurchase and obviously continued with that dividend streak.
Bryan Blair: Thanks again.
Robert Fishman: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning. This is [James] on for Saree. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to kind of go back on 80/20. So I know that it's still in the early stage but you did analysis on most of the revenue stream here. So can you kind of provide more color on when you expect to realize the benefit from 80/20? And like what percentage of revenue do you expect to like discontinue due to unprofitable nature of products?
John Stauch: Yes. As Bob said, I mean, if you look across the portfolio, what mathematically a normalized environment would be in what we call Quad 4 would be roughly 4% of the company. It's very improbable and unlikely that you could get out of all of that revenue in any 12-month period of time. You have contracts, you have obligations. You have certain requirements of how you serve distributors and where those dealers can buy. So this would be in a best case scenario from an existing standpoint, probably half of that would be the opportunity. And then mostly over a 12- to 18-month period, you'd expect to recover most of that lost volume that would be transferred into the A customer streams. So overall, 80/20 should not be a revenue reduction. What it should allow you to do is prioritize your resources and efforts, as Bob said, to taking care of your best customers around your top products and really allow you to free up resources to drive innovation and drive higher long-term organic growth. So I think where we're really got to get paid, right? So the way we expect to get paid is by reducing that complexity in Quad 4 and ultimately then being able to reinvest in the future growth of the company. So I think in a 12-month period, the amount of revenue lost is nominal, but it is a transfer and you should see it in the margin and the Transformation pipe from the efforts that we're driving through 80/20.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Thanks for the color. And a follow-up on the Pool business here. So can you discuss more on the like demand you saw from the prebuy and when you kind of expect to ship those orders?
John Stauch: Yes. We take the -- we put in our price increases generally as a reminder, first of all, the purpose of early buy is to balance our factories and not whipsaw our labor teams and have to hire a bunch of people and then let them go. So we work with the channel to make sure that we could have minimal shipments requirements in Q4 and Q1 that allow us to keep our talented workforce. So with that in mind, we put in prices in Q3. We announced what those price increases will be on the new product. And then our channel places early buy orders at the old prices and then they get terms that allow them to pay us later for that business. Think about it in a normal setting as a roughly a quarter's worth of revenue that we generally ship in Q4 and Q1. And then through those quarters, we still take standard orders for the states that are still open and the product that's still needed, and that's what level loads the Q4 and Q1 revenue streams.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Thanks for taking questions.
Operator: The next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. Please go ahead.
Jeff Hammond: Just maybe go back to the 80/20. One, you mentioned this 15% to 25% cost on the 4% of sales. I'm just wondering as you kind of go through that assessment, maybe cut half of those sales, what do you do with that 15% to 25% of cost? And is there a cost savings number over and above the 260 to think about with 80/20?
John Stauch: So first of all, I don't think it's all addressable because you have like overhead depreciation, factory costs, insurance that obviously is more fixed. But think of -- I think there's at least a 10% cost opportunity in Quad 4 related to the efforts, even compliance and sustainability efforts in addition to shipping, packaging, all kinds of different work streams that aren't as efficient for the B products going to be customers that we're expecting to reduce. And so what we expect to do with the cost is to get rid of them. And that is the goal, Jeff, and that will show up in the Transformation savings. And as Bob has mentioned, we did not have 80/20 expectations in the original Transformation guides, right? And so at some point in time, as we know what these are valued at, we'll have to update our long-term productivity guidance and targets to reflect what we think the 80/20 benefits would be. As a reminder, we're doing things in waves just like we did in Transformation. So we've addressed about 50% of the revenue from an action orientation this year. We expect that to read out next year. And then we finally train everybody in 80/20 and we'd probably expect that to be the second half of next year.
Jeff Hammond: Okay. And then just a couple of quick ones on Pool one, back to the early buy. Just how should we think about the balance of early buy timing between 4Q and first half '25, I know you were pretty balanced last year. And then just any green shoots on new or remodel as we start to see at least some rate cuts, I know that the mortgage rates have been slower to move, but just any green shoots? Thanks.
John Stauch: Yes, Jeff. I mean, first of all, we -- I would define this early buy is completely normal. I think we're back to a more normalized view of it. And so I think growth next year will be more reliant on what happens with new pool builds and also what happens with remodeling and aftermarket. We don't know those predictions and forecasts yet. We're -- we run monthly dealer, voice of customer, and we do dealer and channel checks to make sure that we understand what the thinking is so that we could be prepared from supply chain to address that. And we'll be in a position to share that when we do the guide for next year on the Q4 earnings announcement. It's too premature to call that yet.
Jeff Hammond: Okay. Thanks, guys.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Andrew Krill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Andrew Krill: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I was hoping to get some help on the implied margins for 4Q this year. I'm getting around 23%, down about 100 bps sequentially. Just can you walk us through, I guess, how the kind of the moving pieces on why you're expecting margins to be down sequentially? I think normally, they're a bit more flattish quarter-over-quarter? Thanks.
John Stauch: Well, first of all, you're directionally close. So I mean, I think that would be an appropriate view. We tend to see a drop from Q3 to Q4 historically and traditionally. Q2 and Q3 are our peak quarters, that's when we're fully utilizing our factories and our teams and applying the revenue off the full cost base. So typically, we take a little drop down from Q4 or Q3 to Q4 in revenue, and that's generally why the margins become a little softer. A couple of that is the holidays and also the way that the schedules work, by the way we work with the dealer and the distribution channel that tends to ease off on its purchases towards the end of the year due to the holiday season and a lot of their customers don't want people servicing their houses during those holiday periods.
Robert Fishman: And from a year-on-year perspective, we do expect the ROS to be up significantly in the fourth quarter, similar to how it was in the third quarter. Good news in Q4 is we're going to see better balance across all three segments, Flow, Water Solutions and Pool, all contributing to that ROS expansion story.
Andrew Krill: Great. Very helpful. And then going back to the transformation savings and the final $30 million or so you expecting for 4Q. Any help by segment, which could benefit more or less? Or should we think about them being pretty evenly spread among the 3?
Robert Fishman: Yes. From our perspective, because the ROS will increase for all three segments, you can expect transformation really benefiting all three of those segments in the fourth quarter.
Andrew Krill: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Nathan Jones: Good morning, everyone. I guess I'm going to ask a bit more of a philosophical question about interest rate cuts. You've got a few businesses that you called out has negatively impacted, residential flow, new pool construction, that kind of stuff. Can you talk about typically what kind of lag you see to interest rate cuts before it begins to start impacting those businesses?
John Stauch: Yes. I think it's six to nine months to see meaningful impact, Nathan. Obviously, just a feeling that they're going to continue to head down would start the encouragement of people being able to think that they could go out, for instance, get a variable rate mortgage, maybe refinance later. But we're not yet seeing the credit markets reflect the lower rates, and you probably saw that even mortgage rates ticked up and borrowing rates did not necessarily go down. So I think while we're encouraged by a single larger movement, we're still going to need a few more before we've got a bunch of consumers and customers that are confident that their borrowing rates are going to be lower in the future.
Nathan Jones: So maybe it starts to impact second half of next year and into the first half of the year after?
John Stauch: Probably a good assumption. Tighten that up as we finish Q4 and have better understanding, but that would be a reasonable way to look at it.
Nathan Jones: There's a couple of the pillars on your transformational initiatives that we haven't talked too much today, around operational excellence, organizational effectiveness. Can you just give us an update on the initiatives there and the expected impacts you're looking for?
John Stauch: Yes, I mean, there are two big work streams. I mean the organizational excellence is one that we're really working as more of an offset, right? We want to drive some of the nonproductive activities out of the organization and reinvest in innovation and sales and marketing and certainly supporting our customers more effectively. So we haven't talked a lot about being a significant positive to the P&L, but it's important because it'll free up resources to invest. On the operational footprint, we've made great progress, but growth will help a lot, and we need to get leverage across the factory footprint. And then while we've overdriven a lot of the activities, we've seen some headwinds, as I'm sure most companies have, from insurance, utilities, property taxes, those types of things that actually negatively impact the operational piece of the P&L. So while we probably haven't highlighted enough, we're making great progress there. And we're just trying to get ahead of some of those inflationary elements that have hit the manufacturing side harder than they probably hit across the overall P&L.
Nathan Jones: Thanks very much for taking my questions.
Operator: The next question comes from Mike Halloran with Baird. Please go ahead.
Mike Halloran: Good morning, everyone. Two quick ones here. One, on the commercial side on the Water Solutions, just any variance between the Everpure and Man Ice businesses? And then maybe just talk a little bit to how cross-selling is going on that side of things?
Robert Fishman: Yes. Again, from our perspective, pleased with how commercial filtration is performing this year for Manitowoc Ice, just as a reminder, this year, we had guided down roughly mid-single digits after their record [$4.45 billion] year last year. We do expect them to return to growth next year. Overall, those businesses from a ROS perspective continue to perform very well. So pleased with commercial filtration and Manitowoc Ice. Overall for the portfolio under a little bit of pressure in the third quarter, Water Solutions in total. That has to do with compare we faced last year but also with some of the selling efforts within commercial filtration, where we lead with the system and then benefit from the recurring revenue down the road. So overall, you make an investment today in the systems and then drive that recurring revenue stream. So a few things at play there, but generally pleased with the performance in commercial water for the quarter and for the year.
John Stauch: And then to your question on cross synergies, I couldn't be more pleased. And that's what you're seeing a lot of the filtration revenue this year is the synergies we talked about in the Manitowoc Ice side. It was Manitowoc pulling Everpure. It wasn't really going to come the other way around. So when we look at that deal model, we're ahead of our expectations and expect 2025 to be on or above those expectations. So really feel good about the performance of this business and the synergies that we committed to.
Mike Halloran: Thanks for that. And then following up on a question earlier on the capital usage side of things. I certainly understand the M&A piece. In light of that, what's the equation from your perspective on how to approach buybacks from here? Are you doing something consistent as it sits here today. What would it take in your mind to lean in a little bit more and maybe walk through that thought process?
John Stauch: Yes. I think Bob and I are most pleased that we're starting to really generate cash at the levels that we expected to. As a reminder, we still have a lot of Transformation headwinds and restructuring that we still see as an opportunity in '25 and '26 as we ramp that down. And that's going to give us more confidence in our ability to continue to pay off the debt and have a lot more flexibility as far as what we want to accomplish. $1 billion EBITDA, we always want to have a little acquisition powder for the strategic acquisitions. We are a collection of acquisitions, some of those completely strategic to what we want to be as a company and some that weren't. And so I think what we want to do is when we look at the acquisitions in the pipeline, we want to make sure that they're synergistic to things that we do today and we want to make sure that we're giving our customers more product that they want to buy from us. So being really disciplined in what we're looking at. And we want to make sure it has the type of returns that our shareholders expect. So in the meantime, we're continuing to buy back shares and pay down the debt. That's where the focus has been.
Mike Halloran: Thank you.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Joe Giordano: Thanks guys. Good morning. You highlighted in the slide some of the PFAS products that you guys have developed. And I'm just curious, like what's been the early uptake there? Like who's buying? Has it been more like industrial customers, municipalities and maybe if you can scale the opportunity there?
John Stauch: Yes. So first of all, I mean, it's -- on a percentage basis, immensely huge growth, but we're still in the early stages of revenue there. So let's say, north of $1 million. But I think we're most encouraged that we have several sets of customers that are extremely interested. First of all, our distributors and dealers are excited and enthusiastic that they're working with a partner like Pentair who's put a product line out there that can solve their needs and it gives them something new to talk to their customers about. But most of the uptake has predominantly been in the commercial and hospitality areas where they really, really care about the quality of the water that they are servicing and giving to their customers. But we have seen a little bit of encouragement in people up paying in the residential markets as well. So overall, enthused about the start, and we're hopeful that it's really just wakening people's mindset to water quality and starting to spur a conversation of paying a little bit more for a little bit -- well, a lot more value and feeling confident in the water they're drinking.
Joe Giordano: And then just last for me. You mentioned like the delays on the industrial side and CapEx projects. And you mentioned it could be several quarters like I guess when we talk to other industrial companies, no one's talking about cancellations, but everyone is talking about significant pushouts. And I guess like one does one become the other.
John Stauch: Yes. I think when it goes several more quarters, I think you should think about it leaving the funnel and not being in the funnel. I always look at front log, which is the types of things and projects that we're quoting. Usually, that's not a good indication because engineers always stay busy in the project front line side. Backlog is meaningful. And what you'd expect is that you're starting to grow that backlog because people are still placing those projects and then they're timing them maybe. This isn't that meaningful for us. It's just more of a relative comment that there's a piece of our business that could have been double-digit growth that's now coming back to flattish growth.
Joe Giordano: Thanks guys.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, guys. Good morning. This is [indiscernible] on for Brett Linzey. So just one more on the 80/20. After you guys went through all the revenue streams and product lines. How, are you thinking about the opportunity by segment? Thank you.
John Stauch: As Bob mentioned, we always have a favorite segment at the moment, but the opportunity is equal across all three segments. It is really a combination of longevity, global P&Ls, our desire to chase adjacencies over time to sign up customers who we thought would be bigger than they are today. Those opportunities are equal across all three segments. And we're working through the playbooks, and we're very confident that all three of our segments are going to get an equal participation in 80/20. Some will be more margin focused, and I think that will slide to flow into Water Solutions, especially on the residential end and others will be a growth capability, which would be Pool in probably areas like Manitowoc and Everpure but all of the businesses have an equal opportunity.
Unidentified Analyst: Awesome. Thanks guys.
Operator: The next question comes from Scott Graham with Seaport Research. Please go ahead.
Scott Graham: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So implied from your third quarter guidance, there was a fourth quarter implication that it looks like your new fourth quarter guidance is a little bit lower than on the sales side. And I was wondering if that's because of both the prebuy and the industrial project pushouts? So again, the implied slower sales, are those the reasons for the fourth quarter?
John Stauch: Our guide remains the same. I will acknowledge that consensus might have been slightly higher, but our guide that we put out, and this forecast is equal to what we had in the last forecast, Scott. I think we're managing through the growth and Transformation opportunities we have. And I think the way that the year is playing out is consistent with the way we saw it last quarter.
Scott Graham: Okay. I'll check that math with Shelly. I follow it up, no problem. For Pool, so the full year guide of sort of mid-single would imply a slightly down fourth quarter. And what I'm wondering is if this year's prebuy is largely equal to last year's prebuy in terms of the mechanics we took it in the level loading into the fourth quarter. Why would fourth quarter sales in Pool be implied down?
Robert Fishman: Yes. Within our guide for the fourth quarter, we actually have Pool slightly up and Flow and Water Solutions slightly down to get our overall guidance for the quarter. So Pool is up in the fourth quarter.
Scott Graham: Okay. I guess, thank you. The last question there is, so both Water Solutions and Flow had productivity, which if you x out some Transformation benefit dollar number would imply that the productivity was actually maybe negative in those areas. Was that simply all from the negative volumes?
John Stauch: No. I mean we were more challenged in the productivity side of Water Solutions this quarter. That business is extremely global. And we've been working really hard to get some of the global cost out, but it generally takes longer to attack the cost bases outside the United States. So we still expect those to be opportunities in the future. And as Bob said, we had a year-over-year compare in Water Solutions last year, which was record and those margins were challenged. I think you'll see margin improvement return in Q4 there, and we're confident about what it can do in 2025.
Robert Fishman: And Flow really did have a nice Q3 from a ROS expansion story. The price that they were able to drive along with transformation will more than offset the inflation.
Operator: And I understand there is time for a last questioner, and that will be Damian Karas with UBS. Please go ahead.
Damian Karas: Hi, morning guys. Covered a lot of ground. Just a quick question related to free cash flow. It's been pretty strong year-to-date. I'm just wondering for the fourth quarter, is there anything beyond the typical seasonal factors that you'd kind of expect to happen. It just seems like you're well above the 100% conversion guide for the year. Thanks.
Robert Fishman: We expect a pretty typical Q4 and to the point you made, seasonality does play in, in Q4 and Q1 with Q2 being our largest free cash flow quarter.
Damian Karas: Terrific. Thanks, guys.
John Stauch: All right. Thank you for joining us. In closing, I wanted to reiterate our key themes. First, solid execution across our balanced water portfolio drove significant margin expansion for the tenth consecutive quarter. Second, we are increasing our 2024 adjusted EPS guidance which reflects continued confidence in our strategy and our ability to mitigate risk where we can and maintain agility in a dynamic environment. Third, we expect our transformation initiatives in our 80/20 to continue to drive strong margin expansion and adjusted EPS growth. And finally, we believe our focused water strategy and solid execution are building a foundation to continue to deliver value creation beyond the 2024 fiscal year. Thank you, everyone, and have a great day.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-07-23 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Pentair Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please also note that today's event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Shelly Hubbard, Vice President, Investor Relations. Ma'am, please go ahead.
Shelly Hubbard: Thank you, and welcome to Pentair's second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. On the call with me are John Stauch, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Bob Fishman, our Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, we will provide details on our second quarter performance as outlined in this morning's press release.

Please visit our Pentair Investor relations website and click on events and presentations to find these materials. I will now turn the call over to John.
John Stauch: Thank you, Shelly, and good morning everyone. Let's begin with our record Q2 results in the executive summary on slide four. During the second quarter, we achieved record sales, adjusted operating income, return on sales, adjusted EPS, and free cash Flow following the separation of nVent from Pentair in 2018 and we delivered these results on top of a record from the prior year period. I would like to thank our 10,000 plus Pentair employees for their continued commitment towards delivering for our customers and creating value for our shareholders. We worked tirelessly and impressively to deliver another quarter of remarkable income growth and margin expansion. Thank you. In Q2 sales increased 2%, adjusted operating income increased 16%, ROS expanded by 310 basis points, driven by margin expansion across all three segments. Adjusted EPS rose 18% and free cash Flow was over $500 million. Driven by a disciplined capital allocation strategy and record free cash Flow. We continue to strengthen the balance sheet and we purchased $50 million worth of stock in the second quarter. We also continue to elevate our dividend. As a dividend aristocrat we have increased our dividend to shareowners for 48 consecutive years. As we look to the remainder of the year, we are increasing our adjusted EPS and ROS guidance. This is driven by our strong results in the first half of this year and continued confidence in our ability to execute in a dynamic macroeconomic and geopolitical environment while implementing and executing on our major initiative transformation now inclusive of 80/20. Our expected 2024 EPS increased to approximately $4.25. This represents the high end of our previous guidance. Bob will provide more details later in the call. We believe our record second quarter performance demonstrates the power of our sustainable and balanced water portfolio, as well as strong execution across all three segments, Flow, Water Solutions and Pool. Our strategy to help the world sustainably move, improve and enjoy water, life's most essential resource, continues to prove its resilience and we believe we are well positioned to capture opportunities from favorable secular trends such as water availability, with growing concerns over access to clean, safe and reliable water, increased awareness of water challenges led by growing concerns around human made contaminants impacting water composition, taste and water quality. Growing environmental concerns as consumers are looking to reduce their carbon footprint and impact on the environment, aging commercial, public and municipal infrastructure. Outdoor healthy living as people are interested in gathering at pools to exercise, stay cool and have fun and favorable housing migration to the Sunbelt states, which represents a large mix of our Pool sales. Let's turn to slide five. Over the last 90 plus days, we've seen reports that suggest a continuation of slower global growth throughout the remainder of the year. As we look at each of our three segments and the verticals within each, we believe that there are areas of great opportunity and some that we expect to remain slightly pressured. All in this is where we believe our balanced water portfolio diversifies the risk and enables us to control what we can and mitigate challenges where possible. For example, in Flow, we reached record sales within commercial and have seen higher activity from IIJA funding on infrastructure projects. Higher interest rates in a slow housing market continued to impact our residential vertical and our industrial vertical has experienced some delay in CapEx spending by some key customers. Within Water Solutions, our North America commercial filtration business remains strong and our commercial Ice business performed as expected while international has been impacted by economic pressures. Residential continue to be impacted by higher interest rates. That said, we are really excited about the launch of our first commercial PFAS certified filtration product in Q2, which further expanded our existing PFAS certified filtration product line. Customers showed strong interest in wanting to learn more about this product. We are proud of this new innovation and the teams that brought this product to market. With heightened awareness on water quality and interest in point of use filtration, we are excited to see this product line grow long term. Lastly, in Pool sustained higher interest rates in a slower housing market have continued to impact Pool demand, predominantly in new and remodeled Pools. New in ground Pools built in 2024 are now expected to be near the 60,000 Pool range compared to roughly 72,000 in 2023 and roughly 78,000 in 2019. Given this economic weakness, our recent dealer survey noted that the industry is expecting slightly lower growth than it did 90 plus days ago. However, our aftermarket business performed well in Q2, which in part drove double digit Pool sales growth for Pentair. Despite the near-term economic challenges for the Pool industry, we remain confident in Pentair’s ability to drive long term growth and margin expansion. We believe it remains a very attractive industry with mega trends that are in our favor. A majority of our revenue is concentrated in five Sunbelt states, which are benefiting from the higher migration to warmer weather. We're also seeing a trend toward lifestyle and wellness, with family and friends gathering outdoors and Pools for exercise and to have fun. As climate change remains a top concern, Pentair is well positioned for secular trends and preferences for smart, sustainable products. We are the pioneers in introducing variable speed pumps which save energy and money. Let's turn to slide six. Last quarter, I mentioned that our transformation initiatives remained on track to deliver margin expansion as we highlighted at our March investor Day. Approximately 50% of our total revenue has adopted and implemented value based pricing as part of our strategic pricing initiatives, we are well into wave two of our sourcing initiatives, which is beginning to drive benefits in our financial results and we have continued to drive operational footprint optimization and plan to continue this going forward. In Q2, transformation drove record quarterly productivity. Additionally, we trained about 1000 employees on 80/20, reflecting about 50% of Pentair’s revenue streams. We're starting to execute on some quick wins and continue to see larger longer-term opportunities as we expect 80/20 to further enable our transformation success. It is important to recognize that reducing complexity of low value products for lower value customers is the premise of 80/20. By doing this, resources are freed up. That should allow us to perform better for the core customers who buy our core products. When we do this, we expect to see higher core growth rates in our businesses longer term. I'm excited about the initial fact based data that we have analyzed and I am encouraging the business leaders to move quickly to exit their complexity and focus on the core. We expect to have a further update on our progress and the impact on 2025 after we have completed the initial training and implemented the actions across the entire Pentair portfolio, which we expect to complete by the end of 2024. Before I turn it over to Bob, let's turn to slide seven. We continue to drive strong margin expansion and operating income dollars through transformation despite economic weakness. Our transformation initiatives are well underway and our 80/20 analysis kicked off in recent months with strategic actions that are in the early stages. We have increased confidence in our long-term value creation and we expect to deliver ROS of approximately 23%, about 100 basis points higher than previously guided, and about 13% adjusted EPS growth in 2024. All in, we continue to build a strong foundation that we expect to drive long term growth and profitability across our diverse water portfolio. I will now pass the call over to Bob who will discuss our performance and financial results in more detail. Bob?
Robert Fishman: Thank you, John, and good morning everyone. Let's start on slide eight. We delivered another strong quarter of quality earnings. Sales rose 2% to $1.1 billion, while adjusted operating income increased 16% to $271 million. ROS expanded 310 basis points to 24.7%, driven by sales growth and transformation. All three metrics achieved new records post the separation of nVent from Pentair in 2018. Core sales were up 2% year-over-year, driven by 18% growth in Pool, which was somewhat offset by a 3% decline in Flow and a 7% decline in Water Solutions. Both Flow and Water Solutions reported record sales in the prior year period due to supply chain improvement and our ability to ship a large portion of backlog orders. Sales across all three segments increased sequentially from Q1 as expected, our second quarter sales have typically been our highest sales quarter of the year. We are very pleased to see Pool return to growth for the first time in eight quarters. All three segments drove significant margin expansion in the second quarter. Lastly, we delivered record adjusted EPS of $1.22 post the nVent split, which exceeded the high end of our guidance by $0.05 and was up 18% year-over-year. Please turn to slide nine. Flow sales declined 4% year-over-year compared to a record quarter last year. Residential sales declined 10% as compared to the prior year quarter, but reflected an improvement sequentially from Q1. Commercial sales rose 2% compared to a record prior year. Industrial sales were flat in Q2, reflecting our decision to discontinue certain projects that no longer met our profitability criteria. Segment income grew 13% and return on sales expanded 310 basis points to 21.3%, marking the first time ROS has reached or exceeded 21%. The strong margin expansion was a result of continued progress on our transformation initiatives. Please turn to slide 10. In Q2 Water Solutions sales declined 8% to $311 million, driven by declines in both commercial and residential. We expected our commercial business to be down in light of a record prior year comparison driven by Manitowoc Ice's ability to work through a significant portion of backlog orders. We were pleased with filtration sales strength in Q2. Segment income declined 3% to $73 million and return on sales expanded 130 basis points to 23.5%, driven primarily by transformation which continued to drive operational efficiencies as well as mix. This was the ninth consecutive quarter of ROS expansion. Margins have expanded nearly 900 basis points over the last two years. Please turn to slide 11. In Q2, Pool sales increased 17% to $392 million. Segment income was $134 million, up 27% and return on sales increased 270 basis points to 34.1%, driven by sales growth and transformation. Please turn to slide 12. At our investor day in March, we shared our updated three-year margin targets. We expect 2026 ROS to expand to 24% over 540 basis points as compared to 2022, driven by contributions from all four of our key transformation initiatives, pricing, sourcing, operations and organization. And we have the opportunity to do even better as we discussed at our March investor day. In 2023, we achieved ROS of 20.8% and expect to continue to drive margin expansion to approximately 23% by year end 2024, an increase of nearly 100 basis points from our previous guidance. Please turn to slide 13. As we mentioned in our March Investor Day, we expect 80/20 to enable and accelerate our transformation initiatives. It's another tool in our toolkit to help our businesses enhance the customer experience and reduce complexity. The 80/20 analysis uses a quadrant based strategy to assess customers and products. Simplistically, the first quadrant reflects a combination of customers and products, which drive a majority of revenue and profit. Conversely, the fourth quadrant reflects customers and products that represent roughly 4% of revenue but includes 15% to 25% of total cost to serve. We expect to focus on customer segmentation over product segmentation to enable us to implement customer strategies based on each quadrant. As a result, we can take specific actions tailored to each quadrant to drive higher and more profitable growth over time. To date, we have assessed about 50% of our total revenue using 80/20 and are currently evaluating this analysis and developing action plans. 80/20 is about treating our customers fairly but differently depending on the circumstances. The objectiveness of the data frees the organization to make the right decisions. We expect to see the largest benefit from 80/20 in operations. However, we also believe G&A and new product introductions will be impacted by the fourth quadrant due to the effort required to serve. We expect this to benefit our organizational excellence efforts as well. We believe the 80/20 analysis is a great complement to our transformation program. We expect to see a noticeable contribution in 2025 as these plans are rolled out. I'm excited about the process and the findings, and I expect it to lead to larger transformation opportunities. Please turn to slide 14. In Q2 we achieved record free cash flow of $522 million. We deployed capital to lower our long-term debt, restart share repurchases and pay our quarterly dividend. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 600,000 shares for a total of $50 million. We have an additional $550 million available on our share repurchase program. Our net debt leverage ratio was 1.6 times down, significantly from 2.2 times in the prior year period. Our ROIC was nearly 15%. Long term, we continue to target high teens return on invested capital. We plan to remain disciplined with our capital and continue to focus on debt reduction amid the higher interest rate environment and share repurchases. As I mentioned last quarter, with the net debt leverage ratio within our target range, we have additional flexibility to strategically allocate additional capital to areas with the highest shareholder returns. Moving to slide 15. For the full year, we are increasing our adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $4.25, which is up roughly 13% year-over-year and is at the high end of our previous guidance range. Also, for the full year, we expect sales to be approximately flat to down 1%, driven by a continued sluggish economy. The second half of 2024 reflects the anticipated reality of a continued higher interest rate environment and its impact on the global economic landscape. For Pentair, this means we are lowering the back half revenue expectations by about $120 million at the midpoint of our guidance. About $30 million of this is in Pool, which reflects the expectation of primarily slower Pool builds and remodels. About $30 million is in Water Solutions and is in lower margin commercial services and global water treatment end markets and about $60 million in Flow is primarily related to residential delayed industrial projects and being more focused around standardized offerings and recurring revenue to drive higher profitability. We now expect Flow and Water Solution sales to be down approximately low single digits and Pool sales to be up approximately mid-single digits for the full year. Within Flow, we expect residential to be down approximately high single digits, commercial to be up approximately mid-single digits and industrial to be roughly flat as we continue to be selective around certain projects. Within Water Solutions, we expect residential to be down approximately low to mid-single digits and commercial to be down approximately low-single digits, primarily due to services. We're also updating expected adjusted operating income to approximately increase 10% to 11%. We are pleased to be able to increase our adjusted EPS guidance despite the lower revenue, we are increasing expected transformation savings to approximately $100 million for 2024 as compared to $75 million in our previous guidance, driven by higher productivity. We expect to improve our mix of higher margin businesses and continue our focus on pricing initiatives to offset inflation. Due to a continued sluggish economy we expect sales to be down approximately 2% to 3% for the third quarter, but adjusted operating income to increase 10% to 12%. We are also introducing strong adjusted EPS guidance for the third quarter of approximately $1.06 to $1.08, up roughly 14% at the midpoint. Before I turn the call over to the operator for questions, I want to say how pleased we are with our second quarter record performance. Our teams have been working diligently and effectively to mitigate uncontrolled risk like continued global economic pressures, while working to deliver strong financial results and executing our major initiative transformation, which now includes 80/20. We are very proud of the hard work and dedication of our entire Pentair team. I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for Q&A, after which John will have a few closing remarks. Operator, please open the line for questions. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now begin the question-and-answer session. In the interest of time, once again, that we do ask that you please limit yourselves to one question and one follow up. [Operator Instructions] At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble the roster. And our first question today comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.
Andrew Kaplowitz: Good morning, everyone. Nice quarter. John or Bob, can you give us more color regarding what you're seeing in Pool and your assumptions for break and fix and remodeling? I think you mentioned a strong aftermarket, weaker remodeling, we obviously know what you're thinking for new Pools, but could you talk about your selling assumptions to the channel? How concerned are you? Or where you're baking in for inventories in the channel at this point for '24?
Robert Fishman: Yes, I'll go ahead and start with that one. Andy, thanks for the question. Again, from our perspective, we started the year saying Pool would grow approximately 7% full year. We've now guided that to up mid-single digits. As a reminder, a significant piece of our growth is coming from the fact that last year's inventories correction will not be happening this year. Plus a couple of points of price and then an assumption that says the overall market's down roughly mid-single digits. And so that's how we get to our mid-single digit growth for the year. From our last earnings call, we have seen a little bit of pressure on new Pool builds and remodels. And that was the reason why we brought our guide down for the Pool season.
John Stauch: Andy, I would just add that as a reminder. We had a really easy compare in Q2 versus a, a really low number last year. And so the growth rate in Q2 is more reflective of last year's performance than it is of anything that is outside the performance of this year.
Andrew Kaplowitz: That's helpful guys. And then obviously, your transformation impact is impressive in raising the productivity to $100 million. But you talked about 80-20. How much of it all is that sort of helping '24? It seems like it's early days. And you've got the 23% target for this year and 24% target for '26. So does it give you a little bit more confidence towards maybe that upside case as you go into '26, any thoughts on how 80-20 could impact '25, for example?
John Stauch: Yes. So first of all, 80-20 was not in our 2026 Investor Day longer-term targets. Very little of it is included in our 2024 update guidance. We completed the training sessions and the fact-based analysis on roughly half of our revenue streams. And we'll have the other half done in roughly the next 90 days. So we're very encouraged with what we're learning and finding and it does give us confidence that we can continue to improve margins as we go forward.
Robert Fishman: We were very pleased to be able to increase the transformation savings from $75 million to $100 million. Think of that as primarily coming from our sourcing savings with also our manufacturing and org excellence piece helping as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bryan Blair from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question.
Bryan Blair : Thank you. Good morning. Very solid quarter. To follow up on transformation, obviously, benefits accelerated in the quarter, you have stepped up the full year guide. Just mentioned that it's primarily from sourcing. So, should we think that there's somewhat waiting to the Pool segment in the back half in terms of contribution? And just overall, with that step up, how should we think it's Q3, Q4 waiting?
Robert Fishman: Yes. From our perspective, in terms of the guide we gave for Q3 and then the implicit guide for Q4, we'll see significant ROS expansion in both quarters. We do think that the main beneficiaries in the back half will be the Pool business and Flow followed by Water Solutions.
Bryan Blair : Understood. And I was wondering if you could parse out the commercial Water Solutions revenue decline in Q2 across Everpure, Menis and KBI, and then what you're anticipating in the back half by business line. We know and I said, in particular, a very challenging comp in Q2. Just curious what you're seeing there and what's factored into the outlook now?
John Stauch: Yes. I mean most of the decline that we're seeing in Water Solutions is coming from not participating in low-value service contracts within our KBI services arm, and we're adjusting our revenue down to reflect that. That would be roughly a $20 million adjustment for the year. The rest of it is filtration grew double digit in Q2 and they're having a really strong year. And the Manitowoc Ice business continues to perform to expectations. And as a reminder, we were just under $450 million of revenue last year. We'll be just in the low 420s this year. So we're managing through a really decent execution despite having those record backlogs last year that we ended up shipping. So I feel really good about Water Solutions business. We are tweaking our global residential water treatment business, reflecting some of the lower revenue streams and non-U.S. related businesses. And that's a small adjustment here, but I think it's reflected that we don't think that those will improve in the back half of the year.
Robert Fishman: Yes. And just as a reminder, the North America filtration business, the Ice business, those are very profitable ROS businesses for us. So, the mix certainly works in our favor.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.
Stephen Tusa: Hey, good morning. Can you just maybe talk about the pricing environment that you're seeing out there and how that should trend over the course of the year. It looks like -- I don't know you're assuming maybe one to two points for the year.
John Stauch: That is correct, Steve. And I don't think we should expect that we're going to outperform that between now and the rest of the year. I think we're -- there's pockets of being able to recover some of the incremental inflationary areas, but we don't feel that inflation is significant enough to go out with another round of pricing. So we're generally doing the best we can and that the original list prices. And I think so far, so good.
Stephen Tusa: Do you, at any point in time, see price going like flat to down and Pool at all?
Robert Fishman: No. We do not see that happening. At the halfway point, we have -- of the year, we have two points of price reading out, and I expect something similar in the back half.
Stephen Tusa: Okay. Great. And then just on the bridge, the productivity was pretty solid this quarter. What are you guys expecting for the year now on that number? I think it was like $75 million before. some of these numbers around it, but what do you guys expect for the year?
Robert Fishman: $100 million now in my prepared remarks, and you can think about that as roughly split between -- evenly between Q3 and Q4.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Lee from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
Brian Lee: Hey, guys, thanks for taking the questions. Good morning. I guess maybe a follow-up on the last one. You raised the kind of transformation benefits from the $75 million to $100 million. I know you don't have much, if any, of the 80-20 in '24, but can you give us some sense, any sense of sort of how it would compare just your initial read on 80-20 impact into '25 when you kind of compare and contrast to what you've been able to do with the transformation initiatives this year going from $75 million to $100 million?
John Stauch: Yes. Let me hit the transmission real quickly. I think it's fair to say we always had an internal funnel that was higher than what we had confidence with in the beginning of the year internal side. And I think the $100 million now reflects that most of the programs that we had in the internal funnel are now being realized. And so that's where our confidence level is as we exited Q2. As a reminder, we had difficult year-over-year in transformation in Q1, and we had a very strong Q2, and now we feel confident in what that full year expectation is. When we look at 80-20, I think it's important to note that the way the math works is that what we call Quad 4, which is the lowest performing quadrant. These would be less desirable products to lesser desirable customers. That's roughly usually around 4% of revenue. So just to think about that, that frames on a $4 billion-ish revenue stream, what the walkaway revenue number would be at its worst possible scenario. That same quadrant generally usually reflects about 25% of the company's cost structure. Now you're not going to get all that 25% out because clearly utilizing pieces of people's work efforts, but it starts to tell you about how it's non-profitable being Quadrant four. So, as you release yourself from the products that you're spending a lot of time on, you should ultimately be able to reduce your labor and reduce or redirect your NPI and your sales and marketing efforts to your Quad one to generally over-serve or create a better service level to your top customers, which gives you an overall better core rates. So we don't have that figured out for all the businesses yet, but the math is not going to be any different for Pentair than it is for everybody else who goes through the program. And it's really encouraging and gives us a lot of optimism that the whole another list of transformation ideas as we head into 2025.
Robert Fishman: Yes. From my perspective, it brings tremendous focus to the things that really matter allows us to be seek perfection in QUADRA one with our best customers and best products and really to reduce complexity and simplify the business in quad 4.
Brian Lee: Okay. Super helpful. Appreciate the color. And then, Bob, you mentioned on the guidance walk on revenue. The $120 million at the midpoint that's coming out versus prior guide. Is there any percentage of that, which is being driven by exiting some of these less profitable business lines, just a more proactive approach to kind of how you're structuring the revenue goal for this year versus it all just being market driven? Thanks, guys.
Robert Fishman: I would say in the revenue reduction, there's nothing significant relating to 80-20. There happens to be lower profit revenue streams as we're more selective within Flow as commercial services comes down, those would be helping the overall mix. But nothing yet directly related to 80-20.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.
Jeffrey Hammond: Hey, good morning, everyone. Just on Water Solutions, a couple of questions. One, the commercial filtration, you called out is strong. Is that just attachment synergies from or is it something more broad than that? And then just speak to commercial foodservice. In general, we're seeing kind of a weaker consumer or mixed results out of Starbucks, et cetera, what you're seeing in general there?
Robert Fishman: Yes. I would say we're starting the synergies coming from that Manitowoc Ice acquisition really benefiting our North America filtration business. Again, we have the opportunity to visit distributors and dealers and talk about the breadth of our offering. We have the opportunity to cross-sell products. And we have an opportunity to go to market in a different way, whether it's setting up at a trade show and selling both Everpure and Ice. Those are all the benefits that are accruing to the filtration business this year.
John Stauch: And I think this is John. Jeff, to answer your question, I mean, we do a lot of quick serve. And even though the traffic may be a little more challenged from time to time, it's relatively a stable industry. when it comes to the replacement side and the step-through for our related products.
Jeffrey Hammond: Okay. And then just to put a finer point on Pool, just give me a sense, post some of the pre-announcements, just what feedback you're getting on nVentory levels, kind of this absence of destock and if it's a little bit less or just a little more color on that.
John Stauch: Yes. I'd say, first of all, I mean, we're disappointed in the new Pool build for the year. I mean, we're almost near historical lows and pretty close to where we were in the '08-'09 financial crisis, Jeff. So I mean we're looking for the movement in interest rates to really start to spur the remodeling side and hopefully begin to get people to move homes and think about Pools as part of that attachment. Overall, on the way the segmentation works, we do really on the high end and high end is still strong. That's generally a cash buyer, and they're utilizing retirement income to -- or retirement of funds to buy the dream home in the Sunbelt states. It's really the mid-market and some of the remodeling that we believe has slowed. And so as we mentioned in our remarks, our dealer pulse would suggest that it's a little less optimistic here as we enter the second half of the year than we saw in the first half of the year, which is why we adjusted our guide downward by a couple of points.
Operator: Our next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning everyone. It's -- you mentioned in the prepared remarks that Flow was seeing some of the government stimulus coming through. Can you provide any color there?
John Stauch: Yes. I mean I think it's just overall, we're really pleased with the fact that there's been a fair amount of infrastructure spend and we focused our activity there, had some solid marketing programs to focus on where that got an expansion is. And I think we feel really pleased that we're participating in that segment right now.
Deane Dray: Got it. And what kind of contribution are you expecting for the second half in that stimulus?
John Stauch: Yes, not much at all. It's modest. We called it out as a particular area of the economy that continues to be invested in. And I'm sure you're struggling with some of that road construction and infrastructure spending as well as we all are here in the summer construction season, but it's been nice to participate in that and see a little bright spot from the government funding in that area, which offsets some of the lack of interest rate benefits we're getting elsewhere.
Operator: Our next question comes from Saree Boroditsky from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.
Saree Boroditsky: Good morning. This is James on for Saree. Thanks for taking questions. So I kind of wanted to touch on Pool here. So like very strong growth in 2Q. Can you kind of break it down by like what's the contribution from alibi, -- what was the selling and sales through?
John Stauch: Yes. Sell-in and the sell-through about flat in the quarter for us. And the rest of what happened in Q2 was the year-over-year comparison really wouldn't happen, which was last year, there was a sizable at 5% inventory correction in this year generally sell-in matched sell-out.
Saree Boroditsky: Got it. Thanks. And I wanted to kind of understand the Pool guidance a little bit better. So you delivered a lot of like pre-buy in second quarter 2024. So how should we think about the 4Q this year? Like what does the guidance to pre-buy?
John Stauch: So as a reminder, the prebuy starts in Q3 and Q4 of the previous year, and we take those orders ahead of the price increases for the next Pool year. Right now, we have what we'd say is a modestly down to normalized environment as we look forward in 2025, reflecting that we think that we won't really see benefits from lower interest rates across the residential businesses probably second half of 2025.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Buscaglia from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead with your question.
Andrew Buscaglia: Hey, good morning, guys. Just wanted to -- you're talking more about those 80-20 costs or transformation costs accelerating where like, specifically within each segment, in Pool in particular, are you finding this beneficial to one segment versus any other? And then if you could just talk more about details, maybe specifically for Pool in that regard?
John Stauch: Yes. I mean it has got the same math-based equation for every revenue stream we look at. I just want to start there. And it is roughly 4% to 5% of your revenue falls in that lower right quadrant, which is, again, the less-desirable products to the lesser desirable customers. It won't be any different. It is straight math, and it will be the same. It's harder for a Pool to execute on because they're Quadrant 4 reflective of their overall margins is a significantly higher margin than what we're seeing in some of the other businesses. So it gets a little bit more challenging to exit quickly because you fall in love with the fact that you still are making money in that quadrant in a business like Pool. The reality is that by serving that quadrant, you're taking away from your performance to your top customers, and you're taking away from your ability to produce new products and new sales and marketing programs around those top products. So it will have the same impact across the entire organization. I would say right now, Pool is a little bit more challenged in how to deal with Quadrant 4 and the other businesses who are in a lower profitability standpoint can move faster to eliminate Quad 4. Does that answer your question?
Andrew Buscaglia: Yes. Yes, very helpful. Okay. Yes, that's interesting. And then the -- your cash Flow was really strong this quarter and seemingly a little more profitability as we exit year. What are you thinking about in terms of capital allocation at this point? Has there anything changed there? Any thoughts on a buyback and/or M&A?
Robert Fishman: Yes. Again, very pleased with our free cash Flow generation in the quarter, over $500 million. What that's allowed us to do is pay down close to $300 million of debt in the first half of the year. We've been able to restart our share repurchases in the second quarter. And I'll also continue to pay the dividend. If you think back about when we closed the Manitowoc Ice acquisition back in July of 2022, our leverage was in the high 2s. We've now delevered down to 1.6x and created a lot of optionality for the company to drive shareholder value. So, paying down variable debt continues to make sense at the interest rates that we see continuing to offset dilution. But we'll obviously have a nice problem to have come the end of the year where we're below our target net debt to EBITDA. So again, lots of options around accelerating share repurchases or potentially bolt-on M&A.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nathan Jones from Stifel. Please go ahead with your question.
Nathan Jones: Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask a couple of questions on the 80-20 initiative. You guys -- one of the comments you made was you're going to focus on customer segmentation versus product segmentation. Can you just talk a little bit more about what goes into that decision, how it manifests itself at Pentair? Is it a little bit easier to focus on customers versus products? So just like what goes into that decision?
John Stauch: Yes, I appreciate the question. No, it's harder actually. And I think it's the right way to do it and the only way to really do 80-20 is because ultimately, your customers are determining what parts you're selling and why you're selling those parts. Nathan, we talked about, this usually self create your own complexity. I mean we did design and introduce all these parts. So we have to take accountability for that. But really, as Bob said, we're going to treat our customers fairly and basically differentiate how we serve them. And so not all our customers are buying quantities and not all our customers are buying the same levels of transportation and expectations. So it is harder. It takes longer because we have to have honest and fair and transparent pricing across the customer base. And then we have to work the rebates and the volume discounts accordingly, which takes time to work its way through. And that's what we're doing, and we're going to do it, obviously, legally and compliantly, but we're making sure that we notify everybody that at the end of the day, we can't give everybody the same on delivery. We can't give them the same volume purchases because it gets really complex to someone who's not buying the right quantities.
Nathan Jones: Makes sense. I guess next question, 80-20 typically will create some near-term headwinds to revenue. It may increase the revenue growth in the long term, but that quite for getting that Quad 4 out usually create some near-term headwinds to revenue, got FY '24 guidance that's flat to down a little bit. Should we start to think about a base case where the 2026 target that reached with lower revenue and higher margins and get to somewhere around the same point but with a different pathway than originally targeted?
John Stauch: I'll answer your question quickly. That is a possibility, Nathan. I don't know that yet, obviously. I mean we framed it, and I shared with you that in the near term of walking away from Quad 4 could be 4% to 5% total revenue. What we don't know yet is usually in any short-term period, there would be a little bit of a pullback, but you would get the cost out and therefore, the margin lift. What we would hope that this leads to though is a faster core growth rate because we're able to give the products and customer experiences to our top customers and grow greater than our historical growth rate. Bob and I don't know what that math looks like yet to go across the portfolio. I do think it increases our confidence level of what ROS could be. And certainly, we feel like this will be additive -- at the same time, you're probably not wrong on the fact that some of our dollar growth that we might have forecasted in 2026 could be lower.
Robert Fishman: Yes, I would agree with that. I think we end up with higher quality revenue, higher margin revenue. We remain fanatically focused on Quadrant 1, and we improve lead times, quality, on-time delivery. We have our best service teams working with our best customers. How can that not help drive growth in Quadrant 1. So our view overall is we end up net better on the top line and then continue to drive ROS expansion through reducing the costs and Quadrant 4.
Operator: Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.
Julian Mitchell: Hi. Good morning. Maybe just a first around some of the operating profit levers. So just to understand, I think it's $30 million a quarter of productivity savings in the second half. And then the assumption would be you've still got good transformation waves into next year plus the 80-20. So that $30 million a quarter run rate is a sort of reasonable placeholder starting out next year. I just wanted to check ahead that right. And sort of unrelated price net of inflation was a headwind to op profit year-on-year in Q2. Is that quantum of headwind expected to remain steady through the back half?
Robert Fishman: Yes. I would say I'll take the second one first. I mean at the turn year-to-date, we're slightly below price versus inflation. Prices read out around $40 million, inflation at $47 million. So inflation continues to be running a little higher than what we thought. I would say in the back half, our goal is to catch up and end the year, roughly speaking, price equaling inflation. On the run rate going into next year for transformation, too early to kind of give a calendarized view of that, but transformation will be significant next year in 2025 and certainly help us accelerate our ROS expansion goals.
Operator: Our next question comes from Damian Karas from UBS. Please go ahead with your question.
Damian Karas: Hey, good morning, everyone. Congrats on the transformation progress.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Damian Karas: So first, just a follow-up to some of your earlier comments on Pool, the business being up year-over-year for the first time in a few years, but underlying markets still kind of down for the rest of the year, which would kind of suggest like an extended 3-year down cycle more or less, I'm just curious, given channels being kind of more or less normalized now, what do you think a market recovery looks like for Pool presumably in 2025?
John Stauch: Yes, it's too early to tell yet. I do think I agree with all your earlier comments. It has been a 3-year cycle. And quite frankly, when you look point to point, it's one in which we don't yet agree that there's been any type of pull-in or anything related to COVID. We definitely think that we'll start seeing new Pool builds increase from this level as we head forward in '25 and beyond. And we're hoping to get more to that historical level, which would be just somewhere around 90,000 -- 80,000, 90,000 a year, kind of lead and aided by the interest rates starting to ease. I think overall, still pleased that we're growing year-over-year despite the challenges. And I think from this point forward, we think we're returning to growth.
Damian Karas: Okay. I appreciate your thoughts. And then you've called out the launch of your first commercial PFAS product as well as expansion of the existing PFAS product line. I know you haven't necessarily put a number around the PFAS opportunity. But maybe if you could just speak to that, would you say that's firmly in your mid-single-digit sales target over the medium term? Or is there maybe some upside there?
John Stauch: No, I think it helps. I think it's slightly in that. I mean, it's going to be in that mid-single digit. It gives customers a reason to want to continue to partner with us and our strong brand and our value propositions in the industry. We've been working hard to make sure that all of our food service-related customers understand the value of a high-quality water. And I think that segment of the market definitely understands it. But as we start to expand our Ice footprint and certainly expand our water drinking footprint. We want to make sure that all the other adjacencies also understand the value of a higher filtration capabilities. So we're very excited about the offering, and we're starting to make sure that we title that value proposition to the ones that aren't directly serving a customer who's coming in for a food-related drink or beverage. I think schools, institutions think about that as the backdrop.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Krill from Duetsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.
Andrew Krill : Hey, thanks. Good morning, everyone. I don't believe it's been touched obviously, but for 3Q and the guidance for sales down 2% to 3%, now you can help us with expectations by segment there for the sales growth, just I think the inflection from growth to being down that much as a little surprising, say maybe Water Solutions and Flow, kind of down that low single-digit area. And that Pool is really what's Flowing into the third quarter?
Robert Fishman: For Q3 and that down 2% to 3% guide, we expect Pool to be up slightly and for Flow and Water Solutions to be down slightly.
Andrew Krill : Great. Very helpful. And then for thinking of Pool margin in second quarter, were very impressive. Just do you expect that you can maintain that level of margin in the back half of the year? I know seasonally, they tend to trend a bit lower, but you have all the transformation savings coming through, trying to see how those two factors might offset each other? Thank you.
Robert Fishman: Yes. We do expect to have similar ROS expansion story for Pool in the back half of the year. So again, they're executing very well. They'll get some slight growth in the back half, and so we should be able to see, again, impressive ROS expansion story.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Graham from Seaport Research. Please go ahead with your question.
Scott Graham: Yes. Hey, good morning. Two questions, most of mine have been answered. On the price cost to catch up to sort of get the parity for the year. Do you have to increase prices anywhere to get there? Is that one two the math for the second half does that work to increase -- to get to par?
Robert Fishman: Yes. Again, a couple of points of price in the back half gets us very close to what we think inflation will read out. Again, remember, inflation is about $47 million at the turn. That's around 3% of the cost base. And so we think something similar will play out. Again, we're seeing inflation in the commodity space, the freight space. But overall, our goal, and we should be very close to price equaling inflation.
Scott Graham: At price plus 2%, I think you're saying yes?
Robert Fishman: That price running about 2%. That's right.
Scott Graham: Thank you. And the second question, it's an easy one. You used the wording we restarted share repurchases. I don't know what that means, more events that you just did some this quarter for the first time in a while. Is the second quarter share repurchase number, is that maybe a good number to use from here that maybe go higher?
Robert Fishman: We think for modeling purposes, it's a good number to use. Again, our stated goal is to offset dilution. So, $50 million a quarter is kind of what we've built into the overall guide for the balance of the year.
Operator: Our next session comes from Joe Giordano from Cowen. Please go ahead with your question.
Joseph Giordano: Hey, guys. Good morning. So just curious on the level of productivity you're getting in Pool, does that seem the calculus around like your desire on or like willingness to put volumes out in prebuy? I like are you willing to maybe give up a little bit of future price because of how much costs you're taking out of the organization and you know that you can keep margins on a good trajectory anyway. So just to give you more flexibility to like release more than you otherwise would have to protect volumes and maybe take some share?
John Stauch: Yes. I just want to make sure, I mean, early buy is done and it's just really more a the factory. Otherwise, we'd have all of our revenue in Q2 and Q3 and very little in Q3 and Q4 -- Q1 and Q4. So we make that decision as we head into the year based upon what level of revenue we're comfortable with to still maintain a decent profit level and also make sure that we can keep a consistent employment level. So that's how we make that decision. It's too early to make that call right now. And as the season approaches, that's the discussions we have with the Pool team.
Joseph Giordano: Fair enough. And then just on the PFAS solution here. I just want to clarify, is this like a secondary treatment. Like is this another product on top of like an ever pure that a commercial customer would have? Or is this kind of an integrated solution that's doing multiple -- removing multiple contaminants?
John Stauch: Yes. The answer is yes. That is an add-on to what we currently have.
Operator: And our next question is a follow-up from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your follow up.
Stephen Tusa: Hey, guys. Sorry. Just wanted to like touch on this whole inflation and pricing. It looked like the kind of the stack comp pricing in Pool went down sequentially. And I think as a follow-up to the other question, just wondering, could you just maybe delve into what was so inflationary for you guys? I mean like trying to disaggregate a sourcing benefit versus cost increases that would just be more basic in nature? Just wanted to maybe, I guess, just delve into what you're seeing by category and that inflation number? Like what's really driving that?
John Stauch: Yes. So Steve, we do have some suburb commodity inflation a couple of the raw materials that everybody is experiencing that is a little higher than our overall expectations. Also this year, labor inflation still remain high, especially in the core U.S. areas. Mexico being one of the areas that saw significant labor inflation. So those are the I say, the abnormal inflation in the year. As far as the pricing aspects, we do feel like when you look at it on a full year basis, it all levels out. But within periods, because we do give rebates to dealers, and we also give discounts to distributors, you could have a little bit of abnormality as you work through the quarters. But overall, it usually comes right in on the forecasted number.
Stephen Tusa: Okay, that's super helpful. Thanks a lot.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll be concluding today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference call back over to John Stauch, President and Chief Executive Officer for closing remarks.
John Stauch: Thank you for joining us. In closing, I want to reiterate our key themes. First, solid execution across our balanced water portfolio drove significant margin expansion for the ninth consecutive quarter. Second, we are increasing our 2024 ROS and adjusted EPS guidance, which reflects continued confidence in our strategy and our ability to mitigate risk where we can and maintain agility in a dynamic environment. Third, we effect our transformation and 80-20 initiatives to continue to drive strong margin expansion. And finally, we believe our focused water strategy and solid execution are building a foundation to continue to deliver value creation beyond the 2024 fiscal year. Thank you, everyone, and have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. We thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-04-23 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello and welcome to the Pentair First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the call to Shelly Hubbard, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Shelly Hubbard: Thank you, and welcome to Pentair's first quarter 2024 earnings conference call.

The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's performance in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results. Before we begin, let me remind you that during our presentation today, we will make forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Pentair. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors in our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call up for questions. Please note that we will limit your questions to two, after which we ask you to reenter the queue in order to allow everyone an opportunity to ask questions. Note that we have now published our Pentair investor overview on our IR website, which includes the overview slides we previously included in our quarterly earnings presentations. Please visit our Pentair investor relations website and click on Events and Presentations to find this new overview. I will now turn the call over to John.
John Stauch: Thank you, Shelly, and good morning, everyone. First, I want to thank all of you who attended our 2024 Investor Day in New York last month. We appreciate your time and your insightful questions as we dove deeper into the business and provided our path to 24% ROS by full year 2026 with the potential for upside. Now, let's begin with our strong Q1 results on slide four. The eighth consecutive quarter we continue to drive margin expansion. In Q1, ROS expanded 90 basis points despite sales being down slightly against peak channel inventory challenges in our residential segments. We exceeded our first quarter guidance as our Pentair teams drove solid execution across all three segments. In the first quarter, segment income and adjusted EPS also increased year-over-year. Our transformation initiatives remained on track to deliver margin expansion, as we highlighted at our recent Investor Day. Approximately 50% of our total revenue is adopted and implemented value-based pricing as part of our strategic pricing initiatives. We are well into wave two of our sourcing initiatives, which we expect to begin to drive benefits in the second half of this year, and we have continued to drive operational footprint optimization and plan to continue this going forward. And we have recently introduced 80/20 training to 50% of Pentair's revenue streams and have identified some quick wins and larger-term opportunities. Lastly, we are encouraged by signs that we are returning to a more normal operating environment for the first time in nearly four years. Both our lead times and our backlog have been normalizing and our order rate trend has been in line with our expectations. As we expect to return to a more normal operating environment we have seen a mix of trends across our residential, commercial and industrial verticals within our three segments. For example, in Flow, commercial and industrial verticals performed well in Q1, while higher interest rates continue to impact residential and agricultural verticals. Within Water Solutions, our commercial businesses servicing the foodservice and hospitality verticals performed as expected. We believe residential will improve as year-over-year challenges moderate. Lastly, in Pool, a majority of our revenue is in the Sunbelt states, with a focus on higher-end in-ground pools. In Q1, higher-end pools and the Sunbelt states remain resilient with the exception of California, where weather had a slight impact. From our recent dealer survey, remodeled pool projects appear to be increasing and services we surveyed were optimistic about the aftermarket. Let's turn to slide six. Last week, we published our 2023 Corporate Responsibility Report with an update on our progress. At our Investor Day last month, our leader of ESG and Sustainability, Karla Robertson, provided a preview of our 2023 results on this slide. I'm very proud of the work Karla and our sustainability team are doing and the progress our teams throughout the company are making against our strategic targets. Before I turn it over to Bob, let's turn to slide seven. We delivered another quarter of quality earnings with better-than-expected results. Our Investor Day key themes remain on track. Our 80/20 training and workshops are underway with what we believe are promising early readouts and we are reiterating our full year 2024 outlook while introducing strong Q2 guidance with an adjusted EPS midpoint up 13% as compared to the same period last year. All-in, we continue to build a strong foundation to drive long-term growth and profitability across our diverse water portfolio. I will now pass the call over to Bob, who will discuss our performance and financial results in more detail. Bob?
Bob Fishman: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Let's start on slide eight. With sales over $1 billion, we delivered another strong quarter of quality earnings. Return on sales or ROS expanded 90 basis points despite sales being down 1% versus last year's record Q1. Core sales were down 1% year-over-year, driven primarily by growth in Water Solutions, which was more than offset by slight decline in Flow and Pool. Sales across all three segments increased sequentially from Q4. Pool sales in Q1 exceeded Q4 2023 sales which in turn exceeded Q3 2023 sales as we had guided to last October. First quarter segment income increased 3% to $217 million and return on sales expanded 90 basis points year-over-year to 21.4%. These results were driven by favorable mix, price more than offsetting inflation as well as transformation. ROS improved sequentially from Q4 and approached the Q2 2023 record of 21.6%. We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.94, which exceeded our guidance and was up 3% year-over-year. As John previously mentioned, we are excited to be entering what we believe to be a more normal operating environment for the first time in nearly four years. Please turn to slide nine. Flow sales declined 2% year-over-year. Commercial sales growth of 9% and industrial sales growth of 2% were more than offset by a decline in residential sales of 12%. Our residential sales are more closely tied to the overall housing and agriculture market. Segment income grew 19% and return on sales expanded 350 basis points to 20.1% marking the first time ROS has reached or exceeded 20%. The strong margin expansion was a result of price and mix exceeding inflation and continued progress on our transformation initiatives. Please turn to slide 10. In Q1, Water Solution sales were up slightly to $273 million driven by commercial sales up approximately 1% and residential sales down approximately 1%. Segment income grew 6% to $56 million and return on sales expanded 110 basis points to 20.4%, driven primarily by favorable mix and transformation continuing to drive operational efficiencies. This is the eighth consecutive quarter of ROS expansion. Margins have nearly doubled from 10.8% in Q1 2022 to 20.4% in Q1 2024. Within our residential business in Water Solutions we have continued to see improvement in our year-over-year sales rate for the last five quarters. Within our commercial business in Water Solutions, both filtration and ice drove sales growth, which was offset by lower services revenue due to project life cycles. Please turn to slide eleven. In Q1, Pool sales declined 1% to $359 million. However, Q1 sales improved nearly 7% sequentially from Q4 2023, as expected. Segment income was $111 million down 5%, and return on sales decreased 110 basis points due to lower volume an increase in costs as we prepared for the peak Pool season in Q2 and investment in transformation. We expect Pool margins to expand each quarter year-on-year for the remainder of 2024. Please turn to slide 12. At our Investor Day in March, we updated our three year margin targets to reflect margin expansion through full year 2026, extending our plan by a year. With contributions from all four of our key transformation initiatives pricing, sourcing, operations, and organization we are targeting ROS to expand by 540 basis points to 24% as compared to full year 2022 and have the opportunity to do even better as we discussed during our Investor Day. In full year 2023, we achieved ROS of 20.8% and expect to continue to drive margin expansion to approximately 22% by year-end. Please turn to slide 13. This runway provides context of when we expect each wave to deliver margin expansion in our reported results. Note that we expect our transformation benefits to compound with each additional wave and the entire process to begin to repeat in 2027, creating a continuous cycle of ongoing savings. Please turn to slide 14. In Q1, we used $127 million in cash, which is consistent with the prior year quarter. Q1 is predominantly a cash use quarter and typically followed by strong cash generation in Q2, our seasonally highest quarter. Our net debt leverage ratio was 2.1 times, down from 2.6 times in Q1 a year ago. Our ROIC was 14%. We continue to target high teens return on invested capital. We plan to remain disciplined with our capital and continue to focus on debt reduction amid the higher interest rate environment along with share repurchases to offset dilution. With the net debt leverage ratio within our target range, we have additional flexibility to strategically allocate additional capital to areas with the highest shareholder returns. Moving to slide 15. For the full year, we are maintaining our adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.15 to $4.25 which is up roughly 12% at the midpoint. Also for the full year, we continue to expect sales to be up approximately 2% to 3% with Flow sales to be up approximately low single-digits, Water Solution sales to be approximately flat, and Pool sales to be approximately 7% for the full year. We also expect segment income to increase 8% to 11%. For the second quarter, we expect sales to be up approximately 1% to 2% compared to last year's record Q2. We expect strong growth in Pool sales in Q2 somewhat offset by challenging compares in our Water Solutions segment. We expect second quarter segment income to increase 10% to 12% with significant ROS expansion. We are also introducing strong adjusted EPS guidance for the second quarter of approximately a $1.15 to $1.17 up roughly 13% at the midpoint. I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for Q&A after which John will have a few closing remarks. Operator, please open the line for questions. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Mike Halloran with Baird. Please go ahead.
Michael Halloran: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the question. So two questions here. First one just how are you thinking about the end markets as you work through the rest of the year? I mean the overall topline guidance is really unchanged. So I guess the question is, are you seeing anything different today than you were thinking a few months back? And how are you thinking about the sequentials from here across your end markets?
John Stauch: So far, Mike, I would say things are playing out exactly like we thought and hoped for with the exception of maybe within our Flow segment, the Residential side and the Ag-side being a little weaker as we progress through the end of the year. Other than that, everything is generally in line with our previous expectations.
Michael Halloran: Thanks for that. And then on the Flow margins, awfully impressive and certainly seems a little different than I would have expected seasonally. So maybe some thoughts on how you think those margins sequentially work from here, in particular, anything in the first quarter that's not repeatable from a mix perspective or anything else? And is this just an example of the right foundation to build ROS with all the work you guys are doing internally?
Bob Fishman: It really is. On the Flow side, we were extremely pleased with the ROS expansion in Q1. And again, we've said that they will be one of the main beneficiaries of the transformation program. So I expect the segment to continue to expand their ROS year-on-year because a lot of the play there is around strategic sourcing, the pricing excellence, the operational footprint, and basically the complexity reduction play.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Brian Lee: Hey guys. Good morning. Kudos on the solid execution here.
John Stauch: Thank you
Brian Lee: I guess maybe as a follow-up to Mike's question. I mean, I think the most eye-catching metric was definitely the ROS and Flow, looks like both price cost and transformation benefits were driving a lot of this. I know it's a little bit lumpy if we look historically, but what is kind of the right run rate to think of in this segment coming off this 20% result in Q1? How much more, I guess, price cost or transformation or anything else you want to outline as we think about year-on-year improvements in ROS, just particularly for Flow?
John Stauch: Yes. I mean just to reiterate what Bob said, I think we've done a nice job of refocusing the business and driving transformation. One thing that really kind of helps is, if you think about Flow. There is a business inside of Flow. It's our sustainable gas business, which last year had several larger losing projects, and we've been able to right-size that business and bring those project executions back up to, let's call it, low single-digit margins. But we are getting a very favorable year-over-year comparison against those performance last year. So we do think this is a good starting point. And as we move through the year, we're going to continue to manage the mix and drive the transformation programs and really pleased with the Flow performance.
Brian Lee: Okay. Great. Helpful. And then second question, just when I look at Pool, again, I know quarter-to-quarter, this can kind of fluctuate, but productivity sort of reversed in Q1, 200 basis point headwind versus the tailwind. You saw last quarter, which was about the same 200 basis points. Is this all investment? Can you kind of break down or quantify how much it was this quarter? It seems like it might have been a big send quarter and should we expect this drag for a few more quarters or does ROS go right back up positive year-on-year? I know you're saying growth is sequentially better throughout the year. How about, I guess, margins in ROS, in Pool specifically, as we think about the cadence? Thanks guys.
Bob Fishman: Yes. In my prepared remarks, I did mention that ROS and Pool will increase year-on-year for the balance of the year. So comfortable that we'll see ROS expansion within the Pool business. I think Q1 was a little bit unusual and that the volume was declining, but we have significant growth in Q2. And so some of the costs, the ramp-up of cost to service the strong Q2, obviously put a damper on the margins in the first quarter. We also are continuing to invest to drive growth and transformation wasn't where we needed it to be within the Pool business. But those investments will pay off and further ROS expansion down the road. So again, comfortable with the ROS expansion in Pool, the remainder of the year. And again, as we ramp to significant growth in Q2, that will become a big manufacturing leverage play as well.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Damian Karas with UBS. Please go ahead.
Damian Karas: Hi. Good morning everyone.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Damian Karas: My first question is on the Pool business. You had mentioned in your slide that remodel inquiries are up. Could you give us a sense for how much are we talking here? Is that kind of across the board or was that also just like on the high-end side of the market? And is your expectation for remodels still kind of down low-single-digits for the year in your guidance?
John Stauch: Yes, to the second one. But we do feel there's some encouraging trends that will give us feeling that our dealers will start to take more orders, which would extend into '25 and '26. I think with all the new Pools being built, there probably wasn't as much attention being spent to getting the remodel sequenced and completed. And I think we're encouraged that we're now seeing that part of the market get some demand from our customers and again, this is primarily in the key Sunbelt states and more on aged Pools.
Damian Karas: Okay. That's encouraging to hear. And then could you just help us think about the Water Solutions and that 9% comp year-over-year. How are you thinking about the second quarter for the segment kind of both in terms of top line and segment margin?
Bob Fishman: From a top line perspective, it's important to remind everyone what a large quarter Q2 was last year, especially within the Ice business. So we do see a decline year-on-year within Water Solutions as they bump up against that tough compare. So think of the Ice business and services having a bit of a headwind and then the filtration business continuing to grow nicely.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Andrew Kaplowitz: Hey, guys. How are you?
John Stauch: Good. How are you?
Andrew Kaplowitz: Good. John and Bob, just maybe following up on Water Solutions. Look [indiscernible] guys hanging in there a little bit more than you would have thought. Obviously, comps are tough as you just talked about. I think your guidance for commercial water was up low-single-digits for this year. Is that still what it is? And then what happened in services? And would you expect that to sort of come back as the year goes up?
John Stauch: Yes, on Ice. I think Ice is going to play out right now the way we expected it to. And as a reminder, as Bob said, tough compare in Q2. But overall, I think it's going to come in line with our expectation. And still has resilience in the end industry, and we're feeling good about our filtration penetration, combined with that BU to drive it. We are going to dial our services business into more profitable annuity-based services as we exited some of the larger programs that we were doing with some of the large fast food companies and some of those were not very profitable, and we want to refocus the business into a simpler mix of service, more geared to the products that we install and so we will see that be a little lumpy throughout the year as well.
Andrew Kaplowitz: It's helpful guys. And then, Bob, are you still thinking $75 million in productivity this year even with the slower start in Pool and the $4 million in total in productivity for Q1?
Bob Fishman: Yes. Again, we were pleased with the transformation readout in Flow and Water Solutions, but it was offset somewhat by the negative productivity and Pool as we ramp up for Q2, still feeling very comfortable with the $75 million number and think of that as being fairly linear over the next three quarters.
Andrew Kaplowitz: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Steve Tusa: Hey, guys. Good morning.
John Stauch: Good morning Steve.
Bob Fishman: Hi, Steve.
Steve Tusa: Just a follow up to that bridge question for the year. Can you just update us on what you're thinking on price and then just the spread on price cost and price and inflation for the year?
John Stauch: Yes, I think we're still hopeful we can get price to offset cost. I mean we did see a little incremental inflation start to enter Q1 into Q2. I think it's primarily around what we'd call freight and probably specifically copper. So we're monitoring that, Steve. If needed, we would go back out and see what we could recover from a price standpoint. And our goal is to, for the full year, try to offset price and cost.
Steve Tusa: Okay. And 2%-ish price for the year. Is that still kind of in there or -- what you did 3% in the first quarter?
John Stauch: Yes. We're still in that 2% for price and think about 3% inflation on the cost base. Those two would roughly offset from a dollar perspective.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Bryan Blair with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Bryan Blair: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Solid start.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Bryan Blair: A quick follow-up on productivity and transformation read-through. You said step up somewhat ratable for the next three quarters to get to the $75 million. Given the moving parts of Q1 and divergence in segment contribution, how should we think about how that drop-through shakes out for the segments going forward?
John Stauch: We expect Pool to have a very significant contribution in Q2 given its rate of growth and the fact that we, as Bob mentioned, we had some incremental investments to get the product prepared to ship in Q2. And so think about that as labor being roughly flat from Q1 to Q2, but getting a lot more revenue in Q2. So that would be a huge contribution. Corporate is always a timing issue. Also, Bob didn't mention that, but we have higher corporate expenses that run in Q1 typical in the industry and so that usually comes down as it heads into Q2 as well. But I think the rate of contribution will be the same for the other segments and then we get the step-up in Pool.
Bryan Blair: Yes. I appreciate the detail. And I understand that debt reduction is the priority near term with regard to capital deployment. Although with your second quarter cash flow, suspect by June, July timeframe, you'll be under two times levered. Any color you can offer on your M&A pipeline and whether we may see any deal for the second half of this year, it's better to anticipate you get back to that growth lever in more 2025 timeframe?
Bob Fishman: I agree with the comment that the cash flow is providing strong optionality for us. What was interesting is we started the year thinking there would be three rate cuts. We've now built into our guidance of $100 million of interest expense, no rate cuts. So we think that's prudent. We were able to keep the interest expense the same as our previous guide, primarily because the free cash flow is happening earlier in the year. So we look forward to a strong Q2 in free cash flow. To your point, we're right within our target range. We think there continues to be a debt reduction play to help the EPS. We'll restart the share repurchases to offset dilution and then there remains optionality in terms of what drives the highest shareholder value.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Julian Mitchell: Hi. Good morning. Maybe just wanted to put a finer point on that second quarter sales guide. So in total, it's up one to two points year-on-year. Based on your comments, Bob, is it right to think about Waters may be down mid-single digits, Flow is flattish and then you've got Pool up 10% plus. Is that the right sort of framework for Q2 sales?
Bob Fishman: I would agree with those numbers, Julian.
Julian Mitchell: That's very helpful. Thank you. And then just my second question would really be around sort of the inventory situation. I think your own inventories are flattish sequentially in March, down a lot year-on-year. Maybe help us understand kind of how you're assessing inventories on the customer and channel partner level? And how do you assess your own sort of inventory rate versus kind of history for where we are in the year?
Bob Fishman: From our perspective, inventory from a days on hand is still significantly higher. We go back to 2019 and see each of the segments has room for improvement. That being said, year-on-year, we were down roughly 10 days from an inventory on hand perspective. So we're moving in the right direction. To bring down those inventories, the volume will certainly help in the second quarter, but we're not quite where we want it to be.
John Stauch: And then on the channel side, I think we're at normal levels. I think right now, we're working with our channel partners, and we're generally shipping through in the same quarter with being bought. So I feel like all that's behind us here in the Q2.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey Hammond: Hey, good morning guys.
Bob Fishman: Hey, Jeff.
John Stauch: Hi, Jeff.
Jeffrey Hammond: Just on Pool, I mean, John, you seem a little more confident in how things are shaping up, at least from the survey work. And I think you talked about kind of having these added costs to ramp. And so just wondering what it takes for you guys to kind of lift expectations there? And then just also any early read on the start of the Pool season here, I know weather was pretty disruptive last year.
John Stauch: Yes, Jeff, I appreciate the question. I mean just -- as a reminder, I mean, Pool markets are -- and sell-through on a normal market basis still be down mid-single-digits. So we're benefiting from those year-over-year easier compares as we ramp up and no longer have those inventory headwinds. And then I feel like we've got better insights and into the sell-throughs and the way that we now can work to get those shipments out in five days, where we're tying the shipments to the sell-through. So, yes, it does feel better and it feels like more normal, which is why we use the word normalized for a period of time. So I feel good about that. Interest rates are going to be pesky. And I think it's affecting the financing. It's affecting dealer financing and the sense of where they're getting their working capital loans from, it is going to continue to challenge the industry. And also, when interest rates are like this, we don't see movement from people selling their house and buying another house, which are what our business tends to like, the water doesn't taste the same and then you invest in a water filtration system. So Jeff, we could use those lower interest rates at some point to send a signal that things are going to be brighter. And I think that, that's what we're reflecting in the -- in our current hold of the full year forecast. And then we feel confident we have transformation and we have cost out initiatives to make up the gaps if we continue to see this be challenged as we head through the back half of the year.
Jeffrey Hammond: Okay. And then just -- Home Depot is buying kind of the number two player in Pool. And I'm just wondering if you think that drives any change in behavior or kind of tougher customer to kind of deal with any thought there?
John Stauch: I think this year, short-term, no. Clearly, the deal is going to take a while to complete. I mean I think all we can do right now is take Home Depot and SRS Heritage on their words and what they're saying right now is they expect to run that independently and continue to service the pro channel. And for now, that's the way we would see it unfolding and therefore not a short-term impact that we anticipate.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please go ahead. Mr. Jones your line is open.
Nathan Jones: Sorry. I take off mute. Good morning, everyone.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Nathan Jones: Question on Water Solutions. You talked about some verticals there that are expected to improve as year-over-year challenges moderate. Is there an expectation that demand is actually improving sequentially here? Is that just a comment that you run into some easier comparisons as the year goes by and those comparisons just get easier in the second half of the year?
John Stauch: From an overall end market perspective, I would say it's more the latter, Nathan, in terms of, we can't with interest rates the way they are and people not buying new homes get too much ahead of ourselves on the residential side. So pleased to see that the decline year-on-year is improving for the last four or five quarters. But again it's not as robust as we would like it to be.
Nathan Jones: Okay. And are you seeing any parts of those channels? I know we've talked a lot about the Pool inventory channel. Any parts of the channel at Water Solutions that might still be reducing their own inventory? I mean you guys have talked about reducing your inventory further. So potentially is there any destocking still continuing in any channel, whether it's Water Solutions or, I guess, across the portfolio?
John Stauch: Not that we're aware of, Nathan. I mean right now, we would say that sell-throughs matching sell-in generally across the industry.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Bob Fishman: Good morning.
Deane Dray: Can we circle back on the opening comments, you talked about that you're halfway through value-based pricing. Would love to hear some of the early read on the traction and whether any disruptions? And then I guess it's a related question, the same thing on 80/20. Just any success stories there? And any kind of product shakeouts, product lines that might be deemphasized? Any color there would be helpful. Thanks.
John Stauch: Yes. So we're doing a good job utilizing the pricing playbooks that we have and I'm really proud of the businesses utilizing those tools to affect outcomes strategically in their business. And again, this is just more strategic pricing and more thoughtful value-based pricing. That being said, I said this in Investor Day, and I have now gone through a full session of training. I kick myself for not having done 80/20 sooner. Because what we're learning from 80/20 is the complexity in the portfolio is all being treated equally. And what we need to do is think of our A parts or our top parts to our top customers getting differential treatment and that's where we can be more innovative. That's where we can spend our energies for sourcing and pricing effectively. And then we get like most companies, you get all the complexity that you introduced over time, either the secondary parts of those top customers or secondary parts to what you call the lower-end customers, that drive the complexity in the organization and drive too many resources where there's very little impact that you can have. I mean, Deane, I'll give you this. I mean, think about any regulatory change and thinking about how you treat that equally, it should really just be focused on your top parts to your top customers to your top regions, right? So we're going to get a lot of value from that. And I think it comes from the complexity reduction, but I think it's really more of a growth tool because it's going to allow us to double down and really focus our innovative efforts to the top products that we have into the top end markets that we have with our best customers.
Deane Dray: That's real helpful. I think we talked about it at the Analyst Day, it's less about cutting lines and it's more about optimizing growth. Is that right?
John Stauch: That is correct.
Deane Dray: All right. Good. And then just I've asked about this before because I just kind of the voice of the customer on the Pool side is, all this interest in automation, the extent to which you can automate testing and any sort of updates on the Pool chemicals and so forth, operation in the equipment? Just where does automation stand in terms of the take rate of your customers?
John Stauch: I mean it's still about where it used to be, Deane. And I think -- we think this year will be a higher level of penetration as people have time to think. And our dealers have time to get caught up and learn and then be more productive in how they help the end customers get what they need. I think we have to make it simpler and we have to take the complexity out of that portfolio as well. And then I think we also have to think about how do we bring the right value proposition for the overall pad and I think those two things will help us really change and accelerate that penetration rate.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Brett Linzey: Hey, good morning everybody.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Brett Linzey: Hey, I want to come back to Pool. So just some of the preordering activity received, has most of that shipped out in the fourth and first or do you have some feather into the second quarter, just try to think about any revenue visibility there?
John Stauch: It's strongly in the second, to be honest. I mean, it balances out between Q4 and Q1, but most of this is about servicing the Pool channel in the season, which will be Q2 and then adjusting within season, which would be Q3 for us.
Brett Linzey: Okay. And then just back to capital allocation, certainly, deals are episodic, but I guess at what point if deals aren't coming into view, do you lean a little bit heavier into repo? Is that an H2 event or do you think you assess M&A for the course of '24 and we should think of incremental repurchase as more of a '25 event?
John Stauch: Well, we're going to have strong cash flow in Q2, we expect, as we normally seasonally do. And then as Bob mentioned, I think our first step is we just got to reinstate buyback kind of to offset dilution and get that back as part of the capital allocation strategy. And then we're always looking at potential bolt-on M&A and pleased that we're at least seeing some things now and if we can transact them or get them over the finish line, that's yet to be determined. And we got valuations, we've got performance that has to be looked at. But ultimately, I think we're excited that we're at least looking at things again.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Andrew Buscaglia with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.
Andrew Buscaglia: Hi. Good morning, guys.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Bob Fishman: Good morning.
Andrew Buscaglia: I just wanted to check on the Flow side, you had mentioned resi weaker than expected of down about 12%. Can you just remind us what's behind that kind of what's driving that? And then any concerns that your markets are different, but that leads into other areas?
John Stauch: Two particular markets. It's water supply, water disposal. North America, which specifically is in ground well pumps and what you'd say is pivot spray irrigation. That's it. I think it was just clear to us within the quarter that it's not worth running any promos or specials or thinking about dealer stock outs that we really just have to understand that the market is going to be softer and work within that softer market to drive the transformation levers that we need.
Andrew Buscaglia: Yeah. And then on the topic of areas of weakness in resi outside of Flow, Pool sounds strong, but I guess.
John Stauch: Yeah, Pool has got the -- yeah, Pool has got the year-over-year inventory tailwinds, which are helpful, again, still mid-single-digits down and from a market perspective. And then residential water treatment saw severely -- severe jobs in their outlook last year. And so they're really more sequentially flat as they're moving throughout the year here, which if you said that's a sign of positive, they're not down substantially. But they're not seeing signs of improvement either as some of those higher-end systems require financing to move them.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Saree Boroditsky: Thanks for taking my questions. So you made the comment that was positive on remodels and aftermarket in Pool. Could you just update us on how you're thinking about new Pool construction for the year?
John Stauch: Right now, we're thinking about exactly the same as in our original guide. And it's down versus historical standards. But I think overall, from an industry perspective, we're working within that context and no update at this time.
Saree Boroditsky: And then guidance implies you realized about 50% of your earnings second half, but I guess I would have expected to be slightly higher given the Pool recovery and transformational benefits. So what's kind of the offset to that, that's driving second half earnings to be similar to the first half?
John Stauch: Yes. Again, we're pleased at the -- on our last earnings call, we talked about EPS being down slightly in the first half, and now we're at the point where it's roughly 50-50. So again, the strength of the first half is reading out. And we feel strongly that the momentum will continue in the second half that's in line with traditionally how the business is operated roughly 50-50.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Andrew Krill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Andrew Krill: Hey, thanks. Good morning everyone. Just wanted a quick follow-up on that EPS kind of seasonality question. I think it makes sense on the 50-50 split. Just wondering for 3Q versus 4Q, I think historically, those are somewhat similar. Should we be expecting that or is there any reason maybe it's a little more 4Q heavy as more of the transformation benefits flow through?
John Stauch: I think I would just say the normal cadence of our business would be generally the same or if not more skewed a little bit more to Q3 versus Q4. Most of our dealer trade businesses, which is 75% of what we do, don't see a very strong close to the year. Most people don't want them inside their homes or during the holidays. And then we don't have that normal industrial cycle where there's a push to ship everything by the end of the year. The things that will skew that is depending on what the Pool season is for the subsequent year and then that sometimes leads to stronger earlier shipments in Q4, and we have no idea what that's going to look like at this stage.
Andrew Krill: Okay. Great. Very helpful. And then a quick follow-up just on backlog, I know you're more of a book-and-ship business, but just a lot of costs -- of that kind of a more normalized cycle patterns, et cetera. Just is it reasonable to expect like the small backlog the segments have now you think are lower kind of exiting this year and that should be the more normal run rate into 2025? Thanks.
John Stauch: We would agree with that, that the majority is the shorter cycle and that backlog would be lower at the end of this year as the more normal operating conditions continue.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Scott Graham with Seaport Research. Please go ahead.
Scott Graham: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I have two of them. The first one is on strategic pricing, maybe a little bit more finer to the point, with the pricing guide that you've given -- that you gave on the call here earlier, suggests a little bit of a bleed off in pricing for the rest of the year, notwithstanding if you increase prices, of course, what is strategic pricing due to the pricing number? In other words, let's say that bleeds off to 2% for the balance of the year. Does that sustain 2% into next year, the pricing initiatives?
John Stauch: Yes. Strategic pricing would do two things. First of all, it helps you have confidence that the price you set is the right value that you should expect, meaning you looked at the features and you priced accordingly. The second thing it allows you to do is hold firmer on your rebate structures. So that's usually where the net pricing benefit comes on. So there's list pricing, which is usually higher. And then what did you net or what did you realize I don't know if we have next year's dialed in yet, but we usually drive it to be, as Bob said, price offsetting cost. And when we take a look at material inflation and costs, we're going to try to drive enough pricing actions to at least be neutral along those two elements.
Scott Graham: Okay. Thank you. My follow-up is around margin guide. I know 22%. It's just -- the first quarter was really strong margin quarter and you had no -- really no benefit from volume, you had a little bit of benefit from mix, but it wasn't necessarily in Pool, right? So the rest of the year, you have building strategic savings, the transformation, you have a building mix in Pool, which is could be material with volumes. I'm just sort of wondering if 22% -- just seems like you should be able to get there fairly easily. Are you thinking higher than that potentially?
Bob Fishman: I would start by saying the midpoint of our guide does suggest that we're slightly higher than the 22%. And overall, for the reasons you mentioned, there's potential upside on that ROS expansion. So I like the idea that price is going to offset inflation, transformation then drive that ROS expansion. And then mix can play in it plus or minus. We got -- we saw some favorable mix in Q1, but having a slightly lower Ice business, that's a profitable business as an example. So price offsetting inflation, factoring in mix and then transformation potentially reading out better could drive an improved ROS expansion story.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Joseph Giordano: Hey, good morning, guys.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Bob Fishman: Good morning.
Joseph Giordano: I think most questions have largely been asked already. But just kind of curious like bigger picture, EPA comes out with regulations on PFAS. This is something that you guys were thinking about doing like potentially like an in-home product. I'm just curious how those kind of strategies, kind of how you weigh those against kind of the 80/20 and the simplicity and wanting to focus on things that you know have a real market? And how does that dynamic play out in your thought process for thinking about that?
John Stauch: I think it's a great question. I think 80/20 helps optimize the current revenue streams you have, but it also needs to apply to your focus on what you think you can do to make a larger impact in the future and I think we're getting better at choosing fewer, more impactful innovation projects. And I'm still behind what we're doing with the whole home system that we're working on. And I do believe that there's a strong progress around that and the more awareness we get in water and homes, and the more people are concerned about what they're consuming and drinking, I think that's better for us. The reason I don't get all pounding the table on the movements on the regulatory side is we just don't see people running out right now to buy the current products that we have that actually create or solve the problems today. So there has to be something else that occurs to get the consumer focused. And as you look at the longer term, I think we're very energetic. I think the shorter term, we're less optimistic that we're going to see a shorter-term impact.
Joseph Giordano: Fair enough. Thanks guys.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Today's final question is a follow-up from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Steve Tusa: Hey, guys. Sorry. Just one last quick one. On the 2Q, do we just assume that basically that entire, call it, I don't know, $25 million to $30 million that's effectively from the transformation for the 2Q?
Bob Fishman: Yes. In terms of reading out, we've captured $4 million of the $75 million. And then -- our view is that the remaining $70 million is fairly linear over the next three quarters.
Steve Tusa: Right. So that basically accounts for all the year-over-year profit improvement like roughly for the second quarter?
John Stauch: Yes. With Pools incremental volume growth being offset a little bit by the year-over-year impacts in Water Solutions, but you're not far off.
Steve Tusa: Yeah. All right. Cool. Thanks guys.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Bob Fishman: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to John Stauch for closing remarks.
John Stauch: Thank you for joining us. In closing, I want to reiterate our key themes. First, solid execution across our balanced water portfolio drove significant margin expansion for the eighth consecutive quarter. Second, we are reiterating our full year 2024 guidance which reflects confidence in our strategy while continuing to monitor uncertainty across the macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape. We are mitigating risk where we can and being more agile as we expect to achieve new performance records in 2024 and drive long-term shareholder value. Third, we are pleased with our progress on our transformation initiatives, which we expect to continue to drive strong margin expansion. And finally, we expect to continue to deliver value creation beyond the 2024 fiscal year. Thank you, everyone, and have a great day.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.

Similar to previous quarters in 2023, we have included Slides 4 through 7 in our earnings slide deck, which provide a brief overview of Pentair as well as our investment thesis. I will now turn the call over to John.
John Stauch: Thank you, Shelley, and good morning, everyone. Our record performance in 2023 demonstrates the power of our balanced water portfolio and our focused growth strategy post the separation of nVent. We completed year one with our three-segment structure, Flow, Water Solutions, and Pool, and we finished our first full year with Manitowoc Ice.  Our Flow segment, which moves water where it's needed and removes water where it's not wanted, along with our Water Solutions segment, which improves water, both posted a record year for sales and ROS; and our Pool segment, which enables people to enjoy water, delivered record ROS despite significant volume headwinds.  I'm extremely proud of our approximately 10,500 global employees for their solid execution in a challenging macroeconomic environment. As we enter 2024, we are leveraging our balanced portfolio for continued growth and profitability with expectations for new records of financial performance. Additionally, we look forward to sharing more about our strategy and three-year outlook at our Investor Day on March 6th.  Now, let's begin with our Executive Summary, Q4 2023 on Slide 8. We finished Q4 with record performance in a fourth quarter post the separation of nVent in 2018, specifically record segment income and ROS, marking the seventh consecutive quarter of ROS expansion. This is important to note with strong comparables in Q4 2022. In the fourth quarter, sales were down 2%, which included slightly better than expected Pool performance. Segment income increased 8% and ROS expanded by 190 basis points. Adjusted EPS was $0.87, up 6%, and we generated $97 million of free cash flow in the quarter. Let's move to Slide 9, titled Executive Summary Full Year ’23. 2023 was a record year for segment income, ROS, and adjusted EPS, post the nVent separation, as previously mentioned, despite sales ending the year flat. In full year ’23, we delivered sales of $4.1 billion; record segment income of $855 million, up 11%; record annual ROS of 20.8%, expanding 220 basis points; and record adjusted EPS of $3.75. Flow and Water Solutions set new sales records in 2023, and we delivered significant margin expansion across all three segments, setting a new annual record ROS for each. Transformation and solid execution across all three segments continue to drive operational efficiencies throughout the year. Lastly, we generated significant free cash flow of $550 million and increased our dividend for the 48th consecutive year, further solidifying our status as a dividend aristocrat.  Let's turn to Slide 10, titled Balanced Water Portfolio. We are helping the world sustainably move, improve, and enjoy water through our three segments, each with over $1 billion in sales in 2023, and together creating a balanced water portfolio. Our strategy is working, and we have been delivering on the expectations that we have shared with you.  I will now pass the call over to Bob, who will discuss our performance and financial results in more detail. Bob?
Bob Fishman: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 11, titled Q4 2023 Pentair Performance. I will also be discussing our Full Year Performance on Slide 12. We delivered another strong quarter of earnings and significant margin expansion, despite sales being down 2% year-over-year. Volume continued to improve sequentially, with substantial progress in Q4 as compared to Q2 and Q3, driven primarily by improvement in Pool volume.  Sales for Q4 were down 2%, which was slightly better than we guided. Core sales across all three segments were down slightly, as compared to last year's record Q4, when our lead times began to improve from a recovering global supply chain, enabling us to ship more backlog orders. As we move into 2024, we expect to see a more normalized operating environment.  Fourth quarter segment income increased 8% to $198 million, and return on sales expanded 190 basis points year-over-year to 20.1%. This improvement was driven primarily by our Transformation initiatives. Adjusted EPS of $0.87 was up 6% versus the prior year. For the full year, sales were flat at $4.1 billion, with core sales down 5%, driven by growth in Flow and Water Solutions, which were offset by lower Pool volumes. Segment income grew 11% and return on sales expanded 220 basis points to a record 20.8%. All three segments significantly expanded margins and set new records. Adjusted EPS increased to a record $3.75.  Turning to Slide 13, labeled Flow at a Glance, you can see the impressive five-year financial performance. Sales rose over 4% compounded annually and margin expanded 300 basis points since 2019. In 2023, Flow continued to reach new records in sales and ROS. We have also provided a sales view by region, channel and solution reflecting 2023 sales and the diversified nature of the business. We have eight iconic brands, some over 100 years old, and we rank first in quality, technical support and customer service. Please turn to Slide 14, labeled Q4 2023 Flow Performance. In addition to the fourth quarter performance for Flow, I will also be referencing the full year performance on Slide 15. Note that we have recently renamed our Industrial & Flow Technologies segment to Flow. In Q4, Flow grew sales 1% in the quarter to $379 million, a record fourth quarter. Industrial solutions was up 9% and commercial was up 2% with residential down 7%.  Segment income was flat and return on sales decreased 20 basis points to 17.2% due to a return to more normal seasonality following a record Q4 2022 and an unfavorable mix from our residential business. For the year, Flow sales increased 5% to $1.58 billion primarily due to double digit growth in commercial and industrial solutions. Residential was down 4% showing improvement sequentially from Q3. Full year segment income grew 17% and return on sales increased 170 basis points to 17.8%, a record margin for Flow driven by Transformation and price more than offsetting inflation.  Turning to Slide 16, titled Water Solutions at a Glance, you can see the strong five year financial record with a compounded annual sales growth rate of 17% and over 400 basis points margin expansion since 2019. Our iconic brands include Everpure and Manitowoc Ice. Our residential Water Solutions products have helped reduce the need for 7 billion single use water bottles in 2023.  Please turn to Slide 17, labeled Q4 2023 Water Solutions Performance. In addition to the fourth quarter performance for Water Solutions, I will also be referencing the full year performance on Slide 18. In Q4, Water Solution sales decreased 5% to $270 million following a record Q4 2022. Commercial sales were down 4% primarily due to the timing of projects within our services business, partially offset by growth in Manitowoc Ice and filtration.  In residential, Q4 sales were down 6% but reflect significant improvements sequentially from Q3 of this year in which residential sales were down 14%. Segment income grew 15% to $52 million and return on sales expanded 320 basis points to 19.1%, a new Q4 record driven primarily by productivity from our Transformation initiatives and Manitowoc Ice.  For the year, Water Solution sales grew 19%. Segment income grew 66% and return on sales increased 590 basis points to 21%, a new full year record. Commercial sales increased 54% driven by the acquisition of Manitowoc Ice and growth in filtration. Manitowoc Ice had a record sales year with growth of 23% versus the prior year.  Please turn to slide S9 titled Pool at a Glance. Looking at the five-year financial performance, Pool was able to grow the top-line significantly and increase margins to a record 31% or up 320 basis points since 2019. Our Pool business benefits from a very large installed base with roughly 80% of sales coming from remodel and break and fix.  Please turn to Slide 20 labeled Q4 2023 Pool Performance. In addition to the fourth quarter performance for Pool, I'll also be referencing the full year performance on Slide 21. In Q4, Pool sales declined 2% to $336 million driven by a six-point drop in volume which was partially offset by four points of price. Note that volume improved significantly compared to the 28-point decline in Pool volume in Q3. For the year, Pool sales were down 18%, segment income decreased 10%, and return on sales increased 270 basis points to 31% driven by price and our Transformation initiatives.  Please turn to Slide 22 labeled Transformation Initiatives. Similar to last quarter, we believe this slide provides a good illustration of our Transformation initiatives and our ultimate goal of driving margin expansion. We have been targeting ROS of approximately 23% by the end of fiscal 2025, expanding margins over 400 basis points as compared to fiscal 2022. In 2023, we delivered ROS of 20.8% as Transformation began to read out in Q3 and Q4, and we expect to deliver roughly 22% by the end of full year ’24, which we believe puts us on track with our Transformation initiatives. Please turn to Slide 23 labeled Transformation Runway. We have kept this slide as a reference to illustrate the staggered nature of each of the four initiatives and the various stages of each. We are pleased to note that we believe we are executing well on these initiatives going into 2024.  Please turn to Slide 24 labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. In Q4, we generated $97 million in free cash flow, up nearly 100% year-over-year, reflecting another strong quarter. For the year, our free cash flow was $550 million, up nearly 94% year-over-year. Our net debt leverage ratio was 2.0 times, down from 2.6 times in Q1. Our total debt was less than $2 billion, and the average interest rate was approximately 5.2%.  Our ROIC was 14.3%, which includes the full impact from the Manitowoc Ice acquisition. With the focus on being good stewards of capital, we continue to target high teens ROIC. We plan to remain disciplined with our capital and continue to focus on debt reduction amid the higher interest rate environment with the potential for share buybacks.  Moving to Slide 15 titled Q1 and Full Year 2024 Pentair Outlook. For the full year, we are introducing our adjusted EPS guidance of approximately $4.15 to $4.25, which represents a year-over-year range of up 11% to up 13%. We expect total Pentair sales in fiscal 2024 to be approximately $4.2 billion or up about 2% to 3%. We expect Flow sales to be up low-single digits reflecting low to mid-single digit growth in our commercial and industrial businesses offset slightly by a low-single digit decline in residential.  Water Solution sales are expected to be essentially flat, comping record 2023 performance driven by our commercial water business. Commercial sales in full year 2024 are expected to be up low-single digits and residential to be down low to mid-single digits. Pool sales are expected to increase approximately 7% in full year 2024 which aligns the historical compound annual growth rates of mid-single digits pre-pandemic.  We expect Pool sales to increase driven primarily by inventory headwinds in 2023 that we do not expect to repeat in 2024 and some benefit of price. We expect this growth to be slightly offset by the uncertainty that still exists regarding the macroeconomic environment, higher interest rates, the potential impact of financing for new and remodeled pools and potential repair deferrals in the aftermarket. We believe Pool remains a highly attractive market for us and we look to deliver strong growth in 2024 while being mindful of macroeconomic dynamics.  We expect segment income to increase approximately 10% with ROS expansion of roughly 150 basis points. Also for the full year we expect corporate expense of approximately $95 million, net interest expense of roughly $100 million, an adjusted tax rate of approximately 16.5% which is inclusive of changes in the global tax standards for a total impact to Pentair of about $0.07 per share and a share count of approximately 166 million to 167 million. Lastly, we expect to deliver approximately $1 billion in EBITDA in full year 2024, a milestone we are very proud of. For the first quarter, we expect sales to be down approximately 2% to 3%. As a reminder, many of our businesses were working down large backlogs in Q1 last year as supply chains improved and we were able to ship more backlog orders, in 2024 we expect more normalized seasonality in our businesses.  We expect first quarter segment income to be flat to down 3% primarily due to lower sales with corporate expense of approximately $25 million, net interest expense of roughly $29 million, an adjusted tax rate of approximately 16.5% and a share count of approximately 167 million. We expect Q1 to drive ROS expansion both sequentially and year-on-year. We are also introducing adjusted EPS guidance for the first quarter of approximately $0.88 to $0.91.  For the first time since 2020, we believe we are seeing a return to a more normalized operating environment globally. Thus we expect to see seasonality resume to historical norms across all three of our segments in 2024 with Transformation driving margin expansion. In the first half of 2024 we expect adjusted EPS to be slightly less than 50% of our full year adjusted EPS guide. Q1 is expected to be the lowest quarter for sales, segment income, ROS and adjusted EPS as compared to the remaining three quarters in full year ’24. We have continued to accelerate transformation funnels and remain focused on investing in the long-term growth of our company.  Turning to Slide 16 titled 2023 Reflection, our business continued to execute well and delivered what we said we would do. We drove margins as a result of our balanced water portfolio and Transformation initiatives. Manitowoc Ice posted a record year exceeding expectations. We drove performance accountability across the organization, ended the year with an even stronger balance sheet and free cash flow and maintained a disciplined capital allocation strategy. We believe we are well positioned going into full year ’24.  I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for Q&A, after which John will have a few closing remarks. Drew, please open the line for questions. Thank you.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. In the interest of time we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. This is Grace on for Brian. First question on margin, kudos on the margin executions. Just a quick question on the margin expansion trajectory here, so if I do a math correct here, your full year guide implies 140 basis point expansion while your 1Q guide implies 20 basis points at the midpoint. So how should we think about the margin expansion trajectory moving the year and which segment should we see the most margin expansion? Thanks. 
John Stauch: Yeah, let me just take the first part and I will hand it to Bob. I just want to remind everybody that last year's Pool inventory correction didn't happen fully until Q2. So we are up against one more quarter of Pool compare from a Q1 perspective. And if you actually look at the performance exiting Q4 and compare it to our Q1 guide, you will see that the continued operating performance is there. And the last point I will just make before handing over to Bob is our Q1 EPS guidance is back to our normal seasonality as a percentage of the overall full year. So what you're really seeing is a reflection that we're back to our normal seasonality contribution and therefore the year-over-year compares are harder one last time in Q1. So, Bob?
Bob Fishman: Yeah, I would agree with your numbers. So ROS expansion will continue in the first quarter as we drive approximately 150 basis points of ROS expansion for the full year and as you'd expect, with Q2 being our largest quarter, the ROS expansion will be significant in Q2 and will also play out well as we close out the year in Q3 and Q4. 
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you. And then my second question is more on Pool. So you're up 7% year-over-year. That's about like $90 millions of revenue incremental. I think I believe you talked about like the destocking was about $150 millions in ’23. So I’d assume that delta is driven by, you’re cautious around you called out like uncertainty in the macro, higher interest rate. Is that correct? And second, its how much visibility do you have on that 7% growth? And can you talk about like the early buy activity? Is that -- does that give you enough confidence to guide 7% year-over-year growth? 
John Stauch: That's two questions with a lot of subparts. But let me see if I can summarize it. I mean, first of all, we have given two numbers on the inventory piece. We've given $150 million and $120 million. I just want to remind everybody it's about a $150 million for Pentair from the end of Q1 to the end of Q4 2023. On a year-over-year basis, it's actually closer to $120 million, which is, you know, then if you think about exactly what you're saying, you take our reported sales, add the $120 million, you'll get to the conclusion that price and volume is down.  And I think that reflects several factors. One is that we expect new Pool builds to decline only modestly but then we are not so sure what's going to happen with remodeled pools. And we're also expecting some level of discretionary purchases in the aftermarket in the first half for sure, as people are maybe a little more cautionary, depending on where the interest rates are. Net-net, it's still a fundamentally good growth rate for us as we set up the year. And we're expecting really good conversion of ROS on that contribution.
Operator: The next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Julian Mitchell: Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to circle back to the sort of profit bridge numbers and maybe looking at Slide 12, to try and understand what's embedded for 2024. Any help you could give us around the sort of that inflation bucket, what you're dialing in, it was that sort of $190 million number in ’23. And when we look at productivity, very good exit rates in terms of, $30 million or so tailwind in Q4. How are we thinking about that number for full year ’24 as well, please? So, yeah, inflation and productivity, any finer points on the guide assumption? 
Bob Fishman: Yeah, I understand. Thank you for the question, Julian. So as we look at 2024 in the context of the walks, we're thinking that price will offset inflation. So think roughly two points of price offsetting inflation. That would mean that in order to grow to the midpoint of our guidance, we'll have, roughly $40 million of volume. That $40 million is compared to the negative $460 million that we saw in 2023. So when we talk about moving to a more normalized environment, we are very pleased that the challenging years are behind us and we can start to grow. That's really how you bridge the revenue piece.  When you move over to segment income, the price of, call it two points, will offset inflation, will get some drop through, call it in the 30% range of that $40 million of income. And that leaves you with roughly $75 million of Transformation to drive the 150 basis points of ROS expansion. That $75 million compares to the $67 million that we did in 2023, but it also includes us making investments back into the business. So as we drive innovation in places like commercial water and Flow and Pool, as we look to drive opportunities to improve and make life easier for our dealers and distributors, that's all included in that net $75 million number. And that's the bridge that would take you from the $855 million of income in 2023 to the midpoint guide of around $940 million. I hope that's helpful.
Julian Mitchell: That's extremely helpful. Thank you. And maybe just a quick follow up on the top-line outlook. So you start out Q1 down a couple of points, the full year is up a couple of points, how are you thinking about the sort of rate of improvement in that year-on-year sales line through the year? Is it just each quarter year-on-year gets slightly better? And is that true across all three segments kind of moving in a synchronized wave from down slightly to up slightly? Any clarity on that, please?
Bob Fishman: Yeah, that's really how we do view it. We expect growth to return in Q2. Again, Q2 is historically our largest quarter. We had a big Q2 in 2023, but we still expect growth and then we continue to grow in Q3 and Q4. 
Operator: The next question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Nathan Jones : Good morning, everyone.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Nathan Jones: Let me start with a follow up on the Transformation initiatives. I think you guys have some pretty good visibility to the savings that you're going to generate over the next more than one year, two, three, maybe even four years. Can you talk about the linearity of savings realization there out of Transformation? Kind of when do those savings peak and start to level off? Just any color you can give us on the longer term outlook?
Bob Fishman: Yeah, we're pleased with what we're seeing in terms of Transformation reading out. It was $29 million in both Q3 and Q4 of 2023. And as I just mentioned, we're looking at roughly a net $75 million number in 2024. When we look at the funnel, we would expect those type of Transformation numbers to continue over the next couple of years. We think the funnel supports the various waves, whether it's pricing, sourcing, the operations or the org excellence. So we think it's going to create runway for us over the next couple of years, for sure. 
Nathan Jones: And then I guess my follow up on the water quality business. I think Manitowoc burnt some backlog off that it had built up during supply chain challenges. Is it possible to quantify the tailwind that was there in 2023 and maybe is a bit of a headwind in 2024? And then what the underlying expectations are for growth for Manitowoc Ice in 2024 and beyond?
John Stauch: Yeah, let me just give some color and I'll let Bob close out. I think we enter 2024, especially in the Q1 phase with much more normalized backlog levels. We still grew nicely in Q4 Manitowoc and we expect to grow again in Q1. So I think we're at normal levels. Just as a reminder, this business was only taking 60 days to 75 days of orders. So the backlog was more relative to what the nearer term dynamics were, Nathan, not some level of large backlog that wouldn't be used in the future.  So obviously we had a great 2023. This business contributed nicely to overall Water Solutions and overall Pentair and we couldn't be more pleased where we are. And 2024 is more about getting the filtration synergies lined up along with the Manitowoc Ice acquisition. They're the same business unit and when we gave the numbers of what we expected this business to achieve in the longer term of 2025, it was inclusive of those revenue synergies on both the services side and the filtration side. So very pleased where we are and very excited about the contribution we'll see in 2024 and beyond.
Bob Fishman: Yeah, I would just add that historically Ice is a mid-single digit grower. When we look back at the CAGR, that's historically what they've grown. The 23% increase in 2023 included some nice wins in China and working down the backlog. So as we look to 2024, we would expect that business to take a little bit of a breather down mid-single digits. But good news is that the business unit commercial water will actually grow low-single digits. So you're seeing some benefit of filtration business as well as some of the synergies coming from the Ice acquisition but being captured within services and filtration. So overall could not be more pleased with how Ice is performing and continue to, once we get through 2024, be back on that mid-single digit type trajectory.
Operator: The next question comes from Mike Halloran with Baird. Please go ahead.
Mike Halloran: Thanks everyone, morning. 
John Stauch: Good morning.
Mike Halloran : Can we just continue on the water solution side and round out the residential piece? Easy comps, still expecting some pressure, I'm guessing the cadencing improves through the year but any context on that piece would be helpful?
John Stauch: Yeah, there is easier comps but it's also the most global of the businesses inside that portfolio, Mike, so we're balancing off Europe, China and North America and while the comps are easier in North America, we do expect some return to growth. We're not yet seeing the interest rate environment propel new housing starts and/or a lot more movements which is usually key indicators to drive that business. But we're at levels now where we're definitely growing off of these compares in North America but we're anticipating a little bit more choppier outcomes in China and Europe in that business. So net-net probably slightly down but getting closer to flat. 
Mike Halloran : No, makes sense. Appreciate that. And then quick clarification on something you said earlier, John. The expectation was for volume and price to be down. I'm assuming you mean that on a net basis and pricing is slightly up and volume is the majority of the downside? I just wanted to clarify.
John Stauch: That's correct. On Pool --
Mike Halloran : On the Pool?
John Stauch: You expect a net price benefit and a contribution in line with the way that Bob shared it across the total Pentair portfolio and the offsets to that would be the volume which would be the market challenges.
Mike Halloran : That's what I figured but figured out to clarify. I appreciate it everyone. Thank you.
John Stauch: Thank you. Appreciate it.
Operator: The next question comes from Scott Graham with Seaport Research. Please go ahead.
Scott Graham: Hey, and good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Just on two quickly -- the fourth quarter price cost on the order side. I was just kind of wondering what happened there. But it looks like there was some slippage. And did that reverse, maybe in the first quarter or second quarter of this year?
John Stauch: Yeah, so I'm a couple dynamics there. I mean, just as a reminder, price in Q4 does also reflect on some of our early buy. So it's not the largest contribution to price in the quarter. Absent that, we were pretty much signaling that we would get closer to price offsetting cost versus having benefited substantially from price being much higher than cost in the first half of the year. So it came in line with expectations. And I think as you head forward, it's probably going to be a little bit better. As Bob said, we now expect it to be offsetting throughout 2024.
Operator: The next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBank Capital Markets, Inc. Please go ahead.
Jeff Hammond : Hey, good morning, everyone. 
John Stauch: Good morning.
Bob Fishman: Morning.
Jeff Hammond : So just on the early buy, I think there was some question on, kind of how you're going to spread it for 1Q and just wondering, if you have more to go in 1Q? And then just I'm kind of the, maybe just speak to break fix kind of how you're thinking about that market within the guide? 
Bob Fishman: Yeah, early buy came back to more normal levels in the fourth quarter. But again, as we typically do that, that gets spread between Q4 and Q1. So in line with historically how it's done, in fact, the early buy component in terms of shipment in Q4 was probably a little bit less than historically what we've done.
John Stauch: Yeah, and on the break fix, Jeff, I will concede that we probably have what I'd call a more cautious outlook, I would not call it conservatism, I call it more realistic. And we just don't know how the interest rate environment is going to affect the consumer being more thoughtful on what's discretionary, not discretionary on the pad. Clearly, we expect products like pumps and filters to be replaced as needed to keep the pool running. But some of your heaters, especially on the high end and/or some of your lighting could see some consumer discretion push those off a quarter or two.  That's just our outlook. I don't say that that's right. I think it's better to take that slant and maybe err to the fact that if that doesn't happen, we're going to see, a higher level of growth versus taking a more optimistic view and then having to reset the guide again to the lower end in Pool. So I would be very clear, I don't know. It's just what we have in our particular view.
Operator: The next question comes from Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Brett Linzey: Hey, good morning all.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Bob Fishman: Morning.
Brett Linzey: I wanted to come back to the capital allocation priorities. You noted the continued deleveraging path, but also the potential for share repurchase. I guess what would be the gating factor there to drive that decision and what would be the optimal leverage you'd be willing to flex for repurchases?
Bob Fishman: Yeah, based into the assumptions that we gave, the $100 million of interest expense and the share count, we have assumed share buyback resumes to offset dilution. So typically, Q1 is a negative free cash flow quarter, but we would also start a share buyback later in the year, is what's based into our assumptions currently. 
John Stauch: And again, that's just to offset dilution at the moment. I think where we're at from a debt to EBITDA is prudent. I think at these particular interest rate levels, I think the focus still is on debt reduction. And the way we're going to look at incremental buyback or M&A is what long-term value does it create for the share owner and therefore which one's the best course of action.
Brett Linzey: Got it. And then just want to circle back on the $75 million of Transformation that's planned this year. Curious how that feathers across the individual segments as we model ’24? And is this primarily from the Wave 1 measures and actions taken last year, or are you doing more on the operational side in 2024?
Bob Fishman: It's primarily the Wave 1 on the sourcing side. Again, just as a reminder, Wave 1 last year looked at electronics, motors, maintenance, repair and operations, packaging, logistics. So we're at the point where that'll start making its way into the P&L and very early stages of Wave 2. Wave 2 looked at metals, moldings, resins, ocean raid and purchase finished goods. So I think we've got a nice cadence there of the Wave 1 reading out in 2024 and Wave 2 will straddle ’24 and ’25. We'll also start to see some benefits from both the pricing excellence and the operations. On the pricing excellence, we've now rolled the strategic playbook out to almost all of the different categories and [TMs]. So again, good cadence there from a Transformation perspective.
John Stauch: You know, Brett, we've got to leave some information for Analyst Day to make sure everybody attends, comes and listens to us. And we'll go in a lot more detail as to how we see all of those Waves working and connected to what the segment expectations will be as well. 
Operator: The next question comes from Andrew Krill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Andrew Krill: Hey, thanks. Good morning, everyone. I just want to go back to pricing. I know you said about two points net for the company, but just wondering, do any of the three segments benefit more or less relative to that 2%? And are these pricing increases basically already put through or does it require more pricing on kind of mid-year or at some point in the year? Thanks. 
John Stauch: It doesn't vary greatly across the segments as far as the expectation. And yes, they are all announced and implemented at this stage.
Operator: The next question comes from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Joe Giordano: Hey, guys. Good morning. 
John Stauch: Good morning.
Joe Giordano: Hey, so on the Manitowoc Ice, you know, obviously the growth there on an organic basis looks a lot different than the water solutions business as a whole. Can you can you kind of go through, especially kind of like buckets of what drove that? Like how much was just backlog? How much was like was price in Manitowoc different versus like the underlying water solutions of three points for the year? Like how much were there like revenue synergies with the filtration reading out already into ’23? Just if you can kind of just break those into large buckets for growth. 
John Stauch: Yeah, let me simplify it. I mean, right now we're seeing great traction, especially with Manitowoc and also then the filtrations of Everpure, through distributors into key accounts and also working our way through synergies there. I just want to mention that our services business had a very large project that it worked in 2022, which was for a large customer, the install of frozen carbonated beverages. And we ran up against the year-over-year headwind in that business in Q4. But if you actually look at the filtration and the Manitowoc, contributing nicely and it's just offset slightly by the headwind of the services business.
Operator: The next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Andy Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning, everyone. 
John Stauch: Morning, Andy.
Andy Kaplowitz: John, could you give us a little more color into your industrial CapEx, I suppose businesses within Flow? I think you have the segment up single digits for ’24, industrial businesses look good in Q4. So what are you seeing in Flow and then how are you thinking about your commercial businesses there as well?
John Stauch: Yeah, so thank you for the question. I mean, we've had pretty nice steady order rates and steady deliveries. And what we do is very, very important because we're turning waste into value for a lot of our key customers. And we're seeing continued investment in that because it drives productivity for them. It's also a big sustainability play for them. So it's an area where doing the right thing for the planet also means a really good value for the customer. And so we've seen a steady order view there and we feel like we're well positioned heading into 2024.  On the commercial side, our larger pump business has benefited from, expansion of what I call mainly infrastructure types of projects and the continued build out in North America related to data centers, warehouses, etc. And we continue to see that trend as we enter 2024 holding up nicely as well.
Operator: The next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
John Stauch: Good morning Deane. 
Deane Dray: Hey, just want to follow up there while we're talking about the formerly known as Industrial & Flow Technologies. Is there anything, it might just be cosmetic, but is there anything to read into the renaming as Flow? And just in answering Andy's question, the point of the business today for Pentair is more of the focus on residential, commercial and the opportunities in Pool and it seems less about industrial and data centers and so forth. And maybe I'm just reading too much into it. But my sense is, are you still the natural owner for this business? And is there any potential that you'd consider a separation?
John Stauch: Yeah, I know. I appreciate the question, Deane. And I will spend a little bit of time on this at the Analyst Day in March. But just to share with you how I'm thinking, the relabeling of Flow was actually more of a branding exercise. You know, we want to have a web presence where we can tell our story and flow represents 9.99% of everything we do and the former Industrial & Flow Technologies, well, we just didn't think worked as a naming nomenclature. So that's all it was. It's also shorter, which makes producing reports easier. And that's a big deal, right?  But ultimately, Deane, the way I think of the company is we're a $1.5 billion in separations and membrane technologies. We're about a $1.5 billion of pumps across the enterprise. And then even some of our specialty applications like heating and cooling of ice, a rise in $800 million, which leaves you a couple $100 million of lighting and $100 million of other. So when you think of the portfolio, we're not geared to residential other than that's where our dealer base is. And that's where our strength and our presence has been generally accepted around our brands. But as a reminder, we do a couple of hundred million dollars industrial wastewater today. That's in the Flow side and we'll continue to build out that capability and technology to continually take advantage of water reuse projects around the world.  So, it’s -- we are -- we believe this business naturally fits and we're going to demonstrate that we use those membranes that are used for industrial wastewater applications. We're bringing those back into the residential applications and we think it's going to give us a differentiated technology advantage as we do so. So really excited about the cross-pollination of technology and really excited about how the segments are working together, while also maximizing what we think is the revenue opportunities within their individual swim lanes. 
Operator: The next question comes from Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Steve Tusa : Hey, guys, good morning.
John Stauch: Hey, good morning, Steve.
Bob Fishman: Hi, Steve.
Steve Tusa: How's it going?
John Stauch: Good. How about you?
Steve Tusa: Grinding it out. Just on this productivity number, can you just quantify how much investments you're throwing in there, just roughly?
John Stauch: It's not a lot. Just, you know if you thought about $10 million to $20 million of reinvestment into the areas of sales and marketing, innovation, digitization, capturing data upstream and bringing that data to help our dealers be successful. And then really just automating the experience between our dealers and our distributors and us, are the two biggest opportunities we have. And then we got some excitement around three or four of these innovation projects that we'll talk about further, Steve, at the Analyst Day. And I want to continue to invest in them because I think they could be game changers in the long haul. So I'm really pleased with the level of transpiration we're realizing and, you know, these are good businesses that we want to add a little bit of investment back into.
Steve Tusa: You should have thrown AI in there. You missed the opportunity. But on that number, so I guess --
John Stauch: But you [answered] it for me, Steve. Now it's in the transcript, so thank you.
Steve Tusa: I guess, though, I thought that the messaging around productivity was more bullish than, I guess, a $90 million gross number if I just add back $20 million. Am I missing something there? Is there just like conservatism on the way some of that's coming through? I thought the productivity number you were messaging was higher than that.
John Stauch: Yeah, you know, I hate ever using the word conservatism. I think we definitely have a funnel that would suggest we could realize more. And certainly, at the upper end of the range, we would be realizing more. So I think right now, as we sit here and we don't see any definitive movement in interest rates for the rest of the year, we haven't planned on any in this forecast. You know, we think we're well balanced in the way we're positioning this.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to John Stauch, President and Chief Executive Officer, for any closing remarks.
John Stauch: Well, thank you for joining the call today. In closing, I want to reiterate some key themes on Slide 27. First, our balanced water portfolio and Transformation initiatives continue to drive significant margin expansion in 2023. Second, we initiated 2024 guidance with expected growth in sales and profitability, reflecting confidence in our strategy and execution across the company. Third, our Transformation initiatives have gained momentum in 2023, with expectations to drive further margin expansion in 2024. And finally, we believe our focused growth strategy and solid execution are building a solid foundation for long-term growth, profitability, and shareholder value. Drew, that does conclude the call.
Operator: Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-10-24 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Pentair Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Shelly Hubbard, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Shelly Hubbard: Thank you, Anthony, and welcome to Pentair's third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. On the call with me are John Stauch, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Bob Fishman, our Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, we will provide details on our third quarter performance as outlined in this morning's press release. On the Pentair Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings release and slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call, and provide a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures that we will reference.

Before we begin, let me remind you that during our presentation today, we will make forward-looking statements which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Pentair. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K. Following our prepared remarks we will open up the call for questions. Please note that we will limit your questions to two, after which, we ask you to then re-enter the queue in order to allow everyone an opportunity to ask questions. A quick reminder before I hand the call over to John. Similar to last quarter, we have included slides 4 through 7 in our earnings slide deck, which provide a brief overview of Pentair. Please see the slide titled Strategic Framework, Pentair at a Glance, Pentair Overview and Making Better Essential for more information. In reference to Slide 7, Making Better Essential, we are proud to share two recent recognitions that Pentair has received for its work in social responsibility and ESG. We've been recognized as a constituent of the FTSE4Good Index Series and we have been named one of America's Greenest Companies 2024 by Newsweek. This recognition from Newsweek evaluated Pentair's environmental performance in relation to our industry, assessing our progress against key environmental factors, including greenhouse gas emissions, water usage, waste profile and commitment to disclosing sustainability data. Pentair's achievement supports our purpose to create a better world for people and the planet through smart, sustainable water solutions. We look forward to continuing to reduce the environmental impact of our operations and further integrate sustainability into our product innovation as guided by our social responsibility strategic targets. Please refer to our published 2022 Corporate Responsibility Report for more information on our sustainability strategy. I will now turn the call over to John.
John Stauch: Thank you, Shelly, and good morning everyone. Let's begin with the executive summary on Slide 8. We are very pleased with our third quarter results, which surpassed the guidance that we provided on our last earnings call. Q3 marked the sixth consecutive quarter of sales over $1 billion, and the sixth consecutive quarter of adjusted margin expansion. Segment income increased 3% and ROS expanded by 140 basis points. Adjusted EPS was $0.94 versus our previous guidance of $0.84 to $0.89 and year-to-date free cash flow was $453 million, up 115% over the prior year. As we look to the full year, we are updating our 2023 adjusted EPS guidance range to $3.70 to $3.75, which reflects the high end of our previous guidance. I want to celebrate these strong results with all our employees. The resilience and dedication to serving our customers and delivering value for our shareholders during a year of global macroeconomic uncertainty is making a difference. Thank you for your leadership. Let's move to Slide 9 titled Strategic Focus. Through our mission to help the world sustainably move, improve and enjoy water, we are enabling the right investments to both deliver the core and build our future to drive long term value for shareholders. In Deliver the Core, we have driven profitability and productivity across all three segments, Industrial & Flow Technologies, Water Solutions and Pool in 2023. We have also been making better essential through our products and solutions for people and the planet with a focus on sustainability and we have been investing in our people to develop talent and build a higher-performing culture. Another strategic focus of ours is to build our future to accelerate performance. In 2023, we have further invested in the transformation, innovation and M&A. In fact, we've seen great results across all three of these areas with our transformation having begun to read out and new innovation launch this year with exciting new products coming in all three segments. And our Manitowoc Ice acquisition is exceeding expectations. Regarding innovation, in 2023, our businesses have launched 25 new products. Examples include a new high-efficiency ice maker for convenience stores and fast-casual restaurants designed in advance to meet the future EPA regulation for refrigerants, expansion of our Energy Star award-winning and smart IntelliFlo3 pump series and the advancement of our Beer Membrane Filtration solutions to operate continuously with higher levels of smart automation. In addition to these new product launches, our innovation teams continue to make great progress advancing our strategy to build our future as they focus on our longer-term growth being centered on the Pool of the future, re-imagining residential, commercial water treatment and industrial waste to value solutions. Over the last three years, we have launched over 100 new products. Let's turn to Slide 10, titled Transformation Update. We embarked on this transformation journey nearly two years ago with the intent to transform our business for the Pentair of the future. Our company has evolved substantially with the separation of nVent and then evolving to a leading diversified water company. Through our four key transformation themes, including pricing, sourcing, operational excellence and organizational effectiveness, we are streamlining our processes in building additional capabilities, which add more tools in our toolbox to drive growth and productivity. In Q3, transformation gained momentum and drove a substantial increase in productivity sequentially from Q2. After implementing Wave 1, both pricing and sourcing, we expected transformation to begin to scale in the second half of this year and we are pleased to note that our transformation initiatives remained on track. Let's turn to Slide 11, titled CEO Summary. We delivered another strong quarter with significant ROS expansion. Our Manitowoc Ice acquisition continued to exceed expectation. Our IFT and Water Solutions segments more than offset Pool's volume decline and our transformation initiatives drove margin expansion. Our performance through Q3 resulted in another positive update to 2023 adjusted EPS guidance. All in, we are building a strong foundation to drive long-term growth and profitability across our diverse water portfolio. We have updated the full year adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $3.70 to $3.75 from the previous range of $3.65 to $3.75. We are mindful of the uncertainty across the global macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape and we continue to closely monitor macroeconomic developments and implement risk mitigation strategies, when and where necessary. We have continued to accelerate transformation funnels, while focusing on investing in the long-term growth of our company. We remain confident in our diversified water business model, long-term strategy and our transformation initiatives, which we expect to continue to drive shareholder returns. We have a long successful track record of generating strong cash flow and being disciplined with capital allocation. We achieved 47 consecutive years of dividend increases and are targeting high-teens ROIC. We have a strong balance sheet and an enviable five-year financial track record. I will now pass the call over to Bob who will discuss our performance and financial results in more detail. Bob?
Bob Fishman: Thank you, John, and good morning everyone. Let's start on Slide 12, titled Q3 2023 Pentair Performance. We delivered another strong quarter of significant margin expansion despite sales being down 4% year-over-year. The diversification of our portfolio and our transformation initiatives continued to more than offset Pool's lower volume impact on margins. Core sales for Q3 were down 7% year-over-year, driven by our residential businesses. Our commercial and industrial businesses performed well in the quarter. While Q3 sales declined primarily due to the volume headwind in Pool, the negative volume impact on Pentair and Pool improved sequentially from Q2. Third quarter segment income increased 3% to $212 million and return on sales expanded 140 basis points year-over-year to 21%. This improvement was driven primarily by productivity from transformation, accretive margins from the Manitowoc Ice acquisition and some price versus cost benefit. We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.94. Net interest expense was nearly $29 million and our adjusted tax rate was 15% during the quarter with a share count of 166.6 million. Please turn to Slide 13, labeled Q3 2023 Industrial & Flow Technologies Performance. Industrial & Flow Technologies sales increased 3% year-over-year, driven by commercial sales growth of 8%, and industrial sales growth of 12%, which more than offset a decline in residential sales of 7%. Segment income grew 18% and return on sales expanded 250 basis points to 19.4% marking the fifth consecutive quarter of equal to or greater than 200 basis points of improvement. The strong margin expansion was a result of continued progress on our transformation initiatives. IFT's continued success was partly driven by a revised go-to-market strategy and industry leadership that has been underway over the last two years. For example, within our industrial businesses, our strong reputation and industry expertise is driving above-industry growth. We've been moving away from primarily project-led business to standardized solutions focused on ease of doing business with distributors. And our key accounts have begun to reinvest in sustainable product lines following the pandemic. Within our commercial businesses in IFT, we are focused on driving business beyond warehouses and office space to datacenters and institutions such as universities, airports, hospitals, and government buildings. We also believe there are large opportunities in municipal infrastructure as driven by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act legislation in the US, with a focus on investments in clean water, flood control and broadband. Interestingly, one of our customers is the leader in directional drilling equipment for fiber optic cables. We continue to believe the aftermarket is a good opportunity for future growth because of our significant product install base. Lastly, we believe we are in a strong position to benefit from the Build America, Buy America Act as our compliance is expected to give us a strategic advantage. Within our residential businesses in IFT, we have seen a return to normalization. Recall that these products are typically not a discretionary spend. When a sump pump or a well pump breaks, it's critical to get it fixed. Please turn to Slide 14, labeled Q3 2023 Water Solutions Performance. In Q3, Water Solutions sales increased 9% to $299 million, driven by our Manitowoc Ice acquisition and price. Segment income grew 40% to $69 million and return on sales expanded 510 basis points to 23%, driven primarily by our accretive Manitowoc Ice acquisition and productivity from our transformation initiatives. Margins have expanded over the last seven quarters from 10.8% in Q1 of 2022 to 23% in Q3 of 2023. Within our residential business in Water Solutions, we noted last quarter that we are seeing North America stabilize. This was evident in Q3 as residential sales declines improved sequentially from Q2. Within our commercial business in Water Solutions, filtration sales in North America remained strong and Manitowoc Ice continued to exceed our expectations. Please turn to Slide 15, labeled Q3 2023 Pool Performance. In Q3, Pool sales declined 21% to $309 million. The volume decline of 28 points was primarily due to continued channel inventory corrections in the quarter and reflects a strong Q3 2022 comparison. Sequentially, the negative impact of volume, significantly improved from Q2. The pricing benefit of 7 points helped partially offset the volume decline. Despite lower Pool sales in Q3, return on sales expanded 130 basis points due to price offsetting inflation, prior actions to rightsize direct labor to align with lower volumes, and improved productivity driven by our transformation initiatives. Please turn to Slide 16, labeled Transformation Initiatives. Similar to last quarter, we believe this slide provides a good illustration of our transformation initiatives and our ultimate goal of driving margin expansion. For reference, our transformation initiatives focus on four key themes, pricing excellence, strategic sourcing, operations excellence and organizational effectiveness. As we've mentioned in past quarters, we expect strategic pricing actions to benefit the top-line of all three of our segments. We expect our other three transformation initiatives to help improve our overall cost structure. As a result, we are targeting ROS of approximately 23% by the end of fiscal 2025, expanding margins over 400 basis points as compared to fiscal 2022. Please turn to Slide 17, labeled Transformation Runway. As you look at each of the four key themes, you can see that the work within these transformation initiatives is in various different stages. For example, in 2023, we have begun to see early readouts from Wave 1 within pricing, sourcing and operations. We are beginning Wave 2 within each of these three themes and expect margin benefits to read out in 2024. You can see how each new wave is expected to compound on the others to drive expected margin expansion year-over-year through 2025 and beyond. In pricing excellence, the strategic pricing playbook has been developed, which is just beginning to roll out across segments and categories. For example, in Q3, we began to implement strategic pricing actions across select products within our Pool segment. Within these price actions -- while these price actions are reflected in our recent annual price increase, please note that these strategic actions differ from annual price increases. Typically, on an annual basis, we evaluate overall inflation, both materiality costs to determine the appropriate price increase across our products. With regards to strategic price actions, we are evaluating all products through a value-based model and identifying which ones have opportunities for adjustments. Recall that in the past, we primarily evaluated pricing through a cost-plus approach. In sourcing excellence, the implementation of Wave 1 is underway with savings currently reading out. As a reminder, Wave 1 included materials such as electronics, motors, maintenance, repair and operations spend, packaging and logistics. Additionally, we successfully kicked off Wave 2 this summer with over 800 suppliers attending our supplier show. For reference, Wave 2 materials include metals, moldings, resins, ocean freight and purchase finished goods. We expect Wave 2 to begin to read out beginning in 2024. Incremental to our strategic sourcing waves, we have seen benefit from our rapid renegotiation process that is a part of our transformed sourcing excellence work. In operational excellence, we have completed the consolidation of three facilities while continuing our execution on lean transformation plans across our sites. In organizational effectiveness, we are in the earlier stages with Wave 1 and expect margins benefits to be realized beginning in 2024. Due to the staggered nature of these transformation initiatives, we expect Wave 3 to begin to read out post 2025 in operations excellence and organizational effectiveness. Overall, we are excited about the savings we have begun to realize from the early waves and remain confident that our teams can execute on pricing actions and savings we have identified particularly in sourcing. Please turn to Slide 18, labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. In Q3, we generated $143 million in free cash flow, up nearly 100% year-over-year, reflecting another strong quarter. Year-to-date, our free cash flow was $453 million, up nearly 115% year-over-year. Our net debt leverage ratio was 2.1 times, down from 2.6 times in Q1 and 2.2 times in Q2. Our maturity stack is very manageable. Total debt is now less than $2 billion. And the average rate is approximately 5.3%. Our ROIC was 14.1%, exceeding our cost-of-capital and includes debt from the Manitowoc Ice acquisition. We continue to target high-teens ROIC in the long term. We plan to remain disciplined with our capital and continue to focus on debt reduction amid the higher interest rate environment. Moving to Slide 19, titled Q4 and Full Year 2023 Pentair Outlook. For the full year, we are updating our adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $3.70 to $3.75 from our previous range of $3.65 to $3.75. Also for the full year, we expect sales to be roughly down 1%, segment income to increase 10% to 11% with corporate expense of approximately $85 million to $90 million, net interest expense of roughly $123 million to $125 million and adjusted tax rate of approximately 15%, and a share count of 166 million. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to be down approximately 3% to 4%. This is mainly attributable to expected lower Pool volume year-over-year and the return of seasonality in our business now that lead times have normalized. We expect fourth quarter segment income to increase 3% to 8% with corporate expense of roughly $23 million, net interest expense of roughly $28 million to $30 million, and adjusted tax rate of approximately 15%, and a share count of 166 million. We are also introducing adjusted EPS guidance for the fourth quarter of approximately $0.82 to $0.87. Moving to Slide 20, titled Full Year 2023 Guidance at Midpoint. We continue to expect total Pentair sales in fiscal 2023 to be approximately $4.1 billion or down about 1%. We continue to expect IFT sales to be up mid-single digits and Water Solutions sales to be up high-teens. For Pool sales, we have made a slight adjustment to down high-teens from previous guidance of down mid-teens at the high end of the range. Segment income is expected to increase approximately 10% to 11% with ROS expansion of over 200 basis points to 20.9%. Moving to Slide 21 titled Q3 Progress Summary. We are very pleased with our Q3 and year-to-date performance. As John mentioned earlier, our third quarter marked the sixth consecutive quarter of sales over $1 billion, and the sixth consecutive quarter of adjusted margin expansion. We have executed well in a dynamic environment and delivered on our commitments. Specifically, our diversified water portfolio and transformation initiatives have driven significant margin expansion despite Pool's volume decline. Our Manitowoc Ice acquisition has exceeded our expectations. We have instilled performance accountability across the organization, which is being measured through key metrics. We have a very strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation. And we have a disciplined capital allocation strategy that aligns to our high-teens ROIC target. I'd now like to turn the call over to the operator for Q&A, after which John will have a few closing remarks. Anthony, please open the line for questions. Thank you.
Operator: We will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Brett Linzey with Mizuho. You may now go ahead.
Brett Linzey: Hey, good morning all.
John Stauch: Morning.
Brett Linzey: Hey, first question just on pricing in Pool. So it sounds like you're going to have two different actions here. So, one being the normal course of business and then on top of that, some surgical. If you could just square that comment. And then anything you can share in terms of the magnitude of the actions that you're contemplating there?
John Stauch: No. I think just to clarify, as we go into next year, we're only counting on a price increase, which would be a more normalized price increase and modest compared to prior years, but slightly higher than what we would have said would have normally occurred, which is covering the inflationary aspects. Not aware of anything incremental than that and those price increase, they're already been announced to the market.
Bob Fishman: Yeah, our comment towards that, not only did we use an approach that looked at inflation, but for certain product lines, looked at adjustments based on a value-based model. But that is all included in the pricing that went out to be effective Jan 1.
Brett Linzey: Understood. Thanks for that. And then just wanted to circle back to the comments around the market extensions within IFT commercial. Great to see some opportunity outside those traditional verticals. Is there any way to quantify the total addressable market size that will increase here, given this new reach, this new focus?
John Stauch: No, but I mean it opens up what we would say would be at least $1 billion plus for our particular opportunities. And I think that's a conservative estimate, Brett.
Brett Linzey: Okay, great. Best of luck, thanks.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. You may now go ahead.
Andy Kaplowitz: Hey, good morning everyone.
John Stauch: Morning.
Bob Fishman: Morning.
Andy Kaplowitz: John, can you update us and give us more color on what you're seeing in the Pool market? It looks like you're suggesting with your Q4 guide slightly bigger inventory correction in the $150 million you were guiding to. Maybe you could give us some more color on that. And then how do you think that sets up Pool for 2024, especially given the higher interest rate environment?
John Stauch: Yeah, so I think, first of all, we're pleased that we were able to predict the way that Q3 was going to unfold, and it played out, generally, as we expected. I think we focused on sell-through data. And then also focused on the metrics of our channel partners and I think that data is providing clarity of what's going on. I think the inventory is generally behind us. I don't think that's what Q4 represents. I think Q4 represents what we would say is reflecting the higher interest rates and the impact it could have on the sell-through aspects within the market and it's helping to position ourselves for the best possible 2024 that we can have. So it's a modest participation in early buy, it's making sure that we're not continuing to build inventory ahead of next year. And it's setting ourselves up for a really good 2024.
Andy Kaplowitz: That's helpful, John. And then you beat your forecast for Q3 sales overall, were down 4%. I think you were expecting down 7%. You didn't change anything other than Pool, which we just talked about. But my question is whether you're seeing anything in IFT or Water Solutions that stopped you from raising your forecast at all? I would imagine you want to be conservative as you talked about, but any more color there on current economic conditions, how they're affecting the other segments?
John Stauch: No. I mean I think Water Solutions has benefited from significant performance at Manitowoc Ice and we're really pleased with how that acquisition came in and has performed. Just a reminder though, we're going to start comparing against really good delivered quarters in the prior years and so that year-over-year performance is going to moderate. I think the market outlook for that business continues to be strong, but it's going to be hard to continue to put up those types of numbers on a consistent basis.
Andy Kaplowitz: And then in IFT, anything you're seeing in terms of channel destock or anything like that?
John Stauch: No, but I think it's only fair to suggest that higher elevated interest for longer makes sure that productivity-based projects and/or expansion investments are going to be up against higher hurdle rates and we're reflecting that in our particular revenue forecast as we go forward.
Andy Kaplowitz: Appreciate the color, John.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. You may now go ahead.
Brian Lee: Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I know there's a lot of questions around Pool. I'll just throw another one in there. And lot of moving parts and the macro is still uncertain, but is there sort of a framework you guys can provide us to think about for Pool? Because if all goes right, it sounds like by the time we get to end of '23 here, channel destocking is fully complete, you've got normal seasonality returning, price is still kind of elevated in the mid-single digits, so I guess, first off, do you see that holding in '24 on the price side? And then just from a volume framework perspective, assuming all those things, do you play out as you expect channel destocking seasonality? Like, what is the framework we should be thinking about in terms of the Pool volume outlook here as we think about the next kind of 12 to 18 months?
John Stauch: Yeah, first, I think we're feeling really good about the ability in 2023 to have -- continue to raise our guidance through the diversified portfolio, offsetting really consistent performer in Pool. I mean Pool has generated a lot of income and growth for us over the years and I think it was a little bit worse this year than we anticipated coming into the year, primarily because that inventory was larger and the overall market wasn't as strong as we had hoped it would be. But as we head into 2024, we're looking at the framework as being that we do pick up the tailwind from not having that inventory correction. And then as we get closer to the end of the year, we'll predict what the markets are going to be. I think it's fair to say that we're not thinking that overall Pool builds expand from here. And we don't think overall remodeling expands, but I do think we're going to see a little bit of recovery in that aftermarket, which I think was accelerated into the prior years and now has been normalized. And a lot of those are non-discretionary purchases and we think we get back to a potential overall growth, plus the benefit of the tailwinds of inventory.
Brian Lee: Okay, fair enough. Makes sense. And then maybe just with interest rates backing up here and the macro, I think a lot of focus around kind of what it meant for your Pool business all year long. Are you seeing anything beyond the resi sector in your kind of end-market exposures that are having any impacts or constraints on spending when it comes to that sort of cost of capital environment and just financing condition is getting a little bit tougher here? Anything you can speak to at kind of a high level? Thanks.
John Stauch: Yeah. I mean I think you're calling it. I think we're seeing it everywhere to be honest with you in little bits. I mean, as a reminder, 75% of our end customers are small dealers and professional trade channel people and their borrowing of capital is higher and harder to get access to capital. I think that slows down some of the projects that we're working on. We're not exposed to commercial buildings more than a $100 million or a couple of hundred million, but I think you're going to see financing be tougher on the building side. And so an elevated higher interest rates for long, just I think produces a sluggish environment is the way we're looking at it, which is why we're really putting that accelerator on the transformation initiatives we have, pricing selectively, making sure that we understand the market back and how to position our products and services effectively in the industries and then making sure that we're managing the cost structure well within the company.
Brian Lee: All right. Appreciate it guys. Thank you.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Bryan Blair with Oppenheimer. You may now go ahead.
Bryan Blair: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
John Stauch: Morning.
Bryan Blair: Just hoping to drill down a little bit more on commercial water solutions trends. It sounds like underlying market activity remains pretty solid. Just curious if your team is seeing anything shift on a sequential basis. I know a lot of questions have been asked already in terms of macro backdrop, higher for longer rate environment, et cetera. Specific to that platform, are you seeing anything as we get into Q4 or the outlook for 2024 that concerns your team in terms of the strength that you've been leveraging recently?
Bob Fishman: There's no doubt that commercial water solutions has had a excellent 2023, going to market with end-to-end solution of water quality. Ice and services has been very compelling. Manitowoc has had an excellent year. And we've done well in North America filtration. So overall, we continue to see the market within the restaurants, primarily the quick service restaurant space being solid for us. The challenge for us is bumping up against a tough compares next year. But overall, the markets that we serve are doing well.
John Stauch: Just to give you some indication of point-to-point, I mean, despite the fact that we're going to see significant shipments in Manitowoc this year and feel really good about their progress, the overall CAGR from 2019 to the end of 2023 is about 8%-ish or slightly a little bit higher than that which we had slightly normal than -- or higher than the mid-single digits that we had forecast the business to have. So just a reminder that the markets, as Bob mentioned, are recovering globally and they continue to participate in that recovery.
Bryan Blair: I appreciate the color. That's very helpful. You mentioned the end-to-end solution and there's no doubt that the value proposition combining Everpure, KBI, Man Ice, that's resonating with your customer base. Can you speak to direct cross-selling traction within the platform, what's been realized to date for your legacy businesses, not just the lift to Man Ice?
John Stauch: Yeah, I mean I would I would quantify that value is a couple of points of incremental growth as the overall commercial water solutions business from those synergies. I mean, lots of excitement and putting Everpure in the trade shows, next to the Manitowoc Ice and vice-versa and helping our customers which are a distributor and an installer realize the benefits of promoting both. And I think when you have a good filtered solution on an ice machine, you're extending the life of the ice machine. And then it also leads to the service capabilities we have and the fact that we can offer some of those services. More importantly, just understand what the service provider is up against, so that we can redesign for service and also work with our partners to help them get in and out of those end markets faster. So I mean there's a lot of energy and excitement and we couldn't be more pleased with the synergies and the go-to-market strategies of these three businesses put together.
Bryan Blair: All makes sense. Thanks for the color.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Mike Halloran with Baird. You may now go ahead.
Mike Halloran: Hey, good morning, everyone. So two quick ones here. First on the destocking impact last quarter, you talked about a $150 million impact on destock this year. Is that still the number we should be thinking about or has that changed now?
John Stauch: No. I think there's nothing that's changed in that number. It played out as we said as expected.
Mike Halloran: Thanks for that. And then on the balance sheet side of things, you're two times levered now on a net basis. Bob talked to debt paydown is still the priority. Maybe you could just talk to, given the changes in interest rates, how your financing terms are. Is there a -- has there been any shifts in what kind of leverage levels you're looking at going forward or, maybe better put, where would you -- what kind of leverage levels would you want to see before you became more aggressive using your balance sheet, whether it's for buybacks and M&A, whatever it is?
John Stauch: Mike, I promised myself I wouldn't give a target today. I think right now, I think we all have to be mindful of access to capital and managing with our capital framework and I think paying down the debt right now is a good use of it. Obviously, we're always looking at strategic complementary businesses to our current business units. The market is not robust though at the moment. And even when you're seeing assets availability, you've got to question how those interest rates environments affect their business. So you're not seeing transactions happen. So I think just paying down the debt right now and giving ourselves the maximum flexibility is where Bob and I are focused for the remainder of this year and into next year.
Bob Fishman: Yeah. I would just add to that, that obviously staying investment-grade is hugely important to us. As the variable rates have crept up, we did undertake the interest rate swap and the collar, so that turned out to be a smart move where when you include the collar, effectively 65% of our debt is fixed. That brings us to kind of a weighted average rate of 5.3% in the quarter, maybe 5.5% going forward. So overall, we've done some good things to manage within this environment and paying down the debt has certainly helped from an overall perspective.
Mike Halloran: Thanks for that. All very reasonable. I appreciate it.
John Stauch: Thank you, Mike.
Operator: Our next question will come from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. You may now go ahead.
Julian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. Maybe just wanted to follow up on the sort of profit bridge a little bit from Slide 12. So the sort of price net of inflation number was close to zero. It seemed inflation picked up a bit as a headwind year-on-year versus the prior quarter. So maybe help us understand kind of the inflation moving part in Q4 into early next year. And should we expect that price net of inflation number to be sort of close to zero like it was in Q3?
John Stauch: No, I think the way -- it's a good observation. I would remind you that the inflation as we showed in our bridge is as year-over-year. So it doesn't necessarily reflect sequentially this year, it could be that we saw some elevated inflation on some of the buys that we had last year. So we think that we are overall moderating to price versus cost being neutral or slightly more close to neutral and then obviously focusing on the productivity contribution that's coming from our transformation initiatives, that's the model going-forward. If you recall, we were benefiting quite substantially earlier in the year and last year on price versus cost. And now that's shifting to more of a transformation benefit as we go forward. Bob, I don't know if you want to add anything.
Bob Fishman: Yeah. I would just add to that, that while inflation did -- the change in inflation and increase in Q3 versus Q2, the nice thing was that price was able to cover that. We do expect inflation to moderate significantly in the fourth quarter and certainly where price exceeds inflation. At the beginning of the year, we talked about inflation being around 4.5% of sales. And we're really tracking right towards that. So the team has done a nice job of understanding inflation and factoring in the impact of that. So overall pleased with what we're seeing and that'll moderate in the fourth quarter.
Julian Mitchell: That's helpful. And as you said, hopefully, that productivity piece becomes larger as a driver. It was substantial already in Q3. Maybe just sort of refresh, where we are on the sort of Wave 2 from transformation savings and how substantive that productivity number should be as a segment income driver next year when you kind of roll together sort of incremental savings from transformation next year.
Bob Fishman: Yeah, and that is a very important part of our margin expansion story. As we talk about price equaling inflation, it's important that productivity then drives that ROS expansion. So we were pleased to see the $29 million read out in the third quarter, up significantly from the single-digit in Q2 and expect to have a significant transformation benefit in the fourth quarter. We're really within Wave 1 in terms of reading out in 2023. We've built some healthy funnels around each of the four pillars of transformation. And so that will start to read out to an even greater extent next year. So overall pleased with the momentum going into 2024.
Julian Mitchell: Got it. And your sort of second half run rate for those savings, we should expect that sort of to be steady through at least the first half of next year, I suppose. And then maybe the sort of the comps get a bit tougher on productivity.
John Stauch: Well, and then that's when the Wave 2 kicks in, Julian. So you -- but you're right. The material took a long time to realize because of all the engineering work and the resupply efforts that we had to do with the supply community. So we're starting to benefit from those in Q4. That run rate will go into next year and then Wave 2 starts to take over in the second half of next year from a sourcing standpoint. To give you some color, about a third of our businesses engaged in the pricing exercises in 2023 will be close to two-thirds of the wave through that in 2024. So that's kind of how the waves that Bob mentioned start to unfold. And we start to benefit from that performance inside the businesses.
Julian Mitchell: That's great. Thank you.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies. You may now go ahead.
Saree Boroditsky: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just building on the transformation initiative comment, discussing and benefit from Wave 2 in the second half of next year. Can you just quantify how we should think about that as contributing to margin performance?
Bob Fishman: We're very focused on ROS expansion. So if you think about us finishing around 21% this year, we've talked about improving the ROS to 23% by 2025, and we've said that's being done in a linear way versus it being all back-end loaded. So we expect the ROS to improve next year as we head towards that 23%.
Saree Boroditsky: I appreciate the color. Then, just kind of going back to Pool, and a lot of questions today, but -- and you talked about some of the early buy programs having modest participation there. Maybe as you think about 4Q delivery versus 1Q, is there any way to think about how you thought about the delivery patterns and what that means for 1Q sales? Thank you.
John Stauch: Yeah. I mean I think what we'd like to see unfold is we believe Q4 can be higher from a shipment perspective for Pentair than Q3 and then we would expect Q1 to be better than Q4. And then we would be in the normalized pattern, end of Q2 next year finally being a normal seasonal pattern, which should be the strongest full quarter of the year. And as a reminder, Q3 is modestly less than that. And then again Q4 starts the pre-load for the 2025 season. So we feel like we worked through this and now we've got a clear line-of-sight to more normal seasonality in the business and really keeping our eye on sell-through going-forward so that we don't get into this inventory situation with our channel again.
Saree Boroditsky: Appreciate the color. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. You may now go ahead.
Jeff Hammond: Hey, good morning, guys.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Bob Fishman: Hi, Jeff.
Jeff Hammond: Hey. Just on IFT, can you just talk about like the order trends you're seeing? I don't know if it was really a comp issue but it seemed like there was a step-down in the growth rate. And I'm just wondering what the orders are telling you about kind of the go-forward there.
John Stauch: Yeah. I mean, just, again, we're looking at year-over-year comps, Jeff, and our infrastructure businesses had a really solid 2022 and so some of these growth rates reflect against the prior quarter of 2023. I think the orders continue to be strong from a mid-single-digit indicator as we go forward, but the year-over-year comparisons are going to be tougher. And as Bob mentioned, we are really focused on non-project-related wins. We're focusing on service, we're focusing on aftermarket, we're focusing on recurring revenue streams with our key distributors and end-market providers, Jeff.
Jeff Hammond: Okay, great. And then just back on this Manitowoc Ice tough comp issue, can you just talk about -- I think you called out a lot of the success and the synergies. But just, what's been going on with backlog drawdown and order rates there to kind of think about this tough comp dynamic? We're also kind of picking up in the channel that commercial food equipment and some other markets are maybe starting to see more normal growth as well.
Bob Fishman: Yeah. I would say backlogs have returned to more normalized levels. Just as a reminder, Manitowoc grew roughly 30% in the second quarter, will have grown or did grow 20% in the third quarter and for the full year, Manitowoc will be up roughly 20%. So they've had a very strong year. To John's point, when you look at the CAGR from 2019, that's sitting at roughly 8%. So we do expect a more normalized year next year as we bump up against 2023's 20% growth. But overall, the business remains very healthy. The end-to-end approach in terms of going to market is resonating well. So very confident in the Manitowoc business.
John Stauch: And Jeff, your data points are right. This isn't a sustainable growth level for our ice business. I mean, when you're mid-to-high single-digits, we would have hoped that, that is a more linear growth rate that we get to and obviously, we're going to satisfy the demand and make sure that it's a Manitowoc Ice machine that someone is putting into their restaurant. So it gives us the ongoing service and relationship with that customer. But this is not normal as we've said all year.
Jeff Hammond: Okay. Appreciate it, guys.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Andrew Krill with Deutsche Bank. You may now go ahead.
Andrew Krill: Hey, thanks, good morning, everyone. Want to go back to the Pool pre-buy. I think you might have said you're expecting like a modest pre-buy this year. So just any more insight you can give on that and maybe try to like quantify how it's tracking versus more normal years. And just to clarify, are you assuming that as part of the 2023 guide or would that be incremental to the Pool sales guidance? Thanks.
John Stauch: No. It's all included in our current view of what our business will do in Q4. And just to remind everybody, what we try to do is level-load factories to make sure that we're not taking down our shipments in any one quarter beyond the level of our employment groupings. So we're obviously encouraging the channel to buy ahead of next year's pool season through discounts that we offer in term extensions, right? We're now at a level that we think is prudent for us and that's where the modest early buy is. And as you know, the channel would take more if they are incentivized more to take it. And if they don't, then those become standard buy orders in the next year. And so that's always what the forecast is reflecting. And we have to do it in our economic best interest. Our channel partners do it in their best economic interest. And right now, we feel our guide is the best reflection of what we'd say a more normal seasonality and a more normal early buy, which would set us up nicely for a 2024 growth year.
Andrew Krill: Got it, thank you. And just for the 4Q guide and the implied margins for the total company and marked a pretty meaningful step-down sequentially. I think historically you've been more flattish from 3Q to 4Q. And I know it isn't necessarily a normal year but just seems a little, perhaps, conservative, especially with the cost actions starting to come through. So maybe if you could unpack that and if like any segments in particular you think the margins are weaker than normal for 4Q. Thanks.
Bob Fishman: What we implicit in our guide is significant ROS expansion versus last year's Q4. When you look sequentially, it does come down, but a lot of that does reflect some of the seasonality that, that is returning back to more normalized levels. So overall pleased with the ROS expansion in Q4 versus last year's Q4 and it will be the momentum we need exiting the year.
Andrew Krill: Thank you.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Joe Giordano with Cowen. You may now go ahead.
Joe Giordano: Hey, guys, good morning.
John Stauch: Morning, Joe.
Joe Giordano: I wanted to start on margins and keep it there for a sec. I mean, not -- probably splitting hairs a little bit but Pool margins went below 30%, I think we were kind of talking about 30% being like a new floor and you're close enough where that's still like a valid statement. But just from here into the fourth quarter into next year, that 30% kind of feel good still as probably kind of a bottom level?
John Stauch: I'd say yes on the second part of your question and I think delivering the margin that we did despite the year-over-year decline in volume is what I'm most proud of the team having accomplished. And yeah, I mean, I do think we're splitting hairs. I think they're directionally in a really good spot as a business model and obviously getting growth from here is going to leverage up nicely.
Joe Giordano: Okay, and then similarly on Water Solutions, I think you were talking about -- like the commentary coming out of last quarter was that the margins were going to step down pretty decently sequentially in the third quarter because of the deliveries that Manitowoc did in 2Q and the opposite happened, right? It went up sequentially. So how should we think about margins there? I know Manitowoc is still delivering at a high level, but how should we think about sequential margins there and the sustainability of this, like, 22%, 23% level there?
John Stauch: Yeah. I would remind you that Water Solutions has a residential component and systems businesses and they also have the commercial water solutions. When we mix towards commercial, we're going to have a lot higher-margin profile. And what we're really doing is being very selective on the products that we're offering on the residential side. And we try to mix up that business. And so a lot of the decline in the revenue was on the residential side. And that actually helped the overall mix of the business to the positive.
Joe Giordano: Okay, that makes sense. And if I could just sneak in one last one on just the volume. So I mean your Pool volumes this quarter came in better than what we were thinking about when we spoke three months ago. Commentary from your largest distributor calls for like fourth quarter, their inventory levels in dollars are going to go up from the third quarter. So like, that kind of implies growth for you guys. If they do normal seasonality, implies growth in Pool of like high-single-digits. If they do less, maybe it's more modest growth. But how would you kind of think about where growth can look like for Pool in the fourth quarter?
John Stauch: Well, I think we're a piece of their puzzle. So we'll start there.
Joe Giordano: Yeah.
John Stauch: And I think we are indicating that we do think sequentially our revenue numbers do go up from Q3. And then it's really a discussion of how much more. And I really think that we do our best to predict that business with reasonable accuracy and getting it exactly to the dollar is improbable. And so I would say, we got really close in Q3 and I think we feel really good about our Q4 revenue estimate at this moment.
Joe Giordano: Thanks guys.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Scott Graham with Seaport Research. You may now go ahead.
Scott Graham: Good morning, John, Bob, Shelly. How are you?
John Stauch: Morning, how are you?
Shelly Hubbard: Morning.
Bob Fishman: Hi, Scott.
Scott Graham: Good. Thank you. So the productivity jump was obviously meaningful. How much of that 2.8% maybe was some help from a better supply chain, sort of external?
John Stauch: Well, I think a lot is coming from that, Scott. I mean, I think we're working more seamlessly with our supply chain today. Obviously, we've caught up on most of the demand to them and aligned with our channels. And so we are benefiting substantially from a lot of more seamless deliveries across the entire supply chain today.
Scott Graham: Okay. Back on to Pool, sorry, but historically, these numbers kind of shook out as 40, 30, 30 new remodel and then sort of the maintenance of the aftermarket. As we look at a weak 2023, kind of, what does that -- where do those numbers kind of end the year at? Is that an estimate you can make?
John Stauch: Yeah. I think they're generally in that ballpark. And we could argue, weak -- I mean I think the overall builds in 2023 are going to definitely be at pre-pandemic levels but generally in line with what we had seen prior to the pandemic. So I think we're in a more normalized area. Scott, I think the learning is, across the channel is there is high-end pools there is low-to-mid market pools and the interest rates are definitely impacting the more low-to-mid and the high-ends are continuing to be built. So I think that we'll all probably start to refine the numbers to try to break it out by the demographics that its serving, but I think generally, the model is still working.
Scott Graham: Okay, thank you, John. Last one, you indicated builds, you are assuming kind of flattish. We're modeling flattish and then aftermarket up. Were you referring to the fourth quarter or a period of time longer than that?
John Stauch: No, we're talking about -- if we think about heading into the 2024 pool season, that's generally what we're -- our current expectations would likely suggest.
Scott Graham: Okay. So your mid-single-digit plus long-term thinking on Pool, it's not going to be that next year, based on that.
John Stauch: We'll give that in January, Scott. I'd remind you that there is an inventory correction next year, which creates some benefits and then there's the overall general market conditions that we are addressing. But when we get to giving our Q4 earnings, we'll update and share with our 2024 guide.
Scott Graham: All right, thank you. Had to try.
John Stauch: Yeah, you tried. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Deane Dray with RBC Capital. You may now go ahead.
Jeff Reive: Good morning, this is Jeff Reive on for Dean. Maybe my first question, you talked about your innovation, the 25 new products this quarter, 100 for the year, over the last 12 months. Is there any internal metric you target? Like, are you targeting new product vitality? And what are the typical margin differential on new products?
John Stauch: Yeah. I mean we do. We have all those. Vitality is obviously the right product line by product line. When we create new valuable products at the market or that our customers want, we tend to see margin lift from those new products, not usually at its initial stage, it usually takes probably a year or two for that to recognize. But that is the model we work to.
Jeff Reive: All right. So nothing to quantify. And then maybe on IFT, you kind of mentioned the Build America, Buy America provision in infrastructure spending. Are there any products that you offer where you are on -- or virtually 100% American-made where your competitors aren't? And is that a meaningful piece of the business?
John Stauch: Yeah, we have today with the Born in America where a lot of our historic brands 120, 130 years old are -- have originated in the United States. They've been specified here for long periods of time and they're manufactured here. And so our employees are really proud of those brands. Our customers are really proud of those brands and they tend to give us the ability to have at least a fair opportunity to win those jobs when we go to market.
Jeff Reive: Got it. Thanks.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Nathan Jones with Stifel. You may now go ahead.
Nathan Jones: Good morning, everyone.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Bob Fishman: Hi, Nathan.
Nathan Jones: Couple of questions on Water Solutions. I think first one is probably on Manitowoc Ice. I think you guys have shipped out of backlog this year, you had maybe a couple of large projects that might not repeat next year. You talked about mid-single-digit plus. But should we be thinking of that long-term mid-single-digit plus as being of a low-end number than what you've done in 2023? Or do you think you can actually grow from the number that you're putting up in 2023 as we go into 2024?
John Stauch: That's a nice try, Nathan, we're not going to go there yet. Right now, we're trying to satisfy our customer demand for the rest of the year and then we'll do an assessment of where we think we are and we'll be prepared to share that insight with you as we head into 2024.
Nathan Jones: Okay, fair enough. In Water Solutions, I think you've also had some inventory destocking in some other business, residential water treatment businesses. Can you talk about the impact that comping against that, as we go into next year, might have without looking at the fundamental outlook of 2024?
John Stauch: Yeah, as a reminder, we -- what we did in 2022 is we exited a fair amount of lower-margin direct-to-consumer business and we've been up against those comparisons this year in Water Solutions. Those comparisons, as we head into next year, go away. And so obviously, this is all included in Water Solutions this year and in next year, we get a little bit less contribution from acquisitions and we have a little bit less headwind from the business exits that we took on this year.
Nathan Jones: All right. Thanks for taking the questions.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Our final question will come from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. You may now go ahead.
Sabrina Abrams: Hey, you have Sabrina Abrams on for Andrew Obin. Just wanted to ask, I know there's been a couple of questions about Manitowoc but are you guys still committed to the $370 million full year guidance?
John Stauch: That would be an easy commit.
Bob Fishman: Now, we had talked at the beginning of the year of that $370 million but the business has done significantly better than that and will grow roughly 20% this year.
Sabrina Abrams: Got it. And then just going to ask another one about Pool and maybe if you could give some color on the pricing number because I know you are returning to the regular discounts in 4Q. Any color on what we should think about the pricing in 4Q '23, given that the past couple of year, you were not having normal pre-buy?
John Stauch: Yeah. I don't know how to answer the question. I mean I think, as a reminder, we put our price increases in for the season over the next year. We do that in Q3. And so the discounts usually take you to more flattish pricing year-over-year. So the pre-buys are term extensions, but they don't include a price increase necessarily because there is a discount to what the price increase would be. So it's not like we're discounting partly to sell it, we're just not having to -- we're just not getting the full raised prices in that early buy.
Sabrina Abrams: Got it, thanks.
John Stauch: Okay. Thank you. Okay, so thank you for joining the call today. In closing, I want to reiterate some key themes on Slide 22. First, solid execution within our diversified portfolio and transformation initiatives continued to drive significant margin expansion in Q3. Second, we updated our 2023 guidance due to strong performance year-to-date and confidence in our strategy. Third, our transformation initiatives have gained momentum in 2023 with benefits expected for the remainder of 2023 and beyond. And finally, we expect to continue to deliver long-term value creation. Thank you everyone and have a great day.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-07-27 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Pentair Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded today. I would now like to turn the conference over to Shelly Hubbard, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Shelly Hubbard: Thank you, Joe, and welcome to Pentair's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. On the call with me are John Stauch, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Fishman, our Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, we will provide details on our second quarter's performance as outlined in this morning's press release. On the Pentair Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings release and slide deck which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provide a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures that we will reference. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's performance in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results. Before we begin, let remind you that during our presentation today, we will make forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Pentair. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K. Following our prepared remarks, we will open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Before I hand it over to John, I wanted to highlight Slides 4 through 7 in our earnings slide deck that include our strategic framework, Pentair at a Glance, a Pentair overview and our newest slide illustrating our ESG highlights and progress. These 4 slides provide a good snapshot of who Pentair is, especially for those new to our company. Our strategic framework states our purpose, mission, vision and values that drive our performance as a smart, sustainable water solutions company. Pentair at a Glance on Slide 5 provides a great snapshot of our company, our performance, our installed base and our 47-year track record of annual dividend increases, which places us in a small group of companies. The Pentair overview on Slide 6 provides our historical sales and ROS performance on a consolidated level and by segment. Lastly, our ESG highlights and progress shown on Slide 7 are a testament to the important work our teams do to integrate sustainability into our operations, product innovation and long-term strategy. We are very proud of our achievements to date, especially considering the early stages of program, which began just about 3 years ago. I will now turn the call over to John.
John Stauch: Thank you, Shelly, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with our record Q2 results and the executive summary on Slide 8. In Q2, we achieved record sales, segment income, return on sales, EPS and free cash flow following the separation of nVent from Pentair in 2018. Specifically in Q2, sales increased 2% to nearly $1.1 billion, Segment income increased 14% to $234 million. ROS expanded by 230 basis points to 21.6%, driven by margin expansion across all 3 segments. Adjusted EPS rose 1% to $1.03, and free cash flow was $433 million. With another strong quarter of financial results, we are raising our 2023 adjusted EPS range to $3.65 to $3.75, which increases the midpoint of our range to $3.70. We also continue to strengthen our balance sheet and reduced our net debt leverage ratio to 2.2x EBITDA at quarter end, down from 2.6x in Q1. We believe our record second quarter performance demonstrates the power of our global diversified water portfolio and strong execution across all 3 segments: IFT, Water Solutions and Pool. Our strategy to help the world sustainably move, improve and enjoy water, life's most essential resource is proving its resilience. For example, like last quarter, sales growth in our IFT and Water Solutions segments more than offset the expected sales volume declines in Pool year-over-year. Margin expanded across all 3 segments, driven primarily by price, cost actions to rightsize our direct labor and pool, the elimination of 2022 manufacturing and supply chain inefficiencies and continued progress on our transformation initiatives that are beginning to read out. Lastly, I want to thank our employees across the globe for their hard work, dedication and contribution to delivering another strong quarter for customers and shareholders. Let's move on to Slide 9, titled Q2 segment highlights. Within IFT, we achieved record sales, driven by double-digit growth across our commercial and industrial businesses. Commercial and infrastructure flow delivered strong sales growth across all categories, primarily due to our strong backlog, aftermarket and replacement sales in our pump portfolios, carryover pricing actions from 2022 and stabilization in the supply chain. Industrial Solutions also delivered strong sales growth, driven by global key account expansion, new business partnerships and aftermarket and replacement sales in our components and membranes portfolios. Record margins in Q2 were primarily driven by price and transformation. In addition to implementing our transformation initiatives in IFT, we have also focused on capturing the right projects with improved offerings to drive margin expansion. In Water Solutions, our commercial offerings drove very strong sales growth and margin in Q2, which benefited in part from the continued recovery of foodservice and hospitality venues post the pandemic and a shift in consumer behavior from products to services. In fact, in 2023, the number of locations of the top 500 chain restaurants in the U.S. now exceeds the 2019 benchmark according to the Technomic Top 500 chain restaurant 2023 report. We also saw strength in commercial filtration sales in North America. Our Manitowoc Ice acquisition continued to outperform our expectations delivering strong sales and margins that were accretive to the Water Solutions segment. Over the last few years, Manitowoc Ice has expanded its sales driven by a focus on its consumer, with a targeted go-to-market strategy, effective management of macro supply chain challenges and reliability in its supply chain to deliver product with better lead times. We are very pleased with the acquisition and how it complements our commercial Water Solutions businesses enabling us to provide end-to-end water solutions for customers from filtration to ice to services. Lastly, we believe that the residential water treatment is nearing the bottom of the cycle, we believe our residential business is stabilizing and lead times have improved. Awareness of PFAS or forever chemical that have been found in drinking water continues to rise. We are proud to say that we have products today for residential consumers that reduced PFAS to current certification levels. And we continue to drive new innovation and invest in R&D to be able to provide more products that are certified to produce PFAS. We believe we have positioned the company well to be a leader in this space. Within Pool, 2023 has been a softer and difficult year as we expected, given the higher than historical demand in 2021 and '22 coupled with supply chain challenges that disrupted our lead times during those periods. Our lead times have returned to approximately 5 days on most of our products. However, the channel continues to work through higher inventory creating a sell-in versus sell-through imbalance for Pentair in 2023. Despite these lower volumes in Q2, we drove significant margin expansion from price, cost actions to rightsize labor to lower volumes, eliminated 2022 sourcing and manufacturing inefficiencies and delivered transformation savings. We continue to expect Q3 to reflect a bottom in Pool volume for Pentair as we expect higher channel inventories to correct, allowing for sell-in to be more closely aligned with sell-through. We have noted in the past that our typical Pool sales mix reflects 40% from new and remodeled pools and 60% from the aftermarket break-and-fix replacement sales. While the number of new pools this year is lower, than the elevated number of new pools built during the pandemic, the installed base of U.S. pools has continued to grow. Despite the short-term reset in 2023, we believe Pool remains an attractive market. Before I turn it over to Bob, let's turn to Slide 10, titled CEO Summary. We delivered another quarter of quality earnings with ROS expansion across all 3 segments. Our IFT and Water Solutions segments more than offset Pool volume declines, and our transformation initiatives are well underway. Our strong first half has resulted in another 2023 guidance increase. And we believe our Pool business is well positioned for return to growth following the channel inventory correction, which we expect to be completed by Q3 quarter end. All in, we are building a strong foundation to drive long-term growth and profitability across our diverse water portfolio. We are introducing Q3 guidance and raising the full year adjusted EPS range to $3.65 to $3.75, the midpoint of $3.70 is up $0.05 from prior guidance due to a strong Q2. We have also updated our segment sales expectations to reflect stronger sales in IFT and Water Solutions driven by a strong first half of 2023 and lower expected sales in our Pool segment. We continue to closely monitor macroeconomic developments and remain mindful of an uncertain operating environment. We continue to implement risk mitigation strategies, and we are accelerating transformation funnels as necessary while focusing on investing in the long-term growth of our company. We remain confident in our diversified water business model, long-term strategy and our transformation initiatives, which we expect to continue to drive shareholder returns. We have a long successful track record of generating strong cash flow and being disciplined with capital allocation. We have achieved 47 consecutive years of dividend increases and are targeting high-teens ROIC. We have a strong balance sheet and an enviable 5-year track record in financials. I will now pass the call over to Bob, who will discuss our performance and financial results in more detail. Bob?
Robert Fishman: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 11, titled Q2 2023 Pentair Performance. We delivered record second quarter sales of nearly $1.1 billion, up 2% year-over-year. This is compared to a previous sales record in last year's Q2 of $1.06 billion post the separation of nVent from Pentair in 2018. Our IFT and Water Solutions segment continued another quarter of strong sales performance, which more than offset lower Pool volumes. Sales growth in Q2 included strong price contribution and the Manitowoc Ice acquisition, which closed in July of 2022. The volume decline in Q2 was primarily related to our pool and other residential businesses which was partially offset by strength within Commercial and Industrial. Please note that where I referenced record results, I'm referring to Pentair's performance post the separation of nVent from Pentair in 2018. Core sales improved 9% in both IFT and Water Solutions with Pool declining 28%, compared to the prior year periods, pool sales increased 19% in Q2 2022 and 49% in Q2 2021. Second quarter segment income increased 14% to a record $234 million and return on sales expanded 230 basis points year-over-year to a record 21.6%, this improvement was driven by price more than offsetting inflation, accretive segment margins from our Manitowoc Ice acquisition, the elimination of 2022 manufacturing and supply chain inefficiencies and productivity benefits from our transformation initiatives. We delivered record adjusted EPS of $1.03. Net interest expense was $33 million, and our adjusted tax rate was 15% during the quarter with a share count of 166.1 million. Please turn to Slide 12 labeled Q2 2023 Industrial & Flow Technologies Performance. Industrial & Flow Technology sales increased 9% and year-over-year, driven by commercial sales growth of 28% and industrial sales growth of 13%, which more than offset a decline in residential sales of 4%. Segment income grew 27% and return on sales expanded 250 basis points to 18.2%, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of equal to or greater than 200 basis points of improvement. The strong margin expansion was a result of price offsetting inflation and continued progress on our transformation initiatives. Please turn to Slide 13, labeled Q2 2023 Water Solutions performance. In Q2, Water Solutions sales increased 51% to $336 million driven by our Manitowoc Ice acquisition, volume and price. Manitowoc Ice has continued to exceed our expectations. Q2 sales were approximately $135 million, up roughly 30% compared to the prior year period. Segment income grew 130% to $75 million and return on sales expanded 760 basis points to 22.2%, driven primarily by our Manitowoc Ice acquisition as well as efficiencies from our transformation initiatives. Within our residential business, we are seeing North America stabilized. We have also been evaluating our SKU mix and reducing complexity. Please turn to Slide 14, labeled Q2 2023 Pool performance. In Q2, Pool sales declined 28% to $334 million. The volume decline of 36 points was primarily due to channel inventory corrections in Q2. This year, a strong Q2 2022 comparison and cooler and wetter than usual U.S. weather. The pricing benefit of 8 points helped partially offset the volume decline. Despite lower Pool sales in Q2 2023, return on sales expanded 190 basis points due to price significantly offsetting inflation, rightsizing direct labor to align with lower volumes, the elimination of 2022 manufacturing and supply chain inefficiencies and benefits from our transformation initiatives. Please turn to Slide 15, labeled Pentair Pool sell-in versus estimated industry sell-through. This slide provides an illustration of our Pool sale sell-in and the estimated comparison to industry channel sell-through since 2019. Here, you can see the imbalance of sell-in and sell-through beginning in 2020 and continuing to expand in 2021 and 2022 due to record inflation and supply chain disruption. In 2023, we have returned to normal lead times and sell-through is returning to normalized levels. We expect sell-in and sell-through to rebalance by 2024, following approximately $150 million of channel inventory correction in 2023. We expect this 2023 inventory correction to become a tailwind in 2024. Please turn to Slide 16, labeled transformation initiatives. Our transformation initiatives focus on 4 key themes: pricing excellence, strategic sourcing, operations excellence and organizational effectiveness. As we've mentioned in past quarters, we expect strategic pricing actions to benefit the top line of all 3 of our segments. We expect our other 3 transformation initiatives to help improve our overall cost structure. As a result, we are targeting ROS of approximately 23% by the end of fiscal 2025, expanding margins over 400 basis points as compared to fiscal 2022. Please turn to Slide 17, labeled Transformation runway. As you look at each of the 4 key themes, you can see that the work within these transformation initiatives is in various different stages. For example, in 2023, we are beginning to see early readouts from Wave 1 within pricing, sourcing and operations. We are beginning Wave 2 within each of these 3 themes and expect margin benefits to readout in 2024. You could see how each new wave compounds on the other to drive expected margin expansion year-over-year through 2025 and beyond. In pricing excellence, the strategic pricing playbook has been developed, which is planned to be rolled out by category within each segment. We have completed internal training and plan to implement these actions over the next few months. In strategic sourcing, the implementation of Wave 1 is underway, with savings currently reading out. We expect to kick off Wave 2 later this summer with readouts beginning in 2024. Incremental to our strategic sourcing waves, we have seen benefit from our rapid renegotiation process that is part of our transformed sourcing excellence work. In operations excellence, we have completed the consolidation of 2 facilities while continuing our execution on lean transformation plans across our sites. In organizational effectiveness, we are in the earliest stages with Wave 1 and expect margin benefits to be realized beginning in 2024. Due to the staggered nature of these transformation initiatives, you can see that what we expect Wave 3 to begin to read out post 2025 in operations excellence and organizational effectiveness. Overall, we are excited about the savings. We have begun to realize from the early waves and remain confident that our teams can execute on pricing actions and savings we have identified particularly in sourcing. Please turn to Slide 18, labeled balance sheet and cash flow. With our record free cash flow in Q2 up $433 million, up $144 million from the prior year period and the repayment of debt, we have lowered our pro forma net debt leverage ratio to 2.2x, down from 2.6x in Q1. As a reminder, our second quarter is typically our highest free cash flow quarter. We expect our full year free cash flow to be in line with our historical performance of approximately 100% net income. Our return on invested capital was 14.9%, which includes debt from the Manitowoc Ice acquisition, but only approximately 4 quarters of Manitowoc EBITDA contribution. Our target ROIC is high teens. In Q2, we entered into interest rate swap and collar agreements in order to hedge our variable rate debt. Our variable to fixed debt is now 48% and 52%, respectively, with an average rate of approximately 5.3%. We have no significant long-term debt maturing for the next 5 years and the majority of our debt is in term loans going out 3 to 5 years. We plan to remain disciplined with our capital and continue to focus on debt reduction amid the higher interest rate environment. Moving to Slide 19, titled Q3 and Full Year 2023 Pentair Outlook. For the full year, we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $3.65 to $3.75, increasing the midpoint to $3.70. Also for the full year, we expect sales to be roughly down 2% to flat, which is unchanged from our prior guidance in Q1. Segment income to increase 10% to 12% as compared to up 7% to 10% in prior guidance, with corporate expense of approximately $80 million, net interest expense of roughly $125 million, an adjusted tax rate of approximately 15% and a share count of 165 million to 166 million. Our assumptions on corporate expenses, net interest expense, adjusted tax rate and share count remain unchanged from guidance provided last quarter. For the third quarter, we expect sales to be down approximately 7% versus last year's near record Q3. This is mainly attributable to lower year-over-year Pool sales as we expect the channel inventory correction to be completed by quarter end. We are also introducing adjusted EPS guidance for the third quarter of approximately $0.84 to $0.89. We expect segment income to decrease 1% to 6% with corporate expense of approximately $21 million, net interest expense of roughly $31 million and adjusted tax rate of approximately 15% and a share count of $165 million to $166 million. Moving to Slide 20, titled Full Year 2023 guidance at midpoint. At the midpoint, we continue to expect total Pentair sales to be down approximately 1% to approximately $4.1 billion. Due to strong Q2 performance in IFT and Water Solutions we have updated our segment sales assumptions as follows: we now expect IFT sales to be up approximately mid-single digits, up from low single digits; within IFT, we expect residential to be down approximately mid-single digits; and commercial and industrial to be up low double-digits. Water Solutions sales are expected to be up high teens versus mid-teens. Commercial is expected to rise approximately 50%, with residential sales down roughly 10% and the expected Pool sales range remains unchanged at approximately down mid-teens, although we now expect sales to be down at the higher end of this range due to a softer Q2. As we have discussed in prior quarters, our Pool sales consist of approximately 40% from new and remodeled pools and 60% from aftermarket. Within our current Pool guidance, we now expect new pools and remodels to be down approximately 25% to 30% versus previous assumptions of down approximately 25% and inventory in aftermarket to be down roughly 20%, unchanged with approximately 2/3 of the decline relating to inventory corrections. We expect price to be up roughly mid-single digits. We expect Pool sales to return to more normalized sell-in, in 2024 after absorbing significant inventory correction headwinds in the current year. Segment income is now expected to increase approximately 11% at the midpoint as compared to 9% previously with ROS expansion of over 200 basis points to 20.9%, up 40 basis points from our Q1 guidance. Overall, we are excited about the future. We believe the diversification of our portfolio has proven that we can weather challenges in 1 segment while continuing to grow total Pentair sales and expand margins across all 3 segments, despite significant volume declines in our residential businesses. We are seeing progress in our transformation initiatives, generating strong free cash flow and further strengthening our balance sheet with the repayment of debt. Before I turn the call over for Q&A, I wanted to highlight why we believe that Pentair is a compelling investment opportunity. Please turn to Slide 21. There are 6 distinguishing characteristics that we believe sets Pentair apart. We are an industry leader with a diversified brand portfolio and a focus on driving innovation across all 3 segments. We have a transformation strategy that is expected to drive operational efficiencies and margin expansion. Our ESG focus is on making life better for people in the planet with our smart, sustainable water solutions. We recently published our 2022 Corporate Responsibility Report, highlighting progress towards our strategic targets. We have favorable secular trends driving end market growth. We have a strong balance sheet and cash flow, which we expect to drive additional value creation and we are a dividend aristocrat with 47 consecutive years of increased dividend. I'd now like to turn the call over to the operator for Q&A, after which John will have a few closing remarks. Joe, please open the line for questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question here will come from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.
Julian Mitchell: My first question, I suppose, was really around -- when we're looking at a couple of the guidance increases in the non-pool divisions, just wanted to try and understand the cadence of sales a little bit better through the back half. If I look at the Water business, for example, it looks like the guide implies a pretty heavy sequential declines in Q3 and 4. I just wanted to make sure I understood that right. And then also within IFT the guides implying year-on-year growth evaporate in the back half. Is that just a function of comps or something changing in the end market sell-through?
John Stauch: I think we would describe it as more moderating, Julian. I think clearly, our Manitowoc performance from a year-over-year basis, there's a huge acquisition component year-over-year, but there's also the organic growth of nearly 30%, as Bob mentioned in his comments, those are the result of industry demand and our ability to fulfill those industry demand. And eventually, we start to moderate and compare against year-over-year comps that are more normalized. In the IFT side, I think what we're seeing is really strong growth in commercial and industrial, again, backlog related that will again moderate in the back half of the year. Moving to what I would say is more normalized on growth rates that we would expect on a longer-term basis, Julian.
Julian Mitchell: Understood. And then just my quick follow-up on the Pool segment. On that point on inventories. So, it's obviously the sort of the weather impact early in the second quarter, which have been very well flagged for months now. Is your point that maybe delayed the requisite inventory depletion early on. But what's happened, say, so far in Q3, that's why you feel confident that the inventory depletion is on track to be finished by the end of September. Maybe just any color on how your conversations with channel partners and what you see on the sell-through, how has that evolved in the last 2 to 3 months?
John Stauch: Yes. I think just on the Q2 numbers for Pool, I mean, it's solely in my opinion, related to more inventory coming out of the channel than we expected. I think the channel has done an amazing job of working and moving and migrating the inventory around branches to where it's needed, and they are aggressively working to eliminate that extra inventory from the channel. I think as we talk to our channel partners for Q3 and Q4, we continue to believe that all of the inventory or the excess inventory will be worked out in Q3, reflecting our current guide, and we would be talking on more normal early buy discussions as we ramp into Q4 as we anticipate the 2024 demand, and coming back to a more normalized seasonal performance. That being said, Pool is, in our opinion, really low in Q3 from our revenue forecast as it deals with that volume decline for us related to that inventory and channel correction.
Operator: Our next question here will come from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup.
Andy Kaplowitz: John and Bob, maybe give us a little more color into the progress on transformation because if you look at the segments, obviously, IFT, for example, 18.2% seems quite a bit ahead of plan. So what has gone right for you guys here over the last couple of quarters? And would you expect that progress to continue?
Robert Fishman: I would say we're very pleased with Wave 1 across the board, particularly pleased within sourcing. As a reminder, Wave 1 consisted mainly of motors and drives, casting, electronics, logistics, packaging and then Wave 2, you can think of that as being metals, resins, purchase finished goods and a component of indirect spend. We've seen a lot of benefit within the transportation area within Wave 1 and 2024 is setting up for benefits in the other components of the Wave 1 spend. One of the areas that we've done a really nice job is capturing deflation, particularly across resins, plastics, motors, metals and castings where our team went in and did an expedited response to what they saw in the global marketplace. We're able to strengthen relationship with suppliers and actually take advantage of pricing that was coming down in the number of different commodity groups. I would say within kind of the ocean space, the expedited air on the air consumption, that's down over 50% from where it was last year. And ocean rates are down some 65%. The final thing I would say is that we've done a really nice job of rightsizing to the volumes that we expected from a direct labor perspective, and that's all about having headlights into the business and taking the corrective action. And then finally, there were a lot of inefficiencies in 2022. Spot buys, expedites, partial truckloads, partial completion of products where we'd have to push a 90% complete product off the line and wait for a part to come in. We had overtime attrition. We've done a really nice job of addressing those inefficiencies as part of the transformation as well. So across the Board, we're very pleased and I'm very thankful to the team that works on this every day.
Andy Kaplowitz: Bob, it's good color. And then maybe somewhat related question around pricing and particularly in Pool. I know it's one of your initiatives there, too. But -- maybe you could talk about your ability to hold price given the way the markets are. Have you seen any deterioration? Obviously, your margins were still good, and how would you think about Pool margin moving forward?
John Stauch: Yes. So I think as we head into 2024, we're certainly pleased with the way prices held up in 2023 in relationship to what Bob said. And I think that's indicative of the way that ROS expansion has unfolded. I think we're going in a more normalized pricing environment now, Andy. And I think that -- that means that we have to rely on those price increases and work hard on the productivity aspects to drive the margin. And I think we're going to see normal and then I think it depends on how these industries fare as to what would be the expected hold rate or the realization rate of those price increases in 2024, and it's way too early to tell.
Operator: And our next question here will come from Bryan Blair with Oppenheimer.
Bryan Blair : I wanted to ask about transformation, obviously driving pretty strong results already, and you've noted that you're early stage and the respective waves of those initiatives. As we look to your 2025 gross target to level set, what are you baking in for core growth between now and then? And then what level of reinvestment is contemplated? The reason I ask is that just the simple math, if we assume any core growth in kind of moderate realization of the sourcing opportunity that you've identified that seems to drive ROS above the targeted range and then the other levers imply pretty solid offset.
John Stauch: Yes, I think that's fair, Brian. I think I would talk about, as Bob mentioned, we're really pleased on the early indications of transformation. As a reminder, we're using outside partners to give us benchmark looks at what's possible and working with us to give us breakthrough thinking and putting in establishing core processes to drive this transformation. So we feel like it's going to be consistent and predictable. The one thing I would share with you, though, as you look at our targets is they're also inclusive of investments and we have a lot of energy around investing in our channels, our obsession around customer experiences, improving those customer experiences and investing in innovation. And those are offsets to the transformation benefits that we would expect. And as you can imagine, Pool has been an innovation leader for many years. It's been playing a little bit of defense lately. And we want to put our foot to the pedal there and really drive both product innovation and go-to-market innovation. So expect us to invest back in our businesses.
Bryan Blair : Understood. That all makes sense. Appreciate the color. I know your attention focused on debt reduction since the Manitowoc Ice closed. But your balance sheet starting in pretty solid shape. You're generating really robust cash flow given your financial position and clearly successful integration of Man Ice, just wondering if your team will get back to bolt-on or tuck-in M&A over the near term?
Robert Fishman: I would say that the focus for this year continues to be on debt pay down, where interest rates are. We think that's the wisest use of the capital. And then that creates optionality going into 2024 around share repurchase and M&A.
Operator: Our next question here will come from Mike Halloran with Baird.
Mike Halloran: So a couple of commercial questions here. First, on Manitowoc Ice. Can you just give some context to what's going on in the channel right now? I guess a little from an inventory perspective, but more from what are the customers saying from a demand perspective, how do you think about the sustainability of what you're seeing underneath the hood? And then some comments on how Man Ice is performing well to peers would be great.
John Stauch: Yes. I think if you look back at the 8 years prior to 2019, 7, 8 years, like this has historically been a 5% to 6% steady grower with some years that might be slightly higher, slightly lower based upon how the restaurant and hospitality market unfolds. Clearly, if you take '19 as a starting point to where we expect '23 to finish, think about being high single-digits. What we want to remind people is there's a significant catch-up to the significant downturn that hospitality industry has faced and that's a big part of the start-up and the demand. As I referenced in my note, we're now back slightly above the 2019 restaurant numbers. So I think we're going to see more of the historical trend pattern as we look forward in this business going forward. Our ability this year to grow faster was the share capture that was really based upon -- having gone through the supply chain work that we're doing elsewhere in Pentair, ironically and completely coincidentally, Manitowoc is using the same outsource partner that we're using on the rest of Pentair and started that sourcing initiative 3 to 4 years earlier than us. And so they were able to put the supply chain into place that allow them to be prepared and ready to partner to get these increased demands, and that's been a big benefit to the Manitowoc business. It's also very encouraging for us on what the rest of Pentair can realize as well.
Mike Halloran: Good point. Kind of answer I was going to ask on the commercial question for the second part there and on the outlook side. So let me pivot to the IFT piece. It's nice to see the margins kind of tranche higher in these last couple of quarters. And I was just hoping to get a little bit more context to how you think about what that progression forward looks like for the segment specifically, how much impact the mix is going to have? Clearly, the transformational piece is a core part of that progression. And if there's any moving pieces below the hood that we should think about as you look to the back half of the year there?
John Stauch: Yes, special call out to our commercial and infrastructure team on just getting to margins in ROS is that, quite frankly, Mike, I didn't think were possible, right? And I think they're doing it while they're growing, which is extremely encouraging. That being said, I think as we go forward, it's going to be about how we continue to win projects and jobs that have aftermarket and service [Indiscernible] to them, how we can grow at mid-single digits, while maybe more likely maintaining these margins. Because as you know, when you get these tailwinds in the industry, it's easy to be selective -- it's harder to be selective when the jobs get tougher to find. And I think that's the discipline we're putting into the group. But it's really encouraging to see the progress they made. I think they still see opportunities to expand the ROS. But again, this is an area we want to invest in. And as you know, one of the things that has always talked about is blue water, right? So we're really strong on the fire pump side, and we've been able to find synergies by bringing the clean water side to some of the projects we've worked on, and we've been able to do that at the appropriate margins. So it's really encouraging to see that growth and the margins at the same time.
Operator: Our next question here will come from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Lee: A lot of mine have been covered, but I had a couple of maybe modeling specific ones. I guess on the record ROS, when I look at the full year guide, I know this might be a little bit timing related or -- and maybe a little bit of nitpicking, but it seems like the implied ROS is down here in 4Q. Can you kind of walk us through some of the puts and takes just exiting the year? As you think about driving more expansion into '24 as your comments suggested?
Robert Fishman: The guidance that we've given actually has us expanding ROS year-over-year, both in Q3 and even more significantly in Q4. So that is one of our rallying crises to continue to expand ROS year-on-year again, a little bit less in Q3 because of the headwind of the Pool business. But overall, transformation continues to read out in the back half of the year.
Brian Lee: Okay. Understood. Yes, we'll go back and take a closer look at the model. And then maybe just on Pool. It sounds like you're pretty confident around trends bottoming here, inventory sell-through, sell-in normalization. So I know it's probably too early to tell, but any initial thoughts around what all of that points to the rest of this year kind of goes according to plan and pool. Are we thinking about a reasonable base case back to like mid-single digit volume, maybe low single-digit type pricing tailwinds in '24? Just sort of what's the setup as you think about what the normalization and how quickly it plays out, gets you to in terms of a reasonable base case to get back to normal growth trends in '24, potentially?
Robert Fishman: One of the reasons why we added that extra chart was to try and give some view of the headwinds this year and what could be a potential tailwind for next year. So we did quantify the inventory correction at about $150 million. And so that will not repeat next year. So in itself, that's a $150 million good guide in 2024. We're not giving any view as to what aftermarket might grow, still too early from that perspective. But from an overall pricing perspective, price has been sticky from our perspective and that we do expect price increases as we go into next year.
Operator: Our next question here will come from Andrew Krill with Deutsche Bank.
Andrew Krill: I wanted to go back to Water Solutions. Here, the margins were very strong in the second quarter. And historically, they've had a nice sequential step-up going into 3Q. So I know Manitowoc kind of changes the mix a bit. But I mean, do you still expect a meaningful increase sequentially there for the margin?
Robert Fishman: Yes. We -- sequentially, we will be roughly in line, I would say, to maybe slightly down because we just won't drive that amount of volume and necessarily get the leverage that we saw from an Ice perspective. But overall, when we look at the different pieces, the filtration as well as the residential piece within Water Solutions, we continue to see transformation playing a big role. So I would say year-on-year, significant ROS expansion in Q3 for Water Solutions, a little bit of pressure as you go from Q2 to Q3 just because -- to John's earlier point, seasonality that's start to return to more normalized levels.
Andrew Krill: Okay. Great. Makes sense. And I guess, to the extent you're willing to comment on weather, it seems like it's normalized so far in July. Any comments you can give on July trends so far for Pool and then maybe just for the broader company as well?
John Stauch: Yes. I hate to bring the weather word into the focus. And as I said earlier, I don't think it played as much into our Q2 Pool softness as the inventory correction did. Weather usually intends to work its way out eventually throughout the period. So I would say right now, we're seeing heat trends that have some positives in certain areas to driving demand. And at the same time, when it gets this hot, you don't necessarily need heaters. So I don't -- I would not bring weather into our forecast at all. I think everything we know today from our weather forecasting has been included in our guide, and we don't expect weather to be a big part of our discussion going forward.
Operator: Our next question here will come from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
Steve Tusa: Not too bad. I'm not going to ask you about the assumptions that underlie your weather forecast. Yes. So just on the kind of phases of this transformation, you mentioned logistics? I mean obviously, the logistics prices in general are down, how do you like disaggregate what you guys are doing versus just like the normal deflationary cycles that are happening in these types of materials?
Robert Fishman: From our perspective, and I'm not trying to be flipping here, but even in the deflationary environment, there's work to be done. We need to go back to the suppliers and point out commodity prices that are coming down. So our view is that either through our negotiation process, either through the structured 11 gate process within Wave 1 and Wave 2. We have to understand the market, first of all, make sure we're asking for price decreases or longer-term price stability and so it's all part -- from our perspective of that strategic sourcing initiative.
John Stauch: But Steve, just to add on that, I agree with everything Bob said, and we're happy, but it is a benefit of the deflationary, the work we do to negotiate. But also, we have reduced our carriers by almost 2/3. And we did do a series of route optimizations and choose partners that are best to serve the routes and the lines that we need, and that was a big part of the work that's generating the savings.
Steve Tusa: Right. That makes sense. Can you just remind us what the benefit from transformation is for next year? I'm not sure if you mentioned that earlier in the call.
Robert Fishman: We did not.
Steve Tusa: Can you just update us on what you expect that to be?
Robert Fishman: What we've said up until now is we'll go from what will be roughly a 21% ROS this year to 23% by 2025. And our view is that roughly linear as we get to that 23%. So -- and transformation plays a big piece of that margin expansion.
Steve Tusa: What percentage?
John Stauch: Larger than that increase because we're also putting back investment, Steve. So I think the next wave that we'll start to realize is the significant Wave 1 benefits of the purchasing savings and the direct material that we're doing. And you could assume that, as Bob said in prior comments that, that's a double-digit savings against about 1/3 of the material buy.
Steve Tusa: Sorry, one more on all this. Where will that show up in the bridges? Will that show up as -- in all parts of the bridges or productivity? So it won't be part of like inflation. If you if you execute better on some of those purchasing initiatives, maybe that shows up in net inflation? You're saying that the transfer -- all the transformation will be bucketed in that productivity bar?
John Stauch: Price bar and productivity bar, correct.
Steve Tusa: The price bar as well?
John Stauch: Well, price is the transformation work we're doing on the strategic price initiatives, right? So it's a piece of the price contribution and then the productivity of the transformation is a piece of the productivity contribution.
Operator: Our next question will come from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc.
David Tarantino : This is David Tarantino on for Jeff. Maybe just to attack the margins a bit different. Margin's been pretty impressive the last couple of quarters. Could you parse out what the price cost tailwinds just kind of from carryover and normal pricing actions and what was kind of the early benefits from the transformation program?
Robert Fishman: Yes. When you look at -- price has read out nicely in the first 2 quarters, that will moderate in the back half and basically land around that mid-single-digit price benefit for the year. We are taking advantage primarily of carryover pricing with that advantage. And just as a reminder, there were many years or at least a couple of years where we were catching up and price versus cost was a headwind. It has been a tailwind over the last few quarters. But think of that as mainly carryover pricing decisions we made last year that benefited the first half.
David Tarantino : Great. And then maybe just a cleanup one on Pool, maybe outside of the destock, how would you describe the sell-through in the channel versus expectations? It seems like trends were maybe a bit softer and then on that kind of -- maybe could you level set us on what you would expect the magnitude of the prebuy, like what's implied in the guide, given we've had an unusual recent couple of years?
John Stauch: Yes, I'll take the first one. I think sell-through as a whole this year through the first couple of quarters is slightly behind our original expectations. And I think that is a combination of some of the prebuys that happened in previous periods. It's also probably discretionary items that are being pushed out as consumers are dealing with the rest of their finances. And then as has been mentioned, from the industry. I think some of the finance Pools are slower than they were originally anticipated. As we go forward, and you look at early buy, we talk about normalized early buy. And about half of our Q4 shipments fall into those early buy categories. And the rest of the Q4 shipments are generally more standard orders. And we work those programs through the end of Q3 into Q4. And generally, we know what those orders are and wouldn't know what those orders are at the Q3 earnings call.
Operator: Our next question here comes from Damian Karas with UBS.
Damian Karas: Maybe in the spirit of the summer, a couple of follow-up questions on Pool. That business is obviously operating at a really healthy level of profitability despite the demand pressures you're facing now. Just curious how you're thinking about..
John Stauch: Your breaking up just a little bit.
Damian Karas: I apologize. Could you hear me?
John Stauch: If you wouldn't mind repeating the question, please?
Damian Karas: Yes, absolutely. So I just wanted to ask you about Pool margins. I mean it's very profitable right now despite the volume pressures, so how are you thinking about what that trajectory should look like next year as the inventory headwinds reverse and you get a demand recovery?
John Stauch: Do we have another question?
Operator: We'll move on to our next question from Nathan Jones with Stifel.
Nathan Jones: I will ask one on IFT. Volume has been pretty flat overall for the last couple of quarters. But you've talked about being more selective on projects. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about how much the growth is where you want to grow versus maybe how much the declines are where you're not looking to grow?
John Stauch: When you think of Flow, Nathan, you got to remind us that we've got a residential business around pumps, and that has been slow and down soft, right? And that's reflecting the residential trends in the Water Solutions as well as Pool. And so when we talk about Flows and overall growth, what we're really seeing is growth in infrastructure, commercial. As a reminder, commercial buildings aren't just office buildings, they also include data centers. They include warehousing. They include any type of infrastructure that would require or need fire pumps as well as water coming into that building and wastewater exiting that building. And so that has been a strategic point of ours, and we want to grow in those spaces. We're strong in those spaces. And so really what you've got is a residential, commercial and infrastructure mix here.
Nathan Jones: Okay. Maybe then just one more on the Water Solutions business. I think you -- there's basically inventory destocking going on there as well that you had expected to probably end in 2Q. Is that the case in where kind of a bit more back to sell-in matching sell-through in that business?
John Stauch: Yes. We're actually through most of the inventory challenges in the residential Water Solutions side of the business, Nathan. And what we have as a reminder is we exited direct-to-consumer businesses that we had, and we did that in Q4 last year, and so we're working through those year-over-year comps related to those decisions. And so the underlying growth of our core systems -- in our core components business is moderating, but it doesn't yet have inventory challenges or doesn't have inventory challenges.
Operator: Our next question here will come from Joe Giordano with Cowen.
Joe Giordano: So yes, we kind of touched on this, but IFT so like more than 100% of the growth is priced right now and the volumes were modestly negative. As you look into the second half, price moderates, like does volume from where we are today, do you expect that as the year progresses to further deteriorate? Or does that start to pick up some of the likely moderation of price?
John Stauch: We continue to believe on the Flow side, and remember, IFT is an industrial solutions business as well as Flow. I mean Flow has traditionally, we would think it is a low single-digit to mid-single-digit contributor and we're moderating back to those growth rates as we get to the second half, which we believe is normal. And then what we've got to do is make sure the mix of the business is start to contribute more to the margin expansion side. And we've gotten a lot of productivity and a lot of strategic projects out of C&I. But as a reminder, R&I tends to be the higher margin side of that business. And so we would expect that contribution get more normalized as we go forward.
Joe Giordano: Meaning volumes like don't necessarily reflect higher in the second half. Is that -- am I reading that right?
John Stauch: That's correct. Yes.
Joe Giordano: Okay. And then you guys -- you commented on Pool that you've done well and like adjusting headcount appropriately to the lower levels here. You have sizable revenue declines and margins up nicely. How do we think about margins as the volume start to come back, like as you need to add headcount? Like is this a good level to build off of, just like 30%, 70% rate? Or could there be kind of like -- for like -- a better way to say, like a lack of incremental margin expansion on revenue growth as that inflects?
John Stauch: It's a good basis to build off of. As we grow from here, we begin to get volume leverage on the on the overhead structure of the business. The only thing that would be an add-back is rebasing commissions that would be relative to selling the product throughout the channel. But when you think all that, growth is a really good thing and this is a really good level to model off of. With that, I'd like to provide some closing comments. Thank you to everybody for joining us today. And I wanted to reiterate our earnings call key themes: first, we had solid execution within our diversified portfolio along with price and transformation. These initiatives drove Q2 sales growth with margin expansion across all 3 segments; second, we continue to expect strength in our IFT and Water Solutions segments as well as transformation efficiencies to offset lower Pool volume in 2023; third, we raised our 2023 guidance due to strong Q2 and our confidence in the sustainability of our performance, driven by a diversified portfolio; and fourth, our transformation initiatives are reading out and expected to drive greater benefits beginning in Q4 and beyond as we implement actions towards identified savings. And finally, we expect to continue to deliver value creation beyond this fiscal year. Thank you, everyone. Have a great day.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you very much for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-04-27 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Pentair First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Shelly Hubbard, Vice President, Investor Relations. Shelly, please go ahead.
Shelly Hubbard: Thank you, MJ, and welcome to Pentair's first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. On the call with me are John Stauch, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Fishman, our Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, we will provide details on our first quarter's performance as outlined in this morning's press release. On the Pentair Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings release and slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provide a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures that we will reference. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's performance in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results. Before we begin, let me remind you that during our presentation today, we will make forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Pentair. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors in our most recent Form 10-Q, Form 10-K and today's release. Following our prepared remarks, we will open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a follow up then reenter the queue in order to allow everyone an opportunity to ask questions. Before I hand it over to John, I wanted to highlight Slides 4 through 6 in our earnings slide deck that illustrate our strategic framework, Pentair at a glance and a Pentair overview. We believe this information is helpful to understanding who Pentair is, especially for those new to Pentair. Our strategic framework states our purpose, mission, vision and values that drive our performance as a smart sustainable water solutions company. Pentair at a glance on Slide 5 provides a great snapshot of our company, our performance, our installed base and our 40-year track record – 47-year track record of annual dividend increases, which places us in a small group of companies. Lastly, the Pentair overview on Slide 6 provides our historical sales and ROS performance on a consolidated level and by segment. This information was first disclosed last quarter in the supplemental data section and is now illustrated on one slide. As you can see, over the last three years, we have grown sales by a compound annual growth rate of nearly 12% and ROS has expanded by 110 basis points on a consolidated basis. I will now turn the call over to John.
John Stauch: Thank you, Shelly. Good morning everyone. Let's begin with our strong Q1 results in the executive summary on Slide 7. We are very pleased with our first quarter performance, which reflected a strong start to our fiscal year as we help the world sustainably move, improve, enjoy water, life's most essential resource. Q1 sales rose 3% to over $1 billion, segment income increased 23% to $211 million, and ROS expanded by 330 basis points to 20.5%. Adjusted EPS rose over 7% to $0.91. Segment income and ROS each achieved record levels post the nVent separation in 2018. I'd like to thank our talented Pentair employees for once again delivering for customers while creating value for shareholders. Strong results reflect the strength of our diversified water portfolio and progress on our transformation initiatives, which drove greater efficiencies across each segment. For example, growth in our Industrial & Flow Technologies, or IFT, and Water Solutions segment more than offset the expected volume declines in Pool year-over-year. We improved ROS expansion across the enterprise and realized operational efficiencies as our transformation initiatives accelerated. We are driving these actions at the revenue stream or category level, which not only provides the go-to-market and customer insights, but also the ownership and accountability to realize savings and other opportunities that we have identified. Let's move on to Slide 8, titled Q1 Highlights. Within our IFT segment, growth was driven primarily across our commercial, industrial and even residential and irrigation verticals. We are excited about the near and long term growth and margin profile of this segment as our transformation is taking hold. We are focused on capturing the right projects with improved offerings to drive margin expansion. We realized benefits in pricing, sourcing and operational excellence, and we expect more opportunities ahead. We also had customer wins for our sustainability-related technology that reduces water usage and recapture CO2. Additionally, we drove aftermarket and replacement revenue in our membranes and pump portfolio. In our Water Solutions segment, we are very pleased with our Manitowoc Ice acquisition, which complements our commercial Water Solutions businesses, enabling us to provide end-to-end water solutions for customers from filtration to ice to services. The integration remains on track, has progressed well and was accretive to segment margins. As I mentioned last quarter, we expect 2023 to be a softer year for our Pool segment. During the first quarter, unusual U.S. weather in the west, expected higher channel inventory and strong demand in the prior year contributed to declining volume. Despite the decline in year-over-year volume, the installed base has continued to grow over the last three years, and we believe the Pool segment is an attractive market. As we look forward, we continue to invest in leading innovation, specifically automation, which helps to save energy, time and water and enables pool owners control of their pools directly from their smart device. Today, roughly 50% of installed pools have automated systems. This is an area where we see the greatest opportunity as consumers look to maintain control of their pool function at the tip of their fingers. Good examples of our latest pool innovations are the IntelliFlo3 Variable Speed and Flow Pool Pump, also known as the IF3 and the IntelliCenter pool Automation System. Our IF3 is the first pump with WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity for remote control monitoring and over-the-air, or OTA, updates. It also features built-in IoT connectivity, which simplifies installation setup and operation for our dealers. Market reactions and dealer feedback to the launch of our new flagship IF3 Pool Pump has been extremely positive, and we're pleased overall with the demand we have seen despite a slower start to the pool season. We believe our IntelliCenter Pool Automation System is the most feature-rich and expandable pool automation system on the market to easily control even the most complex and advanced pools. The system is powered by AWS Cloud technology for improved stability, connectivity, scheduling and reliability. Our digital automation technology centralizes control for multiple pool devices from water features to lights to pumps. In pool, lead times have continued to improve, enabling us to better serve our customers and deliver our products more quickly. Moving on to Slide 9, titled Making Better Essential. We recently released our 2022 corporate responsibility report on April 18, and we are excited that we have made progress on our strategic social responsibility targets. We are focused on advancing a sustainable future through innovation in our products and solutions to create a better world for people on the planet through smart, sustainable water solutions.  Turning to Slide 10, titled Social Responsibility Strategic Targets. In 2022, we reduced Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 29% as compared to our 2019 baseline and we decreased our water withdrawal, which represents a 9.3% reduction compared to 2021. We also implemented a sustainability scorecard process for all new Pentair product development to help us better understand the sustainability impact and opportunity of each new product. Moving to Slide 11, titled Positive Impacts from our Products and Solutions, we are proud of the continued progress we have made in our operations and towards sustainable products and solutions. A few examples include 37% of our total electricity usage came from renewable sources and 83% of Pentair's solutions support energy efficiency and 71% support water efficiency. For the eleventh consecutive year, Pentair has received the ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Award from the EPA. This award recognizes Pentair pool pumps and Manitowoc Ice excellence in energy efficiency. In fact, Pentair was the first manufacturer of pool equipment to receive this certification for our pool pumps. Since 2005, our ENERGY STAR pool pumps have saved a cumulative 38.9 billion kilowatt hours of energy savings, reduced greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 16 million tons of CO2 and saved over $5 billion in operating costs for U.S. consumers. Before I turn it over to Bob, let's turn to Slide 12, titled CEO Summary. We delivered quality earnings across our diversified portfolio and positioned the company for sustained value creation. Our Q1 performance was a strong start to our fiscal year, which reflected sales growth and ROS expansion driven by a diverse water portfolio as well as efficiencies from transformation. Manitowoc Ice has assimilated well and contributed ahead of expectations. Bob will discuss our second quarter and full year 2023 guidance in more detail. However, I wanted to share with you some of my thoughts on our current outlook. As we look to the remainder of 2023, we continue to closely monitor macroeconomic developments and remain mindful of an uncertain operating environment. We are implementing risk-mitigation strategies, and accelerating transformation funnels is necessary while focusing on investing in the long-term growth of our company. We've reduced our pool revenue expectations, reflecting both a lower sell-through due to economic uncertainty and the previously expected inventory headwinds, while increasing our expected margin expansion, reflecting Q1 performance and confidence in our transformation progress. We also expect Water Solutions and IFT performance to continue throughout 2023 as informed by orders, backlog and transformation efficiencies. As a result, we are raising the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance to $3.65, reflecting our strong Q1 performance while maintaining the high end of our adjusted EPS guidance range at $3.70. We are confident in our diversified water business model, long-term strategy and our transformation initiatives, which we anticipate will continue to drive shareholder returns. We have a long successful track record of generating strong cash flow and being disciplined with capital allocation. This year marks our 47th consecutive year of dividend increases. And longer term, we are targeting getting back to high teens ROIC. We have the right purpose, the right team, the right portfolio and the right strategy to win in this market. We believe we have a very solid foundation and the competitive advantages to continue to succeed. I will now pass the call over to Bob, who will discuss our performance and financial results in more detail. Bob?
Bob Fishman: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 13, titled Q1 2023 Pentair Performance. We delivered better-than-expected first quarter sales growth of 3% driven by pricing benefits across all three segments and the contribution of our Manitowoc Ice acquisition, which were partially offset by volume declines in our residential businesses. Our higher-than-expected sales in the quarter were driven by better performance in IFT and Water Solutions, offset by slightly lower-than-expected sales in our Pool segment, primarily due to unusual weather in the West. Core sales declined 3% mainly driven by a 16% decrease in Pool after Pool grew 23% in last year's Q1 and 48% in Q1 of 2021, partially offset by core growth of 11% in IFT and 2% in Water Solutions. First quarter segment income increased 23%, and return on sales expanded 330 basis points year-over-year to 20.5%, driven by price more than offsetting inflation, productivity benefits from our transformation initiatives and accretive margins from our Manitowoc Ice acquisition. As John mentioned, both segment income and ROS in Q1 hit record levels post separation of nVent. We delivered better-than-expected adjusted EPS of $0.91, up 7% versus the prior year. Net interest and other expense was $33 million, and our adjusted tax rate was 15% during the quarter with a share count of 165.8 million. Our better-than-expected segment income and adjusted EPS were driven by higher sales, price offsetting inflation and better contribution from our transformation initiatives. Please turn to Slide 14, labeled Q1 2023 Industrial & Flow Technologies Performance. IFT sales increased 9% in the quarter, which included two points of FX headwinds. Core sales increased 11%, segment income grew 25% and return on sales expanded 200 basis points to 16.6%, marking the third consecutive quarter of equal to or greater than 200 basis points of improvement. The strong margin expansion was a result of price offsetting inflation and continued progress on our transformation initiatives. Sales growth in IFT was driven across all businesses, led by commercial flow and industrial solutions, along with growth in residential flow. Please turn to Slide 15, labeled Q1 2023 Water Solutions Performance. In Q1, Water Solutions sales increased 32% driven by our Manitowoc Ice acquisition and price. Core sales grew 2%. The three points of volume decline was primarily due to the continued inventory correction across many product lines in our residential channels. Segment income grew 136%, and return on sales expanded 850 basis points to 19.3%, driven by our ICE acquisition as well as efficiencies from our transformation initiatives. Please turn to Slide 16, labeled Q1 2023 Pool Performance. In Q1, Pool sales declined 16%, which was slightly below our expectations. The volume decline of 27 points was primarily due to unusual weather in the Western U.S. in the first quarter of this year, inventory corrections in this year's Q1 and a strong prior year comparison. The pricing benefit of 11 points helped partially offset the volume decline and was due to carryover from the prior year. Despite lower sales year-over-year, return on sales expanded 520 basis points to 31.9% due to price significantly offsetting inflation, rightsizing to lower volumes and benefits from our transformation initiatives. Please turn to Slide 17, labeled Transformation Expectations. We continue to make progress on our transformation with realized successes in Q1 regarding pricing and sourcing, which drove margin expansion. As we shared with you last quarter, we expect to drive ROS expansion of over 400 basis points by year-end 2025 as compared to 2022. As I mentioned last quarter, in pricing, we completed wave one, which established a new strategic pricing playbook. This creates a foundation for pricing across our different go-to-market strategies and includes looking at our dealer and distributor programs to better optimize them. We continue to gain insight into profitability by customer and product category and use this data to better drive our forecast. We believe pricing remains a big opportunity. We are building capabilities and starting to see benefits materialize. We expect future waves to include the implementation of a pricing playbook across all of our product categories. We are furthest along in our strategic sourcing initiatives. As I've mentioned previously, material costs represent roughly 40% of our revenue. We have completed wave one negotiations that focused on key categories like electronics, motors and drives, castings, packaging, logistics and MRO. Wave one included roughly 35% of material spend and identified over 12% in saving opportunities. We have unlocked value through supplier-dedicated resources, supply base reduction, inventory solutions, enhanced supplier executive-level relationships and rebate programs. In Q1, over 120 Pentair cross-functional team members attended workshops to begin the wave one implementation process. Wave two was launched in Q1 and covers another 35% of material spend for commodity groups, such as metals, plastics and molding, purchased finished goods, transportation, and indirect spend such as IT, fleet management and office supplies. We expect this will create a funnel of savings for 2023 and 2024. In operations excellence, we are focused on reducing complexity and driving lean processes across all our operations. We believe this presents longer-term opportunities but not until 2024 and beyond as we build out the funnel. Lastly, in organizational effectiveness we are focusing on sales and functional excellence to simplify our organization. From an organizational standpoint, we believe ample opportunities remain for complexity reduction across the entire portfolio and a realignment of needed skills within our top priorities. We continue to move transformation from funnel to execution, and we expect more material benefits to contribute to our longer-term margin expansion targets. We continue to believe that our transformation initiatives will be a large value-creation opportunity for Pentair. Please turn to Slide 18, labeled balance sheet and cash flow. This slide reflects the closing of the Manitowoc acquisition at the end of July of last year. We ended the quarter with pro forma leverage at 2.6 times. Our ROIC was at 15.2%, and as a reminder this includes debt from the Manitowoc Ice acquisition with only approximately 3/4 of Manitowoc EBITDA contribution. We recently entered into interest rate swap and collar agreements in order to hedge our variable rate debt. We now expect the mix of variable to fixed debt to be closer to 50/50 by the end of Q2. We have no significant long-term debt maturing for the next few years, and almost the majority of our debt is in term loans going out three to five years. We used $123 million of free cash flow in Q1, which reflects typical seasonality and was roughly $25 million better than the prior year. As a reminder, the second quarter is typically our highest free cash flow quarter of the year, and we expect full year free cash flow to be in line with our historical performance of 100% of net income. We plan to remain disciplined with our capital and continue to focus on debt reduction amid the higher interest rate environment. Moving to Slide 19, titled Q2 and full year 2023 Pentair outlook. For the full year we are updating adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $3.60 to $3.70, raising the midpoint. Also for the full year we expect sales to be roughly down 2% to flat. We expect segment income to increase 7% to 10% with corporate expense of approximately $80 million, net interest expense of roughly $125 million, and adjusted tax rate of approximately 15% and a share count of 165 million to 166 million. For the second quarter, we expect sales to be approximately down 1% to flat versus last year's Q2 as the contribution of Manitowoc Ice and our commercial and industrial businesses are expected to help offset expected volume declines from our residential businesses. We are introducing adjusted EPS guidance of approximately $0.94 to $0.96, which represents a year-over-year decrease of approximately 6% to 8%, primarily due to lower pool volumes. We expect an improvement in the second quarter versus the $0.91 of adjusted EPS in Q1. We expect segment income to increase 5% to 7% with corporate expense coming in around $21 million, net interest expense of roughly $34 million, and adjusted tax rate of approximately 15% and a share count of 165 million to 166 million. Moving to Slide 20, titled full year 2023 guidance at midpoint. At the midpoint, we expect total Pentair sales to be down approximately 1%. While the sales midpoint has not changed, our sales mix and assumptions have. We now expect IFT to perform better than we expected 90 days ago and Pool sales to decline from our original expectations due to increased economic uncertainty and lower new pool construction. We now expect IFT sales to be up low-single digits, Water Solutions to be unchanged with sales up mid-teens and Pool sales to be down approximately in the mid-teen range as compared to down low-double digits previously. As we have discussed in prior quarters, our Pool sales consist of 20% from new pools, 20% from remodels and 60% from the aftermarket. Within our current Pool guidance, we now expect new pools and remodels to be down approximately 25% versus previous assumptions of down approximately 20% and inventory in aftermarket to be down roughly 20% compared to previous assumptions of down 15% with approximately two-thirds of the decline relating to inventory corrections. We expect price carryover of roughly mid-single digits. We do expect Pool to return to more normalized demand in 2024 after absorbing significant headwinds in the current year. Segment income is now expected to increase approximately 9% as compared to 8% previously with ROS expansion of nearly 200 basis points to 20.5% as compared to 20.2% last quarter. We are encouraged by the diversity of our portfolio, the integration of Manitowoc Ice and the continued momentum of our transformation initiatives, which are expected to drive significant margin expansion. Before I turn the call over for Q&A, I wanted to highlight why we believe that Pentair is a compelling investment opportunity. Please turn to Slide 21. There are six distinguishing characteristics that we believe sets Pentair apart. We are an industry leader with a diversified brand portfolio and a focus on driving innovation across all three segments. We have a transformation strategy that is expected to drive operational efficiencies and margin expansion. We have an ESG focus on people, the planet and governance to provide smart, sustainable water solutions. And we just recently published our 2022 corporate responsibility report, highlighting progress towards our strategic targets. We have favorable secular trends driving end-market growth. We have a strong balance sheet and cash flow, which we expect to drive additional value creation. And we are a dividend aristocrat with 47 consecutive years of increasing dividends. I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for Q&A, after which, John will have a few closing remarks. MJ, please open the line for questions. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Mike Halloran with Baird. Please go ahead.
Mike Halloran: Hi. Good morning everyone. Really nice quarter, really nice quarter. So a couple of questions here. First on the Man Ice side of things. Maybe can you just talk a little bit about where you're seeing the outperformance from and then also a little bit of context on how you're looking at the forward outlook? What kind of visibility you have? What customers are saying? Any kind of context around that?
Bob Fishman: See the Manitowoc Ice performance has been significant from our perspective. We – I often get asked the question. So this year, in Q1, we drove roughly $95 million of sales in Manitowoc, and that's versus them doing around $75 million last year. And again, think of that business as high 20s from a margin perspective. I would say one thing that's helped is they have significant backlog in the business. They're clearing that. But probably more importantly, if you think about the go-to-market strategy, as we combine ice services and our commercial filtration business, my view is that one plus one plus one adds up to more than three, and the opportunity to go-to-market in that way has really helped the business.
Mike Halloran: And then on the pool side of things, obviously, the margins were particularly impressive given where the volume levels we're at. Maybe you can just frame, provide a little bit more context around the drivers behind that? I know you commented on price transformation, but a little more detail on that. And then how should we think of the sustainability of this margin range, particularly given you still have a lot of volume variability ahead of you?
John Stauch: Yes. Mike, I'll tag team this one. And I think we talked openly last couple of years about the inefficiencies in our manufacturing process from not having our supply chain aligned to the volume demands. And those inefficiencies came from freight premiums to get product in and out as well as the overtime that we were running in our factories. As we were able to have more visibility and clarity on the demand throughout the channel, Mike, we were able to eliminate most of those inefficiencies. And spot buys are a big piece of what we are dealing with, too, and we saw huge positive impacts in Q1 regarding that. I share that because while we're getting some of the transformation benefits in pool, what really ups our confidence as most of the transformation benefits around the ongoing sourcing savings and the operational efficiencies really are in the later quarters and we have a lot of confidence that we're going to realize those in addition to these inefficiencies going away.
Bob Fishman: The only thing I would add is I think pool has done a really nice job back in Q3, Q4 of last year and seeing the channel correction ahead of us, they did a nice job of rightsizing to those lower volumes.
Mike Halloran: Thanks John and Bob. I appreciate it.
John Stauch: Thanks Mike.
Operator: The next question comes from Bryan Blair with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Bryan Blair: Thank you. Good morning everyone.
Bob Fishman: Good morning.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Bryan Blair: Actually wanted to follow up on Mike's question on the Manitowoc outperformance. Obviously, pacing ahead of plan. You mentioned the strong pro forma growth year-on-year. Is high 20s margin an EBITDA or ROS figure, just to clarify on that? And how should we think about that phasing through the year, whether there's lift possible? And are you willing to speak to a new accretion range for 2023?
Bob Fishman: It is a ROS number to answer your first question. And again, our view is that Manitowoc Ice is an extremely well-run business as part of our portfolio. Our goal is to continue to keep the margins in that high 20s range and have them take advantage of the transformation initiatives as well. But we don't want to get ahead of ourselves with that business either. For now, the performance is going exceptionally well.
John Stauch: And as a reminder, when COVID evolved, I mean, the space that we're in took one of the bigger hits across the Pentair portfolio, right? So we're still dealing with global openings of restaurants, hospitality, gyms, et cetera. And that's really driving the trends in our foodservice operations, both with Manitowoc performance, but also with our Everpure filtration and our services operations as well. So really feel good that we've got visibility in this space and that we're coming together to solve some customer solutions in a way that make those customers want to continue to work with us.
Bryan Blair: All makes sense. It's good to hear. And within Water Solutions, resi weakness to start the year, that was obviously anticipated. Any update you can offer, insight into current channel trends and whether over the next couple of quarters, we may be more in balance in terms of channel inventory?
John Stauch: Yes. As a reminder, we've had – part of this delta negative year-over-year is driven by our exits of our direct-to-consumer initiatives. But when you look at the core underlying residential water treatment trends, they're still positive and encouraging as people are looking for the best water that they can have in their homes. And when you look across your channels, we're still seeing modest growth across most of our end channels.
Bryan Blair: Understood. I appreciate the color.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Brett Linzey with Mizuho Americas. Please go ahead.
Brett Linzey: Hi. Good morning all.
Bob Fishman: Good morning.
Brett Linzey: Hi. I want to come back to wave two of the transformation. It sounds like you've got a lot of organizational muscle around these opportunities. With regards to wave two, is there anything unique about the phasing or the timing of the benefits relative to wave one? Or should we think of this as sort of linear through 2024?
Bob Fishman: Yes. And just as a reminder, we have the four major initiatives in transformation. They all have different waves, in particular, around sourcing the wave one negotiations is complete now. So we're moving on to the wave one implementation, and at the same time running a parallel activity around the next $500 million, $600 million of spend in wave two. So our view is it's a really nice runway that benefits more significantly in 2024, but then also gives us upside in 2025 and beyond.
Brett Linzey: Okay. Got it. And just on price, I mean, the traction continues to be very strong there. Was Q1 in line with your Q1 expectation? Or did that realization come in a little bit better? I'm just curious if there might be a little upward tension on that 5% assumption for the full year.
Bob Fishman: It was a little bit better than we expected. We always knew that Q1 would be our better price quarter and that it would slowly come down throughout the year. But we have seen less discounting than we thought. So we're certainly comfortable with pricing and had a little bit of upside in the first quarter.
Brett Linzey: All right, got it. Great quarter. Thanks.
Bob Fishman: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Andy Kaplowitz: Hi. Good morning everyone.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Bob Fishman: Hi, Andy.
Andy Kaplowitz: I am just focusing on the overall pool market for a second. Can you possibly quantify how much weather impacted your pool equipment business in the quarter? And are you still thinking normalization of pool markets occurs, end of Q2 or Q3? And I think you've been focused on attempting to take share back this year as supply chains have improved in pool? Have you been able to do that?
Bob Fishman: So to start the question, it was a couple of points relating to weather in Q1. So it did cause us to come in slightly lower than what we thought. We – our belief is still that we are back to normal inventory levels by the end of the pool season, which will be the third quarter. So that continues to be our assumption there. Third part of your question, Andy, was what?
Andy Kaplowitz: Share. As supply chains have gotten better, have you been able to sort of get more equipment into the market and take some share?
John Stauch: Yes. I mean we're excited about the new product offerings, as I mentioned, and getting the industry and the market again focused on those new products. I think when everybody is busy and things are active, you just kind of want to put in more of the products that you know very well. So we've been very actively training the dealer channels on the new IF3 Pump, as I mentioned in my comments, which was really the first product that has the Internet capability and WiFi and Bluetooth built into the pump itself, which allows us for some basic features that can be run without the full automation pad. The second one that we launched is – we're excited about our new IntelliCenter and the improvement in the IntelliCenter app, which we've been able to, again, get the channel excited about. And then the third element that we still have coming is a new filtration capability both for safety and clarity of space. So I think if we talk about winning, it's going to come from new products and having, again, the most innovative products for the channel and getting the channel excited to be partnered with Pentair to bring those to the consumers.
Andy Kaplowitz: And then, John, your CapEx businesses, such as industrial solutions, continues to look strong. Can you talk about the durability of the CapEx cycle? What are your conversations like with customers at this point across that IFT segment?
John Stauch: Yes. I'm extremely impressed with the IFT team both under Jerome's leadership when he was there and the way that De'Mon has continued to lead it. Our business leaders know that what we want is predictable growth and growth that comes both profitable on the project element but also brings with it the aftermarket and services component. So we've limited the growth opportunity to those projects that we feel like we can bring forward at a positive margin for Pentair and also then bring on those future businesses. So I think we feel good about the engagements we have with the customer space, the investments that are happening and the solutions we're providing, which again are taking waste to value. So, in most cases, these projects are bringing value to our end customers while they are investing in it. So, we're keeping an eye on it. You would expect higher interest rates to slow that industrial investment. But right now, from what we can see, the pipeline remains strong.
Andy Kaplowitz: Appreciate the color, nice quarter guys.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Saree Boroditsky: Thanks for taking my questions. Just kind of building a little bit on Pool. You talked about inventory normalizing after the Pool season. So if you could just update on how you're thinking about the early buy potential as we get into 4Q and what that should look like as we get into 2024? Thanks.
Bob Fishman: We expect early buy to return to normalized levels. It was roughly at normalized levels as we closed out 2022. So no significant difference there. Again, as we said, from our perspective, the inventory correction should be done by the end of the Pool season, and then we can return to more normalized growth.
Saree Boroditsky: Thanks. And when you talk about the demand normalizing for 2024, I know it's really early, but any color on how we should think about new pool construction versus aftermarket if we are entering a weaker macro environment? And then how are you thinking about price increases, does that normalize after the recent high levels we've seen?
Bob Fishman: From a new pool construction perspective, we mentioned that we assume that new pools would be down in that kind of 25% to 30% range. So, again, think of new pool construction around that 80,000 mark back in 2018, and 2019, and 2021 declined to around 115,000; 2022, about 100,000 new pools; and this year, we're estimating kind of in that 70,000 to 75,000 range. Our view is that a lot of this is predicated on interest rates and the macroeconomic environment, but we do expect growth in new pools next year, more normalized demand across the aftermarket, really the inventory correction done. So, when you think about 2024, you are looking at normalized growth against 2023 that has significant headwinds. So, we are optimistic that as we turn the corner here in 2023, we have a positive story for Pool. And just as a reminder, we had started the year saying that Pool would be down low double digits. We did change that assumption to down low mid-teens. And if you think about that, we are absorbing about $100 million more of a headwind than what we thought at the beginning of the year. So, if you take the low end of double digit down and you take the high end of mid-teens, there is $100 million that we think will work its way through this year, again, setting ourselves up for a better 2024. And that, again, is one of the reasons why we were pleased to bring up the midpoint of our guidance this year that even with that headwind we were able to increase with the strength of IFT, Manitowoc Ice and the great start to the year.
Saree Boroditsky: I appreciate the color. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Nathan Jones: Good morning everyone.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Nathan Jones: Follow-up on Manitowoc Ice to start with, Bob, you talked about them working down backlog in the quarter. Can you quantify kind of that increasing sales from 75 to 95, how much of that was burning off backlog? And are we going to be talking about a difficult comp there next year with that backlog reduction contributing to the performance in the first quarter?
Bob Fishman: A piece was backlog, Nathan, I don't have the split between what was backlog. As we mentioned last year, backlog has been strong in Manitowoc Ice at the – since we acquired the business in July. But overall, our view is to go-to-market not only with Manitowoc Ice but with commercial filtration and services. And historically, this business has been a very consistent grower. So our view is Manitowoc Ice will continue to perform well.
John Stauch: Yes. Nate, and if you look at order rates, our order rates there continue to be strong in the space. I don't think we would believe that our normal organic growth rates in the ice business will maintain at these levels. But right now, the visibility would suggest that getting back to being able to ship at the same order rates is where we're at today, and we'll begin to work that backlog down as we exit the year.
Nathan Jones: Thank, that's helpful. And then maybe a broad one across the portfolio. We've talked a fair bit about lead times coming down across a lot of your businesses. Are there businesses that still have lead times that are longer than where they were before COVID 2019 kind of timeframe? Are you back to more normalized lead times across all the businesses? You're going to see normalization of order rates, normalization of inventory levels, and we should be basically done talking about this stuff by the end of the year?
John Stauch : In the majority of our businesses across the majority of the high-running SKUs, we're back to normalized lead times. We still have a few specialized products and SKUs, but those are becoming fewer and fewer quarter-by-quarter.
Nathan Jones: Great. Thanks for the color.
John Stauch : Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst : Hey everyone. This is Miguel on for Brian. I just had one question, maybe high level. For the – for your commercial end markets, have you seen any concerns out there on financing just given everything going on with the banking sector? I guess, what are you seeing in real time there, if anything at all? Thanks.
John Stauch: Yes. I mean, I think, we're all expecting it. We don't have a huge commercial building offering. We generally provide the fire pumps and then the aftermarket service pumps into that space. And then we do have some pumps that connect the building of commercials back into the city water aspects. And yes, I think, we're anticipating that higher interest rates will put pressure on those buildings and the REITs that own them and the challenges in that space. But it's going to be a modest impact to Pentair just because of the size of the business offering we have there.
Unidentified Analyst : Okay, fair enough. Thanks a lot. I’ll pass it on.
Operator: The next question is from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Steve Tusa: Hi guys, good morning.
John Stauch: Hi Steve how are you?
Bob Fishman: Hi Steve.
Steve Tusa: On the IFT growth, I know you guys went through it a little bit. I might have missed it at the beginning of the call, but the commercial and industrial solutions up mid-teens. Any more like any deeper color you can give on like the types of end markets that were driving the growth there and why that was so strong?
John Stauch: Yes. So I mean, first of all, relative size, this business has been really focused. We're talking about those two markets, Steve, being roughly around 300 and some change on an annualized basis for us, so just to frame what the teens growth would be. And I think these are projects that we won primarily to our focus around the aftermarket, the services. And again, as I mentioned, we're into larger irrigation, we're into industrial wastewater, and we're also into commercial buildings. That would be the end markets.
Steve Tusa: Okay. And those were – I think that was stronger than you guys had expected in the quarter? Is that right?
John Stauch: Well, I think it's probably in line with our expectations, but it's stronger than historical averages. Correct.
Steve Tusa: Right, okay. And then as far as the behavior of your customers on the Pool side, any color seasonally on how you would expect 3Q and 4Q to play out EPS-wise? And you've given us the 2Q guide, but the third and the fourth quarter, anything to note kind of seasonally there? I guess this goes to kind of like the pre-buy question in the fourth quarter?
Bob Fishman: No doubt that that pool will face down 16%. They will be down a little more than that in Q2 and Q3 and then should be turning the corner in the fourth quarter. So, from an EPS perspective, we think Q3 will probably be the most challenging quarter, and then Q4 EPS will improve as a lot of these transformation initiatives kick in and then Pool starts to improve.
Steve Tusa: One more…
John Stauch: Steve, we don't anticipate that there is hardly any dealer inventory out in the channel anymore. And obviously, the financing that they are paying, they are working more of their jobs in the sense of how do they bill and pay in the same cycle. And so the inventory we are referring to is the channel inventory distributors. And based upon feedback and conversations, everybody is aligned to try and burn all that inventory by the end of Q3, which would mean for us, our normalized Q2 will be a lot lower than normal. And then we'd expect that to be gone and behind us by the end of Q3, meaning we're growing sequentially from Q3 to Q4 for Pool and then continue to grow from there as we head through 2024.
Steve Tusa: One more question. When it comes to pricing, are you approaching this year any differently than you have in the past? And is there – like what's the exit rate on your price capture into next year? Should we assume that that's a normal price capture? Or is there – are there signs that with the downturn that people are getting maybe aggressive in pockets?
John Stauch: I think we would be going back to really normal areas, Steve.
Steve Tusa: Which is what, like a couple of percent?
John Stauch: Low single digits, like more normalized based upon – I mean way too early to call it, but I mean, your general assumptions are making sure that you're selling the value, that you're going out and you're pricing effectively and you're being able to handle any fluctuations in commodity or labor wages.
Steve Tusa: Yes, okay. Great. Thanks for the color as always.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Scott Graham with Loop Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Scott Graham: Hey good morning all. Thank you for taking my question. I was – just on Slide 20, where you break down the Pool view for the year. So the new remodel went from 20% to down 25%. How much of that was the first quarter weather was there, I mean, how much of this is sort of rest of the year versus what's already happened?
Bob Fishman: It really wasn't weather-related as much as it was just the economic uncertainty, the higher interest rates. So that was our assumption was that by bringing new and remodel down 5%, it was more related to that.
John Stauch: Yes. And then, Scott, it's Q2 and Q3 and Q4, not Q1. I mean, Q1 related to the West weather, but most of all this adjustment is in Q2, Q3 and Q4.
Scott Graham: Okay. Got it. Makes sense. And to the same end, well not the same, the aftermarket inventory. Last quarter, you were kind enough to sort of parse that out between impacts of aftermarket versus inventory. Could you give some color on that this time?
Bob Fishman: Yes. Our view is the mix of that, so the down 20% is roughly two-thirds relating to the inventory correction and a third relating to the aftermarket or items that were bought in advance over the last couple of years, so think heaters, lighting, those types of products.
Scott Graham: Yes. Got it. Thank you. And last question is kind of going back to the commercial water. We've kind of had some fits and starts in that business with varying distribution plans and different channels and what have you. Could you kind of tell us, what is Manitowoc Ice doing for you in commercial? I know you have, you sort of lined up that in Everpure when you first bought this, but we're now kind of into this thing. What are you guys doing in the market right now to really leverage the three pieces of this business?
John Stauch: Yes. I appreciate the question. I mean, first of all I'd say the fits and starts are more on the residential side. Global business and always experimenting or trying to think about how to go to market differently. We're now convinced that just accepting where we are with our pro channel, partner with their pro channel, drive leads to pro channel, that's our strategy in residential, and that's going to be consistent as we go forward. On the commercial side, we've always had a strong offering with our filtration products in Everpure and the RO systems that we sell into our commercial customers. What Manitowoc brings is added strength and capability across a wider selection of customers. And ultimately, we're able to discuss the end-to-end solutions that really drive productivity and value to our core OEM customers. So very excited and very pleased with the progress. And as a reminder, I mean, we're using the Manitowoc team to run that combined business. And we've integrated all those go-to-market strategies under one leadership team, and I believe that that's going to drive sustained value for our customers.
Scott Graham: Thanks a lot.
Operator: The next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning everyone.
John Stauch: Good morning, Deane.
Bob Fishman: Hi Deane.
Deane Dray: Just a couple of cleanup questions here. Just a follow-up on the banking turmoil question, you answered it with regard to commercial construction. Interested in hearing if there's any sort of impact on the Pool side or consumer water side, maybe dealer financing. Some customers finance a pool construction with a personal loan. Just is there anything at the margin that you would call out there?
John Stauch: Yes. I think it's going to vary by geography and demographics. I think all of us that serve the channel, Deane, believe that there is some economic turmoil that could come from these current interest rates and the impact it has on varying degrees of consumers and buyers. And I think that's in Bob's expectation of the lower new Pool sales. Also, I think we're going to see it slightly impacting the remodeling space as well because a lot of those remodel pools might have used some form of home equity or some type of borrowing to do it. I think the bigger uncertainty is what happens to where interest rates are and when they settle out. So we're hopeful that we get clarity as we exit this year and people can predict what the longer-term interest rates will be.
Deane Dray: Yes. That's really helpful. That's the way we've been thinking about it. And just to clarify on the Pool outlook, a year ago or so we were talking about how you were supply constrained on the number of construction capacity. Where does that stand? Is it – are they able to fill all the demand? Is the supply of labor at all part of this equation?
John Stauch: Yes. We believe that they'll be at the more normalized areas. I mean, I think they're finishing up the backlog that they had that was pre-bought and they're out then probably trying to sell the remodeled pools and the upgrades on the pool equipment, which will bring us back into more, what I call normal pattern of how our dealer channel works to provide value for us and our consumers.
Deane Dray: Great. And just last one for me, for Bob. Gross margin was significantly above our expectations. I know that's a high-quality problem to have to answer. But if you could just take us through what the impact was, maybe – is there a carryover pricing? Just how do you give color there, please?
Bob Fishman: Yes. I couldn't have been more pleased with the margin expansion. From our perspective, it was a number of different drivers that should drive sustainable margin expansion in the future. So to the earlier point made, we did a much better job of removing the inefficiencies that existed last year. So think about logistics, think about air freight, think about even spot buy on electronics, all getting better in the first quarter. Again, our price read out better than expected because we didn't have to do the discounting that we had perhaps put in as an assumption but felt good about how pricing read out from the carryover activities that we had done. The accretive nature of Manitowoc; and then finally, just the transformation initiatives, including rightsizing to those lower volumes in pool. Those are all things that we got significantly better at in Q1 and should be sustainable as we go forward.
Operator: The next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Julian Mitchell: Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to look at the sort of the EBIT bridge assumptions that you've got laid out. Just trying to understand, when I'm looking at that first quarter on Slide 13, you've got that sort of close to $60 million headwind for the year from inflation, the productivity tailwind very narrow in the quarter at $6 million. As you look at the year as a whole, how are you thinking about those two pieces, inflation and productivity, kind of as we go through the year? Does inflation narrow as a headwind steadily and productivity move up steadily? Sort of anything you could flesh out on those two pieces, please?
John Stauch: I think you nailed it. I think our year-over-year price contribution starts to anniversary some of the price increases we've put in midyear and three quarters away through last year. And you got it; we continue to see productivity sequentially getting better. And we think inflation starts to slide off here as it wraps around on year-over-year headwinds that it compares to.
Julian Mitchell: And then just my quick follow-up. The pool market, I realized there's been about 82 questions on it, but just your revenue guide down mid-teens for the year, it's not that different from kind of what you did in Q1 year-on-year. So just trying to understand sort of the year-on-year cadence, like what's the kind of exit rate in Q4 – the Q4 sort of sales decline rates, assuming that you have succeeded in getting those inventories back to normal by the beginning of Q4? Because I noticed that in, say, the water piece residential there, you're down 25% in Q1. The year has guided only down 10%, so we can kind of understand the steep rate of narrowing declines through the year and makes sense given the comps and everything else. Just want to understand in Pool how we think about that down mid-teens off the kind of down mid-teens in Q1 already?
John Stauch: Yes. Think about the biggest impact to Q2 and Q3 just being the inventory headwinds that we're experiencing. We'll still run up in Q4 of last year, some of the year-over-year challenges with early buy but will generally be slightly positive. And we'd expect to then have the tailwind of not having that inventory burn as we head into 2024.
Operator: The last question comes from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Joe Giordano: Hey, good morning guys.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Joe Giordano: So on IFT, I mean, obviously what's going on there is interesting in a macro uncertain environment to have the margin expansion that you can have here. But it's been exclusively driven by on the top line by price like three quarters now. So as we get into a different type of market eventually where we want to see the growth side, how do you position that portfolio to be able to capitalize on like an up-cycle rather than right now capitalizing on like a flat down-cycle?
John Stauch: Yes. I mean real quickly. I mean there's several revenue streams in IFT. And we've got our focus on the ones that are higher value. And yes, to your point we're being very critical to what projects we take on, which ones we don't. And as we start to work with our customers, I do think you'll be able to see this business produce on a regular basis low-single digits, in line with our expectations with more of that being value and less being a price contribution.
Joe Giordano: Fair enough. And then we've kind of danced around this, but like in Pool in the fourth quarter possible that, that's up, right, organically?
Bob Fishman: It's possible. Our view, roughly flat to up slightly would be our view now after that inventory correction makes its way through in Q2 and Q3.
Joe Giordano: Yes. That’s all I had. Thanks guys.
Bob Fishman: Thank you.
John Stauch: All right. Well, thank you for joining us. We know this is a busy earnings day. I just want to reiterate our earnings call key themes in case some missed part of our call. First, our diversified portfolio and transformation initiatives drove Q1 sales growth with margin expansion across all three segments. Second, we expect strength in our Water Solutions and IFT segments as well as transformation efficiencies to drive upside. Third, we raised the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guide due to Q1's strong start as well as our confidence in the sustainability of our performance, while acknowledging that we expect Pool to be softer than we had initially expected. Fourth, our transformation initiatives are expected to drive greater benefits later in full year 2023 and beyond, and we implement actions towards identified savings. And we expect to continue to deliver value creation beyond this 2023 fiscal year. Thank you, everyone, and enjoy your day.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-01-31 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Pentair Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Shelly Hubbard, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Shelly Hubbard: Thank you, Kate, and welcome to Pentair's fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. On the call with me are John Stauch, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Fishman, our Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, we will provide details on our fourth quarter and full year performance as outlined in this morning's press release. On the Pentair Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings release and slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provide a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures that we will reference. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's performance in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results. Before we begin, let me remind you that during our presentation today, we will make forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Pentair. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K and today's release. We will also reference certain non-GAAP measures. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call up for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a follow-up, then re-enter the queue in order to allow everyone an opportunity to ask questions. I will now turn the call over to John.
John Stauch: Thank you, Shelly, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with Slide 4, titled Executive Summary. We closed out 2022 with strong sales, segment income and adjusted EPS, which is a direct result of the hard work and dedication of our focused employees across the world. Sales increased 9% to $4.1 billion; segment income rose 12% to $768 million; ROS expanded by 40 basis points to 18.6%; and adjusted EPS increased 8% to $3.68. A few of our key wins during the year include: strategic progress on our transformation initiatives, which we expect to drive significant margin expansion over the next several years; the acquisition of Manitowoc Ice, a complementary and accretive acquisition which further enhances our commercial water solutions business; and recognition for our leadership in social responsibility and sustainability. All in, we are focused on building the Pentair in the future by investing in sustainable growth and expanding profitability through strengthening our operational and financial foundation, which we expect to create long-term value for our stakeholders. Bob will discuss our first quarter and full year 2023 guidance in more detail, but I wanted to share some [Technical Difficulty] thoughts. We are confident in our business model, diversified portfolio and our transformation initiatives, which we expect to drive long-term shareholder value and contribute significantly to 2023. As we look specifically at 2023, we are working through near-term macroeconomic-driven challenges, which we are driving -- which is driving lower-than-expected volumes in our residential businesses. However, we expect to see more normalized demand in 2024 and view 2023 as a catch-up year for excess demand that was realized in 2020 through the first half of 2022. Please turn to Slide 5, titled 5 Year Pentair Performance. Reflecting on the last five years is a focused, smart, sustainable water solutions company. We drove strong financial performance by: increasing revenue at an 8% compounded annual growth rate; increasing EPS at a 14% compounded annual growth rate; and we have also generated over $2 billion of free cash flow; and ended 2022 with nearly a 16% ROIC. These are metrics that we are very proud of and share with our incredible team here at Pentair. This is a testament to our relentless efforts to deliver premium quality, innovative products and services to our consumers. We believe the largest opportunity is improving ROS, which did not improve materially over the last five years. The strong demand we realized later in 2020 through the first half of 2022 came with disrupted supply chains and unprecedented inflation that was hard to outpace. We believe our second half of 2022 demonstrates that we have finally made progress on price versus cost. However, we still have significant opportunities to improve our operating and cost efficiencies across all of Pentair through transformation and recovery of the inefficiencies that we realized. Please turn to Slide 6, labeled Pentair at a Glance. For those of you listening today who may be new to our story, I wanted to reiterate a few important key metrics that I discussed last quarter. In 2022, we generated $4.1 billion in sales with approximately a 50% mix from residential channels and 50% from commercial, industrial and infrastructure channels. We have decent profitability at 18.6%, but as I mentioned previously, we have a lot of opportunity to improve this. We believe our large installed base is an advantage and an opportunity for us. For example, 75% of our products are replacement inside a large installed base that benefits from over 75,000 focused trade partners. We believe these relationships with our trade channel partners drive resiliency of revenue and create a great opportunity for continued growth as we introduce new products and technologies. We have a long successful track record of generating cash flow and being disciplined with our capital allocation. In fact, we have increased our dividend for the 47th consecutive year, putting us in a very small group inside of the S&P 500, and we are especially proud of our high-teens ROIC, demonstrating that we continue to be good stewards with your invested money. We believe we have a very solid foundation and we know there's still more we can do. Please turn to Slide 7, labeled Our Impact: Making Better Essential for People and the Planet. Our work on ESG and social responsibility continues to be at the forefront of how we operate and how we work to make the planet better. At Pentair, we take great pride in the products we develop that are providing solutions to some of the world's largest challenges, including safe and healthy drinking water, climate change and water shortages to name just a few. We also seek to make better essential for people and the planet. For example, our products and solutions improve water efficiency, reduce and capture carbon emissions and avoid the need for single-use water bottles. Here are a few highlights. 71% of Pentair solutions support water efficiency; 15.9 million tons of CO2 emissions have been avoided by U.S. consumers using Pentair's energy efficient pool pump since 2005; and nearly 8 billion single-use plastic water bottles have been avoided in 2022 due to Pentair's water filtration products. Furthermore, our leadership and social responsibility is being recognized by third-party organizations, including Forbes and others. We look forward to continued progress and plan to share additional details in our 2022 Corporate Responsibility Report, which we expect to publish this spring. Please turn to Slide 8, labeled Strategic Framework. Our purpose, mission, vision, values and impact are critical components of our strategic framework. Our purpose matters and is to create a better world for people in the planet through smart sustainable water solutions. Our mission as a company is to help the world sustainably move, improve and enjoy water, life's most essential resource. And we do this in residential, commercial, agriculture and industrial applications. As of January 1st of this year, we have split our Consumer Solutions segment into Pool and Water Solutions. This creates three focus segments as IFT remains unchanged. We expect this to not only improve transparency, but further improve customer service, differentiate our products, measure our success externally and drive greater profitability for our shareholders. Our three segments are now Industrial & Flow Technologies, Water Solutions and Pool. We continue to see great opportunity in all three of these segments and the businesses that each of them lead. Our Industrial & Flow Technologies segment helps move water where you need it, when you need it more efficiently in our pump businesses. The segment also focuses on transforming waste into value through our sustainable gas and membrane businesses. Our Water Solutions segment, which includes our most recent acquisition, Manitowoc Ice, is a leading platform to provide water and ice to our food service and residential customers. These businesses improve water by providing great tasting, higher-quality water and ice while helping our customers use more -- water more productively. Our Pool business helps enjoy water by using less energy and chemicals. In North America, it also has a large installed base of approximately 5.4 million pools with an average age of 20 to 25 years. The industry is approximately 60% break and fix, 20% major remodeling, and 20% new pools. Only about 50% of all in-ground pools have some form of automation, which we believe is a long-term opportunity for Pentair. I will now pass the call over to Bob, who will discuss our performance and financial results in more detail. Bob?
Bob Fishman: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 9, labeled Q4 2022 Pentair Performance. I will also be discussing our full year performance on Slide 10. We delivered fourth quarter sales growth of 1% with core sales declining 3% as strong price contribution was not enough to offset volume decline. Consumer Solutions core sales were down 11%, as expected and previously communicated, due to residential channel inventory levels rebalancing and as a result of our lead times beginning to return to more normal levels. Industrial & Flow Technologies reported strong 11% core sales growth with strength in commercial flow and industrial solutions. For the full year, sales grew 9% with core sales up 6%. Consumer Solutions delivered 4% core sales growth, and Industrial & Flow Technologies saw core sales growth of 10%. Fourth quarter segment income increased 10%, and return on sales expanded 130 basis points year-over-year to 18.2%, driven primarily by price, significantly offsetting inflation. Productivity was negatively impacted by lower volume in the quarter. Adjusted EPS of $0.82 was down 6% versus the prior year, but exceeded our guidance for the quarter. Net interest and other expense was $28.2 million, which represented our first full quarter of new financing post the Manitowoc acquisition. And our adjusted tax rate was 12.7% during the quarter, with a share count of 165.2 million. For the full year, segment income grew 12% and return on sales expanded 40 basis points to 18.6%. Adjusted EPS increased 8% for the year to $3.68. Our tax rate ended the year at 14.5%, and our share count was 165.6 million. Please turn to Slide 11, labeled Q4 2022 Consumer Solutions Performance. In addition to the fourth quarter performance for Consumer Solutions, I will also be referencing the full year performance on Slide 12. In the fourth quarter, Consumer Solutions sales declined 1% with core sales declining 11%, comprised of 15 points of price, offset by 26 points of volume decline. This was in line with our expectations. The volume decline was due to difficult year-over-year comparisons and the anticipated inventory correction across many product lines in our residential channels. Segment income grew 7%, and return on sales expanded 150 basis points to 23.1%, as strong pricing measures continued to play out along with the contribution from Manitowoc Ice. For the year, Consumer Solutions sales grew 12% with core sales up 4%. Segment income grew 10%, and return on sales declined 40 basis points to 23.3%. Our pool business had sales growth of 4% for the year. Water treatment saw sales growth of 28%, led by contribution from the Manitowoc Ice acquisition, which was completed at the end of July. Please turn to Slide 13, labeled Q4 2022 Industrial & Flow Technologies Performance. In addition to the fourth quarter performance for Industrial & Flow Technologies, I will also be referencing the full year performance on Slide 14. Industrial & Flow Technologies grew sales 5% in the quarter, partially offset by a 4% FX headwind with core sales increasing 11%. Segment income grew 21%, and return on sales expanded an impressive 240 basis points to 17.4%, marking the second consecutive quarter of greater than 200 basis points of improvement. The strong margin expansion was a result of significant price contribution and moderating inflation. For the year, sales increased 6% with core sales increasing 10%. Segment income grew 14%, and return on sales increased 110 basis points to 16.1%, as strong price more than offset inflation and FX headwinds. IFT saw sales growth across the segment with residential flow up 3%, commercial flow up 6% and industrial solutions up 10%. Please turn to Slide 15, labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. As a reminder, this slide reflects the closing of the Manitowoc acquisition at the end of July. We ended the quarter with pro forma a leverage of 2.5 times, and our return on invested capital was at 15.7%, declining slightly due to the acquisition of Manitowoc Ice. I would like to remind you that given the rising interest rate environment, we are comfortable being two-thirds variable as we were less inclined to lock into higher rates for longer. We have no significant long-term debt maturing for the next few years and the majority of our debt is in term loans going out three to five years. We generated $283 million of free cash flow from continuing operations in the year, which was in line with our messaging on the Q3 earnings call. Working capital was a significant headwind this year, primarily inventories, which has led to a timing issue on cash flow. Our inventories were higher largely due to inflation, [buy-ahead] (ph) and inefficiencies in the supply chain. We expect to benefit from working capital improvement in 2023 and generate free cash flow in line with our historical performance of 100% of net income. In 2022, we returned roughly two-thirds of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We plan to remain disciplined with our capital, and we'll continue to focus on debt reduction amid the higher interest rate environment. Please turn to Slide 16, labeled Segment Structure Beginning in 2023. As John discussed, we moved to three reporting segments effective January 01, 2023. We have included realigned historical information for these segments from 2019 to 2022 in the supplemental data section of our earnings presentation. Our Industrial & Flow Technologies segment had roughly $1.5 billion of revenue in 2022 with a ROS of approximately 16%. This business grows sales at roughly single digits over the long term in a very large industry. Water Solutions consists of residential and commercial and was roughly $1.2 billion of revenue on a pro forma basis when including a full year of Manitowoc Ice. This is a mid-single digit sales growth contributor over the long term, operating in a very large industry. Finally, Pool was roughly $1.6 billion of revenue in 2022 and is our highest profitability segment that we expect will grow sales mid-single digit plus over the long term. Please turn to Slide 17, labeled Transformation Expectations. We have moved transformation from funnel to execution, and we expect more material benefits to contribute to our longer-term margin expansion targets. In 2022, we made strategic progress on our transformation initiatives with a primary focus on two of our four key themes: pricing excellence and strategic sourcing. Overall, we believe transformation will be a key driver in value creation over the next three years. For example, through our transformation initiative, we have identified over 400 basis points of targeted margin expansion by 2025, up from the 300 basis points that we discussed at our previous Investor Day. A significant portion of that is due to a focus on material costs, which represent roughly 40% of our sales. By driving transformation excellence through pricing and sourcing, we believe this will have the most significant impact on overall cost efficiencies. With the work we have completed in 2022, we believe that we can expand return on sales to approximately 23% in 2025. In pricing, we have completed wave one, which has established a new strategic pricing playbook. This creates a foundation for pricing across our different go-to-market strategies and includes looking at our dealer and distributor programs to better optimize them. We are gaining insight into profitability by customer and product category and using this data to better drive our forecast. We believe pricing remains a big opportunity. We are building capabilities and starting to see benefits materialize. We expect future waves to include the implementation of our pricing playbook across all categories. We are furthest along in our strategic sourcing initiatives. We have completed wave one that focused on key categories, like electronics, motors and drives, castings, packaging, logistics and MRO. Wave one included roughly 35% of material spend and has generated over 12% in savings opportunities. We expect to unlock value through supplier-dedicated resources, supply base reduction, inventory solutions, enhanced supplier executive level relationships and rebate programs. We expect to reduce complexity across our entire organization and to see close to 80% supplier reduction in some of our commodity groups. Over 75 Pentair team members attended 3,000 plus hours of formal classroom instruction and workshops in supply chain topics. As we institutionalize our wave one learnings, we expect this will drive future waves as we look at additional categories. Wave two is scheduled to start in 2023 and is planned to cover another 35% of material spend for commodity groups such as metals, plastics and molding, purchase finished goods, transportation, and indirect spend such as IT, fleet management and office supplies. We expect this will create a funnel of savings for 2023 and 2024. In operations excellence, we are focused on reducing complexity and driving lean processes across all our operations. In 2022, we made a few small strides on footprint optimization. We believe this presents longer-term opportunities, but not until 2024 and beyond, as we build out the funnel. Lastly, in organizational effectiveness, we are focusing on sales and functional excellence to simplify our organization. From an organizational standpoint, we believe ample opportunities remain for complexity reduction across the entire portfolio and a realignment of needed skills within our top priorities. We continue to believe that our transformation initiatives will be a large value creation opportunity for Pentair. Please turn to Slide 18, labeled Q1 and Full Year 2023 Pentair Outlook. For the full year, we are introducing adjusted EPS guidance of approximately $3.50 to $3.70, which represents a year-over-year range of down 5% to up 1%. We expect sales to be roughly down 3% to up 1%. We expect segment income to increase 5% to 10%, with corporate expense of approximately $80 million, net interest expense of roughly $125 million, an adjusted tax rate of approximately 15% and a share count of 165 million to 166 million. We are targeting free cash flow of approximately 100% of net income as we expect working capital to improve and inventory levels to come down. For the first quarter, we are introducing adjusted EPS guidance of approximately $0.76 to $0.78, which represents a year-over-year decrease of approximately 8% to 11%. We expect sales to be roughly flat to up 1%, as the contribution of Manitowoc Ice helps offset expected volume declines from the rebalancing of residential channel inventory. We expect segment income to increase 5% to 8%, with corporate expense coming in around $21 million, net interest expense of roughly $33 million, an adjusted tax rate of approximately 15% and a share count of 165 million to 166 million. Please turn to Slide 19, labeled Full Year 2023 Guidance at Midpoint. The chart on Slide 19 shows a walk of sales and segment income at the midpoint of our full year 2023 guidance. From the sales walk on the left-hand side, you will see that we expect sales to be down roughly 1% at the midpoint. We expect volume to be down approximately 10%, primarily due to our residential businesses. We expect price benefit of approximately 5% and a benefit from acquisitions/divestitures of roughly 5%, primarily due to a full year of Manitowoc Ice, partially offset by exits in the residential businesses and water solutions. We expect Pool sales to be down low double digits at the midpoint in 2023 after growing 14% in 2020, 40% in 2021 and 4% in 2022. We believe 2023 will be an inventory rebalancing year across the pool industry. We do think that there was a higher-than-normal level of demand in 2020 and 2021 that led to timing and supply chain disruptions in the industry and, therefore, created larger-than-normal impact between sell-through and sell-in reflected in our results. We estimate that from a sell-through perspective, the overall industry grew about 4% on a volume basis from 2019 to 2022, roughly in line with historical levels. As we have discussed, our Pool sales consists of 20% from new pools 20% from remodels and 60% from the aftermarket. At the midpoint, we expect that new pools and remodels will be down approximately 20% in 2023 and the aftermarket business, including inventory corrections in Q1 through Q3, will be down approximately 15%. We expect price carryover for Pool will be up roughly mid-single digit. We do expect the industry and our Pool revenue to return to more normalized growth later in 2023 and in 2024, reflecting a more even balance of sell-through and distribution buying patterns. As a reminder, even with an expected [Pool] (ph) year of down double digits in 2023, we expect to grow at a double digit CAGR in Pool from 2019 through 2023. We expect our Water Solutions segment sales to be up mid-teens at the midpoint, including up approximately 40% in our commercial business with a full year of Manitowoc Ice and down approximately 10% in our residential business. We expect IFT sales to be up slightly at the midpoint with the commercial, industrial and infrastructure businesses up approximately mid-single digits and residential down approximately double digits. On the segment income side, we expect segment income to grow approximately 8% at the midpoint and to expand ROS roughly 150 basis points. We expect price to slightly exceed inflation. We expect approximately 35% ROS from our acquisitions and divestitures. Our transformation initiatives and productivity should deliver over 200 basis points of margin expansion. And we expect drop through of roughly 30% on the decrease in volume. We expect our greater than 200 basis points of transformation and productivity benefit will be the result of volume rightsizing actions that we undertook in the fourth quarter of 2022, inefficiencies in our 2022 results that will not repeat in 2023 and our transformation initiatives. Our comments are based on the midpoint of the range. The lower end of our range would be reflective of higher interest rates, impacting housing demand and residential sales and increasing our interest expense. As we think about the higher end of our range, our main drivers would be a better outcome in the residential businesses, primarily Pool, and overdriving some of the transformation benefits. In closing, we expect the lower Pool year in 2023 to be offset by the strength of our diversified portfolio and our transformation initiatives. We are confident in the expected benefits from our transformation initiatives and we believe we are gaining continued momentum, to not only drive savings in 2023, but to build a strong funnel for 2024 and 2025, with significant ROS expansion. We also expect ROS expansion as our residential businesses return to more normalized growth in 2024 and beyond. I'd now like to turn the call over to the operator for Q&A, after which John will have a few closing remarks. Kate, please open the line for questions. Thank you.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Joe Giordano of Cowen. Please go ahead.
Joe Giordano: Hey guys, good morning.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Bob Fishman: Hi, Joe.
Joe Giordano: Maybe, I'm going to start [not] (ph) on Pool. Can you talk about the residential portfolio that you have within the old Consumer Solutions group? You made a couple of acquisitions over the years, Pelican, Aquion and Rocean, and small deals, but now we're talking about some exits that you're making. So, maybe just give us an update on where that portfolio is? Where is it maybe versus what you thought it might look like when you started making those deals? And kind of like an update on the strategy going forward from there?
John Stauch: Yes. I mean, first of all, I think about it as roughly still 40% of the overall Water Solutions segment. And think of all the core that we were focused on for the last five to ten years, which is really about the trade and the professional channel, all being a big part of our strategy and still performing. What we did exit was our attempts at the direct-to-consumer side of the business, which we felt were not going to gain the traction that we originally hoped they would, but also they were confusing the trade channel as far as our partnership to support them. And so, now we're focused on being back to where we were, which is pulling demand through our professional trade channel and ensuring that we're winning with the best products and solutions, Joe.
Joe Giordano: That makes sense. And then just a follow-up on the 2025 margin target. Can you maybe walk us through the relative contributions from the three segments? Like, I guess, Pool doesn't have as much upside given how strong it's been, but if you could kind of help us frame that up?
Bob Fishman: Yes. Joe, we were pleased to be able to increase the ROS expansion due to the -- what we're seeing in the transformation initiatives. We still have work to do to break it out by segment, but overall, we would expect each of the segments to be contributors to that ROS expansion.
John Stauch: And so, when you think of the increase in the target, as Bob mentioned, 100 basis points of that comes from candidly the fact that we're mixing up with the Manitowoc acquisition. And then we felt like stepping up the expectations on the transformation was helpful for two reasons. One is, we believe that we're making progress with the actual work we're doing. But the second one is we have inefficiencies that we uncovered over the last couple of years of being challenged by the supply chain, which we want to make sure are included in the transformation journey that we're on.
Bob Fishman: And just to bridge the gap, when we had our Investor Day, we talked about going from 18% to 21% in 2025. We then acquired Manitowoc. So that gave us another approximately 100 basis points to bring us to 22%, and then we found another 100 basis points in the transformation initiatives to get us to the 23%.
Operator: The next question is from Bryan Blair of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Bryan Blair: Thank you. Good morning, guys.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Bryan Blair: Just to confirm, your 2023 guidance implies mid-single digit core growth in commercial water solutions. Is that correct?
Bob Fishman: Yes. Yes, it does.
Bryan Blair: Okay. And having owned Manitowoc Ice bit longer, any update you can offer on the commercial synergies that you've seen to date or what's expected between Everpure, Manitowoc and KBI?
John Stauch: Yes, we're really pleased with the start. I think these all come together nicely and I think we continue to see significant opportunities for our customers to benefit from the end-to-end solutions that we now provide in commercial water solutions.
Bob Fishman: And just to provide a little more detail, the Water Solutions does have commercial [up] (ph) approximately 40%, residential down approximately 10%.
John Stauch: Right. He was asking for core though, and I was giving the core of mid-single digits.
Bob Fishman: Got it.
Operator: The next question is from Mike Halloran of Baird. Please go ahead.
Mike Halloran: Hey, good morning, everyone. First, a follow-up to Joe's second question. Just what kind of volume assumptions are embedded in those margin targets, if any? Or are those exclusive volume expectations over the next few years? In other words, is there a level of revenue or volumes you need to get to be able to achieve these targets?
John Stauch: Well, I mean, we're making significant impact in 2023 even with the down volume. So, I think the jumpstart in 2023 reflects the aggressive efforts to get the labor in line with the volume and also to recover those inefficiencies. As we go forward, we'd be looking at the normalized growth rates of each of the segments being included in our efforts to get to the ROS targets that we implied.
Mike Halloran: Okay. That makes sense. And then, just from a guidance perspective, could you help with the cadencing a little bit through the year. When you think about normal seasonality and there's a lot of moving pieces particularly in Pools, some of the destocking, how are you guys thinking about what the normal seasonal cadence looks like by segment within the guidance?
Bob Fishman: We are starting to move back to a more typical seasonality where Q2 is typically our largest quarter followed by Q3. I would say that we expect to see slightly less than 50% of our EPS in the first half, primarily because interest expense is a little bit higher in the first half and transformation initiatives play out a little bit more strongly in the back half. But we are returning to more traditional seasonality than what we saw during the COVID years.
John Stauch: And I would just add that you should assume that most of the residential channel challenges will come through Q1, Q2 and Q3, and we have easier comparisons in the back half of the year as we look at what those year-over-year impacts would be.
Operator: The next question is from Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Julian Mitchell: Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to understand your sort of conviction level around the price tailwinds. You had 5 points of price dialed in for this year after sort of low teens ending last year. So, maybe sort of give some more color on the price confidence and how you see the sort of needed inventory liquidation in a lot of pool products perhaps weighing on that?
John Stauch: Yes. So, I'll start and then Bob can bring some more in. I think first of all, the price that we're anticipating is actions that have already been taken. And we feel good about the decisions we've made and we feel like we have, as we said, stickiness in the channel. I do think it's fair to assume that as we get through the year, we have to anticipate that there might be ideas from the channel to participate in rebates or discounts. We've assumed a little of that in our guide. But we're hopeful that our balanced view of the revenue projections that we have don't encourage us to think that we need to do significant discounting to achieve our expectations.
Julian Mitchell: And you're seeing sort of competitors acting in a disciplined fashion to -- for the time being?
John Stauch: I don't know about that. I mean, we don't have any information to the contrary.
Operator: The next question is from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Nathan Jones: Good morning, everyone.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Nathan Jones: Appreciate all the detail in the presentation this morning. I'm going to ask about Pool. You talked about in the prepared comments Bob, 2019 through 2023 double-digit growth in Pool, [indiscernible] what's in the guidance for '23. I think historically that had been more like 7% or 8%. Can you talk about what was price versus volume in that? How much higher was price than you would normally have? I'm just trying to get an idea in a sense of, are we kind of back to a normalized volume growth? If you take that period from '19 to '23 where we pulled forward demand early, we're giving some [backing] (ph) and now are we kind of back to that normal trend line?
John Stauch: We think if you looked at it, Nathan, on a sell-through basis, we'll be normalized from a volume from a sell-through basis. Obviously, we got a little disconnected on the sell-in versus the sell-out. But overall, we believe we're tracking to historical volume levels with where we end up. So, you should assume that we've had a significant price benefit over the last four years that we've realized.
Nathan Jones: Okay. That makes sense. So, on a volume level, we're back to normalized. That's good to know. With the change in the reporting structure, is there a change in the way you're managing any of those businesses? And if so, how do you think that benefits the customer experience of buying to Pentair? Just any color you can give us on the change in reporting strategy if there's a change in the actual business management structure?
John Stauch: Yes. We've committed a lot of effort and resources to run at what we call the category level, which is the products that go to the market and serve the customer streams. So that's our focus. And the new segment line-up allows us to be aligned. Pool for pool, and then, we've been able to split the Water Solutions businesses to the residential and commercial where we have the varying go-to-market channels, and IFT remain the same. So, we feel really good about our customer-centric efforts both on sales, marketing and NPI. And we're very encouraged on how the new segments will help enable the focus on the growth journeys of these three different areas.
Operator: The next question is from Brian Lee of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Brian Lee: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.
John Stauch: Hi, Brian.
Brian Lee: Maybe just shifting -- hey, back to the margin outlook here. I appreciate the update of you through '25. I guess just sort of drilling into '23 a bit here, you mentioned the 100 basis points from the Manitowoc. When I look at just Slide 19, can you kind of give us a sense of if that's your sort of entire transformation contribution in '23? Or maybe just walk us through some of the pieces, including how much of that 100 basis points from Manitowoc is embedded in the '23?
Bob Fishman: Yes, let me do that. I would say roughly 50 basis points to 60 basis points comes from Manitowoc of that 160 basis point increase. So, the way that you should think about Manitowoc is we had roughly $150 million of revenue in our P&L in 2022; $60 million in Q3, $90 million in Q4. And as we mentioned before, we drive about 30% of Ross on that Manitowoc business. We'll increase to about $370 million of revenue in 2023. So, think of revenue going up about $220 million in Manitowoc at that 30% income level. We also get by exiting the residential businesses, we'll lose about $25 million of revenue in 2023, but we'll gain about $10 million of income, those were loss making businesses in 2022. So, when I talked about acquisitions and divestitures benefiting about 5% top-line and roughly 35% from a ROS perspective, that was the breakout.
Brian Lee: Okay. That's great. Appreciate that color. And then, just a quick question on the Pool side. I don't know if you quantified this, but you're talking about the channel inventory sort of coming down maybe normalizing in the 2Q-3Q timeframe. Can you quantify sort of where you see inventory levels sort of weeks and then -- or I guess months and where you would need to get to sort of get a normalized level?
John Stauch: Yes, I'm looking at it slightly different than that. I think we've shared with you that we think we're down about 20% each on new pool builds and also the aftermarket remodeled side. So, think of that as each of those two 20% is down 20%. And then, we group the aftermarket and the inventory piece, and we assume that what we're going to see is lower pull-through from the sell-through and demand, because as Bob mentioned, we think some of the aftermarket demand was serviced earlier. And because of that, we feel like we got to balance the shipments into the channel and the industry to serve that lower demand. And most of that we think happens over Q1, Q2 and Q3.
Operator: The next question is from Steve Tusa of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
Steve Tusa: Hi, guys. Good morning.
John Stauch: Hey, Steve.
Bob Fishman: Hi, Steve.
Steve Tusa: Just the inflation number, I'm not sure if you said that so far, what's the actual number? I mean, you could kind of eyeball the chart there, but just curious what the actual inflation headwind is for '23?
Bob Fishman: It'd be about 4.5% is how we view it at this point.
Steve Tusa: Okay. So, on absolute basis, what does that kind of convert to?
Bob Fishman: Well, if you think about prices being about 5%, so call that, $200 million benefit, I think about inflation at 4.5% is being around $180 million.
Steve Tusa: Okay. So, moderately positive. When you think about the pricing in the other businesses, anything going on there? Any kind of surcharges? Or anything moving around in the non, I guess, the more industrial businesses?
John Stauch: No, real surcharges, Steve. We're back to more normalized price actions and having to go out and compete competitively from a standpoint of making sure that quoting those jobs by anticipating the impact of inflation, and then winning [the future] (ph) sourcing inflation as we satisfy the industrial projects.
Operator: The next question is from Andy Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Andy Kaplowitz: Hey, good morning, guys.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Bob Fishman: Hi, Andy.
Andy Kaplowitz: So, supply chain inflation, obviously, looked better in Consumer Solutions in Q4, but I think you mentioned productivity was negative because of a decline in revenue. I know you said you expect inefficiencies to lessen as you go into '23. So, just sort of what that happened in Q4 was just lower revenue, and do you still see that sort of $50 million of incremental improvement for manufacturing inefficiency getting better in '23 versus '22?
John Stauch: We do. Go ahead, Bob.
Bob Fishman: Absolutely. So, the significantly lower volume in Q4, while we put actions in place, that's what primarily drove the negative productivity. As we look at 2023, those inefficiencies whether it was air freighting, spot buys, whether it was supply chain challenges, those will reduce significantly and, obviously, help our productivity. Those will be one area. Then, just the actions we took in Q4 around adjusting for the lower volume will benefit us. And then, in addition to that, the transformation initiatives that are starting to benefit us in 2023.
Andy Kaplowitz: Very helpful. And then, Bob, maybe the conviction level to get back to free cash flow conversion of 100%? And if you do get there, obviously, you've got some leverage here, but we've seen more recent announcements of a little bit of consolidation in, call it, the water equipment space. So, where does Pentair go from here on the M&A front?
Bob Fishman: Yes, I'll definitely take the first one. We have high confidence in our free cash flow. We will benefit from working capital coming down in 2023, primarily inventories. We've established targets and are starting to chart progress. So, I'm confident around the inventory space. We'll also see benefits versus 2022 in terms of accruals and cash being paid out. So, overall, there's three or four different areas that give us confidence in the free cash flow. Historically, we do drive a 100% of net income. And when we've had a challenging year, we turn around the next year and get back to our typical path. So, high confidence there.
John Stauch: Yes. And as far as the M&A, I mean, short term, we're going to service the debt just because of the high interest rates. We love our strategy. We believe the move and proven enjoy gives us a lot of flexibility to add to our existing portfolio. But we're going to be smart. I mean, call me old fashioned, but I think ROIC matters in the long run. It used to be how we measured performance. I still think it matters and I think we have to be disciplined with your capital. And we need to make sure if we put that capital work that we can make these acquisitions deliver to the expectations.
Operator: The next question is from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Shelly.
Shelly Hubbard: Thank you.
Deane Dray: We also, John, agree, ROIC matters.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Deane Dray: Hey. And on Manitowoc, just can we circle back on this? One of the obvious upsides was the whole cross-sell opportunity, making sure every one of those ice machines has a Pentair filter. Just can you share with us on the take rate there? Any initiatives that you have to make sure that that process happens smoothly?
John Stauch: Yes. Deane, first of all, I still think we think across all the synergies we said that we're going to experience those. And we do believe, as we said, there's certainly account management and making sure that we can service the key accounts across all three platforms, KBI being one of those platforms as well on the service side. We do believe that every ice machine should have a filter and we would hope that it's our filter since we think we are the best filtration company. But that has been [independent] (ph) choice, of course, made by the distributor and the end market. And I think we can help them be aware of why our filters do better and we do believe that take rate is going to be serviced over time.
Deane Dray: Got it. And then, for Bob, the idea here is you've got this whole working capital normalization happening. Wouldn't it be fair to expect that cash conversion would be well above 100% at some point in '23, just given the kind of cash conversion that you'd expect from working capital alone?
Bob Fishman: We've looked at the free cash flow and certainly don't want to get ahead of ourselves. One of the pacing items is the transformation piece. So, we expect to spend less on transformation and restructuring in 2023 than we did in '22, but we still have to invest to drive the benefit. So, those will be good payback items that we spend the money on, but that is one of the items that contains the free cash flow slightly. The only other thing I want to mention on your first question relating to scorekeeping for Manitowoc is that as we drive synergies, it's all within commercial water solutions, but some of the benefits goes to commercial filtration as they sell filters, some of it goes to our Ken's Beverage as they drive more services relating to the ice machine. So, all of the synergies are not necessarily captured in just Manitowoc Ice.
Operator: The next question is from Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jeff Hammond: Hey, good morning, guys.
John Stauch: Hey, Jeff.
Bob Fishman: Good morning.
Jeff Hammond: Just on -- just back on Pool and the destocking, I'm just wondering, one, kind of how you think of inventories on your balance sheet versus those at the distributor channel? And then, just if any early buy kind of played in any part and kind of the pacing of destocking?
John Stauch: To the second one, and really when we think of inventories, you have -- a reminder that some of our inventories are across the entire portfolio. Our project businesses, our electronics, the tougher to get componentry is where a lot of our inventory resides, Jeff. It's not like we're sitting on finished goods inventory ready to go out. So, it's not that simple.
Jeff Hammond: Okay. Just on res pool, I think you put -- around Pool, you've got 28% margins in '22. How should we think about decrementals as you go through this transition and kind of where you think those margins bottom out?
John Stauch: We expect to drive margin improvement in 2023, Jeff. I mean, as a reminder, our volume in Pool was down roughly 30% in Q4. And that's one of the reasons we didn't get to get that leverage up. And as we take a look at 2023 when we get the costs in line and balance out against these new production levels, we do believe we're going to drive margin improvement in Pool in 2023.
Operator: The next question is from Scott Graham of Loop Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Scott Graham: Hey, good morning, and welcome, Shelley. So, just to couple of questions, one on the Pool, one on the commercial water treatment. I know you said for commercial water to expect sort of a mid-single digit growth this year, I'm curious does that include Manitowoc Ice on sort of pro forma...
John Stauch: I -- no. And I'm sorry that we weren't clear. I thought the question was what was core growth of commercial water solutions, and I said mid-single digits. Inclusive, of the acquisitions, it's much higher than that, which is on the chart as mid-teens.
Scott Graham: Right. No, that I certainly understand.
John Stauch: They all included.
Scott Graham: Yes, that I certainly understand. What would you think that the growth would be in Manitowoc Ice in pro forma?
John Stauch: Mid singles.
Scott Graham: Okay. Thank you. The other question is around Pool. So, there's a pretty big change in your assumption. I think you were looking at, thinking, last quarter that aftermarket would be about flat, and now you're kind of looping that together with the continued destock. And I'm just curious because there are more pools in the grounds, so I would have almost thought that naturally that aftermarket might have even been up this year. So, is that essentially saying that the destock is kind of more than 100% of the decline? Or am I thinking about that right?
John Stauch: Yes. I think it's really the result of the significant growth in '20 and '21 and first half of '22 that the industry saw. And if you think about a more normalized growth, it would suggest that key items like heaters and lighting were probably pulled into those earlier years. And that is probably challenging the aftermarket assumptions. Now all of that's great, because we're adding to content in existing pools and there will be some replacement of those products down the road. So, I think long-term trajectories are fine. We just think that some of the demand was pulled into the earlier years.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to John Stauch, President and Chief Executive Officer, for closing remarks.
John Stauch: Thank you, and thank you for joining us today. We're excited about the future Pentair and focused on creating a better world for people on the planet through smart sustainable water solutions. Our focus on driving superior shareholder value is fueled by our mission to help the world sustainably move, improve and enjoy water, life's most essential resource. Kate, you may conclude the call.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-10-25 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Pentair’s Third Quarter 2022 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jim Lucas, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Jim Lucas: Thanks, Andrea, and welcome to Pentair's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. We're glad you can join us. With me today is John Stauch, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Fishman, our Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, we will provide details on our third quarter performance as outlined in this morning's press release. Before we begin, let me remind you that during our presentation today, we will make forward-looking statements. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Pentair. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K and today's release. We will also reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the Investor Relations section of Pentair's Web site. We will be sure to reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. I would like to request that you please limit your questions to one and a follow up to ensure everyone an opportunity to ask their questions. I will now turn the call over to John.
John Stauch: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide number 4, titled Executive Summary. We are pleased to announce that our Q3 results were strong considering near-term challenges, and were in line with our expectations. Sales growth of 9% and segment income growth of 15% included a partial quarter of our recently-completed Manitowoc Ice acquisition. ROS expanded 110 basis points, demonstrating that price and productivity offset inflation, and our adjusted EPS grew 11% to $0.99 in Q3, which included incremental debt from our acquisitions and rising interest rates. We are very excited about the addition of Ice to our portfolio and the expansion of our commercial Water Solutions platform, and the team and the integration process is off to a fast start. Bob will give more detail on our updated full year 2022 guidance later in this call. While we have modestly reduced our full year expectations due primarily to increased FX headwinds and higher interest rates, the year is generally playing out the way we thought it would after our Q2 earnings call. We are seeing the previously communicated inventory correction in most of our residential channels, which we believe the industry is now addressing as supply chain challenges begin to abate. With our updated guidance, we now expect that we will have cleared nearly $200 million of channel inventory pool by the end of the year. We are encouraged that underlying demand is still up year-over-year as evidenced by dealer and distributor sell through despite the rising interest rates within the US residential industry. I will speak in a few slides about some preliminary thoughts on 2023. But the main takeaway is that we believe we are well positioned to grow sales, segment income, margins and adjusted EPS next year. Please turn to Slide number 5, labeled Water. With everything going on and the market reacting to shorter term challenges, I wanted to take a moment to remind you that we believe Pentair is well positioned to solve some of the world's toughest water challenges in a sustainable way. Today, over 70% of Pentair's solutions support water and energy efficiency through helping to reduce water usage, reuse or recovery of water, or requiring less energy to operate or operate more efficiently. With a lot of the ongoing challenges, we believe that our solutions are needed to improve the lives of people and sustain our planning. Please turn to Slide number 6, labeled Purpose. Our purpose is important to our employees, our customers, and is growing more important to you, our shareholders. We hold ourselves to very high standards and our annual sustainability report has shown progress. We believe that further progress not only benefits the planet, but customers, employees and shareholders as well. Please turn to Slide number 7, labeled Pentair at a Glance. Given how much focus has been on our residential businesses, particularly Pool, we wanted to take a step back and remind people of the diversity of the Pentair portfolio. Our mission as a company is to help the world sustainably move, improve and enjoy water, life's most essential resource. And we do this in Residential, Commercial, Agricultural and Industrial applications. On a pro forma basis, for the full year of our Manitowoc Ice acquisition, and inclusive of our current 2022 guidance, US residential sales comprised roughly half of our revenue and the other half comes from our other served industries. I will spend the next few slides talking about our three businesses and how they help comprise the overall Pentair results. We are on track to generate over $4 billion in sales this year and we have a strong focus on profitability with our ROS in the high teens. 75 is an important number for Pentair. 75% of our products are replacement inside a large installed base that benefits from over 75,000 trade partners. We believe the large served installed base and relationships with our trade channel partners drive resiliency of revenue and create a steady funnel for continued growth as new products and technologies are introduced. We have a long, successful track record of generating cash flow and being disciplined with our capital allocation. In fact, we have increased our dividend for 46 consecutive years, and we are especially proud of our high teens ROIC, demonstrating that we have been good stewards with your invested [loans]. We believe we have a very solid foundation, and we know there is still more that we can do. Please turn to Slide 8, labeled Aligning Organization for Accelerated Success. We announced last quarter that effective January 1, 2023, we will be splitting our Consumer Solutions segment into two new segments, Pool and Water Solutions. Our Industrial & Flow Technologies segment will remain unchanged. We believe this new segment structure will help us accelerate our efforts to improve customer service, differentiate our products and drive profitability for our shareholders. Please turn to Slide number 9, labeled Pool Business. Pool is a leading in-ground equipment maker with the largest installed base in North America, primarily across the Sunbelt states. Pool is on track to generate $1.6 billion in sales this year, has return on sales in the high 20s and has generated a 10 year revenue CAGR of approximately 10%. We are preferred business partners to Pool professionals and a trusted source for all things pools. Our Pool Business helps people sustainably enjoy water by using less energy and chemicals. One of the most attractive characteristics of the pool industry in North America is serving a large installed base of approximately 5.4 million pools. The average age of these pools is approaching 25 years. The industry is roughly 60% break and fix, 20% major remodeling and 20% new pools. Over the last two years, there was undoubtedly an increase in demand for products such as heaters and cleaners that were not been deeply penetrated on the pool [bath]. People were moving to warmer climates and buying homes with a pool or wanting to build a pool. The emergence of Airbnb and Vrbo was people rent homes with pools rather than staying in hotels. Our industry leading variable speed pumps have faced supply chain disruptions that have kept us from shipping as many as the industry wants, but we are starting to catch up on these shipments as the supply chain improves. Only about half of our in-ground pools have some form of automation and we believe this is another long term opportunity for Pentair, the industry and consumers. Pool dealers continue to be constrained by the lack of available labor. While dealers may have been busier with new pools in the last two years, this has come at the expense of remodeling activity. We believe we have strong opportunities to continue to grow in key categories, particularly pumps. Our new IF3 pump was soft launched this year, as we were not able to get enough chips and drives to meet demand. The initial feedback is very positive and we believe this is an opportunity to build on our leading technology position in pool pumps. We believe the long term outlook for the pool industry remains very positive, and we are well positioned to enhance our position as a leader in North American pool equipment. Please turn to Slide 10, labeled Water Solutions business. Our Water Solutions business has undergone a transformation of its own with our acquisition of Manitowoc Ice. On a pro forma basis, Water Solution's approaching $1.2 billion in sales with return on sales of roughly 20%. The business is approximately two thirds Commercial and one third Residential. Similar to Pool, our Water Solutions business sees a large percentage of its sales growth in distribution into trusted water treatment specialists. Our Water Solutions business improves water by providing great tasting, higher quality water and ice while helping our customers use water more productively. We have discussed our commercial Water Solutions business quite a lot this year given the acquisition of Manitowoc Ice. When put together with our Everpure filtration business and our KBI services business, we have created a leading platform to provide quality water and ice to our foodservice customers. Our Residential Water Treatment business consists of components and systems. Our focus within Residential Water Treatment is reestablishing the core of components while also investing in differentiated point inventory and point of use systems. We have a strong position with our core [pro trade] specialists. We have brands such as Flex and Rainsoft that have strong recognition in their respective channels. Commercial Water Solutions was already a high margin business where the focus is on driving growth. Residential water treatment is much more on complexity reduction and margin improvement while investing in core channels. We are excited about the opportunities for the soon to be Water Solutions segment. Please turn to Slide 11, labeled Industrial & Flow Technologies segment. Industrial & Flow Technologies does not always get the same attention from investors as our other two segments but it's important to our long term strategy, as we help the world sustainably move, improve and enjoy water, our Flow business helps move water where you need it, when you need it more efficiently. While our Industrial Solutions business might not be as water focused as the rest of the portfolio, the business is focused on transforming waste into value. Our Flow business is just north of $1 billion in sales with healthy margins that are improving. Professionals represent roughly 80% of sales per flow and we have many highly recognized brands. Our deep relationships with channel partners are an important long term growth driver. Flow is roughly two thirds Residential and one third Commercial. We also serve irrigation and infrastructure on a smaller scale, which helps bring balance to the business with a combination of short cycle products and engineered products that are longer cycle. Flow has seen solid margin improvement this year, and we believe this business has a long runway ahead to drive margins even higher. Our Industrial Solutions business is roughly $500 million as a technology leader in several niches, including beer membrane filtration and sustainable gas solutions. Industrial Solutions is the one part of our portfolio that is not tied to professional trade channels, but this business provides filtration technology to help solve customers' environmental goals through smart and sustainable solutions. Similar to Flow, we believe there's a lot of opportunity for margin improvement within Industrial Solutions. Please turn to Slide 12, labeled Transformation to Enhance Value Creation. We continue to believe that transformation will be a large value creation opportunity for Pentair. We are building capabilities and training businesses and new tools to use. We are furthest along on our sourcing initiatives. We have completed wave one that is focused on key categories like electronics, motors and drives, casting and indirect. In fact, we had an early win in the quarter regarding our MNO spend where we went from over 100 different suppliers down to one. This allows us to not only save money but it also reduces complexity across our entire organization in this channel. As we institutionalize our wave one learnings, we believe this will drive future ways as we look at additional categories. On pricing, we're establishing a foundation for pricing across our different go to market strategies. This includes looking at our dealer and distributor programs to better optimize them. We're gaining insight into profitability by customer and product category and using this data to better drive our forecast. Pricing remains a big opportunity and this year has been about building capabilities and next year should start to see benefits materializing. We've made a few small strides on footprint optimization this year. We believe this presents longer term opportunities, but not until 2024 and beyond as we build out the funnel. From an organizational standpoint, there remains ample opportunities for complexity reduction across the entire portfolio and a realignment of these skills within our top priorities. Transformation has moved from funnel to execution and we expect more material benefits to contribute to our longer term margin expansion targets. We'll be providing more detail regarding specific expectations when we introduce our 2023 guidance. Please turn to Slide 13, labeled Early Thoughts on 2023. While we are not yet ready to provide full guidance for 2023, we did want to share some early thoughts as we go through our internal planning process. We expect to grow revenue next year for a few reasons. First, we expect the inclusion of Manitowoc Ice will contribute significantly. Second, we expect carryover pricing from the actions we have already taken this year. And third, we believe the diversity of our portfolio will be demonstrated and create resiliency. The focus from investors feel solely on our Pool business, but we have many other contributing businesses in our portfolio. In fact, Pool has its own diversification with 60% breaking fix that we expect will likely continue to grow. While the smaller exposure to new pool construction may decline double digits and maybe there will also be softness in remodeling, we expect the 5.4 million in-ground pools in the break and fix portion of the industry will likely grow modestly. And this, along with carryover pricing, should help limit the anticipated declines from inventory correction early next year. The remainder of the Pentair portfolio has more exposure to some later cycle business, with Industrial & Flow Technologies that offers further diversification. We also expect to grow income next year. Again, we expect that Manitowoc Ice and pricing carryover will be contributors. We are also taking actions this year to better align our manufacturing costs and overhead with the lower volumes we are experiencing. We also expect productivity to return to more normalized levels as manufacturing inefficiencies abate with improved supply chain performance. Transformation is also expected to be a big contributor to income and margin performance next year. We also expect to see adjusted EPS growth with the accretion from Manitowoc Ice, overall business performance and benefits from Transformation. We expect free cash flow to return to more normalized levels or perhaps even a little better as we expect better inventory performance and supply chain inefficiencies go away, and backlogs are reduced. Overall, we believe we are positioned to grow in 2023 despite the challenges of softening economy, residential inventory and stocking challenges, and FX headwinds. I would now like to turn the call over to Bob to discuss our performance and our financial results in more detail. Bob?
Bob Fishman: Thank you, John. Please turn to Slide 14, labeled Q3 2022 Pentair Performance. We delivered second quarter sales growth of 9% with core sales increasing 4% as strong price contribution offset anticipated volume decline. Consumer Solutions core sales were down 2% as residential channels rebalanced inventory levels as our supply chain constraints lessened and as a result of our lead times beginning to return to more normal levels. Industrial & Flow Technologies reported strong 14% core sales growth with strength across the entire segment. Segment income increased 15% and return on sales increased 110 basis points year-over-year to 19.6%. Price once again offset inflation and productivity showed some sign of improvement as manufacturing inefficiencies improved modestly as supply chain constraints eased a little in the quarter. Below the line, net interest and other expense was $18.6 million with increased debt as we closed our Manitowoc Ice acquisition earlier in the quarter. Our adjusted tax rate was 13% during the quarter as we trued up our planning for the year, with the new full year rate now expected to be 15%. Our share count was $165.2 million and adjusted EPS grew 11% to $0.99 and exceeded our guidance for the quarter. Please turn to Slide 15, labeled Q3 2022 Consumer Solutions Performance. Consumer Solutions increased sales 8% with core sales declining 2% comprised of 16 points of price, offset by an 18% decline in volume. The volume decline was due to tough year-over-year comparisons and the anticipated inventory correction across many product lines in our residential channel. Segment income grew 10% and return on sales expanded 30 basis points to 23.8%. Our Pool business had a 4% decline in sales and many product lines such as heaters, cleaners and lighting experienced a delay in orders as inventory in the channel took a pause at the end of the season. We experienced growth in pumps during the quarter as we were able to get the drive needed to fulfill demand. As we have been discussing throughout the year, we have been expecting a decline in the second half of this year as lead times for many products have returned to more normal levels and our channel partners no longer needed to place orders far in advance. Further, pool is a seasonal business and historically, the fourth and first quarters tend to be at lower levels than the second and third quarters. We believe the underlying demand for pool equipment should continue to be strong as the average age of approximately 5.4 million pools installed in the US approaches 25 years. About half of these pools have no form of automation, which we believe is also a long term driver of demand and increased content on pools. We are expecting a slowing in the next few quarters as channel inventories normalize to more historical patterns, which we expect will likely result in continued volume decline partially offset by strong pricing. Water treatment sales grew 34% in the quarter helped in large part by two months of contribution from Manitowoc Ice. Our residential business sales declined low double digits as the channel goes through an inventory correction similar to what is happening in Pool. Consumers continue to be focused on water quality and demand for the product remains strong, however channel inventory does need to return to more historical levels. Our Commercial business grew organically and benefited from the acquisition of Manitowoc Ice. Both Everpure and KBI experienced solid demand in the quarter with Everpure experiencing several new total water management contract wins. The integration of Manitowoc Ice is off to a good start and we remain very excited about the long term prospects for our commercial water solutions platform. Please turn to Slide 16, labeled Q3 2022 Industrial & Flow Technologies Performance. Industrial & Flow Technologies grew sales 10% in the quarter, partially offset by a 5% FX headwind, with core sales increasing 14%. Segment income grew 25% and return on sales expanded an impressive 210 basis points to 16.9%. The strong margin expansion was a result of positive mix, improved productivity and strong price contribution. Our Residential Flow business sales grew 6% in the quarter as price continued to read out oppositely, which helped to offset continued supply chain disruption. Inventory in the channel is in good shape and our focus remains on working down backlog as supply chain disruptions continue to ease. Commercial flow sales grew 13% as delayed second quarter shipments occurred and underlying demand remains solid. This business has made significant gains this year reducing complexity and has been a big contributor to the segment's margin expansion. Industrial Solutions sales increased 13% as most product lines experienced growth. Demand for our sustainable gas solutions remain strong and continue to grow in orders and backlog. Our beer business has helped many customers work on productivity solutions, given the ongoing CO2 shortage that exists. Overall, Industrial & Flow Technologies delivered a great quarter with sales, segment income and margin growth. Please turn to Slide 17, labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. This line reflects the closing of the Manitowoc Ice transaction at the end of July. We ended the quarter with pro forma leverage at 2.6 times and our ROIC was at 17%. Given the rising interest rate environment, we are comfortable being two thirds variable as we were less inclined to lock into higher rates for longer. We have no long term debt maturing for the next few years and the majority of our debt is in term loans going up three to five years. Cash flow in the quarter was $72 million and $211 million year to date. Working capital has been a significant headwind this year, primarily inventory, which is leading to a timing issue on cash flow. Our inventories are higher primarily due to inflation, buy ahead and inefficiencies in the supply chain, requiring us to purchase more products. We believe we are well positioned to drive improvement in free cash flow in the fourth quarter but we expect to fall short of our target to 100% free cash flow conversion for the full year. We believe this is a timing issue and expect next year to benefit from working capital improvement as inventory levels come down. Please turn to Slide 18, labeled Q4 and Full Year 2022 Pentair Outlook. For the fourth quarter, we are introducing adjusted EPS guidance of approximately $0.79, which represents a year-over-year decrease of 9%. We expect sales to be roughly flat as the contribution of Manitowoc Ice helps offset growing FX headwinds and expected volume decline as a result of residential channel inventory correction. We expect segment income to increase 8% with corporate expense coming in around $20 million, net interest expense of roughly $28 million, an adjusted tax rate of 15% and a share count of 165 million to 166 million. With the third quarter outperformance and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we now expect full year sales to grow approximately 9% for the year. We expect segment income to increase approximately 12% with [strong] price contribution. We expect adjusted EPS of roughly $3.65 or an increase of 7% for the year. Below the line, we expect corporate expense to be around $80 million, net interest expense of $55 million, an adjusted tax rate of approximately 15% and shares to be around 165 million to 166 million. With the working capital headwinds experienced this year, we now expect free cash flow to be approximately 60% to 70% of net income with free cash flow returning to more normalized levels next year. I would now like to turn the call over to Andrea for Q&A, after which John will have a few closing remarks. Andrea, please open the line for questions. Thank you.
Operator: We will now begin the question and answer question [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Andy Kaplowitz of Citigroup.
Andy Kaplowitz: John or Bob, can you give us a little more color into your volume expectations for Pool in Q4, and a little more color into how you're thinking about '23 in Pool? I know you said that you baked in channel destocking in Pool in the second half of the year. But has the destocking been higher than your expectations? And then it seems like you have confidence in break and fix, but you mentioned more uncertainty regarding renovation. Have you seen a drop off in that backlog at this point?
John Stauch: I mean, as a reminder, we did start the year saying that we expected that the supply chain constraints that were there throughout 2020 and '21 would likely, as they start to abate, identify that there's probably excess inventory in the channel. As the year played out in Q2 and after our Q2 conference call, I mean, what was happening and you can see it happening in other industries like retail, we expected that we would see a pullback again in demand and therefore, have to burn through inventory in the channel. So I would say it's playing out generally as expected, maybe a little bit higher in Q4, with a little bit higher being that the overall demand in the industry has slowed modestly. So we're not at the high to mid single digit sell through numbers that we were historically, and we're starting to see some pullback actually in the overall demand and therefore, that needs to add to the inventory correction.
Andy Kaplowitz: And then, John, maybe backing up, could you give us a little more color into the buckets you cited that can help you provide the '23 growth that you seem confident of. I think in the past, you've talked about the Manitowoc Ice accretion being around $0.10. Maybe any sort of color on pricing carryover, or transformation and related tailwind would help, and then how much manufacturing efficiencies impacted you this year?
John Stauch: I mean, it's really early for guide and obviously, you understand these interests. I mean, I think where our confidence level comes by growing on an absolute basis on revenue EPS is that Manitowoc is going to -- should be well over $200 million as it brings the full year performance to Pentair. And that's a fairly high margin business, so we really feel good about the income contribution. And their backlog substantiate everything we saw in the business model and we're off to a strong start in integration, so I'll start there. I don't keep low worried about Pool but we're nowhere near what we saw in '08, '09, when we saw the correction. And so when you think about how Pool Corp on their call, it's a major distributor of ours, characterized as the industry dynamics. and we look at it as 20% of the industry is new, 20% is remodeled, and we have the overall break and fix in the service to our pool business. Usually, the way those dynamics work, since our dealers are capacity constrained on labor, they'll shift their work to either building new pool or remodeling, not doing both at the same time and/or servicing the pools on a break and fix basis. So we think that that's going to -- even if you project downward trends in the industry, we think that's going to be a modest impact to Pentair. And then ultimately, we believe that we have carryover pricing as a company, and then we like the diversity of our portfolio. And we're trying to remind everybody that we're not 100% exposed to Residential. As a matter of fact, we're less than 50% exposed to Residential, and the rest of our cycles are still in growth mode. They're building orders and pipelines and backlog, and we're going to see those contributions in the next year. So that's on the revenue side. On the income side, our manufacturing inefficiencies are really more about we received product late in the quarter from our suppliers, and we have to rally and push it out to our customers. And so those inefficiencies come in the form of premium break in and less than in full truckloads on the way out, as well as a lot of overtime and extra people required to get that product out the door. So I had to quantify it, I'd say it's around $50 million. And so we're going to address all that and bring our cost in line, and we feel fairly confident that we're going to see the ROS expand next year because we're going to get back to our standard productivity levels that we were at prior to the whole COVID impact.
Operator: The next question comes from Mike Halloran of Baird.
Mike Halloran: So John, just a clarification on something you're saying in there. You referenced Pool Corp's commentary in the prepared remarks, talked about the splits there. Was that for Pentair specific, or was that an industry sellout thought process or the sell through versus what you're expecting for your revenue base, if that makes sense?
John Stauch: The statistics I give on a sell through basis, we've been using for a very long period of time, and they're generally in line with what I said, like they don't change very much. It's hard to get as specific because our dealers serve all three of the channels. And as they buy product, we make assumptions based on pool permits and/or what was bought in the pool [full] pad versus maybe just a couple of products that feel more like replacement. But our dealers serve all three forms of the industry, and most of what we've been selling lately feels more pool pad oriented. And so therefore, we're convinced that there's more to go on the break and fix. And when we talk about break and fix, we're talking about putting our dealers out there to help that individual try to automate their pool. And it's hard to push that if you don't have the electronics that produce that product. And we feel like we're catching up on that and we feel like we got runway in '23 and '24 to really change that penetration rate.
Mike Halloran: So just to clarify, I just want to make sure I understand. So the sell through piece is the 20%, that's the news was where you're going to get industry headwinds, repair, replace up a little bit, maybe flattish as per your commentary. And then the flex is in the remodel side, where we used to play out the visibility yet. And then the inventory piece would be Pentair specific as you get to the correction, so a little bit worse than those sell through numbers is what the thought process is? Correct?
John Stauch: Yes. Mike, we feel like we're pretty good at that between what we've already done in Q3 and Q4. But as Bob alluded to in his comments, I still think there's more in Q1.
Mike Halloran: So then on the commercial side of things, maybe just talk about the trends through the quarter here, backlog levels and what the customer base is saying? Essentially kind of getting to the confidence level and the sustainability of the solid underlying trends you're seeing on the commercial side.
John Stauch: I mean, I think where we have the best visibility would be on the Manitowoc side. We recently acquired them but they've got a good visibility because they make a machine, and that machine takes a little longer time to make than our Everpure filtration would. And so we still see growth both in volume basis and in the backlog and order build. And then as we get to IFT, Mike, we're actually seeing accelerating orders and also building backlog, and those businesses giving us confidence that we're going to see further growth next year than the [IT] side.
Operator: The next question comes from Joe Giordano of Cowen.
Joe Giordano: As you mentioned, Pool Corp, but when they talked on their last quarter, their commentary on ending inventories for the fourth quarter had an enormous range, and it implied for their inventory purchases for fourth quarter like anywhere from almost minus 30% to minus 8%, so like a pretty big range. And they talked about like pre buy as well. So can you kind of talk about what you're guiding in the fourth quarter somewhat like in the context of that huge framework that they're laying out?
John Stauch: I can't speak to theirs at all, Joe. Between Bob and I, we'll try to answer this as we can. We're only a third probably of our key distributors’ businesses because they produce a lot of other product for customers. And obviously, Pool Corp is an important customer of ours, but they're not our only customer. So when we look at inventory, we look at it broadly across the entire channel for pool equipment that we produce. If we think about pool directionally being about 30% down in volume for Q4, which is a pretty big number and therefore, pretty big dent in any inventories in the channel if volume were to be relatively flat absent that. But we're being honest in the sense that when we look at it, we see early buy needs in Q4 that our customers are going to take advantage of. And we believe that in Q1, we're going to start to have a better understanding product by product where the excess inventory is in the channel, and those also need to be looked at branch by branch and state by state. And therefore, we still think there will be a little bit further impact in Q1 as people ready themselves for the 2023 pool season, which generally ramps up in Q2.
Bob Fishman: I would just say that our goal is to work down as much of the channel inventory this year. John talked about a $200 million number, there will be a little bit to go in Q1. But I think we're going to end this year much better positioned for 2023 by working down that channel inventory in pool. That's really our goal.
Joe Giordano: Just to clarify, you said -- broke up a little. Did you say, John, you're talking volumes in pool of minus [30] or so in 4Q? I just didn't catch the number…
John Stauch: Correct.
Operator: The next question comes from Nathan Jones of Stifel.
Nathan Jones: It's very helpful, the commentary around where the pool inventory is likely to be at the end of the year. I think if you put the pieces together on your outlook for the different parts of Pool, your sell through expectations for the Pool business in '23 look like they're maybe up a little bit, maybe down a bit, and the inventory comes out mostly in 2022. Is that a fair way to characterize it? And if the pool sell through happened to be lower next year, how much longer do you think it would take to work through this channel inventory?
John Stauch: Well, Bob, I don't know you want try this. I'm not going to comment, you've got a lot in there. I think we've already said that we do believe overall industry dynamics are down next year from a volume perspective for Pool. We just don't know how much. We do believe that builds are going to moderate on the new side. We don't know what [buyouts] are going to do on their 25 year old pools, we'll see where that steps up. And we overall think aftermarket grows, and then we got carryover pricing that helps mitigate it. So the forecast we have or the thoughts we have as we head in next year is the understanding we'll probably see down sell through for our particular product, and our inventory corrections are based upon those assumptions. And as Bob said, we're trying to clear as much as possible in Q4 but we do believe that it's not going to be a perfect solution, and we'll see a little bit of runoff in Q1. That's all I can give you right now.
Nathan Jones: The commentary today has been pretty bullish on the improvement around supply chain. Maybe you can talk a little bit more about where you are on supply chain, what disruptions remain and what your expectation is for how those play out in '23?
Bob Fishman: Yes, I would point to pumps as an example. While we're still catching up on pumps, our supply chain there is getting marginally better. When we look at inflation, we expect inflation to still be a headwind in Q4 but to improve from Q3. So we are seeing some supply chain improvements, we're encouraged by that. John talked about some of the inefficiencies within the manufacturing process, those should lessen as we go into 2023 and be a tailwind for us. So I would say we are seeing that piece of the business improving.
Nathan Jones: John, I think you said about $50 million of inefficiencies this year. Do you think you can get rid of all of that in '23, or there will still be some of that lingering around?
John Stauch: I think that's a target that we believe we're after, and we believe between transformation and catching up on the supply chain that that's what we're after.
Bob Fishman: I would add a third component to that. So we are adjusting our manufacturing cost for the volumes that we're seeing. So being rightsized going into 2023 from a manufacturing perspective is the third lever that we have.
Operator: And next question comes from Bryan Blair of Oppenheimer.
Bryan Blair: You had mentioned resi water treatment down low double digits, channel dynamics somewhat similar to Pool. Just curious what your team is contemplating in terms of fourth quarter sales from resi treatments? And given current visibility, how long you expect channel normalization to take?
John Stauch: We're taking advantage of strength in other places and what we're doing there is refocusing the business. We were putting products probably closer to the consumer, taking advantage of some of the themes and the trends that were happening during COVID, and we now reposition that business to be 100% focused on the trade channel and/or going through our direct market, which is our RainSoft affiliated dealers. So what you're seeing there is really business exits or us doing some 80/20 and walking away from product line revenue, and then reposition the business for success in 2023. So I think you're going to see a similar trend in Q4 than you're seeing and then we think we put all that behind us.
Bryan Blair: And just to confirm, is $0.10 still the guide for Manitowoc Ice accretion next year? And I guess, to level set a bit more if we were to exclude that, is the expectation -- just given current visibility that you grow core earnings, given all the levers that you've walked through on today's call?
Bob Fishman: $0.10 is still the EPS accretion target for '23. And we're really not in a position to give guidance for 2023 other than to say we have the five levers for earnings growth next year, whether it's price carryover, Manitowoc manufacturing inefficiencies, adjusting for volume or transformation, we feel good about income, EPS growth and ROS expansion next year.
Operator: The next question comes from Brian Lee of Goldman Sachs.
Miguel De Jesus: This is Miguel on for Brian Lee. Just to maybe piggyback off of that last question, I appreciate the early thoughts you gave on 2023. Can you maybe give a bit more color on maybe the mix of the contribution on revenue of price and volume, and on Manitowoc Ice for 2023?
John Stauch: No. I mean, the reason we introduced the 2023 early thoughts chart is really to remind people that we're more than just a pool company. We believe we have a strong diversity of our portfolio that goes well beyond residential. It seems like, and you can tell by the questions we're being asked, we don't get a lot of questions on the other half of the business. And we want to remind people that we just cleared an acquisition that is a really healthy contributor to our commercial water pipeline and portfolio. We're way too early to be able to give the exact science behind all of the different revenue streams as we haven't finished our planning process internally, and we haven't seen where some of the global economics are going to land. So we're not in a position to do that other than tell you given those five levers that Bob mentioned, we feel really strong about our ability on an absolute basis to grow revenue and EPS next year.
Miguel De Jesus: And then switching gears, and it's my last question. Recognizing that new pool is relatively small part of the business, but I wanted to make sure I heard correct. Are you able to provide an early view on new pool construction in '23? I thought I heard double digit decline next year from the prepared remarks, did I hear that correctly? And if not, I guess, how are you thinking about new pool in '23?
John Stauch: Yes, I think that's fair. What we -- the only indication we have is that pool permits uphold, we generally get a look at what those pool permits are in the main states that we serve. And they would suggest that there's likely to be a double digit decline in actual new pool builds next year. And so that's how we're formulating our thought process.
Operator: The next question comes from Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jeff Hammond: Maybe just if you can speak to price carryover into 2023 just based on what you've already announced? And then just you mentioned the transformation savings. I know I think early next year, you're ready to talk more about that. But just any kind of early thoughts on how you're thinking about those savings into next year?
John Stauch: I mean, I think the best way I can characterize it, Jeff, and you're familiar with the industry. I mean, 75% of our revenue goes through the professional trade channel through [distributors]. So in most normalized [seasons], which we think we’ll be heading into one in 2023, when we put price through, we normally are able to maintain those price levels throughout the process. And so we feel there's a stickiness to announce price increases and implemented price increases that we feel we're going to benefit from. So I would say that we are moving into next year and in most cases, we we are experiencing labor inflation. And we did further our price increases here in Q4 for the 2023 season. So between the incremental price increases we announced and the ones that we implemented previously in the year, we believe we're starting from a fairly healthy carryover position heading into 2023.
Jeff Hammond: In transformation?
John Stauch: We'll give a number when we produce the guide, but we've been working very, very hard on these individual streams. And we'll give directional views of what we think we're going to achieve across each of those streams when we give our guidance for next year on the Q4 earnings announcement.
Jeff Hammond: And then just on Manitowoc Ice, maybe just level set us on -- I think that's a fairly stable business, but how -- and you've got pretty good visibility. But just how it's acted in maybe past recessions around cyclicality?
Bob Fishman: It's a -- think of Manitowoc Ice has been roughly a 5% grower. When we look back historically, that's typically what the business does. There's seasonality associated with it, so about 60% of its revenue comes in Q2 and Q3 with 40% in Q1 and Q4. But overall, when we looked at the business, it's a pretty solid 5% grower. We talked about revenue synergies that could accelerate that to 10% when you add on the Everpure business, the KBI and the cross selling across some of the customers that each of us have. So again, when we look out over the next couple of years, we're encouraged by the revenue growth of that business.
John Stauch: And Jeff, it's highly -- I mean, like our [Technical Difficulty] business, we benefit a lot towards the restaurants and they generally do relatively better in downturns and recessions. And they're very focused on cold drink dispense and that market tends to do best with inside those restaurants and stores.
Operator: The next question comes from Scott Graham of Loop Capital Markets.
Scott Graham: Really two questions. Could you -- the Pool side has been beaten to death, so I'm going to stay away from resi altogether. Could you tell us a little bit more about Commercial and Industrial sort of order or sales cadence as the quarter progresses? I don't mean dollars because everything is seasonal, of course. And the year-over-years, did you see any kind of fall off at all on into October?
John Stauch: No, I think in our non-residential businesses, we feel like we continue to see order trends and funnels as growing as we're working through those particular cycles. The only place that we've seen the year-over-year headwinds has really been on the residential channel so far, so that's where we sit today.
Bob Fishman: I would say because we started disclosing backlog in our Q, what you'll see when we file our Q is backlogs are very healthy in the IFT business. So that's an encouraging data point as well.
Scott Graham: And so both of your comments also are about particularly your -- year-over-year growth in the commercial side of Consumer Solutions. Is that fair?
John Stauch: As we sit here today, yes.
Scott Graham: And then the longer term goal talked about in the Analyst Investor Day last year of getting to, I think it was 21% margin in 2025. You got residential that's going to be a little weaker for a couple of quarters coming with Pool a big chunk of that being higher margin. Does that enable us to keep to the 20 -- I mean, netting off against some of the other things you said about supply chain and internal inefficiencies, what have you. Can you still get to that number in 2025?
Bob Fishman: I mean, we would be very disappointed if we did not. We talked at the Investor Day about transformation being our lever to expand 100 basis points a year, that excludes Manitowoc Ice. So when you add Manitowoc Ice to the mix, we would be disappointed if we just got to 21%. And I would say that we will get there much sooner than what we had described at our Analyst Day. Our focus is very much on ROS expansion.
Operator: The next question comes from Julian Mitchell of Barclays.
Matthew Shaffer: This is Matthew Shaffer on for Julian Mitchell. I was wondering how management is thinking about balancing inventory liquidation with the potential EPS headwind from underproducing to normalized inventory here over the next few quarters?
John Stauch: Well, I mean, I think our inventory situation, as I said today, is mainly a result of us doing the best we can to get the raw inventory in around the core aspects have been hard to get, and we would expect to work that down pretty aggressively here over the next couple of quarters. And as Bob mentioned earlier, we'd be in a position to benefit from the cash generation of that inventory. It serves two purposes, it's moving down faster. If you think we can buy it cheaper in the future, obviously, we don't want to be sitting on higher cost inventory so we're aggressively moving to that reason. And the second one is the cash mobilization and getting the cash benefit from that inventory.
Matthew Shaffer: And then on IFT, I was just curious like how management is thinking about the price volume dynamics here in Q4 and into 2023 after a pretty strong quarter here in Q3?
John Stauch: We want to continue the momentum that we've built over the last couple of quarters, and it's not -- I mean, we'd like to accelerate it is what we'd like to do.
Bob Fishman: And we're very focused on the complexity reduction, and the transformation will help that segment significantly.
John Stauch: Okay. I'd like to thank everybody for joining us today. At Pentair, we are focused on creating a better world for people and the planet through smart, sustainable water solutions. We appreciate your interest today and as we continue to focus on helping the world sustainably move, improve enjoy water, life's most essential resource, we remain committed to driving superior shareholder value that we maybe the world's most valued sustainable water solutions company for employees, customers and shareholders. Andrea, you can conclude the call.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-07-26 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Pentair Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please also note that today's event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference call over to Jim Lucas, SVP, Treasurer SG&A and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Jim Lucas : Thanks, Jamie, and welcome to Pentair's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. We're glad you can join us. With me today is John Stauch, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Fishman, our Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, we will provide details on our second quarter performance as outlined in this morning's press release. Before we begin, let me remind you that during our presentation today, we'll make forward-looking statements. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to detect and generally beyond the control of Pentair. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K and today's release. We will also reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the Investor Relations section of Pentair's website. We will be sure to reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. I would like to request that you limit your questions to 1 and a follow-up to ensure everyone an opportunity to ask their questions. I will now turn the call over to John.
John Stauch: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide number 4, titled Executive Summary. Pentair delivered another strong quarter with sales, segment income and adjusted EPS, all up double digits. We are particularly encouraged with our margin expansion, both sequentially and year-over-year as price more than offset continued inflationary headwinds. We're also excited to have received all of the necessary regulatory approvals related to our acquisition of Manitowoc Ice and we expect to close the acquisition later this week. With the significant growth of pool since 2019, and our Water Solutions business expected to exceed $1 billion in sales on a pro forma basis, including Manitowoc Ice and to be predominantly a commercial platform, we'll be moving to 3 segment reporting segments starting January 1, 2023. The 3 segments will be Pool, Water Solutions, Industrial & Flow Technologies. I'll provide more details on the new segment structure shortly. We are also introducing Q3 guidance of $0.93 to $0.95, and tightening our full year guidance to a range of $3.70 to $3.75. Bob will give more details on guidance later in the call, but we are seeing headwinds from FX translation as well as higher interest expense with the rise in rates over the past several months. We continue to believe we are well positioned in attractive markets. Transformation is helping strengthen our performance and the addition of Manitowoc Ice and our new segment structure positions us to continue delivering for all of our stakeholders. Please turn to Slide number 5, labeled Building a Stronger Commercial Water Solutions Platform. We introduced this slide in March when we announced our plans to acquire Manitowoc Ice. Manitowoc Ice is an iconic brand and a great business that we expect to help our commercial Water Solutions business to deliver scaled end-to-end water filtration and ice solutions for foodservice customers, along with predictive services that identify and address customer issues before they arise. This combination will transform our current water treatment business, which historically has been roughly 2/3 residential and 1/3 commercial focused. With Manitowoc Ice, we expect water treatment [indiscernible] on a pro forma basis, with commercial representing nearly 2/3 of the business and improved profitability in addition to even greater growth prospects. Please turn to Slide 6, labeled Aligning Organization for Accelerated Success. To further expand on our announced segmentation move, the addition of Manitowoc Ice will provide us with an expanded and scaled end-to-end commercial water solutions platform for important global customers. We will also reshape our water treatment business to be more commercial focused by both revenue and contribution of income than our residential business. In addition, our pool business has nearly doubled in revenue and income since 2018, which further supports the change in our Consumer Solutions segment structure. As a result, pool and water solutions will each become individual segments, and each will be focused on the respective growth and transformation plans in line with our expectations. Our existing Industrial & Flow Technologies segment will remain the same. As a result of this new structure, we have also announced a number of management changes effective January 1, 2023, when the new structure will take effect. We believe this new segment structure will help us accelerate our efforts to improve customer service, differentiate our products and drive profitability for our shareholders. Please turn to Slide 7, labeled Transformation to Enhance Value Creation. As we have shared over the past several quarters, our transformation strategy is taking shape. We are creating new tools for our toolbox, and each business is identifying their own respective opportunities to transform their business models for future success. Overall, we are focused on 4 areas: pricing; sourcing; operations and organizational effectiveness. The team has been working hard to build funnels in all four categories, and we have gained significant traction within sourcing.  During the second quarter we held a supplier show and gathered over 800 attendees representing over 450 suppliers. We have identified additional suppliers as we evaluate the entire supply chain. This event showcased the diversity of our product offerings and many suppliers, both new and existing, have gained a better understanding of how to partner with Pentair going forward. We are well underway in our efforts of evaluating the larger supplier categories and are looking forward to sharing more on our progress in the future. We believe transformation is a key value creative for Pentair longer term and we look forward to updating you in more detail and sharing our detailed targets and expectations for 2023 and beyond, early next year. I would now like to turn the call over to Bob to discuss our performance and our financial results in more detail. Bob?
Bob Fishman : Thank you, John. Please turn to Slide 8 labeled Q2 2022 Pentair Performance. We delivered second quarter sales growth of 13% with core sales increasing 12% with strong price contribution. We were particularly pleased with the top line performance given the tough comparison to last year. As we indicated last quarter, we expected to see price outpace inflation starting in the second quarter, and it played out as anticipated. Consumer Solutions delivered core sales growth of 15% against a tough comparison, and Industrial & Flow Technologies grew core revenue 7%. Segment income increased 18% and return on sales was 19.3%, which represented a 70 basis point increase year-over-year and a 210 basis point improvement sequentially. We were pleased to see the strong price contribution more than offset inflation, but many of our businesses continue to face supply chain inefficiencies, and we expect this to impact productivity in the near term. Below the line, net interest and other expense was just under $5 million. Our share count was $165.5 million and the adjusted tax rate was 16%. Adjusted EPS grew 21% to $1.02 and exceeded our guidance for the quarter. Please turn to Slide 9, labeled Q2 2022 Consumer Solutions performance. Consumer Solutions delivered another strong quarter with sales growing 19% and core sales increasing 15%. Segment income grew 18% and price more than offset inflation in the quarter. Pool sales grew 20% in the quarter, and we continued to see solid momentum as we continue through the '22 pool season. There is understandably a lot of focus on the pool industry, given the significant growth over the past 2 years. The pandemic changed consumer behaviors early on and whether it is moving to warmer climates, investing in the overall backyard or the emergence of new traveling like Airbnb, consumers are using pools more and more. The industry is estimated to be roughly 60% serving the installed base, 20% major remodeling and 20% new pool construction. New pool permits have historically run 10% of single-family starts and have been a little ahead of that lately, but pool dealers remain constrained by labor availability. Remodeling activity has been strong, but the focus on new pools has kept some of the remodeling activity from occurring, leading to healthy backlogs for dealers. Further, pool attrition has been lower as pool owners have a renewed interest in maintaining their pools. There are roughly 5.4 million pools installed and the average age of the installed base is approaching 20 years. The near-term focus for pool is managing the supply chain, keeping up with demand and improving the inventory health of all product categories. While some categories like heaters, lighting and cleaners have improved inventory positions leading to elevated growth, other categories like variable speed pumps, automation and sanitization still have healthy backlogs, given the limited availability of chips that has impacted deliveries. We continue to believe in the long-term prospects for the pool industry and will provide further updates when we report third quarter earnings in October regarding channel inventory levels as the pool season ends in September. Water Treatment grew sales 19% which included some contribution from KBI. Residential water treatment continues to be focused on complexity reduction and improving margins. Sales were up mid-single digits for the residential business with positive contribution from both affiliated dealers and components. Commercial Water Solutions continued to see a healthy recovery in its end markets, resulting in a healthy double-digit sales growth once again. The overall industry continued to improve, and KBI has strengthened and created new relationships for the business. Please turn to Slide 10, labeled Q2 2022 Industrial & Flow Technologies performance. Industrial & Flow Technologies grew sales 4% in the quarter with core revenue increasing 7%. Segment income grew 4%, and return on sales was flat at 15.7% as supply chain and plant inefficiency has continued. Residential flow grew sales 6% as demand in its channel remains solid and backlog return naturally to historic levels as component availability improved. Price has read out quite well so far this year and capacity constraints in the plants have slowly improved as labor challenges have been addressed. We expect more normalized seasonality to end the year, but are encouraged as sell-through in the channel remains healthy. Commercial flow sales were down 6% as the timing of shipments impacted the quarter. Backlog remained healthy, and we expect improvements in the supply chain should result in these delayed shipments occurring in the second half. The business continued to make progress in driving complexity reduction. Industry Solutions saw sales increase 9%. Backlog continues to be strong and orders were healthy in this longer cycle business, particularly within the sustainable gas solution business. Although this is a longer cycle business, it was encouraging to see healthy price readout in the quarter. Please turn to Slide 11, labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. The balance sheet ended the second quarter exceptionally strong with leverage at 1x and return on invested capital just under 19%. Cash flow improved sequentially and was impacted some by higher inventory levels as supply chain inefficiencies continued. This is a combination of opportunistic raw material purchases and products that have been close to being completed while awaiting final components that have been delayed. Resins, drives and electronics continue to be the categories impacted by availability challenges. We expect inventory levels to come down through the second half.  During the quarter, we completed our financing for the pending Manitowoc Ice acquisition. Given the rise in interest rates that occurred since we announced the transaction in March, we ended up with 75% of the debt variable to help mitigate some of the higher interest expense that will occur versus our original assumptions and to allow us to pay down the variable debt as free cash flow is generated. We repurchased $50 million of shares in the quarter. Our primary focus for the remainder of the year will be on debt reduction upon the closing of the Manitowoc Ice acquisition. Please turn to Slide 12, labeled Q3 and full year 2022 Pentair outlook. For the third quarter, we are introducing adjusted EPS guidance of $0.93 to $0.95, which represents a year-over-year increase of 4% to 7%. We expect total sales to grow 3% to 5% against a tough comparison as we expect seasonality for the business and channel inventory levels begin to normalize. We expect segment income to increase 5% to 7% with corporate expense coming in around $20 million, net interest expense of $6 million to $7 million, an adjusted tax rate of 16% and a share count of $165 million to $166 million. For the full year, we are adjusting our top line guidance to a range of 8% to 10% increase related primarily to a 1% higher FX headwind than previously forecasted. We expect segment income to increase 9% to 11% as we expect price continues to exceed inflation in the back half of the year, offset by manufacturing inefficiencies in the near term given ongoing component and labor availability. We expect adjusted EPS in the range of $3.70 to $3.75 or an increase of 9% to 10% for the year. We have reduced the high end of our previous guide by $0.05 to reflect FX and interest headwinds. Below the line, we expect corporate expense to be around $80 million, net interest expense of $21 million to $23 million as interest rates have increased, an adjusted tax rate of approximately 16%, and shares to be around $165 million to $166 million. We continue to target free cash flow to approximate net income. We are focused on bringing down inventory levels despite ongoing supply chain inefficiencies. Our third quarter and full year guidance does not include the impact of Manitowoc Ice, which we expect to close later this week. For the balance of 2022, we would expect the acquisition to be neutral to earnings. We had previously communicated that we expect $0.25 of accretion in 2023. However, we now expect about a $0.15 headwind from higher interest expense as a result of rates rising since we announced the transaction in March, and we will now expect approximately $0.10 accretion in 2023. We continue to target $0.40 accretion by 2025. I would now like to turn the call over to Jamie for Q&A, after which John will have a few closing remarks. Jamie, please open the line for questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup.
Andy Kaplowitz : John or Bob, could you give us some more color into how you're thinking about pool moving forward? I know you said you can give us more of an update in October, but I think you did suggest earlier in the year that you some inventory correction in the channel and pool later in '22. So given the strength you saw in pool in Q2 but obviously, more normalized inventory in the channel. Do you expect a potential channel correction to be better or worse than your initial expectations? And what could that mean for '23 pool demand?
Bob Fishman: Yes. From our perspective, the year is playing out very much like we thought it would be when we gave our initial guide at the beginning of the year. When we look at the business, we have a comparison to last year where, if you remember, inflation started accelerating in Q2, Q3 and Q4 of '21 and price was still catching up when we looked at the volume in last year's Q3 and Q4, really normal seasonality was not in play. Backlogs were high. We were shipping the products that we were available to us and revenue growth was primarily volume driven. As we built the guide for this year, our view was that price would start to read out quite effectively and price offset inflation in Q1 and then read out really nicely in the second quarter. And our view is price will continue to exceed inflation in the back half of the year. As we look at the back half of the year, price remains strong for the business. and channel inventories return to more normalized levels against tougher comparisons. So what that means is that our guide remains very consistent with what we said at the beginning of the year, and it sets us up for a more normalized pool season in 2023.
Andy Kaplowitz : Bob, maybe I could ask you to elaborate on price versus cost dynamics and supply chain in the sense that commodities have started to come down, but you definitely still talked about supply chain and efficiencies. So is price versus cost or supply chain stabilizing with your expectations? Obviously, you're in the green in Q2. The expectation in the second half, is it better or worse than you had, kind of the same? What are you seeing in terms of overall price versus cost?
Bob Fishman: Yes. I'll break that into the 2 pieces because we look at really in inflation and supply availability in 2 different pieces. From an inflation perspective, our biggest challenges really are across metals, motors, drives, electrical freight, including fuel charges and labor. Of those pieces, most are about the same with commodity prices, metals, copper, steel, showing some improvement, which would likely read out early next year. So our view is inflation gets a little bit better in the back half, but continues to be a challenge. From a supply availability perspective, heaters and lighting, cleaners have all improved. The challenge remains around variable speed pumps automation, sanitization, really anything related to availability of chips. We also continue to have challenges around resins drives electronics. So supply availability, about the same, inflation, getting a little bit better in the back half, but should read out in an improved fashion in 2023.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Giordano from Cowen.
Joe Giordano: When you think about Manitowoc Ice in the context of a potential recession and consumer weakening. I know you cut the accretion just like on the interest side, but how do you just think about the underlying performance of a business like that relative to what maybe you thought when we made the announcement?
John Stauch: Yes. I think we're still very positive about the outlook. I mean one of the things that gives us that confidence is Everpure, which is our commercial Water Solutions business, we've seen that business perform significantly well during cycles, I mean, other than COVID. And just as a reminder, we're not yet to the hospitality levels globally that we expect to get back to. And so when that global travel starts to open up, those are great markets that have been on pause for a little bit in those spaces. So we share some of the same accounts and we have opportunities to penetrate the complementary accounts. and multiple. And then we believe that the KPI service piece of it creates that ongoing service annuity around these 2 products. So no, we think it's going to perform well.
Joe Giordano: And then can you just touch on the leadership changes and like kind of the flip flop from -- of responsibilities from 1 segment to another and what those individuals bring with a fresh set of eyes to those businesses?
John Stauch: Yes. I mean listen, Mario has brought a lot of great leadership capability to Pentair, and I'm sad by what we're doing here from a standpoint that we've almost a victim of our own success. I mean pool, as we mentioned, has almost doubled since 2018. And along the way, we're now competing directly with 2 stand-alone pool public companies. And that business needs a different level of agility and focus for it to deliver to the customers' expectations and be the premier pool provider. On the Water Solutions side, we're adding a commercial element that skews us more from a residential into a commercial aspect. So all of the great capability that Consumer Solutions built, the stronger brand, the customer service, the connected solutions, the effortless customer experiences all phenomenal progress over the last 8 to 10 quarters. All of that capability we use, but I want to use it closer to the customer. So pool needs what it needs to do from those capabilities, and then we need to make sure we're not losing sight of servicing the foodservice customers in Water Solutions. So Jerome used to run pool, and so he's coming back to lead that segment. And within Water Solutions, Adrian has been very close to that process through the transformation work and the onboarding of Manitowoc, and I feel like he's going to bring the right capability and leadership style. And Demond has run our pool business for the last 3 years. He's a long-term Pentair employee, and I think he's going to bring great capability to IFT. And Mario and I talked, and I think this is a great opportunity for him to use the skills and either take my job somewhere else or go lead is a bigger segment somewhere else. So that's a little bit of color.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Halloran from Baird.
Mike Halloran: So just a clarification on the pool inventory levels from Bob's comments, I just want to make sure I understand. Essentially, you're saying you are at normal channel inventory levels for everything that really doesn't involve ships or electronics, whereas the pieces like variable speed motors, sanitization, things like that. Those are not at normal levels, those are below normal levels from a channel inventory perspective? Is that accurate?
John Stauch: Well, I think, Bob, I don't want to put words in your mouth. That's an end of year forecasted statement. And we've got a fair amount of volume reduction in our pool Q3 and Q4 year-over-year that would bring us into what we expect to be normalized levels by the end of the year. Correct?
Bob Fishman: Yes. That's built into the guidance that we have. So our view is that still catching up on the heaters, lighting -- still catching up on the variable speed pumps, the sanitization, the automation. And heaters, lightings and cleaners will be -- those backlogs will come down in Q3 and Q4.
Mike Halloran: Okay. So the commentary you made on the guidance piece of some destocking was primarily related to some of those pieces you just mentioned?
John Stauch: Yes. So I think we had our guide that we felt like we were going to the original guide. And as Bob said, our current guys equaled that original guide. And we always forecasted that we would see those inventory levels start to come down as our lead times started to get better to the channel. I mean, historically, we were generally at 5 days out for any product we made. Clearly, when we were trying to catch up in 2021, that exceeded 180 days in some aspects. Those lead times are not yet back in line to the products that Bob mentioned, anything chip-related or IoT related. And we expect that we'll begin to catch those up between Q3 and Q4 and get more normalized as we head into next year.
Mike Halloran: No, that makes sense. And then within the resi flow piece here, maybe just talk about what the sequential dynamics look like. And if you -- what kind of dynamics you're seeing on the stocking, destocking piece is kind of where end markets are tracking now versus where the inventory levels are?
Bob Fishman: Yes, resi flow continues to remain strong from a demand perspective, our bigger challenges around supply availability and labor. So backlog looks healthy. Inventory in the channel looks healthy and in good shape, we just need to deliver that backlog in Q3 and Q4.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Lee from Goldman Sachs.
Brian Lee: I guess first one, just kind of going back to your comments, Bob, around -- and I don't want to put words in your mouth, but you sort of suggested normal full season dynamics in '23. I mean historically, is that sort of a framework of low single-digit price, mid-single-digit volume? Or could we expect there's still some additional price in '23 that persists from these kind of levels? And then maybe conversely, some volume headwinds given tougher comps and maybe a slower new pool market. Just trying to get a frame of reference when you're talking about sort of the normal, if there's a new normal or sort of the historical metrics you would be referencing?
Bob Fishman: Yes. It's still very early to give our view of the 2023 pool season. But certainly, what we see today suggests more of a normal environment. So we spoke about inventory in the channels at the end of the year being more in line. And then that allows us to have some amount of price carryover from 2022, but more normalized seasonality in the business. So that's our view right now. We'll let the Q3 and the pool season ends in October and then have a better perspective on our next earnings call.
Brian Lee: All right. Fair enough. And then in IFT, I'm not sure you provided color on this, but this was, I guess, the second straight quarter, no volume growth in IFT. Maybe just level set us a bit where are we in the cycle? Just kind of thoughts on volume growth in this segment moving through the rest of 2022?
John Stauch: Yes. I just want to give some color and then Bob will take it a little deeper. I mean, just a reminder that in the flow in our IFT side, we struggle with some of the same challenges we're struggling with on the consumer solutions regarding variable speed and the availability of those drives. So we are still seeing a shortage of those products, and that's where we're having trouble getting the backlog out as well as, as Bob mentioned, some of the labor and some of the premium freight associated with that lingering around the cost side.  So Bob, I don't know if you want to provide any more color there.
Bob Fishman: It's really 3 different business. So we spoke about residential flow and that business continues to have good demand. Commercial sales was down. That's primarily due to us needing to improve some supply chain inefficiencies. And then the longer cycle Industrial Solutions business is doing well, led by sustainable gas. So again, a mix of businesses, but overall, pleased with the 7% core growth in IFT.
Operator: Our next question comes from Saree Boroditsky from Jefferies.
Saree Boroditsky: So just given the significant growth in pool demand over the last couple of years, I know you're not forecasting 2023 today, but if you do see some declines in demand into next year, what kind of levers do you have to keep profitability?
Bob Fishman: Yes. We have a number of levers. I'll start with transformation. The transformation program is really gaining momentum. We're seeing some small benefit this year in '22, but a significant funnel being built in the transformation. And we talked about a 300 basis points improvement for the overall Pentair business to 2025. So certainly on track to deliver that, so it starts with transformation. Then we have a number of inefficiencies to be honest, in the '22 P&L, and we're in the process of looking at those as we build out our plans for next year, but everything from air freighting product to having our labor and certain manufacturing inefficiencies in our factories. So overall, lots of opportunity to expand margins next year through the transformation and being laser-focused on the inefficiencies this year.
Saree Boroditsky: And then just given the addition of Manitowoc Ice in a couple of days, could you give us an update on how you're thinking about contribution to revenues for this year and then earnings into 2023?
Bob Fishman: Yes. So we have a page in the deck that talks about Manitowoc being around $325 million of revenue. If you took 5/12 of that, you can be pretty close to the revenue number. And then from an income perspective, we've talked about that being a 30% EBITDA margin business. And so again, if you took 5/12 of that, you come up with roughly what the EBITDA would be for the business.
Operator: And our next question comes from Bryan Blair from Oppenheimer.
Bryan Blair: I was hoping you could offer a little more detail on underlying trends in commercial water treatment prepared remarks and pretty bullish on trajectory there. Just curious if there's any discernible shift in underlying demand as Q2 progressed or what you're seeing in the early part of Q3?
John Stauch: Yes. I mean it's a steady mid-single-digit grower normalized, and we continue to see it flip along at that rate. I think there's always a little bit of headlines on restaurants that are challenged, but then you always see or don't hear about the new restaurants that come online. And so while restaurants might not be able to fill out their capacity levels because of labor constraints, it doesn't mean that they're necessarily using less water. And that water in most of our restaurants is filtered to a high-quality standard. So I mean, we're seeing good progress there, and we're continually to be bullish on that particular space.
Bryan Blair: I appreciate the color. And just to level set, are there any operational factors that are restricting Manitowoc Ice accretion this year or lowering the 2023 outlook? It sounds like it's strictly interest expense. Just want to make sure that, that is the case.
Bob Fishman: Just interest. The business is tracking well, and our goal is to be focused on synergies next year in addition to that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nathan Jones from Stifel.
Nathan Jones: Question on the inventory comments. You talked about looking to take inventory down in the second half of the year despite supply chain challenges. Is that more related to the seasonality in the business that you're looking to take inventory down? Or is there a move at the moment to structurally reduce inventory that you may have been carrying because of the supply chain challenges.
John Stauch: Both. I mean, I think Bob mentioned that we're going to have a normal seasonality next year, just to be clear, regardless of what the pool outlook is for 2023. We think it will be back in line with historical patterns of peak performance in Q2, a little lighter in Q1 and Q4 regarding that pattern and that's what we think to happen. And what we expect to be at is that we're back to more normalized inventory that would reflect no more further significant supply chain issues. I had a couple more questions on that. We're still short, as you've heard from some of our key customers. And they need those variable speed pumps. They need the sanitizers. And when we finish those out and get those to them, they can get to close the pool pads out, and then that brings the inventory back in line.
Nathan Jones: Okay. Makes sense. And 1 on the transformation. You guys have been talking about the funnel of opportunities for transformation continuing to build. But I noted in the in the press release today that there's no expected expenses for transformation in the second half of the year. Can you just talk about -- have these been self-funding now? Or why are they not expenses related to transformation, but you're talking about a building pipeline of opportunity?
Bob Fishman: Yes. We typically would not forecast transformation expenses. We do forecast the amortization on intangibles going forward, but we would not forecast that. You can expect us to continue at about the same rate as what you saw in Q1 and Q2 in the back half of the year as we spend money on third-party consultants to help us drive primarily pricing and sourcing.
Operator: Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays.
Matthew Shaffer: You have Matthew Shaffer on from Julian Mitchell's team. My first question was for IFT, you guys had good margin expansion year-over-year in 2021, but that seemed to run out of scheme in 2022. What are your expectations for margin expansion in the division for the remainder of the year? And then can you just remind us to the IFT complexity reduction initiatives and the expected impacts there?
Bob Fishman: We are pleased with the IFT ROS improvement in the business. We do expect to finish the year with return on sales higher than the prior year. You'll remember that last year, they started benefiting from complexity reduction in the back half that trend has continued, and we continue to have momentum in that business. So overall, we were flat for Q2, but do expect in the back half of the year. to see Ross expansion in that business.
John Stauch: And as I said in my comments, we had a supplier show, and you probably heard me talk about all the great opportunity to partner differently with supply partners, you should read into that a lot of complexity of product, both in the form of castings as well as semiconductors and PCB boards and et cetera. And so as we go forward, the opportunity to consolidate those designs is a big piece of how we think we're going to drive longer-term margins in IFT and Consumer Solutions, of course, but we'll see it in IFT as well.
Matthew Shaffer: Great. And then the second half sales growth applied to be low single digits, mid-single digits for the company. How much of that growth will be from price first volume? Or any detail there would be very helpful.
Bob Fishman: We expect price to continue to be strong at that double-digit rate. So we did 10% in Q1 and 14% in Q2. So I think double digits in the back half is our assumption.
John Stauch: And then if action continues to be the headwind on a year-over-year basis, and you can back into the volume, which is comparison to higher levels in Q3 and Q4. And then also, as we mentioned, our views of what the inventory correction will be in the channel due to supply chain catching up.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jeff Hammond: Just can you give us the -- like what's the assumption for the volume decline in pool in the second half? And then just on the third quarter, I think you're saying 3% to 5% growth. What's kind of -- is there much differentiation between the 2 segments?
Bob Fishman: Yes. We don't really want to get into all the specific pieces for each of the different segments. I would say that overall, for the company, we've talked about price reading out double-digit. You can think about acquisitions, roughly offsetting FX and then the rest is volume. So think about volume as being down low single digits to mid-single digits in the back half.
Jeff Hammond: Okay. And then can you give us any color on how to think about Manitowoc Ice seasonality? Is it pretty ratable quarter-to-quarter or?
Bob Fishman: Yes, pretty flat quarter-to-quarter.
Jeff Hammond: Okay. And then just last on transformation, just -- you guys have been talking about it for a while. What do you think is the timing where you start to kind of spike out kind of the different buckets and cost savings, et cetera?
John Stauch: I think early next year, in accordance with when we provide the guidance, we would expect to give you the transformation expectations and break out some of the components of how we're going to achieve that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Graham from Loop.
Scott Graham : John, Bob, Jim. I wanted to ask you maybe to develop your answer to a previous question, I think about 1 business for July. How are things in July in general? Is there any big change, 1 segment versus another versus the second quarter? Just maybe whatever you can tell us about July would be helpful.
Bob Fishman: Off to a good start in July, a lot of it comes down to the allocation of key product, and so we're on track to deliver the quarter based on the start in July.
Scott Graham : Got it. And forgive me for not having to put pent of paper on your last answer on download to mid-single for the second half in the volumes. But is the second quarter pricing, is that kind of the peak and then we kind of moderate a little bit because the second half of last year, you started to see the ramp?
Bob Fishman: That's exactly right. Still double digits, but starts to moderate.
Scott Graham : That’s great. If I could just squeeze in this last one. You’ve got a pretty healthy incremental margin implied in your third quarter guidance. Is that mostly a widening of the price cost gap or is there something else?
A –Bob Fishman: Price cost stays about the same and I think the Q3 Ross is roughly in line with the first half.
Operator: And our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research.
Rob Wertheimer: So I had 2 questions. One is simply on gross margin, where you noted, obviously, price is catching up and nicely so to some of the cost increases we've seen. Is there still [100 bps] or more tailwind as that continues to happen and you revert back to higher gross margin levels. I know those issues of mix and I know those issues of don't necessarily get margin on pricing. So just -- is there still a continued tailwind on gross margin?
John Stauch: Yes. I'll take the first part, and then Bob will give you a little bit more color. I'm looking at '19, and I'm looking at my gross margins in '19. And as you recall, we took a small dip in '20 as COVID started to unfold, and we've been catching up ever since. And so our gross margins are still down from '19, and we still believe when we look at our transformation savings that we're using that historical point and then seeking to drive significant gross margin expansion from there. So as we think of pricing as we think of sourcing, it's not just about getting back from -- back to that level. We want to be back to that level and then some which would get after the right pricing dynamics that we're seeking in each of our industries as well as getting real sourcing benefits from our supply partners. And from, as I mentioned earlier, reducing the complexity of our designs through our incentives of Excellence.  So Bob, I don't know if you want to bring more color.
Bob Fishman: Yes, all of our transformation initiatives are focused on sustainable gross margin improvement. So when we talk about 300 basis points of RAS, you can basically equate that to 300 basis points minimum of gross margin.
Rob Wertheimer: Perfect. And then from here, is that more pricing catching up? Or is that more just like reducing all the inefficiencies and then doing all the things you're talking about transformation to get there?
John Stauch: Yes. I think in our distribution and dealer-based businesses, we're pretty confident having been through these cycles before that our customers understand that labor is a big piece of the price that the price efforts we put into place, we would expect to be more sustainable levels. When you get a more project to the OEM-related businesses, I mean, there is a dynamic where we would expect to see pricing headwinds in those businesses, and we need to capture more sourcing savings to drive those gross margins as we go forward. So it's different depending on what business you're looking at, it's a combination of both of those things.
Rob Wertheimer: Perfect. And then if I can, I mean, there's a lot of questions on -- really on the consumer, obviously, the big theme in the quarter. And you have some natural strength, I mean pool has a lot of stability to a lot of backlog, a lot of different things. I'm curious if you're able to look through all that in whether consumer treatment or anything else on just what the current mood is. If you're seeing any downturn or any inflection on near-term purchases that would indicate a change in trends, and I'll stop there.
John Stauch: Yes. I think it's hard to see the immediate reactions. I mean, it's logical to think that higher interest rates are going to put a pinch on consumer spending. And I would say that we break those into 2 categories, what's the discretionary piece and what's the nondiscretionary piece. We don't see pool owners, in particular, on the high end, really changing behavior at all. House is still continuing to transact. Some of those or most of those, I should say, are cash based, and they're still going to seek those pools. I think where we may or may not see it as we look into 2023 and '24 is on remodeling, home remodeling, and/or what is a nondiscretionary purchase of a higher-end water softener, water treatment system, et cetera. That's where we'd see it. We have not seen it yet, but that's where we would expect to see and measure the consumer sentiment regarding our products. The rest is break and fix and I'd call that nondiscretionary and you need a pump, you need a pump. You need a filter replaced, you need a filter replaced.
Operator: Our next question comes from Damien Karas from UBS.
Damien Karas: Just have a follow-up question on price. You mentioned you're expecting up double digits in the second half. Is that primarily just coming from prior price actions? And how should we be thinking about what your refreshed pricing that usually hits in September is going to be aligned? I mean is there some incremental price that's likely to happen? And just we're talking lower relative to actions from the past year? Or given material deflation that we've been seeing recently, is it possibly just more of a pause on kind of the September price refresh?
Bob Fishman: So to answer your first question, the price reading out in the back half of the year is based on all of the price actions that we have taken over the last couple of quarters. So those are locked in. As we think about price moving forward in the back half of the year, price increases, I would expect at this point that there will be some price increases. Labor continues to be high. while we are seeing some relief in commodity, we continue to see pressure on other pieces of the supply chain. So definitely moderating, but at least at this point, suggesting some small price increase.
Damien Karas: Okay. That's helpful. And Bob, you talked about the higher interest expense and variable debt. Could you maybe just give us your updated thinking on capital structure and your capital deployment priorities post closure of the Manitowoc deal?
Bob Fishman: So from a capital allocation perspective, maintaining our investment grade is extremely important to us. So I typically start with that. In terms of paying our dividend, we've increased our dividend 46 years in a row. That's important as well. Near-term focus will be on debt reduction as we bring down that interest cost. And then from an M&A perspective, we are entirely focused on the successful integration of Manitowoc Ice and driving the synergies that we've discussed previously. So from a capital allocation perspective, those would be the key priorities.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to John Stauch, President and Chief Executive Officer, for any closing remarks.
John Stauch: Thank you for joining us today. It's an exciting time for Pentair, and we are preparing to make the most of it. We expect Manitowoc Ice and our new segmentation to be accelerators for all of our stakeholders, and we look forward to updating you on our progress in the future.  Jamie, you can conclude the call. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll conclude today's conference call. We thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-04-21 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the Pentair’s Q1 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to Jim Lucas. Please go ahead.
Jim Lucas: Thanks Jay, and welcome to Pentair's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. We're glad you could join us today. I'm Jim Lucas, Senior VP, Treasurer, FP&A and Investor Relations. And with me today is John Stauch, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Fishman, our Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, we will provide details on our first quarter performance as outlined in this morning's press release. Before we begin, let me remind you that during our presentation today, we will make forward-looking statements. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Pentair. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K and today's release. We will also reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the Investor Relations section of Pentair's website. We will be sure to reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to John.
John Stauch : Thank you, Jim. And good morning, everyone. Please turn to slide 4 titled executive summary. We were pleased to deliver a solid first quarter that exceeded our previously communicated expectations. Sales expanded 15% in the first quarter, and we were encouraged to see price continue to read out positively. Inflation is unfortunately not showing any signs of moderating, which is why we expect to increase price even further to cover the incremental inflation headwinds. During the first quarter, we announced the agreement to acquire Manitowoc Ice, which I’ll discuss it a little bit more detail shortly. We believe this is a great complimentary acquisition that will help enhance our strong commercial water solutions business. Bob will give more details on our guidance later in the call. But we are updating our full year guidance to reflect a little more top line growth. And our full year adjusted EPS range remains unchanged at $3.70 to $3.80. We are entering our seasonally strongest quarter with continued momentum. And we believe that Pentair is well positioned for 2022 and beyond. Please turn to slide 5, labeled building a track record of consistent growth. We believe in our strategy, and we are building a track record of consistent growth despite the many external global supply chain and inflation challenges that most companies are facing. Growing a core is our number one priority. Whether it is sales, income growth, or margin expansion, we must deliver in all areas. We are a leader in pool and continue to be well positioned to serve a large growing installed base. Water treatment is benefiting from consumers focusing on water quality, which benefits both our residential and commercial businesses. We have a sizable flow business with several strong positions in areas such as water supply, water disposal, fire suppression, and flood control. Our industrial solutions business continues to focus around its two biggest opportunities, membrane filtration, and sustainable gas. I will touch on transformation in a moment. But we believe this is one of the biggest long-term opportunities for Pentair. This is not just about unlocking value and improving margins. Rather it is about doing things better and more optimally, and positioning Pentair for the best possible future. Our balance sheet has been one of our biggest strengths, and we are currently in the process of using it with the announced agreement to acquire Manitowoc Ice. While we have built an improved track record of growth in the past couple of years, we believe there's still a long runway ahead for Pentair. Please turn to slide 6, labeled transformation to enhance value creation. Transformation is a word we chose carefully because we are not just focused on taking out costs. Transformation is about improving the way we do business. I remind the team consistently that we need to celebrate the successes of what we have been doing and the way we have done it. But that does not mean these are the right processes going forward. Transformation comes from our lean methodology. It is about identifying the current state, recognizing that you can be much better and therefore creating the future state vision and then building your transformation plan to achieve it. We are focused on four transformational areas, pricing, sourcing, operations and distribution and organizational effectiveness. While 2021 was about planning, we are now moving to the execution phase. Our two biggest opportunities are in pricing and sourcing where we brought in outside partners to help us transform these key processes. We continue to build funnels and we're seeing momentum build, as our outside partners help train us on how to unlock additional value within our four targeted areas. We are bringing greater focus and prioritization and we're using data analytics to drive our decision making. We have seen many of our more complex businesses such as flow make great strides and improving margins, and they are now turning the focus on targeted growth opportunities. Transformation is a key value creator for Pentair longer term, and we look forward to updating you in more detail and sharing our targets and expectations for 2023 and beyond later in the year. Please turn to slide 7, labeled advancing total water management and building a stronger commercial water solutions platform. In early March, we announced our agreement to acquire Manitowoc Ice. We believe it's a great business that will allow us the opportunity to bring to our customers a total water management solution through our commercial water solutions business and expand our offerings. On a pro forma basis, we expect our commercial water solutions business to be a nearly $700 million business, made up of three different growing categories. Everpure is a projected $225 million very high margin respected industry brand that allows us to provide our foodservice customers with high quality water for their specialty needs. Manitowoc is a projected $325 million high margin brands that has a proven track record of creating and delivering dependable ice machines. And KBI is a projected $125 million lower margin, but significantly important and well known service leader with a reputation for providing one of a kind service, preventative maintenance and infrastructure for commercial customers. Combined, these three businesses can offer end to end water filtration ice solutions for food service customers, along with predicted services that identify and address customer issues before they arise. Together, we anticipate that we can deliver sustained commercial water solutions, double digit revenue growth at mid-20s margins by providing ice and better cleaner water to people all around the world. We expect the closing the Manitowoc transaction to occur in the second or third quarter, subject to regulatory approvals. I would now like to turn the call over to Bob to discuss our performance and our financial results in more detail. Bob?
Bob Fishman: Thank you, John. Please turn to slide 8, labeled Q1 2022 Pentair performance. We deliver first quarter sales growth of 15% with core sales increasing 12% with strong price contribution. While inflation continues to accelerate, we were pleased to see price offset inflation for the first time in almost a year. Consumer Solutions delivered core sales growth of 17% and Industrial and Flow Technologies grew core revenue 6%. Segment income increased 5% while return on sales declined 180 basis points to 17.2%. The principal contributors to the margin decline were the lower margin impact of recent acquisitions, supply chain inefficiencies and elevated inflation. We were encouraged to see return on sales improve sequentially with strong price contribution. While inflation is showing no signs of moderating and supply chain disruptions remain, we expect return on sales to show strong sequential improvement into the second quarter. Below the line net interest debt expense was just under $4 million. Our share count was 166.5 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 16%. Adjusted EPS grew 5% to $0.85 and exceeded our guidance for the quarter. We made the decision to exit what has been a very small business in Russia. Exiting the business resulted in a $6 million charge relating to the write-off of receivables, inventories and other costs related to contracts that we will no longer fulfill. This was the right thing to do. And we know that both our sales before and its cost related to our exit were immaterial amounts. Please turn to slide 9, labeled Q1 2022 Consumer Solutions performance. Consumer Solutions delivered another strong quarter with sales growing 23% and core sales increasing 17%. The acquisitions of KBI and Pleatco were positive contributors to the top line. However, they do operate today at lower margins. And this resulted in pressure on return on sales. Segment income grew 6% and price nearly offset inflation in the quarter as we continue to see strong readout in both businesses within consumer solutions. Pool sales grew 23% in the quarter, and we continue to see strong momentum entering the beginning of the pool season. We commented last quarter that we are seeing channel inventory is more in line with historical levels. And while some categories are still catching up, the channel is in much better shape entering this season this year than last. Within Pool, we have a relentless focus on creating an even more effortless experience for our customers. We have recently launched a new order status portal that allows customers to have greater visibility on order status information without making calls. We have also enhanced our phone system for easier navigation to ensure that dealers and consumers alike receive the proper and advanced resource support when needed. One of our key differentiators in Pool’s long-term success is loyalty from our dealers. We have long focused on industry leading sales and technical training to enable our dealers to learn the benefits of our products and help facilitate an easier installation process. We have invested in experienced training centers to allow dealers as well as builders and service companies to have a more intimate learning of our products. One of our key areas of focus is to enable our customers, both distributors and dealers to advance their businesses. We continue to focus on building our innovation pipeline. We are launching our new IntelliFlo 3 pump to create a more efficient flow management experience. We are also launching a higher end version of this pump, with a mini automation system on board to provide the consumer with enhanced control and functionality of their pool. Overall Pool is seeing strong demand from dealers and builders with good visibility through the 2022 season. We continue to carry a healthy backlog in Pool. Although this has historically been a short cycle business with low lead times. As we continue to increase capacity, and hopefully see signs of supply chain inefficiencies easing, we expect backlog to come down through the course of the year. Water Treatment through sales 24%, which included some contribution from KBI. Residential water treatment continues to be focused on complexity reduction, and improving margins. Sales were up mid-single digits for the residential business with positive contribution from both affiliated dealers and components. Commercial Water Solutions continued to see a healthy recovery in its end markets, resulting in healthy double digit growth once again. The addition of KBI has improved and brought in many of our customer relationships. The core Everpure business has enjoyed a strong rebound in quick service restaurants and convenience stores with improvements starting to come in the hospitality sectors as consumers once again start traveling more. We have been most encouraged with the global nature of the recovery in commercial water solutions. In addition to our total water management efforts, this continues to be an important growth factor for us and is contributing a healthy funnel of new opportunities with current and new distributors, dealers and customers. We're also seeing the food service industry particularly quick serve restaurants, adapting to new standards in restaurant design and equipment that is generating opportunities for new installations and reconfiguration of existing restaurants. Please turn to slide 10, labeled Q1 2022 Industrial and Flow Technologies performance. Industrial and Flow Technologies grew sales 4% in the quarter with core revenue increasing 6%, segment income grew 4% and return on sales increase as all businesses within IFT are making progress on complexity reduction. Residential flow grew sales 1% but this included a headwind from a small product line divestiture in the quarter. Overall, residential flow continues to see strong demand as it enters its seasonally strongest quarter. The business is being impacted by supply chain inefficiencies and labor shortages, which along with strong demand has resulted in strong backlog for this historically shorter cycle business. Overall, we expect residential flow to have a solid year with price reading out nicely and backlog being worked out as supply chain and inefficiency, hopefully begin to ease as the year progresses. Commercial flow grew sales 1% as the focus continues to be on complexity reduction and improving margins. The business has made good progress in fuel reduction, driving productivity and beginning to move to more of configure to order instead of engineer to order business model. This is resulting in greater efficiency in the plan and we have seen several quarters in a row of margin improvement as a result. Industrial solution saw sales increase 11% as larger global beer manufacturers are increasing their CapEx budget, and we continue to see strong demand in orders and sales for our sustainable gas business. The business also benefited from the addition of Pleatco. Overall, the longer cycle industrial solutions business has seen solid improvement in orders and backlog. And we expect the top line momentum to continue as the year progresses. Please turn to slide 11, labeled balance sheet and cash flow. The balance sheet ended the first quarter in very strong shape. Our leverage ended the quarter just over one time and our return on invested capital remained in the high teens. Free cash flow usage in the quarter was more in line with historical trends than what we experienced at the start of last year when sales were more linear through that quarter. To start 2022, we saw a slow start in January due in part to Omicron related absenteeism in many of our factories. We had a particularly strong last month of the quarter that resulted in higher receivables that we should collect in the second quarter. In addition, we have been advantageously buying higher than usual level of key components as we manage through today's supply chain inefficiencies. For the year, we continue to expect free cash flow to approximate net income, and the second quarter should see traditional strength and free cash flow generation in line with historical trends. Please turn to slide 12, labeled, Q2 and full year 2022 Pentair outlook. For the second quarter, we are introducing adjusted EPS guidance of $0.98 to $1.01 which represents a year-over-year increase of 17% to 20%. We expect total sales to grow 11% to 13%, which we believe is a strong showing, given the particularly difficult comparison to the same period last year. We expect segment income to increase 14% to 17%, with corporate expense coming in around $20 million, net interest expense of $5 million to $6 million and adjusted tax rate of 16% and a share count of 166.5 to 167.5 million. For the full year, we are modestly increasing our top line guidance to a range of 9% to 11%, reflecting a slightly better showing in the first quarter in addition to further price action anticipated to offset continued higher inflation. We continue to expect segment income to increase 10% to 13%. And adjusted EPS in the range of $3.70 to $3.80, or an increase of 9% to 12% for the year. Below the line, we expect corporate expense to be around $80 million, net interest expense of $18 million to $20 million and adjusted tax rate of approximately 16% and shares to be around 167 million to 168 million. Finally, as we stated previously, we expect free cash flow to approximate net income. I'd now like to turn the call over to Jay for Q&A after which John will have a few closing remarks. Jay, please open the line for questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.
Joe Giordano: Hey, good morning, guys. I wanted to just start on IFT actually, the volume number there was negative, which was maybe a little bit surprising. So just any color there, obviously, price is going to read through and it's offsetting that. But did that kind of like accelerate to the downside at the end of the quarter? How did that kind of looking? What's the view on volumes therefore as you go forward?
John Stauch : From a volume perspective, it was really within our residential, our flow business. And what we saw there was just some of the challenges associated with labor shortages and supply chain challenges. That got us off to a slow start in the quarter. What we like within the flow business is the backlog remains strong, the demand is there. So from our perspective, it was more a matter of battling through some of those challenges, and then starting to grow more significantly throughout the year.
Joe Giordano: Okay, great. And then follow up just on the inventory build. Is that like finished product ready to go out? Or is this like stuff that's still waiting for components that are still hard to get, like semi-finished inventory that you have?
John Stauch : Yes, really the latter is, it is raw material that advantageously buying products so that we can meet demand for its product that's waiting to be built into finished goods. So it is a headwind for us in the first quarter and we're actively setting targets and managing that but it is a reflection of the supply chain challenges that we face.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran of Baird.
Mike Halloran: Hey, good morning, gentlemen. On the price cost side, obviously, good to see you catching up in and being towards even in the quarter, how are you thinking about that going forward from here? Obviously, put another price increase to manage the current inflation or incremental inflation. Is the first quarter peak pain and is that how you're thinking about it in the guidance and any thoughts on how that cadences through the year?
John Stauch : From our perspective, inflation will continue to stay high, I looked at the inflation amount that was in Q1 of roughly $89 million. And we're not assuming that gets any better the balance of the year. But the good news is that prices reading out, and so we should see price cost difference increase throughout the year, which will help our margin expansion story. We're positive around margins improving from -- in the second half versus the first half, margins will improve significantly in the second quarter, both sequentially, and on a year-on-year basis. So we start winning the price cost battle, rather than just offsetting it like we did in the first quarter. So we're encouraged there. From our perspective, Q1 was very much of an inflection point, we improved margins versus Q4, and we had a number of quarters previous to that where we were showing margins declining. So from our perspective, margin expansion continues from here, with Q1 having been the biggest challenge.
Mike Halloran: Thanks for that. And then on Manitowoc Ice, you mentioned in the prepared remarks, double digit growth expectations, just with the mid-20% margins, maybe you can help on the growth side, just parse out how are you thinking about that from market versus some of these revenue synergies targets that you laid out on the acquisition conference call? And then kind of a second part of the question is just thoughts on the timing of close, and if anything's changed on that side?
John Stauch : Yes. So I mean, if you take the three categories we talked about, I mean, obviously, we have two of them in our portfolio today, we're still waiting to bring the third one in. But whenever cure itself has always been a mid to high single digit performer like, just volume alone. And we still don't have the full recognition of the global hospitality markets recovering anywhere near where they were pre-COVID. And we're still waiting for that to occur. And when that occurs, we're really confident that we're going to continue to see that expansion on our filtration lines. Our KBI business has been growing double digits and continues to see that type of opportunity, primarily around installation service plan maintenance for key partners, domestically. And then when we took a look at the Manitowoc acquisition, and due diligence, it has a similar growth profile to Everpure. So absent any synergies at all, we think these are mid-single digit growers. And then when you add some of the prospective synergies that we hope to deliver on that, then that's how you get to the double digits. And then the margins of blend, as I said have very high margin product businesses between Ice and Everpure been offset by a low margin KBI service offering.
Mike Halloran: And then just timing of close, any change there?
John Stauch : Yes, I mean, we were targeting Q2, we've clearly said Q2 or Q3. We continue to work through the regulatory processes, it's taken longer than we would expect it and there's a big deal that between two partners on the larger side that they've got to get through and then we've got to get through our, so yes, we do think that this is more of early Q3, Q2 being the best case
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey, can we started in pool, very impressive growth. And you commented that you've seen normal channel inventory. How about product availability? Remember a year ago that was an issue, any issues there with products, how's the channel look and just degree of confidence about a strong start to the year without an early buy I know. And then you degree of confidence and be able to grow in ‘22 despite tough comps.
Bob Fishman: I can start with that one. We are seeing channel inventory is more in line with historical level. Some of the categories within that doors are still catching up. So continuing to be focused really across the product lines but overall in very good shape there as we enter what should be a very robust pool season in 2022. Our view is that we're in very good shape with the backlog and with the demand to continue to grow the pool business. We have guidance, previously, we had guidance of mid to high single digits for consumer solutions, and we raised our revenue guide. So consumer solution is really trending more towards high single digits with obviously, pool leading the way. So we're confident that this will be another strong year of growth for the pool business. The underlying factors driving the growth of more of a larger installed base, due to new pool builds over the last couple of years, our focused on the replacement side of the business, more people buying second homes, more people putting in pools that underlying demand is there, which is why we're optimistic. I would say our guide for the year is realistic, we expect growth to continue, we don't want to get ourselves ahead of ourselves, and we want to get ahead of ourselves for Q4. We want to set ourselves up for a good start to the 2023 season as well. So I think we've got a very balanced forecast, and remain very optimistic about the pool business.
John Stauch : Deane, if I can just add, I mean, you followed us for some time. I think the products that we're most excited by are the automation products, and they are the ones that are hardest to get through the supply chain. And so we're encouraged by the desires of the consumers to add more automation to their pool pads. And we're doing the best we can but we're fighting for chips and drives like everybody, and we want to make sure we got those products to the consumers and satisfying their long-term pool automation needs.
Deane Dray: Yes, that's great to hear. I'll take the specifics on the IntelliFlo automation systems that you've added. I'll take that offline with Jim, really interested in hearing about the features and functionality. And I just as a follow up question really impressive work on price costs. I just wanted to -- I was -- I'm intrigued by your comment that you're getting additional outside consultants on pricing. And we've seen other companies do this and do it successfully value based pricing and so forth, but on the expectation for ’22, will you start to benefit from that additional, like data analytics on pricing? And is that baked into your guide? Thanks.
John Stauch : Yes, we're working like crazy, Deane. And let me give you an inside view here. I mean, we price primarily to distribution prices to dealers, and we've done that historically more blind to what the actual consumer in the market is paying. And so getting that understanding of what the value to the end customer is regarding our products, obviously, versus competitor alternatives in the market space is very important for us to price effectively and thoughtfully. And that's what we're spending time doing, Deane. So that we can think of the end-to-end value proposition of our core products. And get our fair share of that. So most of the pricing we've done today, it is just been trying to catch up with inflation, what we want to do going forward is to really think of the value that product provides and price it effectively, we're only working on three categories right now. We have about 20 product lines that we're focused on. So our goal is to accelerate that as quickly as possible this year. So to make sure that we utilize that analytics into next year's pricing season.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Brian Lee of Goldman Sachs.
Miguel Barrio : Hi, good morning, everyone. Thank you. I just wanted to go back to just the guidance real quick. And I'd say this is Miguel on for Brian Lee. The segment income, the revenue growth guidance increase, but the segment income growth was unchanged, based on the commentary it seems like price cost is reading out well and seeing a nice deflection from the first quarter. But I think the guiding suggests a bit more pressure on margins for the full year than what was anticipated prior, is that fair, and is all of that a result of inflation or is there anything else that is kind of become more incrementally more challenging on the cost or the pricing side? Thanks.
John Stauch : Yes, I think that's a fair assumption. I think we had a pessimistic view of inflation heading into our early guide. And it's even worse than that, which is where the incremental price comes into play. If we took a look at where that inflation is coming from, it's primarily the oil based freight. And the responses necessary to catching up the global supply chain because COVID is not over. And you're familiar with what's going on in China right now. And that means that to get that product in ahead of the season, there's going to be some incremental freight costs associated with it. And that's what we're working through. And obviously, we're working with all kinds of supply chain partners to optimize the availability of product, but we have a season and that season is Q2 and Q3. And we're going to do what's necessary to deliver the product within that season, and it is going to cost us a little bit more to get that product in. And given the demand that we feel is there in the end markets, I think we'll be able to recover that. But yes, your observation is correct.
Miguel Barrio : Thanks. I have a just a quick follow up, if I may. Just wanted to go back on the inventory build. Are the materials and the related products there? Are they related more to I guess, one segment or another like for IFT, just based on the commentary on chips, just any color that would be great.
Bob Fishman: The increase in inventory is really broad based and really cuts across both consumer solutions and IFT. So from our perspective, it's no one category, it's really across our businesses.
John Stauch : And as motors drives and drives our chips, right, semiconductors, it's the same product that we've been chasing for the last five quarters. And it's the same products that the whole entire global supply chain is trying to get their hands on.
Bob Fishman: Yes, if you look at our supply chain challenges, its residents, motor drives, electronics on the inflation side, it's sprayed metals, electronics, motors, castings, and molding. So across the board, nothing's getting easier. So big thank you to our supply and ops teams that did an incredible job, especially in the month of March after we got off to a slower start because of COVID.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jeff Hammond: Hey, good morning, guys. Hey, in Pool Corp’s release, they talked about kind of five point benefit from an extra day and early buy which I assume means contractors are taking product earlier. And I'm just wondering if you're seeing that as well, and kind of how then forms kind of a 2Q ramp if that is indeed taking place.
Bob Fishman: We're really not seeing that, no significant or early buy and really nothing outside of what we've done historically. So nothing really bad there unless we could get some more color.
John Stauch : Hey, Jeff, I mean, our Q2 forecast assumes that we do better in April than January because we got off that slow start and then we continue to meet that Q2 seasonal ramp and at the moment, we're very confident about that. And that's where the growth is coming from. And then to remind you, most of our dealers are on a pool season ends at the end of Q3, Pool Corp is on a fiscal year end like we are and so that we start to identify and fulfill those pool obligations in Q3. And then we take a look at next year's inventory needs and we partner with our channel to figure out what's needed for 2023. So that's how we're working through it. And as a reminder, we didn't do much early buy at all because of the demand and the backlog. So what we're doing right now is building sell-through demand.
Jeff Hammond: Okay, great. And then just on, we've kind of did our own checks and haven't really been able to find cracks, but we've seen kind of the consumer step back in some areas, obviously you're seeing tons of inflation rates higher. People seem to be shifting from kind of stay at home to services and I'm just wondering, as you pull your channel if you're seeing any kind of early cracks around the consumer. I understand the backlog is abnormally high but just looking for any evidence that the tone is changing. Thanks.
Bob Fishman: Yes, I will use the word cracks because I think right now in dealing with the channel, they're doing everything they can to fulfill their obligations to their customers within this year's pool season. I think if you look at the historical data points, interest rates, housing starts, et cetera, et cetera. I think you're seeing the signs of what could be a tightening and a desire tightening from the Fed that's going to have a slowdown to the overall residential impacts, Jeff. And I'm anticipating that and I think that'll play out in 2023. I don't think there's going to be a steep decline, though, because we didn't -- we don't have these housing starts like we did in ’06 and ’07. I mean, housing starts are still at historical levels right now. And they're trying to work through their supply constraints to deliver that. And it's not in my view a bubble, it's just ultimately the fulfillment of what's needed to satisfy the movement to the warm weather state. So I think we're in pool and in residential water treatment, we're skewed towards the aftermarket, and the replacement industry significantly. And the new housing starts are moderated in the sense that they're about where they were historically. And so pools are up a little bit as a percentage of those houses, but they're not up significantly.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz of Citigroup.
Andy Kaplowitz: Hey, good morning, guys. So I think one of the reasons why you guys thought that pool demand would hold up to sort of responding to last question that you have this sort of pent-up demand for renovation, and then eventually sort of more after market demand. Any more color into how you see that evolving given some of the signs that are out there, interest rates, as you talked about, John, and any more color that would be helpful.
John Stauch : Yes, and I think I’ll take the first part, I'll have Bob, take the second. I mean, as a reminder, the reason we started disclosing the backlog and across the need to stop businesses in Pentair is because the percentage that they became of the overall revenue and the need to do that, under the SEC guidelines, this is a business historically in pool that candidly started every quarter with no backlog, right. So everything has historically been our ability to ship in five days to the end customer through our distribution channel partners, and we would book and fulfill those orders within the same quarter. That's the nature of most of our residential making stock businesses, because you have a distributor that's also holding inventory, we think we're going to get back there at some point. Right now, we do have more demand that we can fulfill because of supply chain constraints. But we're looking every single day and every single quarter at the sell- through rates, and then working with our channel partners to get the right product into the right states, because state by state all those needs, and all those requirements are different for the product sets. And it's a lot of work when you get that pent-up demand. And so we expect that to moderate, meaning that backlog will eventually get to nothing in this area. And then we'll be continuing to meet the day requirements of our channel. And, Bob, I don't know if you want to add anything.
Bob Fishman: Other than we look forward to that day because there are inefficiencies. Some of the orders in the backlog were put in July and August. And it creates confusion not only for the distributors and dealers but for ourselves in terms of managing an efficient process. So those days are we're looking forward to as backlog comes down and becomes more current. And we drive the business based on orders and shorter lead times.
John Stauch : And then the other component we look at is actually product value and unit sales. And when you take a look at unit sales over the last two to three years, you see a more normal trend than you do when you reflect on the pricing side and the dollars because we're trying to capture all inflation. So ultimately, I think that we feel like the heater categories we've said often is caught up. And now we have more heaters on the full path. Everything else is generally acting as a more normal sell- through level based upon the pool demand that's out there.
Andy Kaplowitz: Thanks, John. And then maybe you can update us to give some more color on your transformation. I know it’s in the quarter productivity tailwind was a little bit low. Maybe that's just the inefficiencies in the quarter itself. But obviously, you're in the execution phase now in ‘22 on your transformation. So what are you seeing in terms of your ability to improve sort of the major areas you've talked about? We've already talked about pricing a lot, but sourcing, operations, organizational effectiveness, an update on any of this stuff?
John Stauch : Yes, I appreciate the question. I mean, I'm excited by transformation. Obviously, I'm the CEO who's driving the initiative, so you would expect him to be excited. But I think we got two things going on. We got a supply chain, and an ops and sourcing and business unit teams that are working every single day just to meet the current demand. And so everything you're generally seeing in 2022 is just reflective of trying to offset inflation. That's not strategic, right. Ultimately, what we're doing with transformation is saying how to each of our business units become world class in their spaces. What's needed to become world class? And then how do we attack those opportunities. So think of the fact that we source out of China. And that's become very challenging from a landed cost perspective, but also the supply chain issue. Think about where we need to put our distribution centers to meet daily demand. Think about our supply base being a supply base that was probably perfect for 15 years ago, but doesn't reflect what we need today, as far as region by region shipments. So there's a lot of opportunity in supply and price as I mentioned. But also, our geographical complexity has been quite challenged by where we do business and where strategically, we should do business. And then we also have the opportunity to enable all that through what I'd call digital interfaces, as Bob mentioned in his remarks, how do we give more self service to customers? How do we solve consumer needs? How do we make it easier for you to do business with Pentair? So transformation is really about transforming. And as I said, it's a lean based methodology, what is our current state? What's our future state vision? And then how do we build the appropriate transformation plan by business unit, to really be world class in the customers’ eyes, not ours, but the customers’ eyes. And all of that we think add shareholder value, significant shareholder value, which we'll be excited to share with you later this year as it relates to ‘23 and beyond targets.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Bryan Blair of Oppenheimer.
Bryan Blair: Thanks. Good morning, guys. You mentioned your revised sales guide is based on 1Q performance and incremental price. If we think about the 9% to 11% range for the full year is the right way to think about that? Now high single digit, maybe pushing 10% price, modest deal contribution, and flattish volume or is there more nuance to that framework?
Bob Fishman: That is about it, we were seeing the majority of that growth coming from price with a small contribution from volume.
Bryan Blair: Okay, that's fair. And just to confirm is the outlook still for ROS expansion in both segments for the full year? Or is there a little more potential variance in the outlook now?
Bob Fishman: No, it would be margin contribution from both segments, again, think of that as price cost doing better as the year progresses, and then driving through in some of these inefficiencies that are in the supply chain. So both segments will benefit with those actions and improve their margins.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones of Stifel.
Adam Farley: Good morning. This is Adam Farley on for Nathan. I wanted to follow up on the supply chain questions. Could you just give some color on if the supply chain got better, worse or stays about the same through the quarter?
John Stauch : I think you'd have to break into two categories. One is in January and the Omicron out, I would say it got better. I think just like we're increasing our capacity on a linear basis, linearity Q2 versus Q1, Q1 versus Q4. We're seeing our supply chain accelerate there as well. So that's the encouraging part, the discouraging part in Q1 was we got hit by COVID. And I think we're starting off Q2 here with the challenges in China and COVID. And what impact that could have on the port. So every quarter, there's new challenge. But I think if you took those challenges out, it's fair to say that the supply chain is definitely getting better.
Bob Fishman: I’ll just add a little bit of color. We're off to a nice start here in April.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Scott Graham of Loop Capital Markets.
Scott Graham: Yes, hi and good morning. Thanks for taking the question. John, in answering earlier question with things tightening and clouds maybe starting to emerge a little bit on resi some of the indicators are certainly maybe moving the other direction. I'm just wondering if your comment about resi potentially being down in ‘23, if you were just talking about the market or if you were talking about Pentair.
John Stauch : No, I wasn't talking about either, I mean, 2023 is too far to predict. I mean, I think we are very clear in our full year guidance that we gave in February timeframe that we expect a little bit of channel correction in inventory, correction in the channel towards the end of the year as distributors reset their needs when the supply chain catches up. So that's been in our guide, it's still in our guide, and we are expecting that to happen. If you focus just on the sell-through, there's no slowing of the sell-through right now that we see. And I want to be clear, if you go back historically, we're not at high levels of new home builds, there has been capacity constraints even within that space. But higher interest rates are designed to slow down consumer spending, and consumer house purchases, and I think it would be foolish not to expect that we'll see some more flattish or some slight slowdown. That being said, that isn't a very small part of the overall market, which is North American new housing starts, the overall aftermarket demand, which comes globally, across the entire install base continues to be the opportunity for our residential business. And within there, we've got growing enthusiasm for water treatment, which is helping us on the install base itself. And we also have the growing enthusiasm for more automated and connected solutions, which has been constrained because we don't have the availability of the electronics to fulfill that. So I think there's enough growth legs to continue to go. I'm not, I mean, we're going to get through Q2 and the rest of the year, Scott, before we talk about 2023, but I am in no way shape, or form, or signaling anything related to Pentair, or the industry. I'm just saying that I don't think it's going to continue to be mid-20% growth in residential and perpetuity that will settle down.
Scott Graham: Yes, I think we all agree with that. Thank you for that. Let me just ask one other question this was a big year for Pentair automation product launches in Pool. Sounds like that maybe not, the rollout is maybe being slowed by the chain a little bit. I'm just wondering if you could shed some light on what the reception of the products are with distributors out there. Is it really positive? Are you really excited and just disappointed that supply chain is slowing you down? Maybe just give us a little color on that? Thanks.
John Stauch : Yes, I mean, I think first of all in Q2, we got big ones coming in IF3, our new variable speed pump. And we're excited by that because it used more modern technology. And some of that more modern technology is much easier to get than some of the older base technology we had. You're right. I think when your end dealers are busy. They're not always out there trying to sell new technology. And as that starts to become more normal will get people upgrading and selling more of the newer technologies. But right now we're moving to all cloud based solutions. We're moving to better platforms and ease of use for customers. And the only thing that's constraining that longer-term growth is the supply chain, Scott.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JP Morgan.
Steve Tusa: Hi, guys. Good morning. Hey, can you help me with the little bit with the bridge? And just what you do expect on that inflation number for the year? The one that was $89 million this quarter?
Bob Fishman: Yes, Steve, we think that's pretty good proxy for the rest of the quarter. So we don't see inflation really moderating. So you could take that $90 million, multiply it by four, and that's a pretty good indication.
Steve Tusa: Okay, great.
John Stauch : No, that’s not great. That's a wild, Steve, I know you solved your question, but it's just stunning number, okay.
Steve Tusa: Yes, sorry. I was saying great. Thanks for the detail. That's patting you guys on the back. So thanks for the details. Obviously, not great for you guys. But and then when it comes to kind of reconciling pool’s performance being their inventories year-over-year were up like 60%, or something like that. How do I reconcile that with your, I know their sales performance is about in line with yours. But how do I kind of reconcile the inventory move with your sales performance? Is that they -what could be the differences there?
John Stauch : Let me start the first part, there's always a lag, Steve, you know that. I would say build inventory had and we're then fulfilling their sell-through and a lag position and I think that lag is even more exasperated now because as I said earlier, five days lead times have moved into 90 and 120 lead times. So and that's the result of the overall supply chain. So we feel right now on a dollar basis on the sell-through versus where the inventory levels are, we're about back to historical levels. I think that will always vary in a season like Q2 where nobody can be caught without the appropriate demand, or the inventory to meet the demand. And then that'll start to moderate or start to get fixed in Q3 and Q4, Steve.
Steve Tusa: Okay. And then just one more question for you. What is the price you expect in the second half, or just basically tell us what you expect in the second quarter? And then we can obviously back into the second half.
John Stauch : I mean, we think price will be higher in Q2 than Q1, primarily because we're still working through some of the backlog issues in Q1. So that's just on the natural pricing, it'll go higher. And then we've raised prices even higher than we anticipated this year. And so you could expect the price contribution sequentially in Q3 and Q4 to be higher than it will be in Q2.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays.
Matthew Shaffer: Hi, how's it going, guys? This Matthew Shaffer for Julian Mitchell's team on. I am curious, so stocks been under pressure, any reason management is not set up buybacks? Is that just through the deal or will management not buying back for the next two quarters, should prices remain at similar levels?
John Stauch : You should assume we were not allowed to be in the market at all due to the working on the deal and the quiet periods associated with that.
Matthew Shaffer: Okay, great. And then, so the Q2 guide implies that it's over 50% sequential incremental. I'm curious how confident you are in that guide? And how should we think about Q2 guide by division?
Bob Fishman: Q2 is typically our biggest quarter, we're confident in the guide.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer of Melius Research.
Rob Wertheimer: Yes, hi. Thanks for all the answers. John, just to return to a subject you talked about before, obviously, new housing severely under built and maybe not that big within the mix. How do you think about normal volatility as consumer on the repair and replace and upgrade side? There's a lot more options. You mentioned an automation as a lot more attractive offerings. But how do you think about volatility as consumers cycle up and down within that space? And then I'll just ask my second one right now, any indications from your restaurant customers on their propensity to spend, given the same overriding concerns of the consumer? Thank you.
John Stauch : Yes, I mean, I think I believe that the desires of existing homeowners are to improve their overall experiences within their home. And as new and newer opportunities come along to do that they do. The reason the replacement cycle works is once you have a pool, for instance, you want to keep it running, you don't want to turn it into a pond, and you're going to keep the overall non-discretionary maintenance cycle going. I mean, I think your more discretionary purchases, do I need automation? Do I need an automated pool or not. And I think that always varies depending on the abilities of those consumers to spend, or to have discretionary income to spend. One of the things associated with a pool market is it tends to be higher economic, wealth individuals, and they tend to be in communities that neighbor has something and then that becomes the awareness, and then you generally go off and do the same thing. For water treatment, I do think that one cycle is more up and down based upon need, and ability to spend, because that is a more varied economic group purchasing with water treatment. So we tend to see the remodeling, replacement of whole home water treatment turned into be more of a break and fix and/or to get it working good enough for the time being, and then figure it out later. So I think if we're going to see an impact, we'll see it a little bit more on the water treatment side. And so that being said, that's more of a 90% to 95% aftermarket, replacement business today, than it is what we've seen in cool.
Rob Wertheimer: Okay, that’s helpful. And just any thoughts on restaurants spend?
John Stauch : Yes, I mean, I think we continue to see with the traffic and the demand in that space, we continue to see things pick up. I think where I was making my comments earlier, I don't think I could give you a global answer on that at the moment that's been consistent because all three regions have faced COVID at different times. So while we see North America pick up as we have in the US domestically right now, there is a little bit of slowing in Europe and a little bit of slowing in China relative to where they are on their COVID journey. There are no further question at this time, and I would like to turn the call over to John Stauch for closing comments.
John Stauch : Thank you. And thank you for joining us today, we continue to be inspired about how we are in the business helping to solve some of the biggest environmental challenges of today. And we are focused on engaging our employees and stakeholders while we do it. Whether through our sustainable gas solutions and helping to turn waste into value, or working to reduce the consumption of single use plastic bottles, or increasing energy efficiency through the products we offer. Our products and solutions are helping to make the world a better place. Our work on ESG and social responsibility continues to be on the forefront of how we operate and how we work to make the planet better. We are excited to share more about this in our 2021 Corporate Responsibility report, which we plan to issue by the end of the month. I'm extremely proud of what we have accomplished in this past year, which is a testament to the commitment and dedication of our Pentair employees. Contributions for our various stakeholders and guidance from our board of directors. I look forward to continue our great momentum on ESG as we continue through 2022. We were pleased with the first quarter start, and I'm grateful to all of the Pentair employees who helped deliver it. The first quarter gives us confidence in delivering further growth in 2022. We are building momentum in our transformation processes and combined with our intended closing of Manitowoc Ice. This gives us great confidence in our future. Jay, you can conclude the call.
Operator: Thank you. And thank you for joining us today. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-02-01 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Q4 2021 Pentair Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Lucas. Thank you. Please go ahead.
James C. Lucas: Thank you, Stephanie and welcome to Pentair’s fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. We are glad you could join us today. I am Jim Lucas, Senior Vice President, Treasurer, FP&A and Investor Relations. And with me today is John Stauch, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Fishman, our Chief Financial Officer. On today’s call, we will provide details on our fourth quarter and full year performance as outlined in this morning’s press release. Before we begin, let me remind you that during our presentation today, we will make forward-looking statements. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Pentair. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K as well as today’s release. We will also reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the Investor Relations section of Pentair’s website. We will be sure to reserve time for questions-and-answers after our prepared remarks. I would like to request that you please limit your questions to one and a follow-up in order to ensure that everyone has an opportunity to ask their questions. I will now turn the call over to John.
John L. Stauch: Thank you Jim and good morning everyone. Please turn to Slide number 4 titled Executive Summary. We exit 2021 feeling very grateful for the tireless efforts of all of our employees who helped Pentair deliver for our customers and create value for shareholders despite significant inflation and global supply chain challenges. I am humbled and proud of our employees who remained agile and accountable throughout all of 2021. While we faced ongoing supply chain disruptions and inflation that was almost five times higher than during 2020, our 2021 results exceeded our expectations and create momentum heading into 2022. Sales grew over 20% while segment income and adjusted EPS increased over 30% each. Our return on sales expanded 100 basis points for the full year over 18% despite significant inflation pressures.  We had another strong year of free cash flow generating over 550 million which represented over 100% conversion to net income. We returned approximately half of our cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while also funding two strategic acquisitions. We now see dividend increase at the end of last year and the first quarter dividend in 2022 will mark Pentair’s 46th consecutive year of increasing dividends. We are especially proud of this record as we are in a small and distinguished group of companies who can say that. Our balance sheet ended the year in excellent shape and is poised to be deployed to drive additional shareholder value.  We are introducing Q1 and full year 2022 guidance today which Bob will highlight in more detail later in the call. For 2022 we're looking for continued sales, income, and earnings growth as well as further margin expansion. While Q1 faces a tough comparison to last year through the largest price versus cost impact and continued disruptions caused by COVID-19, our full year outlook remains optimistic and we believe our businesses are well positioned to create further value for shareholders. Our residential businesses served mainly the installed base. We estimate Pentair’s overall exposure to new residential construction is roughly 10% of the entire company.  Our pool business benefits from a large installed base, movement to more autonomous and more energy efficient pools, and favorable population migration trends. Our water treatment business has built momentum on the residential side with smarter, connected solutions while our more profitable commercial business has recovered nicely despite restaurant traffic still not back to 2019 levels. Finally, our industrial business has exited 2021 with continued growth in orders and backlog particularly in our food and beverage and sustainable gas businesses. Overall we believe we are well positioned entering the new year although we recognize that disruptions from COVID-19 are impacting the global supply chain as we start 2022.  Please turn to Slide 5 labeled ESG priorities are integrated with business strategy. Since becoming a pure play sustainability focused company about four years ago we have been focused on integrating our ESG priorities with our business strategy. We believe this supports our efforts in cultivating a long-term value proposition for Pentair. It is the right thing to do, it is good business, and this is tied to what our employees, customers, and shareholders value. Sustainability is more than an initiative at Pentair, it is core to how we operate. At Pentair we are united in our belief that our products and actions are making a difference. We are providing clean safe water to millions of people while eliminating plastic bottles that are harming our environment. Our products help people use less chemicals and detergents in their lives through our water treatment solutions. We have many products that help reduce carbon based electricity needs through variable speed pumps and LED lighting, and we're building a growing business for capturing CO2 gas for reuse. We believe our solutions help make the most of life's most essential resources. We're also focused on decreasing our carbon and water footprint with energy efficient processes and bottle free facilities. In 2021 we established four more goals to reduce Pentair’s Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions and water withdrawals.  We're driving inclusive and diverse workforce and leadership team. As a member of the CEO action for diversity inclusion coalition, leading our organization forward on diversity inclusion efforts is a priority and I am proud of the work we are doing in this regard that contributes to us being an employer of choice. We're also working to build a more sustainable supply chain yet continue to make progress while we are navigating global supply chain disruptions. Finally, we believe we've always had strong governance practices and we remain focused on ensuring that these are the best practices. We have strong diversity on our Board of Directors and we also have strong Board oversight at ESG. We recognize that our work will never be done but we believe we are focused on the right priorities and we will continue to engage with our stakeholders on focus areas where we can improve.  Please turn to slide 6 labeled building a track record of consistent growth. As we highlighted during our Investor Day last June we believe we are well on our way to establishing a track record of consistent growth. We believe that we are in the right spaces for the future. Global water awareness is increasing and we serve large and stable end markets. In fact, our two largest businesses, pool and water treatment are serving sectors that when combined are nearly 40 billion sized and are growing faster than GDP. Growing the core is not just about top line improvement but continued income growth and margin expansion. We know we must focus on all elements of growth and we believe we are better aligned on this focus today more than at any time in Pentair’s history.  Over the last few years we've been investing in building our brand, our digital capabilities, and our innovation in our smart and sustainable solutions. We have successfully rebranded Pelican acquired in 2019 to Pentair Water Solutions, the water treatment space and we believe we are delivering compelling and consistent messaging across all consumer touch points to generate awareness and provide consumer confidence in our solutions and expertise. We recently launched a new home water platform on Pentair.com to empower consumers to learn, shop, purchase, and gain service and support on our website. We improved consumer engagement with multiple digital properties which is web, app, social, and digital ads to optimize customer journeys and deliver consistent, differentiated brand messaging across all platforms. We saw double-digit increases last year to new visitors to pentair.com, in fact this increased engagement has led to a substantial number of leads in our pool business.  While we're a leader in pool equipment today we must continue to invest to maintain and improve our position with customers and consumers. Major part of our effort is around building an effortless pool ecosystem. We not only strive to have the most reliable products in the pool industry, but we are also focused on providing the best information about pool ownership and we believe we offered the highest level of training and education of anyone through the professional channel.  We're also increasing our services offerings in many of our businesses. The acquisition of KBI last year brought service capabilities to our commercial water treatment business and helps us create end-to-end solutions for our customers. We are also focused on expanding services within pool and are developing network to easily connect homes to the appropriate partnered service provider to take care of their needs in a proactive improvement situation. We're also developing more connected products that provide information about the performance of the equipment that will enable our channel partners to quickly react to the needs of the consumer.  When we talk about strategic growth initiatives to accelerate the top line, just about prioritizing, sequencing, and resourcing the critical few ideas that we can deliver to our customers while also driving shareholder value. This is primarily around investments at our leading pool and water treatment businesses, there are other opportunities such as our sustainable gas business in industrial and flow technologies. We're focused in two areas today biogas and carbon capture. Our technology helps capture and purify both CO2 and biomethane in addition to capturing excess CO2 created at the manufacturing processes that can be purified and reused.  We're also driving transformation to both unlock value and to fund growth. In 2021 we launched and committed resources to drive transformation across Pentair. This is a multi-year initiative to transform how we do business and how we serve our customers. We're focused on four transformational areas; pricing, sourcing, operations, and organizational effectiveness. Last year was all about completing our planning and assessment phase and we're moving to the implementation phase in 2022. Pricing, sourcing, and operations are big opportunities to drive our gross margin improvement while we expect organizational effectiveness should help drive efficiencies across Pentair. We believe that transformation will be an important contributor to our goal of greater than 300 basis points of margin improvement by 2025 in addition to helping fund our strategic growth initiatives.  Finally, we believe our balance sheet provides flexibility to our long-term value opportunity. Pentair has been a consistent cash flow generator and we've built a successful track record of disciplined capital deployment. We ended 2021 with our balance sheet levered at only one times which is below our targeted leverage. This balance sheet flexibility allows us to fund acquisitions in our key growth areas which is KBI in water treatment and [indiscernible] pool which we completed during 2021. We believe that we are well positioned to continue delivering consistent growth and we look forward to updating you on our journey. I would now like to turn the call over to Bob to discuss our performance and our financial results in more detail after which I'll provide an update on our overall strategic position. Bob? 
Bob P. Fishman: Thank you John. Please turn to Slide 7 labeled Pentair’s sales performance. I will also be discussing Slide 8 to help frame how we exited the year in context to our full year performance. Fourth quarter sales grew 24% with core sales increasing 19%. Consumer solutions core sales growth was 23% and industrial and flow technologies delivered core sales growth of 13%. For the full year, sales grew 25% with core sales growing 21%. Consumer solutions delivered 30% core sales growth and industrial and flow technologies saw core sales growth of 9%.  We were encouraged to see price read out the strongest of the year in the fourth quarter. Nearly half of the price for the year came through in the fourth quarter. We have discussed all year the multiple price increases we implemented across all of our businesses and the fact that there has been a delay in some of the price reading out given the strong backlogs we have carried throughout the year. We believe that fourth quarter demonstrates our ability to have priced readout and we expect that momentum carried over into the new year. For the fourth quarter segment income grew 18% while return on sales declined 80 basis points. The margin degradation reflects further acceleration in inflation in addition to the lower margin contribution of last year's acquisitions. We would note that we experienced inflation in the fourth quarter that was double what occurred for all of 2020. Adjusted EPS grew 24% in the quarter. For the full year segment income grew 33% and return on sales expanded 100 basis points to 18.2%. Adjusted EPS increased 36% for the year to $3.40. Our tax rate ended the year at 15% and our share count was 167.5 million.  Please turn to Slide 9 labeled Q4 2021 consumer solutions performance. In addition to the fourth quarter performance for consumer solutions I will also be referencing the full year performance on Slide 10. Consumer solutions grew sales 31% in the fourth quarter with pool sales increasing 35% and water treatment up 23%. For the full year consumer solutions grew 34% with pool up 40% for the year and water treatment increasing 24%. Growth was fairly consistent throughout the year and this has been due to the hard work of the teams to meet record demand while facing significant supply chain disruptions throughout the year.  The pool industry has received a great amount of attention the past couple of years with the acceleration of demand where already positive industry dynamics have grown stronger. Pools have become enhancements to residential properties and are desirable features that new home buyers are searching for in their future homes. The population migration to warmer climates is another positive trend for the industry as homeowners are looking to add pools to existing homes or purchase new homes with pools in warm weather states. We believe that signs continue to be strong for pool growth to continue not only in 2022 but well into the future.  Channel inventories ended the year approaching levels more in line with historical levels. There are still some product lines and geographies however where title [ph] inventory levels are not back to normalized levels. Our pool team did a great job beating robust demand while managing supply chain disruptions and expanding capacity at the same time. We have also developed capabilities to enhance our ability to better procure products and improve a smoother delivery for our customers. We completed the Pleatco acquisition during the quarter and this adds to pools aftermarket capability. Pool made great progress in improving its customer service capabilities and we believe that continues to be a differentiator for our leading pool business not only with industry dealers but increasingly with consumers. We saw strong growth across all product categories and we believe that pool exited the year better positioned to save the ongoing supply challenges in order to continue meeting strong industry demand.  Water treatment saw continued growth in residential and further improvement in commercial. Within residential we saw growth across all channels and within our legacy tanks and valves businesses. While the teams were battling inflation and supply chain challenges throughout the year, we continued to invest in the future. With Rocean being integrated into Pentair at the beginning of 2021, we made great progress in commercializing the first product that is expected to be launched this year. We are excited about the innovation that Rocean brings to consumers around point-of-use countertop technology and we look forward to updating you on the progress of the launch as the year progresses. The recovery in our commercial business continued but industry traffic is still not back to 2019 levels. We continued to focus on the integration of KBI and the creation of an end-to-end solution for our customers that has generated an increasing amount of interest. By offering both products and services, we believe our commercial business is better positioned to benefit from continued recovery in the industry in addition to benefiting from new customers that are showing interest in our solutions. For the fourth quarter, consumer solutions grew income 10%, while ROS declined 410 basis points. The margin decline is due to three areas: first, both KBI and Pleatco joined Pentair with lower margins than our segment average. KBI, in particular, is a services business with lower ROS, with strong recurring revenue and cash flow. Second, the margin pressure is in the form of higher inflation, which did not come as a surprise. In fact, consumer solutions experienced nearly half of its full year inflation in the fourth quarter alone. Finally, margins were under pressure due to ongoing supply chain disruptions that have continued to be a challenge. For 2021, consumer solutions grew segment income 32%, while margins were down slightly for the year due to the fourth quarter inflationary pressures that we experienced. We believe that this will begin to move back in the right direction starting in the second quarter, as price catches up with inflation and we begin to see some pressure taken off of many areas of our supply chain. Please turn to Slide 11 labeled Q4 2021 Industrial & Flow Technologies performance. In addition to the fourth quarter performance for Industrial & Flow Technologies, I will also be referencing the full year performance on Slide 12. IFT grew sales 14% in the fourth quarter, with residential flow up 14%, commercial flow increasing 4%, and industrial filtration growing 24%. For the full year, IFT grew sales 12% with residential flow up 15%, commercial flow increasing 6%, and industrial filtration up 12%. Residential flow delivered double-digit sales growth all four quarters of 2021. We believe many of the population trends that have been driving demand for pool are also benefiting residential flow. Our broad portfolio of products are found in more rural and suburban areas. We exited the year with strong tailwinds as many of our dealers are still facing low inventory levels.  The growth in residential flow is all the more impressive given the strong focus on complexity reduction that saw the business exit many older or less profitable product lines. Commercial flow has been focused on complexity reduction and improving margins with good progress made throughout 2021. We have seen improvement in our water supply and disposal businesses, while infrastructure has slowed due in large part to us being more disciplined on bids. Industrial filtration has benefited from stabilization at some of the smaller product lines, while both food and beverage and sustainable gas continued to build backlogs and see their businesses rebound. We have seen accelerating interest in our brew assist IoT-enabled service for brewing, and we now have over 20 connected systems. Sustainable gas experienced strong double-digit growth in 2021 and exited the year with further increases in backlog. We have had good success in our biogas offerings with a number of wins during the year and the funnel remains strong. We're also seeing more and more interest in our carbon capture technology.  For the fourth quarter, IFT grew segment income 63%, while ROS expanded 440 basis points. For the full year, IFT grew segment income 30% and ROS expanded 210 basis points to 15%. IFT was hit especially hard on the demand side when the onset of COVID-19 brought demand to a halt. The business is focused on the elements within its control and the combination of growth in higher-margin businesses, further complexity reduction, and overall productivity. These are all big contributors to the rebound in margins throughout 2021. IFT saw all three of its businesses exiting the year with strong backlog and we would expect another year of growth and margin expansion for IFT. Please turn to Slide 13, labeled balance sheet and cash flow. This slide is one we have been proud of all year, and it improved as we ended the year. For 2021 we generated $557 million of free cash flow. We ended the year with our balance sheet levered at only one times and our return on invested capital exceeded 19%. We returned roughly half of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We also funded two strategic acquisitions, KBI and Pleatco, to further the strategies of water treatment and pool. It is worth noting that Pleatco also contributed a little to IFT as it brought some clean air filtration technologies that fit nicely with one of our existing product lines in Industrial Filtration. We plan to remain disciplined with our capital and we believe that we have more than enough flexibility to return capital to shareholders and fund growth, both organically and through acquisitions. Please turn to Slide 14, labeled Q1 and full year 2022 and their outlook. Today, we are introducing Q1 and full year 2022 guidance. For the full year, we expect sales to grow 6% to 9%, segment income to grow 10% to 13%, and adjusted EPS of $3.70 to $3.80 or up 9% to 12%. Embedded in our guidance is a continued expectation for growth in all three of our verticals. Residential is roughly 60% of our sales with 80% of that serving replacement and only 20% exposed to new construction. While we would expect new construction overall to moderate following two stellar years of growth, we believe this will free up labor to serve strong demand in the replacement market that has been underserved due to the growth in new construction. Commercial represents roughly 20% of sales, primarily in our water treatment business. We are encouraged with the growth that commercial experienced in 2021 given that industry volumes are still not back to 2019 levels. Industrial is the remaining 20% of sales and the strong exit to 2021 across IFT informs our expectations that industrial growth should continue in 2022. Within our full year sales guidance, we expect Consumer Solutions to grow mid- to high single digits and IFT to grow approximately mid-single digits for the year. On the income side for the full year, we do expect price to offset inflation given that the many pricing efforts we undertook in 2021 are reading out, and we expect inflation headwinds to lessen in the back half of the year. We also expect that our transformation activities will move to the execution phase and benefit us in 2022 and beyond. As a result, we expect further ROS expansion in 2022 to approximately 19%. While we expect to see continued top line growth in Q1 due to the strong demand in many of our businesses, we expect to continue to be challenged with higher inflation and supply chain challenges. While we anticipate price reading out higher in the first quarter, we do not expect it to fully offset inflation until the second quarter which is putting pressure on our Q1 profitability. We do expect roughly 50% of EPS for the year to be in the first half, in line with historical norms.  Below the operating line we expect corporate expense to be approximately $20 million in Q1 and roughly $80 million for the full year. We are forecasting net interest to be approximately $5 million in Q1 and between $16 million to $18 million for the full year. We expect the tax rate to be roughly 16% and the share count to be 167 million to 168 million for both Q1 and the full year. Finally, we expect free cash flow to approximate net income. I would now like to turn the call over to Stephanie for Q&A after which John will have a few closing remarks. Stephanie please open the line for questions. Thank you. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup. 
Andrew Kaplowitz: Good morning guys. John you talked in the past about construction moderating replacement and accelerating, you have talked about dealers having back up in the second half of the year in pool so you basically have visibility into the end of the year at this point in pool and I think you mentioned channel inventories are more normalized but not completely normal. So can you give us more color there and then why wouldn’t price be a big number for pool in 2022 so pool revenue can be at or higher than that in Consumer Solution guidance of mid to high single digits? 
John L. Stauch: Yeah, I will take the first part and I will let Bob chip in here. Yeah, I mean we're exiting the year with a pretty lofty backlog and while inventory in the channel have moderated to more normal levels, we're still seeing strong sell-through, and we're still chasing our backlog and trying to work it down. So you see that impact in Q1 and Q2. As we think about the year, the way the full year will play out, most of the dealers will take stock of where they are sometime around the Q3 quarter and then assess what the 2023 outlook looks like and then adjust either inventory or their purchasing desires as they head into the 2023 full year. So we have visibility that we feel like there's pent-up demand, but we won't know exactly how that's going to play out in Q3, Q4 next year until we get through Q2. Bob, do you want to add the pricing comment?
Bob P. Fishman: Yeah, we expect pool will have another strong year after growing 17% two years ago and 14% [ph] last year. We expect significant growth again from pool. We want to be realistic in our guidance and not get ahead of ourselves. COVID continues to be a challenge, but we do expect a strong full year led by price.
Andrew Kaplowitz: Got it, guys that's helpful. And then can you give us a little more color into the implied margin that you're assuming for 2022 for both of your segments, I know you mentioned the acquisitions diluting some solutions inflation pressure, but are you assuming flat to down margin in consumer, then can you sustain the strong incremental margins you achieved in the second half of the year in IF&T?
John L. Stauch: So to answer the question, overall for Pentair, the guidance that we've given has the ROS expanding to 19% from the 18.2% that we finished 2021 with. So up 80 basis points after being up 100 basis points and very much in line with what we discussed at our Analyst Day earlier in 2021. We would be disappointed if Consumer Solutions did not expand its ROS for 2022 and certainly we see continued momentum with -- from IFT. So again, helped by price/cost favorability for the year and the transformation activities, but both of the segments will expand margins.
Andrew Kaplowitz: Helpful Bob, thanks. 
Bob P. Fishman: Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question is from Joe Giordano with Cowen.
Robert Jamieson: Hey, good morning. This is Rob Jamieson on for Joe. I just want to quickly touch on like inventories. So it looks like there's a little bit of build in the quarter here. Is that just trying to get yourself set up where you can help meet demand for 2022, just wondering if you could provide some color there?
John L. Stauch: A little bit of the build is acquisition related around Pleatco and KBI. The rest is us setting ourselves up for the higher demand in 2022. Overall, days on hand very much in line with what we've seen historically.
Robert Jamieson: Okay. And then sorry if I missed this, but what's the pool growth embedded in your guidance for the full year, do you have any breakdown between new versus replacement?
John L. Stauch: We've given guidance for Consumer Solutions of mid-to-high single-digits. So you can extrapolate from that what you're saying full might be. And I would say that water treatment will continue to have another good year, but we've given guidance at the Consumer Solutions level.
Robert Jamieson: Okay, that's great. And then if I can just sneak one more in. I appreciate the sustainable gas update that you provided. It sounds like that business is performing well. I just wondered if you could kind of talk about the growth opportunity there. We've seen a lot of corporations come out with like carbon reduction, carbon neutral initiatives for 2020, 2030, 2050. I'm not looking for guidance, but just how should we think about that growth opportunity for you going forward like in the medium term, do you think that should help you accelerate it, what are your thoughts there?
John L. Stauch: Yes. I mean, we grew that business roughly 20% last year, and we would think that we can continue to grow spend as we look into 2022 and beyond. Clearly, all of those initiatives are creating an opportunity for us to participate in quotes and activity. And we're really encouraged about what the potential front log and backlog could look like in this business.
Robert Jamieson: That’s great. Thanks so much.
John L. Stauch: Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question is from Mike Halloran with Baird.
Michael Halloran: Hi, good morning gentlemen. 
John L. Stauch: Hey, good morning. 
Michael Halloran: Thanks. So could you just talk through some of the competitive dynamics in the pool space right now, I think different players are deciding to go with price increases at different times, handling backlog change it differently and capacity onboarding differently. So maybe just kind of sink all those things together, talk about how Pentair is doing in the marketplace, and also layer in some capacity commentary in there, if you don't mind?
Bob P. Fishman: Yes, maybe I'll start with that one, then let John add to it. Obviously, the demand has been strong within the pool business. Backlogs were up significantly in most of last year and coming into this year. We -- as we looked at the backlog last year, wanted to honor the commitments that we made to our customers. That loyalty was important and will serve us very well in the future. When we look at the backlog entering the year, that backlog has been repriced and will read out fully in the second quarter. So we think we struck the right balance around dealing with the higher orders and the backlog. That repricing of the backlog will help us with a strong second quarter and it's not lost on us that our Q1 started below the guidance, the consensus that was out there, and that's because price does not fully read out in the first quarter and inflation remains high. The good news from our perspective is that Q2 will rebound quickly, and so we're not asking for investors to wait for the back half of the year. You'll see a strong first half from Pentair as that backlog reprices in the second quarter. That would be my response to your question. John, is there anything that you'd want to add?
John L. Stauch: No, Mike, I think Bob answered that.
Michael Halloran: Great. And then second question, just on the complexity reduction initiatives in IFT, where do we stand and as far as that journey goes and what are the next steps as you look forward from here?
John L. Stauch: Yes. I think we've made tremendous progress, and I want to compliment the team. I mean you know this business well, Mike. I mean these are 100-year-old brands or 100-year plus brands, right? So there's a lot of SKUs and a lot of part numbers, and they've been doing a really good job of reducing and trying to aggregate into more common buys and more common part numbers and products. So I'm excited about where we have progressed from to. But that being said, there's still so much substantial opportunity in front of us, just the way that we think about our global supply chains, think about the way that we bring a product through distribution. And I'm really excited about the momentum, but I'm more excited about the opportunity.
Michael Halloran: Appreciate it, thank you. 
John L. Stauch: Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question is from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jeffrey Hammond: Hey, good morning guys. So just back on price, how should we think about price in the guide, I mean, I think you got five points in 2021 and maybe it looks like a mirror image in 2022, but just how much price is kind of built in?
Bob P. Fishman: The best way to think about it is the growth guidance that we gave is primarily price. So price is a significant impact to our overall revenue growth. A little bit of acquisitions, but primarily price.
Jeffrey Hammond: Okay. And then just on supply chain, can you maybe just speak versus third quarter, what you see is starting to get better or stabilizing and what's still may be most challenging?
John L. Stauch: I'll start and I'll have Bob chip in. I mean, I'm actually proud of the fact that we made sequential progress every year or every quarter within 2021, which means we expanded our capability and processes. So we still got the same global supply shortages that everybody else is dealing with. And we're still balancing around the freight disruptions and needs about getting the product to the right locations at the right time. And I think the team has done a great job of moving through all that. As we started 2022, COVID reared its ugly head again in the form of Omicron, and we saw some fee and rates increase in our factories for the first time in a very long time, but we also saw those same increases across the entire global supply chain. And so I think as we think about it getting better, which it is better now, we still have to think that we're not through this, and we need to be cautious and realistic about what Q1 could look like.
Jeffrey Hammond: Okay, thanks guys. 
John L. Stauch: Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question is from Nathan Jones with Stifel.
Nathan Jones: Good morning everyone. 
John L. Stauch: Good morning. 
Nathan Jones: Just a question on some of the volume. It sounds like volume is roughly flat in the guidance with Bob your commentary there that it's primarily priced a little bit of acquisitions. I know you talked about expecting new construction to moderate a little bit. Can you talk about which pieces of the business that you're thinking are going to see volume growth and which pieces are likely to see some modest volume declines?
Bob P. Fishman: Yes. I mean, I think it's prudent to enter 2022, still optimistic and excited about the contributions that we're making, especially in water treatment, residential integration flow, and pool across the residential channel. And I think if we were thinking about the first half versus second half, we think we had volume price and acquisition contribution in the first half. And I think we have a little bit of volume moderating as far as the thoughts around the new housing builds and/or the way the channel reacts to those expectations for 2023. So while we still feel really good about where these markets are going, I think it's prelim at this stage to assume that we'll see a little bit of moderating in the back half of the year as it relates to people taking stock on the 2023 build season.
Nathan Jones: I guess that's reasonable. So a little bit of just caution on the back half given some uncertainty there at the moment. Second question I wanted to ask was one of your prepared comments, John, you said you were looking to build a more sustainable supply chain. Can you talk about what that means to Pentair and how you measure those things to try and ensure a more sustainable supply chain?
John L. Stauch: Yes. So, we are spending one of our top transformation initiatives is sourcing. And like many other companies, our global sourcing, just the whole entire supply chain is from 10 to 15 years ago. And you can see that there's been more of a demand in the United States with more onshoring. And we've got to make sure that our supply chain is related to the lead times that we need for our customers and is optimized, which is not just a cost issue, but it's a total landed and total end-to-end cost as well as making sure it has the right availability. So you can measure through our less expansion, and you can assume that as far as our transformation initiatives over the next several years, we believe sourcing is a significant contributor to that expansion.
Nathan Jones: Okay, thanks for taking my questions. 
John L. Stauch: Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question is from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Lee: Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Kudos on the strong quarter. I guess a couple of questions just again around the guidance. Q1 revenue guidance, it's only a bit ahead of revenue growth outlook for the full year. Comps obviously are going to be much tougher for you in the second half, but are you expecting to kind of maintain positive growth year-on-year through 2022, is Q1 kind of in the high water mark here, just how should we be thinking about seasonality in 2022?
Bob P. Fishman: That's -- that part is what's encouraging about our guidance as we see growth throughout the year, even as we bump up against those tougher comparisons in Q3 and Q4. Obviously, it helps having the stronger price that's built in and the price reading out fully in the second quarter. But overall, pretty good balance. We mentioned that there'd be 50% of our EPS in the first half of the year and the remaining 50% in the back half. That's more in line with historical norms. John touched on the fact that we've given realistic guidance, that we've not gotten ahead of ourselves on volume for the back half. But hopefully, we'll be pleasantly surprised there with the positive trends that we talked about in our prepared remarks. So our view is that we'll have a very strong and balanced 2022, then we will enter 2023 with lots of momentum around demand and also the transformation.
John L. Stauch: And the only thing I'll add to Bob's comments because I think he answered that very well is Q2 is historically our strongest quarter. And we think 2022, that is how it will play out again.
Brian Lee: Alright, that's super helpful. And then I guess, just shifting to the profitability. I know you alluded to this a few times throughout the call, but segment income is flat in Q1, you are expecting EPS and income growth to be ahead of revenue for the year off of 19%. And I think you've quantified kind of the price, but there's a few other moving parts that gets you kind of that leverage as you move through the year. Can you give us a little bit more quantification outside of price as to what some of the big levers are to get earnings and income growth above revenue for the year and for that ROS to get to that 19% expansion level? Thanks guys. 
John L. Stauch: The expansion in margin from the 18.2 [ph] that we did in 2021 to 19 will be primarily us being ahead from a price cost perspective. So overall, we feel very confident that price will exceed inflation for the year, that will help expand margins. And then the transformation, we talked about pricing opportunities, sourcing, operations, and then organizational efficiencies that we would drive. 2021 was very much a planning year for transformation, we're moving into the execution phase in 2022, and that's going to significantly help our ROS expansion as well.
Brian Lee: Alright, thanks a lot guys. 
John L. Stauch: Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question is from Bryan Blair with Oppenheimer.
Bryan Blair: Thanks, good morning guys. Certainly you can offer a little more color on Pleatco integration and how Pleatco is performing relative to your deal model in the early stages, I think you had framed something in the range of $100 million of revenue and ROS approaching 20%, is that still the outlook?
John L. Stauch: Pleatco is performing very well. It was included in our -- for a couple of months in our Q4 results. Very strong aftermarket business, great cultural fit with our full business, and very much in line with the numbers that you talked about. So for us, just a great strategic acquisition and performing very well.
Bryan Blair: I appreciate the detail. As a follow-up, is there any nuance or anything unusual in how the asset is being managed? I believe it's about two thirds pool, some more B2C alignments and one third industrial filtration, more B2B type exposure, just curious how you are managing that now being in the consolidated portfolio?
John L. Stauch: Really, we talked about -- you are right in terms of the two third, one third split, and we talked about the filtration business fitting nicely with our IFT portfolio in terms of that one third. So really, not operating it much differently than how Pleatco ran it. They have a separate manufacturing facility in Louisville, both factories are running well. And again, they benefit from having -- being part of our consumer solutions portfolio and also our IFT. So really no significant difference from how that business was run in the past.
Bob P. Fishman: Yes. It's being run as -- the unit itself has been run the same way in the past, and then we're score keeping the IFT related revenue in IFT and the pool related revenue in Consumer Solutions.
Bryan Blair: Understood, makes sense. Thanks again. 
John L. Stauch: Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning everyone. Impressive growth in pool for 2021 and also your -- the implied guidance there. So like seeing that. Just a couple of cleanup questions on pool, just -- this got discussed last quarter, but just to verify, there was no early buy this quarter, it was not needed, and just what's your perspective on that?
John L. Stauch: Yes. I mean, there was a modest early buy to what we'd call the non-warm weather states Deane, but it was managed very, very modestly in the extent that we're just positioning them to have the inventory they need for their particular business when it ramps up in Q2. And obviously, not running the program was really more about that we're still in catch-up mode from backlog, and it made little sense to put more backlog on top of existing backlog. So I think as we head into next year, we're planning that we'll have some level of that as we take stock at the way the channel may or may not need to position itself for 2023.
Deane Dray: Good. And as a resident of one of those non-warm weather states, I appreciate your comments about the migration trend that's happening into warmer states. So that would suggest the demand will be there, but how about the capacity either dealer pool build capacity, do you think that will take time, is that increasing in proportion, or will that take some time to read out?
John L. Stauch: Yes. As Bob was saying, I mean, the channel has historically and we think it played out exactly this way in 2021 as well, puts their energy towards the new pools and then begins when that starts to moderate moves to the remodel pools and then get serious about the aftermarket upgrade opportunity. So it's generally worked in those three tiers. That's why we're excited that as it moderates the new pool builds, we get that focus again on getting those variable speed pumps, the LED, the more autonomous pools back into either the remodeled pool or the aftermarket upgrade side to the service channel. So this is a great industry. It's a great set of products and we want to come back to what I'd call a more normalized pattern, which gives us that better predictability to manage our supply chain more efficiently.
Deane Dray: Got it. And then just last one for me is we have seen -- already seen this earnings season of companies giving what constitutes lower first quarter guidance and certainly effects of price costs is and inflation, Omicron, et cetera, it's sector-wide. So we're really not surprised to see that. But I did like seeing a point estimate in your guidance, which suggest there's pretty good visibility for you to give that -- to be that specific. So just maybe talk about the visibility for the first quarter, where -- how is January, how did that readout, and that would all be helpful.
Bob P. Fishman: Let me take that one. It was important for us to indicate that 50% of our EPS would come in the first half in line with historical norms. We have strong headlights into the second quarter, primarily because of the repricing of the backlog. We will have that benefit in the second quarter more fully. So the improvement in the second quarter is driven by price. Our view is that inflation will continue to be high, but we'll get better in the second half of the year. So we've not gotten ahead of ourselves with regards to inflation. So good headlights into our Q1 and Q2. January, for us, was to be honest, a little bit slower because of the COVID-19 impact on our suppliers and on our own production facilities. So good news is we've seen improvements in the last week or so, and we're wrapping up to achieve our commitment. But we did see a slower start in January, and that's one of the reasons why we've been able to then have better headlights into the second quarter.
Deane Dray: That’s completely understandable. Thank you. 
John L. Stauch: Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question is from Scott Graham with Loop Capital Markets. Mr. Graham, go ahead. Your next question comes from Steve Tusa with J.P. Morgan.
Steve Tusa: Hey guys, good morning. Just on that 80% of the pool business, that's -- you identified as being remodel, what did that grow in 2021 in total?
John L. Stauch: North of double digits.
Steve Tusa: Yes, I think that's pretty clear. I guess a little more specifically, did it grow above the aquatics average?
John L. Stauch: No, it didn't. I mean it was a significant contributor to the 40-ish percent growth that pool had but we saw the new pool increase if you think of that 20% and you think about what size that was up, it would probably be like half and half contribution from each of those two quadrants. But Steve, I was also saying, though, there's an aftermarket and there's the remodel, right. So the remodel piece is the best opportunity to talk to the homeowner around the upgrades because you're replastering the pool or you're doing some other types of things that allow you to add more penetration. And then the third element is really more of the service and/or the break and fix piece. And we think there's an opportunity to upgrade the channel in the break and fix that was kind of not focused on in 2021. And that's where we think the upside is on the aftermarket side.
Steve Tusa: And so just to be clear, you guys are guiding like the pool business volume to be like down low singles for the year 2021? Just trying to kind of…
John L. Stauch: We're not down, Steve. I mean, because we see a pretty strong Q1, Q2, and then we feel like we've got the price in the back half of the year. And right now, we're being cautious about where the dealers and distributors, but we repositioning their inventory levels as they look into 2023. And I think what's captured in this particular guide is the most realistic case of assuming that there will be some type of pause as they reset and look forward to what they're going to do in 2023. And I think it is very important that we don't get ahead of ourselves and anticipate that growth continues, and then we're here talking at the end of the year about adjustments in the channel in Q3 and Q4.
Steve Tusa: Yes, that's totally fair. You've been -- you talked a lot about your opportunity. I mean, are you saying that you think that the -- let's call it the non-new construction, everything not new pool construction, the consumer spending on like everything but new construction in pools will be kind of your addressable market, I would call it that, that will be kind of flattish and that you'll outperform because you'll be able to kind of execute on these opportunities we're talking about, is that the way to think about it?
John L. Stauch: Yes. I don't think that's a bad way to think about it. I think we believe, we see the thrusts to the new pools being finished, right. And there's still going to be -- we think new pool demand continues to increase. As we head into 2023 we think the market will continue to reposition the labor to serve the remodel side and then we'll move into the aftermarket side of the equation. And then Steve, not to really confuse you, but I think we see product lines like heaters moderate, which has been a huge product line growth play for us, right. As people moved into those stage and extended their season there was a big heater penetration. And then we think things more on the autonomous -- the automation, chlorinators, those types of things start to see more penetration and accelerating and those two things start to offset each other.
Steve Tusa: Okay, awesome. Great color, appreciate it. Thank you. 
John L. Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Brett Linzey with Mizuho.
Brett Linzey: Thank you. Good morning all. Wanted to come back to the price and repricing, obviously, outsize versus history, given the operating backdrop get that. Are those actions -- or are you seeing some surgical surcharges around logistics, I'm just thinking, if we do see a pullback here in commodities or other inflationary pressures, do you see some of that price recede or what's been the historical precedent there?
John L. Stauch: We are focused on list. So what Bob is sharing with you is list price increases. And ultimately, we care most about realized prices, right. So we don't want to just raise list pricing and then negotiate it away. So we believe that we're in -- what we're sharing with you today is our realistic view of what we're going to realize in 2022.
Brett Linzey: Okay, got it. And then consumer, very strong pricing in Q4 10 points. Is that actual like-for-like price or is part of that mix up on the higher ASP, given the industry shift from single speed to variable speed or is that just simply all pure price?
John L. Stauch: That is price.
Brett Linzey: So there's no mix. Okay. Great. And then just last one, if I could sneak one in here. Just in regards to the DOE efficiency change over last year, a fairly significant step-up in the cost of the replacement pump as we enter the selling season. Do you guys see or expect any negative demand response there to those higher prices or do you actually think the ASP starts to gradually come down as that becomes the base offering, any thoughts there?
John L. Stauch: No, I think we think that, that continues to be the heartbeat of the pool pad. It is where people are -- you need that product to run your pool and there's been a significant interest level as upgrading. And even in within 2022, we're launching a new version of that, which is even smarter than the current version, and we think we'll continue to see the interest level there from the trade channel and the consumers. 
Brett Linzey: Okay, great. Thanks a lot. 
John L. Stauch: It lasts longer, it's better. And it's ultimately chosen because of its variable speed and the energy efficiency, but it's just a better overall product.
Brett Linzey: Makes sense. Okay, thanks a lot. Appreciate the color.
John L. Stauch: Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.
Joshua Pokrzywinski: Hey, good morning guys. John, I want to follow up on Steve's question regarding kind of the remodel versus replacement dynamic. So everything outside the new in the pool space, what's kind of the typical level of visibility that you would have I would guess in remodel because break and fix sort of implies that you don't see it coming. What do you normally have at this time of the year, like maybe some context on what you have this year because it just doesn't seem very consumer-like to plan the stuff out too, too far in advance, but I get that maybe there's some deferrals or lack of availability from last year, so like how does that look and how would you kind of numerically score it?
John L. Stauch: Yes. I mean the pool season plays out through Q3. So it starts in Q4 and it goes up to Q3 of 2022 as an example. And we feel like we've got really good visibility and we partnered really well on that particular part. There's the dynamics of how they do against the volume discounts and rebates that go into that Q3 buy. And then we start all over again in Q4 of 2023. And we're not signaling anything other than we have great visibility this year, and we're pausing as we think about working with the channel to see what they see for 2023. What gets confusing is, it's the same dealers who do the news, it's the same dealers that do the remodel, and most of those same dealers also do service. So it's where they spend and focus their time that we're always working with them. So we see their visibility thereby, but we want to be a little bit more surgical on where they're spending the time and then give them the tools and capability to begin to work with consumers on getting those upgrades on the aftermarket pads.
Joshua Pokrzywinski: Got it. That's helpful. And then dealers are obviously very integral to the business kind of across the various product lines. Any place where you're watching for bottlenecks on kind of the installer side, so not a Pentair employee per se, but you're kind of further down the chain where the industry just can't grow faster because there's not enough warm bodies turning wrenches?
John L. Stauch: Well, we've seen it this year. I mean it's not just the labor, it's also the supply ability of all the products that go into the pool around the pool, right. And it's getting better. I think the supply chain is better, so it's probably taking a little less time to build those pools. But that's delayed the remodel efforts, which has then delayed some of the aftermarket efforts. So I think this is going to be a great pool season and I think we're going to continue to see the sustained demand into 2023. I just think right now, we're making sure that we call 2022 pool season accurately. And then we'll deal with 2023 when we're done with 2022.
Joshua Pokrzywinski: Alright, appreciate it. Thanks a lot. 
John L. Stauch: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. We have reached the allotted time for questions. I would like to turn it back over to John Stauch for closing.
John L. Stauch: Thanks, Stephanie and thank you for joining us today. We have delivered on commitments in 2021 whether measured by sales, income, EPS, cash flow, or ROIC. The good news is we believe there's still significantly more value to deliver at Pentair. It is becoming a pure-play sustainability-focused company in 2018. We have been building a track record of consistent growth, while also driving our commitment to creating long-term shareholder value. We are proud of our pool business, but Pentair is more than just a pool equipment provider. Our water treatment, Flow and Industrial Solutions offerings are all proving to be sustained value contributors within our portfolio. When we combine our growth momentum with our transformation efforts and our balance sheet, I'm excited about the future value creation opportunities for our shareholders. Stephanie, you can conclude the call.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Speakers, please hold the line.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-10-26 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Q3 2021 Pentair Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Lucas. Thank you. Please go ahead.
Jim Lucas: Thank you, Stephanie, and welcome to Pentair’s third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. We are glad you could join us. I am Jim Lucas, Senior Vice President, Treasurer, FP&A and Investor Relations. And with me today is John Stauch, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Fishman, our Chief Financial Officer. On today’s call, we will provide details on our third quarter performance as outlined in this morning’s press release. Before we begin, let me remind you that during our presentation today, we will make forward-looking statements. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Pentair. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K and today’s release. We will also reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the Investor Relations section of Pentair’s website. We will be sure to reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. I would like to request that you limit questions to one and a follow-up in order to ensure everyone has an opportunity to ask their questions. I will now turn the call over to John.
John Stauch: Thank you, Jim. And good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 4, titled executive summary. I’d like to thank – start by thanking our Pentair teams for delivering outstanding third quarter in the face of unprecedented material shortages and inflation. We were pleased to once again, deliver strong double-digit sales and EPS gains. While it was easy to focus on the supply chain and inflation challenges that we all currently face. It is also important to appreciate how strong 2021 has been for Pentair. Year-to-date we’ve delivered 25% sales growth, nearly 40% segment income growth. We’ve expanded margins 170 basis points, and grown EPS 40%. We have said that we view our businesses as more seasonal than cyclical and our robust backlogs give us further confidence in our ability to continue our strong momentum in Q4 and into 2022. In addition to the strong sales and earnings growth, we have generated over $500 million of free cash flow this year. And our balance sheet is strong. We ended a quarter under one-time levered, and I am especially proud of our 19% ROIC. We have completed two acquisitions this year, that further advance our strategy. We acquired KBI earlier this year, that added commercial services capabilities to our growing water treatment business. We recently completed the Pleatco acquisition that brings strong aftermarket filtration products, not only to our flagship pool business, but also to our industrial filtration business. Given the strong third quarter performance, we are tightening our full-year guidance range, which Bob will give additional color on shortly. There remains a lot of uncertainty as we end the year, given the ongoing material shortages, logistical challenges and inflation. In fact, we experienced more inflation in the third quarter of 2021 then we did in the full year of 2020. We have gone out with multiple price increases across most of our businesses this year. There’s a lag from when price increases are announced and when we recognize them particularly given our strong sales and backlog growth this year. The good news, however, is we ship strong pricing tailwind entering next year. This has been a great year and we believe we have a lot more runway ahead to become an even stronger company. Please turn to Slide 5 labeled building a track record of consistent growth. We believe our strong performance over the past several quarters reinforces that we are in the right spaces for the future. Our portfolio of industry leading products and now services help consumers move, improve, and enjoy their water in addition to a growing industrial filtration business focused on faster growing niches, such as sustainable gas. We are building a track record of consistent growth. Our residential businesses have enjoyed robust growth and we believe there’s more to come. Our commercial and industrial businesses have been recovering back to 2019 levels and backlogs have been building in these longer cycle businesses. We’re making great progress in building out our strategic growth initiatives. As I mentioned previously, we have completed two acquisitions this year, that furthered our pool and our water treatment strategies. We are also driving transformation to both unlock value and to fund growth. While some of our businesses are further along the journey. We have identified a strong funnel of opportunities to help us become more productive, better serve our customers and drive growth and margin expansion. Our balance sheet is another lever available that offers great flexibility to invest in our core, return cash to share owners and to fund strategic acquisitions. 2021 has been a great year for Pentair, and we believe there’s a lot more yet to come. I would now like to turn the call over to Bob to discuss our performance and our financial results in more detail, after which I’ll provide an update on our overall strategic position. Bob?
Bob Fishman: Thank you, John. Please turn to Slide 6 labeled Q3 2021 Pentair performance. Third quarter sales grew 21% with core sales increasing 18%. Consumer Solutions grew core sales 26%, and Industrial and Flow Technologies delivered core sales growth of 8%. Segment income was up 28% and return on sales expanded 90 basis points to 18.5%. Adjusted EPS increased 27% to $0.89. Inflation continued to be a significant headwind, but we saw price nearly offset it in the third quarter. Corporate expense was $17 million in the quarter, and our tax rate was 16% in the quarter. Overall, the third quarter was another solid performance across the enterprise. As our teams continued to deliver in the face of material shortages, logistical challenges and inflation. Please turn to Slide 7, labeled Q3 2021 Consumer Solutions performance. Consumer Solutions sales growth was 30% as both businesses continued to perform at record levels. Segment income increased 27% while return on sales contracted as price did not fully keep up with a significant inflation headwind. While we have implemented additional price increases, our record backlogs and strong double-digit growth, create a lag from when the price – new prices readout. We believe this creates a tailwind on price entering next year, but inflation does not appear to be moderating. Pool experience sales growth of 32% in the quarter and was up 5% sequentially. The demand in the industry remains strong even as the pool fiscal year ends, an activity begins to moderate. In fact, dealers are booked well into the third quarter of next year, which we anticipate will result in another strong pool season next year. Favorable mortgage rates continued increases in home equity and the ongoing trend of suburban migration are all contributing to robust demand for the industry. We continue to see strong demand for our variable speed pumps as new efficiency regulations drive transition from single speed pumps. The majority of our mix as shifted to variable speed. 2021 has been a good year for new products, including our IntelliBrite, HD Light and higher energy-efficient tiers. We expect next year to be another strong year, including advancements in filtration and continued expansion of connected products. Demand for new pools remain strong with many builders reporting backlogs into the later half of next year. Our record backlog and favorable demographic trends give us increased confidence and momentum as we look to next year. Water treatment delivered 28% sales growth, as residential demand remained robust, and commercial showed strong signs of post-pandemic recovery. We saw our direct-to-consumer business improving leads and closings in several new markets and we continued to evolve our business model. We’ve made great progress in rebranding the business and are also building out our service capabilities. The commercial recovery continued and the integration of KBI is going well. We had a total water management winning the quarter. That was a great example of taking a product sale and adding installation and services with an existing KBI customer. While restaurant foot traffic is still not back to 2019 levels average ticket prices are up and the result has continued improvement in orders and backlog for what has historically been a shorter cycle business. While Consumer Solutions has felt the biggest impact from inflation and material shortages in the short term, we have successfully implemented multiple price increases that are yet to fully readout and strong backlog levels point to anticipated continued growth for the segment. Please turn to Slide 8 labeled Q3 2021 Industrial and Flow Technologies performance. Industrial and Flow Technologies increased sales 8% in the quarter while segment income grew 23% and return on sales expanded 180 basis points to 14.8%. Residential flow grew at a double-digit rate for the fourth consecutive quarter. This growth was accomplished even in the face of supply chain constraints that are not showing signs of mitigating. Our customers have continued to experience strong sell through, which gives us confidence that we will continue to grow. Price is also beginning to readout further and should a tailwind entering next year. Commercial flow increased sales 6% in the quarter. The focus in commercial flow continues to be on complexity reduction, better price realization, and building out the aftermarket business given the large installed base. Industrial filtration delivered 8% sales growth that once again by recovering the shorter cycle business of food and beverage. We continued to see strong orders and our sustainable gas business had strong backlog growth and a growing order funnel where we experienced an improvement in our win rate. IFT is building momentum on return on sales expansion, and our transformation initiatives coupled with price realization improving, we believe should drive more improvement going forward. Please turn to Slide 9 labeled balance sheet and cash flow. Free cash flow continued to be a great story, as we have generated over $500 million year-to-date. We have returned $200 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase during 2021. The balance sheet ended the quarter exceptionally strong with leverage remaining under one times. The return on invested capital ended the quarter at 19% a number we are particularly proud of. We had a higher than average amount of cash on hand at the end of the quarter, as we awaited the completion of the Pleatco acquisition, which occurred last week. Our balance sheet gives us a great deal of flexibility to invest in our strategic growth initiatives, both organically and through strategic acquisitions like KBI and Pleatco. Please turn to Slide 10, labeled Q4 and full year 2021 Pentair outlook. We are initiating fourth quarter and updating our full year 2021 guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to grow 15% to 19%. Segment income to grow 16% to 24%, and adjusted EPS to grow 16% to 24% to a range of $0.81 to $0.87. Our forecast reflects ongoing material availability headwinds and higher inflation. For the full year, we expect sales to grow 22% to 23%. Segment income to increase 32% to 34%, and adjusted EPS to grow 34% to 36% to a range of $3.34 to $3.40. In addition to supply chain and logistics challenges, we would also remind investors that the fourth quarter historically incurs a seasonal slowdown for many of our residential businesses, as the weather turns less favorable for outdoor activity, in addition to fewer work days around the holidays. Below the operating line, we continue to expect corporate expense to be around $80 million. We now expect net interest to be around $15 million and our tax rate assumption remains around 16%. We anticipate the share count to be around $167.5 million, both for the quarter and the full year. Capital expenditures are expected to be around $60 million, while depreciation and amortization is anticipated to be about $80 million. We continue to target free cash flow to be greater than net income. I would now like to turn the call over to Stephanie for Q&A. After which, John will have a few closing remarks. Stephanie, please open the line for questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi.
Eitan Buchbinder: Hi, this is Eitan Buchbinder on for Andy. Good morning.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Bob Fishman: Good morning.
Eitan Buchbinder: So inflation in I&FT appears to have been balanced with price in the quarter. Should price cost for the segment inflect positively in Q4? And what is your expectation for price cost positive in Consumer Solutions?
Bob Fishman: As we said in the prepared remarks, price is reading out nicely, in both of our segments. Unfortunately inflation continues to be a headwind as we look at the fourth quarter. I think that, Consumer Solutions, there’s probably the bigger impact of the margin challenge with the bigger backlog. And the fact that, prices reading out a little bit more slowly in that business. I think we’ll continue to see a challenged margin at least in the fourth quarter. For I&FT they have some really nice productivity improvements. And so margins should continue to improve even though inflation continues to be a challenge. 
John Stauch: The other point I would make is, and you saw a little this in the quarter, despite KBI being a very strategic acquisition, it is a services business, services businesses don’t have the large margin profile. And so it’s not going to have the same margin profiles, Consumer Solutions. So it is slightly dilutive to margins. And as we bring Pleatco in as well, even though it’s a really highly valuable asset and one that we think is going to have great runway in the aftermarket side, it will also have a lower margin profile than Consumer Solutions today. So both of those will be a slight drag on the margins, but on both are various strategic tuck-ins that we think add significant value over the long time.
Eitan Buchbinder: That’s helpful. Thank you. And you called out improving capacity in pool as supporting results in this quarter as well as in Q2. Where would you say capacity utilization stands now relative to its potential within your existing pool footprint?
John Stauch: It’s hard to answer that. I mean, I think, we’re not the capacity challenge, right? Our factories have capacity to meet the demand. We’re still working through the supply chain. And as we mentioned in Bob’s remarks, I mean the supply chain is hugely volatile right now. Even when we can get supply, we have to worry about ports. We have to worry about freight. We have to worry about transportation. So, we’ve got a real lumpiness as far as what’s coming in each day and we’re doing the best we can. And the teams are, I’m really proud of the team’s agility to move forward and deliver again, a really solid quarter in the wake of challenged supply chain areas. So, I can’t answer the capacity issue, but we have plenty of capacity lost within our buildings.
Eitan Buchbinder: Thank you. I’ll pass it along.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.
Joe Giordano: Hey guys. Good morning.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Joe Giordano: Hey, so sorry. I joined on a couple minutes late, so apologies if you covered this. But in our checks that we’re doing with the pool sector, it seems like price the next year is comfortably in the double digits. I think I saw you guys plus eight or so in consumer. Do you expect that to kind of like be a lagging indicator? You see that kind of going up with what’s currently in the market?
John Stauch: Yes, I think we, obviously too early to guide on 2022 right now, but given where we are with inflation and, as I said more inflation in Q3 than all of last year combined. And, even though we planned for doubling inflation, we’re in the quadrupling and quintupling range, which is startling, right? And so I do think with the supply chain logistics, we should anticipate that inflation continues to grow in the next year and therefore, we would continue to price to hopefully offset that inflation. And so, yes, I think the ranges that you’re suggesting are more the probable direction.
Joe Giordano: And if I can sneak in one more just on pool, if you were to categorize your business, I know we talk about like new bills versus retrofits versus just your traditional kind of break and fix. Like, how would you categorize the growth that you’re seeing now? Does anything like in any one of those seem like just way off of, what you would expect or is it kind of balanced across those three verticals there?
John Stauch: It’s really balanced. I mean, we’re seeing new pool builds, which is obviously driving pool growth. We’re seeing expansion of the pad, as we’ve been mentioned all year, which is driving pool growth and adoption and usage, which is on driving pool growth. So it’s across the spectrum of both new pools and aftermarket consistently.
Joe Giordano: Thanks guys.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Mike Halloran with Baird.
Mike Halloran: Good morning gentlemen. So on the comments that Bob made about some seasonal slowing, which is normal going in the fourth quarter, just digging on that a little bit, is the thought that you can get pretty normal sequentials across your business units going in the fourth quarter, or is there some sense of any weakening or strengthening demand in any of the two area, any of the areas you sell into or are there areas where the supply chain might be a greater headwind going into the fourth quarter than maybe what you would have saw in the third quarter?
Bob Fishman: The guide for Q4 from our perspective is roughly flat since sequentially is kind of, how we think about it. We have a little bit of challenges in terms of the seasonality of some of the residential businesses, but to be honest that the backlog is so healthy going into the fourth quarter, that it’s really about the supply chain and the material challenges that we face. So the business continues to be very healthy from a demand and backlog perspective. We are seeing some seasonality in the fourth quarter about residential. It really does come down to the supply chain.
Mike Halloran: So in other words, there’s nothing long that you’re assuming in guidance versus normal seasonality.
Bob Fishman: No, nothing, no.
Mike Halloran: Okay. And then follow-up, balance sheets in a great spot, sub one times levered and so twofold. One, could you just talk about actionability of pipeline, obviously done a couple good deals so far this year, and then secondarily, what would the calculus be to increase, the rate of share buyback at this point?
John Stauch: Yes. Mike its John, I think without a doubt, you mentioned, I think the funnel is healthy and there’s a lot of M&A activity. While we’re not going to necessarily accomplish everything, I think we want to be active and we want to be focused on our SGI activities. So that’s where we’re at right now. And, if in fact those, the pricing gets too lofty or they’re not the right deals for us, I think we’d lean back into utilizing, the cash on the share buyback side. In addition to our normalized targets that we publish as 150 a year.
Mike Halloran: Appreciate it. Thank you.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Lee: Hey guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just a bit of a follow-up on the last one, the revenue guidance for the year is up $15 million at the midpoint for 2021. I guess first question is, does that include Pleatco now and if so, how much are they adding? I think you said $95 million in the press release when you announce the deal. So it does seem like something, maybe falling out or coming down maybe about, $70 million, $80 million, if we’re adding that relative to the original guide. So maybe about, two percentage points, can you help reconcile a bit what’s going on with the guidance there?
John Stauch: Yes, just to clarify, we have just the complete Pleatco is roughly $20 million of contribution in Q4. So it’s relatively modest, on a full year basis, we think that’s close to a $100 million, but we’re not going to have it this whole quarter. And, it’s about two-thirds pool and it’s about one-third Industrial Filtration that’s where I would share with you what that contribution is. Let’s, as Bob said, we don’t think we see the supply chain ramping up between Q3 and Q4 while there’s still this strong demand. We don’t think it’s prudent to anticipate that we would ship more in Q4, given that there’s holiday seasons that are also, clamoring for the same ports and the same freight routes that we’re trying to get to. So, we’re doing the best we can to sequentially improve every single quarter. And I think we made great progress from last year into Q1 to Q2 to Q3. And now what we’re suggesting is it’s wise to think that we’re flattish in our ability to get product out the door from Q4 to Q3. The seasonality of the businesses, which is normal, is more of our service businesses. The businesses, that go into people’s homes to treat water treatment. And those businesses are seasonal. Not too many people look to do that over the holiday season. And as Bob mentioned, that’s why we usually see a Q3 to Q4 dip in those particular offerings. So normal seasonality with the belief that we’re not going to raise our expectations beyond what we delivered in Q3.
Brian Lee: Okay, fair enough. And then, I know you don’t want to get into a 2022 guidance and quantifying the pricing here, but can you maybe give us a sense of what recent or anticipated price actions are in terms of timing and then even into early next year. And then, when you think those start to really readout as you say. Thank you guys.
John Stauch: As we’ve mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have had multiple price increases this year to offset the inflation. We’ll continue to follow that process into next year, where as inflation trends higher, we will pass along that the price of that headwind.
Brian Lee: That’s fair enough. Thanks guys.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies.
Saree Boroditsky: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Could you just talk through what you’re seeing from an early order program and how you’re thinking about those deliveries in the fourth quarter versus the first quarter, and then any commentary on what you’re seeing in the channel from an inventory perspective?
Bob Fishman: Yes. We don’t expect a significant early order program in the fourth quarter. There might be pockets, but at this point, nowhere near the size that it’s been historically.
John Stauch: Part of that is with the, with the significant backlog we have, it’s not prudent to think about adding more to it. So, we worked with our channel partners around, certain stocking areas differently than we worked with our channel partners around where they already had significant demands on us. And we were just trying to meet those demands. So that’s the point that I want to make sure that we emphasize that program is usually a level of the factories. And there’s no need to do that since we’re trying to be full out on the supply chain right now.
Saree Boroditsky: Thanks. That’s helpful. And obviously you’ve had strong sales in the quarter, and it talked a lot about the supply chain headwinds. Could you quantify any loss sales that occurred in the third quarter or that you expect to occur in the fourth quarter? That’s being pushed out to 2022?
John Stauch: I would suggest that, the incremental backlog over last year that we’ve now reported would be the gap that we’re trying to get through. Right? I mean, we have typical backlog businesses, and then we have more book and ship businesses, and then the book and ship businesses, which is primarily the residential. We’re not able to get everything out that our customers want every quarter. And so we start the quarter off and in a backlog situation, continue to add orders to it, ship as much as we can. And then we’re still having those rich backlogs, which are a combination of demand and the inability of the supply chain to meet that demand.
Saree Boroditsky: Great. Thanks for taking the questions.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Blair with Oppenheimer.
Bryan Blair: Thanks. Good morning guys.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Bob Fishman: Good morning.
Bryan Blair: So that sort of follow up on Joe’s question, I guess, to ask more directly, is there anything that you can see today? Are there any meaningful watch items that would prevent pool from posting solid growth again next year?
Bob Fishman: No.
Bryan Blair: All right. No, that’s what I wanted to hear. And it looks like Pleatco, essentially paid for by your second half cash flow. So that’s a pretty good setup. Is there anything you can offer, in 2022 base case outlook growth rate relative to the $95 million ROS level. Anything else that would help us to gauge, a reasonable accretion range for year one?
Bob Fishman: Again, we’re not in a position today to provide the 2022 guidance, but what we do have a number of tailwinds in place, we talked about that the strong backlog on entering the year. We’ve also is as you’d expect with the supply chain challenges, having the number of inefficiencies this year and that’ll help the P&L. And then probably most importantly, the transformation initiative that we talked about should be a tailwind as well for 2022.
John Stauch: Yes, and just Pleatco specifically, which you asked, just think about it roughly a $100 million of revenue give or take and around and think about roughly 20% and a little bit of interest headwind given the fact that most that’s cash and you can get yourself into, what you think accretion might be, obviously we’ll be doing some integration work, which will offset that slightly, but that gives you a general direction of that asset.
Bryan Blair: Okay. Appreciate the detail. Thanks again.
Operator: Your next question is from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital.
Jeff Hammond: Hi, good morning guys.
John Stauch: Good morning, Jeff.
Bob Fishman: Good morning.
Jeff Hammond: I noticed in both businesses you got, productivity was in the green, and I’m just wondering, what’s driving that just given all the crosscurrents and headwinds on supply chain that would be, I guess, eating into that.
John Stauch: Operating leverage, I mean, these are some pretty significant growth rates, Jeff, and when you leverage your fixed costs factories, and generally what’s been, a very productive, variable labor and fixed cost labor, the factories, that’s where we’re getting that productivity front.
Jeff Hammond: Okay. And then just on, a lot of questions on kind of price in the next year. And I think he has mentioned how substantial the carryover is, is the thought that that price cost dynamic, it looks like it’s a little bit negative, 3Q and maybe into 4Q, but is there a point where you start to see that flip positive or should we continue to think about, this trend of those being pretty close as the trend into 2022?
John Stauch: Yes. Jeff, I think, it’s fair to say that when you take a look at the rate that we’re exiting at, from an inflation standpoint, that creates an inflation headwind into Q1, right. And level it off in Q2 and Q3. And that’s where we got to get the incremental price to try to mitigate that. So full year, next year, I think we would feel like we’re in a position to offset it. There might be some lumpiness by quarter, some tailwinds and some headwinds, and that’s what we’re working through.
Jeff Hammond: Okay. And have you announced your Jan 1 price increase magnitude?
John Stauch: No, not yet.
Jeff Hammond: Okay. We’ll stay tuned for that. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question is from Nathan Jones with Stifel.
Nathan Jones: Good morning everyone.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Nathan Jones: I kind of like tact this a little bit from the gross margin side. So the real inflation started reading through in the third quarter. Gross margins in the first half were a little bit over 36%, about 34.5% in 3Q. Do you expect to be able to get those gross margins back to that kind of 36% range when you’ve offset all of the inflation increases with price, assuming inflation stops going up at some point here. But will there be a – just some of the math of adding the same number to the top and bottom that will keep you below that 36% level that we saw in the first half?
Bob Fishman: No, that is our goal is to get back to that, as quickly as we can. And certainly, doing better from a price and inflation perspective is important, but also the transformation is a key part of our margin expansion story.
John Stauch: And Nathan, I’d like to use the opportunity to share that a little bit. I have desires to have a four in front of that gross margin, as we exit the transformation period that we talked about and, most of the levers that we’re pulling, we believe that pricing is a big initiative and we’re leaning into that with outside help more looking at our value-adds and looking at end-to-end costs and trying to think about even our partners cost and how we help mitigate some of the expense. And we agree to that logistics and end-to-end freight costs are pretty sizeable, not just for us, but for our partners. So, how do we get after that with price? Second one, sourcing, how do we lean in on sourcing, and really I’m looking at global supply chains on a total landed cost basis, and make sure we’re making the best choices and SKU rationalization is a big enabler there as well. The third one is the manufacturing and distribution footprint, I think the distribution one gives us a big opportunity. And the fourth one is the organizational enablement. And that’s really about making sure that as we find new channels, new adjacencies, we’re getting productivity from the old way of doing things to fund the new way that we want to do things. And so those are the four big pillars of transformation. We made a lot of progress and we hope to create tailwinds to 2022 from those initiatives.
Nathan Jones: I was actually going to ask about the transformation initiatives next. I know when you announced these things back in June, there was a period of planning that needed to be gone through in order to finalize what exactly you needed to do. Can you talk about where you are in that process and when you should really start to see the benefits in these things?
John Stauch: Yes, really rich funnel, and I’m really proud of the way the teams drove the brainstorming, the ideation around what we could do and should do. And ultimately the opportunity is significant. And I want to make sure we set those targets against those new gross margin levels that you mentioned, because we have gone slightly backwards here, which means we have more that we have to go get. And then we also have to look at it pre-inflation, currently in the inflation environment and post-inflation to make sure that these are really contributing to the end state of Pentair. So really pleased with the progress and the team. And as I mentioned, we expect it to start contributing in 2022.
Nathan Jones: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: Your next question is from Ryan Connors with Boenning & Scatter.
Ryan Connors: Boenning & Scattergood is the name of our firm. Thank you. So, yes, I don’t want to jump across the valley prematurely here. But obviously, we’ve seen what a difference a year can make. So kind of a big picture, structural question around price costs. You’ve gotten a lot of price to pass all this stuff through. So let’s just say hypothetically the fed does tap the brakes early next year. Inflation pretty quickly comes down. Some of your raws go down, your freight goes down. How should we think about price in that scenario? Do you keep a lot of that price and that scenario and realize the margin upside, at least for a while, or, and how long could that be, or do you think that the competitive dynamics and that kind of a scenario would dictate that the price has given back pretty quickly? And I know that the answer might differ by business, but just interested in your perspective on it from that kind of point of view?
John Stauch: Yes. I mean, the way I look at it is that, if you think of that decision tree, you take that scenario, or do you take the scenario where the inflation continues to go forward? I’m going to choose the one where inflation continues to grow, because if that happens and we’re out in front, because we’ve been trying to catch up on price all year long, but if we can get out on the front of it, then the worst case scenario is that we start to turn back pricing to our channel, to basically reflect the lower inflation rate that we have. That’s an easier mitigation strategy than trying to get new price in an area where people are anticipating the inflationary pressures to subside. So, I think those, that’s the scenario planning that we’re going through, which is why we’re not ready to share 2022 with yet, but I’m going to lean towards that. We think inflation and supply chain challenges continue. And the worst case scenario is we dial back from there.
Ryan Connors: Okay. But then in terms of different businesses, I mean, which would be the ones where, based on the competitive dynamics, you think you could hold price and, which are the ones where you think would be a little more competitive and they give-back would be quicker?
John Stauch: Well, I mean, we’ve always said that we’ve got three general business models at Pentair, and our manufacturing build the stock, make the stock that goes through dealer distributors are the most responsive to inflationary pressures and price increases normally. This year is literally unique in the sense that we’ve had these large backlogs and it’s hard. We’re not going to go back and reprice backlog, right? So there’s a little timing delay related to that backlog. Another business model we have is project-based and you’ve got to predict where your price increases need to be to reflect the inflationary pressures that are out there, six to nine months in advance. And that’s always the hardest to get, right. Especially in these environments. And then the third one would be more OEM or larger customer base business models where, again, you’re in a process of negotiation and before those price increases go in, you got to get both sides to agree on what that partnership looks like. It’s those are the three basic premises. And so obviously the make to stock a little easier, most normal times the project, you have to be more careful and the OEM system negotiation of ensuring that everybody got the best productivity in the cycle.
Ryan Connors: Got it. No, that’s really helpful perspective. Thanks for your time.
Operator: Your next question is from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research.
Rob Wertheimer: Hi, good morning, everybody. Thanks for the informative responses and I’m sorry for one more on price cost, but it’s obviously a hot topic and I’m just curious on a couple of things. Is the volatility and variability in the supply chain getting more predictable? I mean, can you get your hands around what the end points might be on, where it is or is it still kind of unpredictable in the next year? Have you changed the way you price? You just mentioned not repricing the backlog, which I understand if you changed the way you, the way the cadence or anything else about the way you do pricing for more inflationary environments?
Bob Fishman: The headlights into the business on material challenges and inflation, could continue to really be a challenge. I would say, getting the material and that we need to drive the demand that we’re seeing is as much a challenge in Q4 is it, as it was in Q3. Inflation continues to trend higher and maybe a little bit more visibility on that, but not a whole lot better in Q4 than Q3. 
John Stauch: Yes. I think that this has taken our entire skill set, which is one of the reasons I want outside help on this. When you think you’ve got the raw materials side, right, which I think we’ve got closer to more accurate throughout the year, the surprises have been more on the freight and logistics cost of the availability and oils continuing to be volatile right now. And then there’s actually a cost of the routes. So that’s been a little trickier to get right. And then, I think when you get into these ranges, it’s retraining everybody that these are the appropriate coverage ranges because these are not ranges in price increases that we’ve historically sought. So it’s been a journey and a lot of learning’s, and I think we’re getting better at it, and I’m really proud of the way the teams are leaning in.
Rob Wertheimer: Okay. That’s helpful. Thank you. And then just for clarification, when you’re looking at, sold through into dealers are taking orders in 3Q et cetera, I want assumes volume is up next year then, right. I guess maybe that’s partly the ability of what you can deliver and then price ought to be up what mid-high singles, sorry if that’s going too far and I’ll stop there.
John Stauch: It is going a little too far. I mean, I think we’re not ready yet to commit to anything next year, other than we do believe that demand is relatively strong. We do believe that inflation is going to continue and we do believe we got to put price increases out there to cover inflation and not just the raw materials I mentioned, but covering the freight, covering the raw material and also covering anticipated wage inflation as well. So that’s the work we’re going through right now. And we want to get as close to accurate as possible.
Rob Wertheimer: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.
Trish Gorman: Hey, good morning guys. This is Trish Gorman on for Julian. So a lot of questions in on price cost, maybe looking at the other side is on productivity. I know you guys have made some investments here and you got the transformation savings coming and it’s stuff that nicely in Q3. So just wondering how we should think about this kind of moving forward, is this Q3 rates sustainable or does it step up further from here?
Bob Fishman: Yes, as John mentioned, a lot of the productivity improvements that we’ve seen in Q3, and we’ll see in Q4 related to the operating leverage as 2022 plays out, it’s really seeing some of the benefits around the pricing, the sourcing that the manufacturing and distribution efficiencies and the organization as John described it. So those would continue to be that the levers as we move into 2022.
Trish Gorman: Okay, great. And then just at the Investor Day, as you’ve talked about some of higher investment spending to support these strategic growth initiatives, just wondering if you can give us an update on kind of how that spending has trended to date and what we should expect for that in 2022?
Bob Fishman: Yes. So then we continue to invest in these throughout 2021. And as we lean into 2022, I think it’s fair to assume that, as I mentioned in the organizational enablement side, that we would expect that some of the traditional ways that we did things would be the funding mechanism for the new ways that we need to do things. So, I don’t see it stepping up significantly from here. And I think we have to find a way to self-fund it as we look into next year and then into 2023.
Trish Gorman: Great. That’s very helpful. Thanks guys.
Bob Fishman: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Taylor Wade: Hi, this is Taylor Wade on for Deane Dray. Could you guys just give us a quick update on some of the new IoT product launches and how those have gone and more specifically the app launch in pool?
John Stauch: Yes. Okay. So, we’re excited. I think, first of all, we’ve got 12 connected solutions out there in the market today, and we’re starting to see the ramping up of the downloads of our applications and use of those products. They cross all of our residential streams from also including R&I flow our small pump lines and as well as our water treatment and our pool applications. So, I think one of the bright spots I’ve seen this year is that we continue to see the automation penetration pool. In addition to the upgrades that we saw across the pad. Well, for new pool builds, and in the aftermarket side, sometimes in the busy seasons, you don’t see people also upgrading to those solutions and so that was very positive. And we started to make progress on our IoT related valves for water treatment, and also our pressure treatment and in our small pumps. So really good progress. And I think we’re getting good feedback on that capability to usage from our channel. And we’re excited about the momentum we were really building. And not to mention that we’ve also got the brew assist, and on the large F&B side within IFT, we’re making great momentum as well as building out our services model for our partners regarding the filtration of the year.
Taylor Wade: Very cool. And then just getting back to the supply chain, I know you’ve mentioned, resins and motors have been kind of in short supply in the past. Is there more that’s been added to that list and, or where does that stand?
Bob Fishman: Yes, we would say that, we would add freight and some of the challenges that we mentioned adding to the inflation headwind, but you’re right, that the resins, the electronics those types of products continue to be higher inflation. 
John Stauch: Those chips are what we’re all seeking, right, as products become smarter than you mentioned it with the IoT initiatives. So, we’re not the only company putting an IoT enabled initiatives. Everybody needs chips that goes in our case goes into drives or electronics, which then go into, it becomes sub-components into the assemblies that we’re trying to produce. So that’s where the catch-up in the supply chain really is.
Taylor Wade: Great. Thank you.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Hi, good morning guys.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Josh Pokrzywinski: John, you mentioned something in your opening remarks about being, a dealer being booked through 3Q of next year. Just wondering if you can unpack that a little bit more and I guess, for mostly replacement oriented business, that’s an awful lot of lead time. Is that just on doing full construction or something may be a bit more discretionary? Like what should we actually like read into that?
Bob Fishman: Those were – yes, and those were my prepared remarks. So, I will take the, take the lead on this particular question. The dealers booked into Q3 of next year includes, both the new and remodeled pool. So seeing strong demand in those two areas.
John Stauch: I mean, Josh, similar to the construction industry, the constraint is really labor and or material availability for the larger builds or remodels, right? So that is a longer lead time item than even our equipment. So those demands on the channel are out there, the channels, trying to meet the demands. And we’re trying to then meet the equipment demands of those remodels in the new pool builds.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Got it. Would you still say, kind of the majority of the strength you’re seeing today is on kind of sweeping the pool pad and like the broader upgrade versus the – kind of one for one replacement. Like how would you characterize, even growth in the quarter, if you wanted to break that down that’s the level that you go you guys have.
John Stauch: Yes, I think it’s a good way to look at it, Josh. I mean, I think, traditionally we would look at the new pool builds is getting an opportunity to expand – do the whole pad. And that’s why we enjoy that new build, the remodels we have that same opportunity, right to talk to the consumers and share with them the possibilities and upgrade that pool pad. And then we always had the break and fix, and you don’t get this type of growth from just break and fix. So the predominance of the incremental demand over what we’ve historically seen, call it mid-to-high single digits is likely penetration into the aftermarket pool pads or into the new pool pads from adding out to the pad.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Got it. That’s helpful. Yes, it’s breaking fix, Bob is out there too much with the wenches banging on pool pumps in Florida. Appreciate it. Good color. Thanks guys.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Patrick Baumann with JPMorgan.
Patrick Baumann: Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Just had a – I think so pricing consumer was up high single-digit in the quarter. I think people have asked us every which way, but just want to ask one more time. Like, can that accelerate next year, given kind of what you’re seeing as things exit the year and does it need to accelerate to offset kind of what you’re seeing cost inflation?
John Stauch: Yes, I think the way to think about it is, when you look at a year-over-year, you have to add what it also increased the previous year. And so, when we think about adding to the price increases next year, I mean, it’s important to realize how inflation is compounded from 2020 and 2021, and then how much more will be added as we go into 2022. So obviously when you look at it year-over-year, it’s a piece, but when you go back and look at the start of this, which for us was Q2 2020 we’ve seen the significant demand and that demand is turned into supply pressures. And then we’ve seen the corresponding inflation across the freight and all the other components here. So, I mean, I’m not going to give an exact answer, because I know everybody’s asked me in every single way, but we’ve got to price appropriately to cover the anticipated inflation that we see coming to us in 2022, but we don’t yet have that number. And when we do we’ll share it, but we’re going to price it appropriately.
Patrick Baumann: Okay. And can you talk about maybe the competitive landscape in pumps around the variable speed transition? We’ve seen Hayward pitching this midrange product of compliant pumps that’s like lower priced than they’re variable speed, but it’s compliant with the new regs and we’re hoping to gain some share with it. Just curious if you have any thoughts on that and if you’re hearing any customer interest on that type of a product and what your response could be if there was?
John Stauch: Yes, there are some small markets or some small regions, I should say. Where –a non-variable speed, and we still have a non-variable speed line is appropriate to meet the standards around certain horsepower levels and in certain outputs. So, you’re always going to see a couple of substitutes and a couple small regions, but the truth is most of the energy efficiency standards are driving to a higher level of efficiency. And we all got advance our products, as we try to keep up with sustainability goals and less electricity usage. So that’s where really where the future is. And currently there’s a few small markets or small regions where a substitute could be appropriate.
Patrick Baumann: Got it. Okay. Thank you. And then last one really quick, if I could fit one more in. Could you size for us kind of the percentage of your business that is like I guess, infrastructure related where you might see some benefit from stimulus, if its moves forward?
John Stauch: Yes. I’d say, less than a couple of $100 million is what I would say our exposure is where we might see some benefit from some stimulus, so not a large number for Pentair.
Patrick Baumann: Is that like the muni-pump business or is there something beyond that?
John Stauch: Yes. It’s the muni-pump business and then possibly the pumps that connect the muni to the subdivisions.
Patrick Baumann: Got it. Okay. Helpful color. I really appreciate the time. Thanks guys. Good luck.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: There are no additional questions at this time. I would like to turn it back over to John for closing remarks.
John Stauch: Thank you everybody for joining us today. We have delivered on commitments in 2021, whether measured by sales, income, EPS, or cash flow. And the good news is, we believe there’s still more to come for Pentair. And it’s becoming a pure play sustainability focused company in 2018; we have been building a track record of consistent growth while also driving our commitment to creating a longer term shareholder value. We have focused on portfolio and aligned around attractive secular trends, and we believe our strategic growth initiatives should contribute to us growing at rates even faster than the markets we serve. Our focus on transformation should help us not only unlock additional value, but also fund these growth initiatives. Our balance sheet provides us a lot of flexibility and our 19% ROIC demonstrates our focus on being disciplined with our capital. Stephanie, you can conclude the call. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K and today's release. We will also reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the Investor Relations section of Pentair's website. We will be sure to reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. I would like to request that you limit questions to one and a follow-up in order to ensure everyone an opportunity to ask their questions. I will now turn the call over to John.
John Stauch: Thank you Jim and good morning everyone. Please turn to slide number four titled Executive Summary. We were pleased to deliver strong second quarter with sales up over 30%, adjusted EPS growth greater than 40% and free cash flow up over $100 million in the first half of the year. I would like to thank our Pentair teams for helping deliver these results, even in the face of unprecedented material shortages and inflation. Our orders continued to grow and our backlog ended the quarter at record levels. We believe our order trajectory gives us increased confidence not only in our ability to growing the second half but it also gives us comfort that the topline momentum we have built the past several quarters will carry over into next year. Our transformation work is on track and we built a strong pipeline of initiatives across the enterprise. Regarding the current inflationary environment, we have implemented further price increases and we expect the price cost gap to further narrow in the second half. Our cash flow remained robust and our balance sheet is in a very solid position. We have a strong M&A pipeline tied to our strategic growth initiatives and we plan to remain disciplined with our capital allocation. We are introducing third quarter guidance and raising our full year expectations once again, which Bob will give more detail on later in the call. Our forecast reflects our expectations that material shortages and inflation are not going away nor will they improve materially. We believe we have better visibility than we have had in the last few quarters and that our proven focus around manufacturing and sourcing gives us the tools to navigate the current environment. We are encouraged to see our commercial and industrial businesses recovering and our residential businesses remaining seasonally strong and as mentioned earlier, our backlog support continued growth. Please turn to slide five labeled Building a Track Record of Consistent Growth. At our June 10th Investor Day, we introduced several targets for 2022 to 2025, including mid single digit sales growth, 300 basis points margin expansion and 10%-plus CAGR for adjusted EPS. Our 2025 targets were based on our guidance as of June 10, which we are raising once again following our strong second quarter performance. Our longer term target provided at Investor Day would now be based off of our revised guidance. We have experienced significant growth since the second half of 2020 and we believe the momentum that we have created will continue into the foreseeable future. We continue to believe that we have a well-positioned portfolio benefiting from many positive secular trends. Our pool business serves a large installed base. Water treatment helps solve water quality issues for residential and commercial customers. And industrial and flow technologies serves some attractive niches like biogas in addition to a large installed base the pumps. While our consumer businesses are seasonal, we do not believe them to be cyclical. Wile our focus is on driving the core to create consistent value creation, we are investing in a few strategic growth initiatives to accelerate the topline. These include getting closer to the consumer in pool, expanding water treatment further into services and biogas and carbon capture within industrial and flow technologies. As we drive transformation more broadly across the entire enterprise, we expect that this will drive both ROS expansion and help fund growth initiatives. Finally, we believe our balance sheet provides a great degree of flexibility to drive further upside, primarily through M&A tied to our strategic growth initiatives. I would now like to turn the call over to Bob to discuss our performance and our financial results in more detail, after which I will provide an update on our overall strategic position. Bob?
Bob Fishman: Thank you John. Please turn to slide six labeled Q2 2021 Pentair Performance. Second quarter sales grew 32% with core sales increasing 28%. Consumer solutions grew core sales nearly 40% and industrial and flow technologies delivered core sales growth of 12% with second consecutive quarter of growth. Segment income was up 40% and return on sales expanded 110 basis points to 18.6%. Adjusted EPS increased 42% to $0.84. Consistent with our guidance, the second quarter did not see price fully offset inflation as we saw higher inflation and we have continued to implement price increases to help offset. The second half should see price cost start to even out, but unprecedented amount of material and wage inflation coupled with robust demand has contributed price reading out at a slower pace. Corporate expense was $26 million in the quarter as we recorded higher levels of compensation expense, given the performance our businesses delivered this year. Our tax rate was 17.4% in the quarter as we now expect the full year tax rate to approximate 16%. This is due primarily to higher levels of North American income as our residential businesses continued to grow at strong double digit levels. Please turn to slide seven labeled Q2 2021 Consumer Solutions Performance. Consumer solutions sales growth was 44% as both businesses delivered strong double digit growth. Segment income increased 48% and return on sales expanded 80 basis points to 24.9%. Consumer solutions experienced significant inflation during the first half as demand continued to grow. Pool experienced sales growth of 50% in the quarter. While we have seen significant growth two quarters in a row to start the year, we believe pool dealers are doing their best to keep up with robust demand. The theme of consumers investing in their backyards continued. The pool team have significantly increased capacity even in the face of material shortages and inflation. Backlog remains at record levels and orders have more than doubled. Even when the record year, we believe the improvement in orders and strong backlog gives us improved visibility that growth will continue looking ahead for next year. The macro trends continued to be favorable and the installed base of pool continues to grow. Demand for new pools remained strong with many builders reporting backlogs into next year. We believe consumers remain committed to enhancing their at-home quality of life and enjoying the pool is a major part of the experience for many consumers. In addition to new pool construction, aftermarket growth remains strong as consumers have used their pools more. Water treatment delivered 35% sales growth as residential demand remains robust and commercial showed strong signs of post-pandemic recovery. Our residential business grew nearly 20% and our commercial business grew sales by over 40%, excluding the contribution from KBI in the quarter. Overall, we believe consumer solutions is well-positioned to deliver continued double digit growth in the second half based on strong order and backlog trends. We expect price to read out further in the second half and close the gap on the higher inflation experienced in the first half. Please turn to slide eight labeled Q2 2021 Industrial and Flow Technologies Performance. Industrial and flow technologies increased sales 17% in the quarter and its end-markets further recovered and the business continued to execute its strategy. Segment income increased 30% and return on sales expanded 160 basis points to 15.7%. Residential flow grew at a double digit rate for the third consecutive quarter. Orders continued to exceed sales and we expect the seasonal business to end the year well-positioned within all of its channels. Commercial flow increase sales 11% and further built backlog. The commercial recovery has gained momentum with orders continuing to improve. We expect growth to continue for the smaller part of the segment. Industrial filtration delivered 14% sales growth as the short cycle aftermarket showed further signs of improvement, particularly within food and beverage. We experienced double digit increases in both orders and backlog. Industrial and flow technologies remains focused on reducing complexity, selective growth and margin expansion. Please turn to slide nine labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. Free cash flow continued to be a great story with over $100 million improvement year-over-year. We generated $340 million of free cash in the first half. We have returned $117 million to shareholders through dividends and buybacks in the first half. We also repaid a $104 million bond that matured during the quarter and paid approximately $80 million to acquire KBI. As we continue to invest our capital wisely, we ended the quarter at just under one times leverage. We are extremely proud and excited to see our return on invested capital exceed 18%. As we look at our cash flow needs going forward, we plan to remain disciplined in our capital allocation approach. We plan to continue working the M&A pipeline and to buyback at least $150 million of our shares this year. Please turn to slide 10 labeled Q3 and Full Year 2021 Pentair Outlook. We are initiating third quarter and updating our full year 2021 guidance. For the quarter, we expect sales to grow 16% to 19%, segment income to grow 18% to 23% and adjusted EPS to grow 16% to 21% to a range of $0.81 to 0.85. Our forecast reflects our expectations that material shortages and inflation are not going away nor will they improve materially. For the full year, we expect sales to grow 21% to 23%, segment income to increase 30% 5o 34% and adjusted EPS to grow 32% to 36% to a range of $3.30 to $3.40. Embedded in our full year sales guidance is anticipated growth in consumer solutions around 30% with pool expected to be up nearly 40% and water treatment up over 20% as commercial is expected to further recover and KBI is expected to contribute in the second half. Also incorporated in the revised guidance is anticipated low double digit growth for industrial and flow technologies. Below the operating line, we expect corporate expense to be around $80 million, given the higher levels of compensation expense in 2021, given the record performance expected this year. We expect corporate expense to go back to more normalized levels next year. We now expect net interest to be in a range of $15 million to $16 million and our tax rate to be around 16%. We anticipate the share count to average between 167 million and 168 million shares for the full year. Capital expenditures are expected to be around $60 million, while depreciation and amortization is anticipated to be around $80 million. We continue to target free cash flow to be greater than or equal to net income. I would now like to turn the call over to Michelle for Q&A, after which John will have a few closing remarks. Michelle, please open the line for questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Mike Halloran: Hi. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. So can you just give some context behind the incremental confidence you are seeing in the pool trajectory from year? Maybe just how far is the backlog stretching out? Maybe a little more details on some of the commentary you getting from the channel? Inventory levels? Any more context would be great.
Bob Fishman: Well, as said in the prepared remarks, the backlog is at record levels, demand at all time high and remains very strong. We see pool build into next year and beyond. So the metrics around demand are very strong. Certainly with what we see now, we have confidence that the growth will continue for a variety of reasons, everything from second homes being built to people spending more time on in their backyards and a number of different products coming out. So I believe that that will continue. We are confidence into next year. Inventories, they are still catching up. So we are working through that to satisfy our distributors and dealers.
Mike Halloran: And then, just in that question, how far out is your backlog specifically tracking at this point? Or is it just meeting with what's available in the channel?
John Stauch: Yes. So Mike, this is John. First of all, we look at the pool season is coming to a completion at the end of September. And then we start the next pool season when we get to October. So our first goal is to get the backlogs and the inventories related to this pool season out. And as Bob mentioned, we feel like we are in a really strong position regarding that. And then we got to work on next year, which we feel is also going to be strong demand. I think another level of confidence is, we have been able to start to attract labor and keep labor in our pool factories which was harder to do three to four months ago. And we are starting to manage the supply chain, the uniqueness because of that, availability product and being able to demonstrate the agility in the factories to get product out to customers. So those are the differences of how we feel. As far as higher confidence, Mike, I think we have always been confident this is a good business and that this is a good demand. But we wanted to make sure we were able to make progress on meeting that demand throughout the year.
Mike Halloran: That makes a lot of sense. And then on the other side of the business. Just maybe some incremental commentary on the recovery cadence you are seeing in IFT? Sustainability, what customers are saying? How it's tracking versus normal seasonality? Any incremental color there will be great.
Bob Fishman: Yes. I will start with that one. We were very, very pleased again to see the IFT growth return. The residential piece of the business within flow continues to be strong. The recovery in commercial has also helped the flow business. And then within industrial, food and beverage has been a nice growth area for us. So it continues to grow to be able to guide for the full year low double digit growth for us is exciting after the challenging year last year. And we expect the momentum to continue as well in IFT.
John Stauch: And Mike I would just add that we saw in our commercial filtration businesses in water treatment finally get back to levels that they saw in 2019. Obviously, it wasn't easy compared to 2020 coming up the dip that we had there. But we are encouraged on those trends and we are encouraged as more restaurants and hotels and hospitality open globally that we will continue to see sequential improvement there.
Mike Halloran: I appreciate it. Thanks John. Thanks Bob.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Bob Fishman: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Joe Giordano: Hi guys. Good morning.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Joe Giordano: Can you kind of just talk us through regionally how like, if you had like a scale, one to 10, how crazy pool has been regionally? Are certain markets just more out of whack from a go forward basis? Like I live in New Jersey. So I know Northeast new pool inflation is probably at levels that have been seen before. But can you kind of scale how this is in more traditional markets? And maybe it's more balanced than some of these growth rates might appear when you normalize businesses for like the comps?
John Stauch: Yes. So we had a couple of things going on this year, as you probably know. One, we had the department of engineering changeover from single speed to variable. So we are already expecting that we are going to see strong growth in that particular product line. And then obviously the acceleration of new pools and remodel pools is really putting a significant demand nationally on that product. And that is the same product generally sold in all of the pool regions. And then state-by-state, you got these disruptions like Texas that has been disruptive for everybody and the fact that all of that aftermarket demand still needs to be satisfied of what happened with the freezes. And then the rest of the markets, I would say that they are just accelerated, meaning that the rate of new builds are consistent across those areas. And then the aftermarket demand replacement cycles or the additive, I want more products in my pad, have been traditionally across the Sunbelt states. So right now, I would say the demand is not easing and we are all trying to catch up with that demand and work through our supply partners to do that.
Joe Giordano: And if I could just sneak one in and apologies if I missed it in the very beginning. But any update on like timeline of new product introductions from some of these like in-home point-of-view systems like with Rocean?
John Stauch: Yes. That's our next year product introduction for us as we work to try to get that technology up to speed and then launch that somewhere around the end of the year, the early part of next year with a soft launch and then expect to ramp that up throughout next year.
Joe Giordano: Great. Thanks guys.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Brian Lee: Hi guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just a follow-up on Joe's question. Just any initial views on the new pool market for 2022? I know it sounds like from listening to other supply chain players, the general expectation is for about 110,000 or so, call it, this year. But wondering if you think that number grows next year? And then with respect to backlog trends, I know you are at record but kind of what sort of visibility can you quantify to any degree you have with builders currently heading into next season?
John Stauch: I think builds will continue to grow. I think you it's capacity constrained generally by labor and product availability beyond just pool equipment after we do the landscaping in those backyards. So, we continue to think that 2022 will be a robust year there. And then additive to that number, we always have remodels. So the pools that needs to also be done in addition to those new pools. And then where we are really pleased is the penetration rate of the products on the pad and more and more awareness of heaters, automation, salt-based chlorinators, those effects of products are where we have really seen the acceleration. So I think we want to continue to grow from here and we believe that we have right now up enough visibility to feel like 2022 is a growth year.
Brian Lee: That's fair enough. And just my follow-up on the price increase. You mentioned the latest price increase. Can you give us some quantification around what that level was? When that was implemented? Or when that's going into effect? And then what parts of the portfolio here? If I look at your consumer solutions segment for the back half, it seems like you are implying kind of 20%, 25% year-on-year growth number for the he back half year. How much of that is price? How much of that is volume? I am assuming a lot of that's going through that part of the portfolio here? Thanks guys.
Bob Fishman: What I will do is just share a little bit of color around price and inflation overall for Pentair. In Q2, price was a two point benefit for us and inflation was quite high, close to five points. As we move into the back half, think of inflation in that by the five to 5.5 point range, so slightly higher but think of price reading out at closer to four points in the back half. So we improve from Q2 and narrow the gap but it continues to be a challenge. And the whole material shortages is a challenge for our ops and supply team and we are really appreciative of all of the work that that team has done. In the second quarter, they really did a nice job helping us drive that 32% sales growth. They did have the luxury of more raw materials sitting in that opening inventory. So as we move into Q3 and Q4, the challenge for the team is really to deal with the lumpiness of the material shortages. So every week is interesting as they plan the production schedule and the team is doing a remarkable job to achieve the numbers that we have guided to.
John Stauch: And then just to follow-up on your price question. We have three general business models. In our dealer-distributor short-cycle businesses, obviously, it's easier to work with the supply chain and then work with the channel partners to raise price in those areas. They usually get through relatively quickly. Then we have our more OEM related businesses or our larger company programs, which takes time. And then we have got the projects that you quote and you are basically dealing with the cost of inflation until you quote that next set of projects. So that's the other color I bring across those three business models and it all blends to the numbers that Bob shared with you.
Brian Lee: All right. Thanks guys for all the color. I will pass it on.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Jeff Hammond: Hi. Good morning guys.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Jeff Hammond: So the incrementals in the quarter were certainly better than I thought and I think how you guys started on the June Analyst Day and I think that was a concern. It seems like price is more of a help in the back half. But what kind of surprised you to the better in the second quarter and how should we think about incrementals in the back-half?
John Stauch: Well, I think we have got some of the IFT productivity that we were expecting and it read out and we feel like that's generally sustained, which was definitely better. And then obviously, when we get more pool product out the door, it generally drives higher levels of margins for Pentair. And we were able to get capacity levels up in pool and we benefited from that.
Jeff Hammond: Okay. And then just on, I guess, this view into 2022. Just in the strength here in pool, where do you think some pull-forwards happening or stuff off that maybe isn't repeatable? I know there is good demand trends on new and remodel. But where have you seen maybe the most pull-forward in terms of consumer attitudes?
John Stauch: Well, I think every single channel partners we have is spending a disproportionate amount of time trying to work with us to get product to the next job there you are doing, right, on the new build side. So when you see increase in the new builds simultaneously with the demand for aftermarket, you are trying to balance those two things at the same time. So I think some of the traditional filter and pump are obvious because every pool pad needs those and they have to be repositioned to where the jobs are and how to get the inventory where you need. And then some of the more nice to haves in the pool that can be deferred and/or added later is really where we think the majority of the backlog is repositioned for next year.
Jeff Hammond: Okay. Thanks John.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bryan Blair with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Bryan Blair: Thanks. Good morning guys.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Bryan Blair: I was hoping you could offer a little more color on KBI integration and how the service network is influencing your commercial water treatment recovery and process going forward?
John Stauch: So for us, KBI is really an exciting acquisition for us that closed in the second quarter. We now are able to provide services within the commercial space. It's a business that we can learn from and then leverage to help grow in that area. So really strong start for us in that business and exciting to see the footprint and the opportunity within that area that we really haven't been able to drive into.
Bryan Blair: That's excellent. And then I think you said 40% total growth for commercial treatment in the quarter. I apologize if I missed it. But did you cite the organic figure?
Bob Fishman: Yes. The growth for the full year in water treatment, we gave -
John Stauch: It was 35% in the slides. I think Bob, right, for Q2 and then there is just a modest contribution from KBI in the quarter. And then for the year, in the full year outlook that Bob gave, think of roughly $20 million a quarter for KBI.
Bryan Blair: Okay. I appreciate that. And then John, -
Bob Fishman: Yes. the growth that we gave for the second quarter excluded the 40%, excluded the contribution from KBI.
Bryan Blair: It did, okay. I appreciate the color.
Bob Fishman: Thank you.
Bryan Blair: So with that momentum, John, you said over the last couple of quarters that it's unlikely that commercial demand would recover to 2019 levels. With the pace, the momentum you have in the business now, does the changes anything?
John Stauch: Right. Actually, as I said, we are at 2019 levels now. So we took a dip last year and now we are recovering to modestly growing versus 2019. We do believe that starts to accelerate from here. But we need the rest the world to continue to open. Primarily hospitality would be the one area that is not yet as robust driven by global travel primarily. Once that gets going, I think we feel like we are growing off of 2019 levels again.
Bryan Blair: That's great. Thanks again guys.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Nathan Jones: Good morning everyone.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Nathan Jones: I am just going to follow-up on the discussion there on commercial water treatment being back to 2019 levels. I can't imagine that the market is actually back to 2019 levels. So can you talk about where you think you are gaining share in this market? Or what's driving your ability to get back to 2019 levels when I can't imagine that the market could possibly be back to that level yet?
John Stauch: Yes. It's the spaces that we have a higher participation rate in, Nathan, like quickserve restaurants and also you got gas station service. And those are beverage hotspots as you can imagine. And we participate in both filtering the ice and also filtering the beverage dispensed. So that is a area that has definitely picked up faster than it was in 2019. And the rest of the fullservice restaurants and hospitality have been slow to recover it is but still recovering.
Nathan Jones: Okay. So your mix is more skewed to stuff that does have a market level back to where it was?
John Stauch: Yes. We benefit from that, yes, right.
Nathan Jones: And then a follow-up on that price cost equation as well. Narrowing the gap in the second half, pretty big gap there in the first half. In the unlikely event that we get kind of stable input prices, would you expect to be net price cost positive in 2022 as you make up these deficiencies from 2021?
John Stauch: Don't know yet. I mean, we definitely have learned a lot about inflation. I mean the sourcing inflation is usually easier predicting and I think we have done a relatively good job on that one. Where I think we have still been playing catch-up this year is labor inflation and the amount the wage increases that occurred throughout the year, Nathan. We are making sure that we are using best practices as we quote the next projects and next year's projects ahead of time. And then were making sure that we keep agility in focus as we think about how to price more effectively on the shorter cycle businesses.
Nathan Jones: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.
John Stauch: Yes.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Connors with Boenning & Scattergood. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Ryan Connors: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I had a big picture question on sort of the aftermarket opportunity. You alluded earlier to this idea that there are so-called nice to haves on the pool pad that maybe aren't going in right now because of the supply chain constraints. And so my question is, how should we think about the growth of the installed base over a couple of nice years here on new builds? And what that does to the structural aftermarket opportunity in the next several years, three to five years out? I mean, is that meaningful, that expansion in aftermarket? And do you believe that's a good thing from a mix perspective? Can you just give us your thoughts there?
John Stauch: Yes. I mean we look at it as, every new pool that goes in is additive to the 5.3 million in-ground pools that exist today. And as people use their pools more and more, the number one thing they look to is the water chemistry of their pools. And then how do they make it more enjoyable and comfortable as an experience. And those things tend to drive higher degrees of automation and consumer awareness and also then lead you to figure out what else you can do to either self manage or self monitor your pool or control heat and/or the other comfort aspects of your pool. So we look it as, all this is good news to build out the long term demand in the channel.
Ryan Connors: Okay. And then my other one was, just want to get your reaction, there is a lot of the news about this global minimum tax rate and lot of movement on sort of tax rates. And I know you have got the unique jurisdiction as a corporate. So any thoughts there on how that could impact Pentair or not from a tax rate standpoint, depending on how that plays out?
John Stauch: We are in the process of assessing what the impact would be. It's still too early to really give a perspective. But our early view here is that there would be some upward trip in the tax rate but not significantly higher at this point. And then certainly better than a number of our competitors.
Ryan Connors: Yes. Okay. Fair enough. Thanks for your time.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Andy Kaplowitz: Hi. Good morning guys.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Andy Kaplowitz: John, you mentioned you are excited about how much smart automation in heaters and your really new pool pad products in general are adding to remodel and aftermarket growth. Can you give us a little more color into how much the new upgrades to the pool pad are maybe more secular? Have you invested enough in your sales and product capability to take advantage of this trend? And what do they tell you about the longer term growth potential in pool? How much do you think they could contribute to longer term growth?
John Stauch: Great question. I mean we have been stuck and the industry is has been stuck and we have been with it somewhere around just modestly in the double digits of automation. And I think just with the recent trends in more mesh networks and getting Wi-Fi into the backyard in a more dependable basis, it creates more opportunities for more automation. You really need awareness and you need people to use the pool with care to really drive that behavioral change. And that's what we are most encouraged by. There is also better technology at great price points that we are participating into to manage and monitor water chemistry. And then to begin to determine what's necessary to balance those water areas. So that's what I am really super excited. We also saw and we shared this openly that as use their pools more, the heater matters. And that was always the nice to haves on the pad on the older builds and I would say most people remodel now they are putting those heaters in, both the spa and for the pool. So we have seen the trends in lighting earlier. We saw the trends working around some of the variable speed pump penetration. We are now starting to see that extend to the other capabilities around the pool. So I think it's a few points of overall pad penetration for the industry over the next several years. And that encourages us and excites us.
Andy Kaplowitz: And John, I might have missed this is in the prepared remarks. But at your Analyst Day, you had mentioned that you are right in the middle of 12 weeks sprint to come up with ideas to form more of the basis of the transformative plan that you laid out through margin improvement. So maybe you could update us on sort of what sort of ideas have come out of that? Any sort of interesting observations you would make?
John Stauch: Yes. So my official report out is this Thursday with the executive team and I am looking forward to that set of brainstorming actions. We have engaged a lot of people so that we have got a voice from the broader organization. It's required patience for my part to not jump and know what the answers are. So I am not going to jump out of that. But I have seen the funnel and I have seen a list of ideas and I would say that it's more sizable than I originally thought. And that was about how do we put the programs around it to action them and to think about sequencing them to derive the value from that. But really, really encouraged right now on the participation in the organization and the ideas that are starting to surface.
Bob Fishman: Yes. This is Bob. And I have probably been a little less patient than John. So I would confirm that the pipeline of opportunities is very robot. A lot of complexity reduction initiatives. There is huge opportunity to drive margin expansion and to really help with those Analyst Day numbers. We said in the prepared remarks that even with a higher guide this year, we are going to go ahead and add on to this year the 300 basis points of margin expansion into the future with where revenue will grow at that mid single digit plus number that that we shared at Analyst Day. So transformation will be a big part of to us achieving those results. And embedded in all of this is ease of doing business with Pentair, so a much, much better situation for our distributors and dealers as well.
Andy Kaplowitz: I appreciate it guys.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Hi Good morning guys.
John Stauch: Hi Josh.
Josh Pokrzywinski: John, just on some of the inventory commentary out there in distribution or kind of your channel. And sense for what that's like kind of on a normalized basis? Maybe absolute levels versus 2019? I think days on hand were probably pretty well, just given how strong the growth pace is. But if we were to sort of dial that back a little bit or normalize that, would inventory sort of be in the right ZIP Code or would they still be low on an absolute basis?
John Stauch: Josh, without getting to specific, we are lower than we should be and our customers and channel partners are asking us every single day to pick up the pace and get then more equipment, right. That's the way I would say it. it's exhausting to the plan teams to keep up the demand and the sell-throughs you can articulate from other people's releases and you see that we are trying to do what we can to catch up with it.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Got it. That's helpful. And then just touching on the last question that I think got asked on some of the other quantified discretionary stuff. You mentioned heaters. How much were those up relative to rest of the pool business? I would imagine a lot of that is more kind of first fit than necessarily replacement of an existing theater. Is that fair?
John Stauch: Yes. I mentioned it because we saw that really go into the back half of last year in a broader way, if you recall. And so now when we think about anniversarying the back half, we are still growing on top of those levels which gives us encouragement that these aren't necessarily one-and-done but we are seeing a long term penetration of the product lines.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Got it. I appreciate it all.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Rosenblatt. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Scott Graham: Good morning John, Bob and Jim. I have questions, a couple of questions about price cost. And I was wondering, Bob, would you be willing to split out the labor piece of the inflation that we saw in the quarter?
Bob Fishman: Roughly speaking, two-thirds material, one-third labor.
Scott Graham: And maybe help us maybe understand a little bit on the labor side. So are you talking about increases to the compensation pool for your current employees to retain them because your business unit heads are saying, hey, we are going to lose people. So you kind of got to get more aggressive there? Are these new employee adds? Could you give a little color on that, if you don't mind?
John Stauch: Yes. I think it's both. I mean when you look at having to add to your labor base, you are confronted with what are the real market dynamics to add. And then you have to go back and you have to make sure that your existing loyal employees are paid at least that, if not more. So it creates a dual impact. One, trying to get the new people and then making sure that your current employee base are well taken care of.
Scott Graham: Thank you for that. On the productivity, particularly IFT, is that the beginning of some of the reduction in complexity, the $10 million, is there a piece of that in there?
John Stauch: Yes. There is a big piece of that in there. And I think we are really encouraged with their efforts around that. And we think that that is, that's why Bob also mentioned transformation. I think we learn from certain categories of dullness. We have seen how it reads out in better efficiencies on sourcing and also less complexity for customers. So we are really encouraged by that trend and we expect to bring that across the enterprise in a faster way.
Scott Graham: Okay. Thank you. Last question is a question you might not be able to answer, but I am just going to shoot anyway. The prices of assets are pretty inflated, speaking of. And we have IFT, which is a business that needs to some fixing to improve the margins there. But it looks like, particularly as of Thursday you are going to have a very clear path to do that. As in acquisitions announced in this space, I would say, in this space in sort of a multi-area just the last couple of days where it affects them about 17 times EBITDA which is your multiple. And I am just assuming that the pool multiple is higher than the IFT multiple embedded within your valuation. Is there any thinking around IFT spinning that off at some point down the line, particularly with asset prices where they are now?
John Stauch: Yes. Scott, I mean the way I look at it is, I think we have a really good IFT business that continues to demonstrate progress towards its goals. I mean I am really encouraged by the way its growing. Double digit core growth this quarter and starting to build out the order pipeline. And I am also encouraged about its focus, its complexity reduction and its commitment to the margin expansion. Now I am going to get through the transformation work. And I believe that this business has significant margin expansion in front of us. So I believe the course of action is, that's can create value for Pentair, a large part of our portfolio. And then it is a big important part of our portfolio.
Scott Graham: Got it. Thank you both.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Rob Wertheimer: Thank you. Good morning everybody. So you have talked on this a couple of times before. But water treatment, we are looking at a really cyclical rebound but a bit less as you have impact from product changes and the solution in residential and commercial. Is that correct? Or is some of the work you are doing underlying will allow this to some of that growth more structural than the nice rebound that we had? And then just maybe just kind of reiterate the timeline of the impact you are seeing from what you are doing there? Thank you.
John Stauch: Yes. So just within water treatment to remind you, roughly $100 billion pro forma business. We have residential and we have commercial. And the residential has been fairly strong. Little lumpy through COVID with the ability to get in people's houses or not as far as what we are trying to do there. But now it's at a point where I think we have got steady-state growth. If you recall, when commercial happened, there was generally a closure of most restaurants and hospitality and offices where people drink water. And that was a huge step back to our business last Q2. That has slowly been recovering as people return to more of the normal of the way it used to be pre-COVID but we are not yet back globally to where we expect it to be. I think our addition of KBI gives us the ability to have services components on top of products with strategically what we think our customers want and we are very encouraged about the early signs there. So I think we are starting to return and I think we are now in, what I would say, every part of that portfolio growing versus being more residentially led, as it was in last several quarters.
Rob Wertheimer: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Trish Gorman: Hi. Good morning. This is Trish, on for Julian. So just on free cash flow, it's been very strong year-to-date. Under normal seasonality, I think second half free cash flow represents 50% or 60% of the full year free cash. Should we expect this normal seasonality to occur this year? And maybe if you could just walk us through the moving pieces there for the balance of the year?
Bob Fishman: Yes. Balance of the year free cash flow remains strong. What's really helping us is, we get off to fast start at the beginning of each quarter that the linearity is very strong. So I expect another strong free cash flow year following last year. And we will continue to drive it over 100% of net income.
Trish Gorman: Great. And then maybe one more. On IFT, I know you guys have talked about the significant margin expansion opportunities there. But how should we think about inorganic opportunities there? Can you just remind us what end-market or products you might look to increase your exposure to within that segment?
John Stauch: Yes. So we hinted at Analyst Day. We really right now like the carbon capture and also the sustainable gas parts of that portfolio. And we feel like that we have got a fairly good position there and we would love to continue to scale and also be able to provide the regional partners the solutions they need. We are at the heart of everything we do. We are a membrane focused company. So we like to look into filtration and have opportunities to expand our filtration capabilities as well. And as a reminder, even though we use some of these technologies in the consumer solutions, they initiate those applications in IFT and we cross-pollinate those across both segments. So those are the two areas that I would say are definitely areas of a focus in the IP portfolio.
Trish Gorman: Okay. Thanks guys.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital management. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Dean Tyler: Hi. This is Dean Tyler, on for Deane.
John Stauch: Well, hi Tyler, on for Deane.
Dean Tyler: Sorry if I missed this, but could you discuss some of the supply chain issues that you guys are seeing? Obviously, you mentioned product availability in some of the prepared remarks. But are you seeing other supply chain issues like port congestions or anything there?
John Stauch: Yes, yes and yes. I mean everything that you are hearing, we are experiencing in some type of inconsistent way, right. So we would say that even though we have had availability of most of the supply we need, it's very inconsistent in its predictability of when and how it's coming, which is forced tremendous agility in our factories to rearrange in a lean way where we put the labor efforts. And sometimes we are producing 75% of the product and then coming back and fishing 25% later, to give you an example. That's why we are very complementary of you teams, as Bob said, because it's required all kinds of different skills to be able to move forward. Main challenges to us are chips, would be drives, would be motors, those would be the areas that are in high demand for the products that we serve.
Dean Tyler: Great. Thank you for that. And could you guys provide just any updates on some of your new IoT products that have launched recently or planning on launching?
John Stauch: Yes. So we are excited by that. And I think, first of all, really excited about the momentum we are building in IFT on lot of their IoT enabled services ability. We have launched products on the consumer solutions side that allow you to connect to our Pentair Home app. And we continue to add product capability to give you a better consumer experience. So I would say, most of those been soft launched in 2021 and we will expect accelerate in 2022 and beyond. And then I have to take a plug because I know Deane would be very interested in this, Tyler, is we feel like we are really making some of progress on some smarter filtration technology for pool as well and we are excited as we mentioned at the Analyst Day about the progress on that technology and making pools clearer and more visible and utilizing less chemicals to achieve the same outcomes.
Dean Tyler: Great. Thank you very much.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And I am showing no further questions and I would like to turn the conference back over to John Stauch for any further remarks.
John Stauch: Thank you Michelle and thank you for joining us today. 2021 is experiencing a phenomenal year of growth and we believe the future continue to bright for Pentair. We believe we have strong business platforms that are industry leaders in their designated spaces. We are in spaces that are growing faster than the overall global markets and are propelled by attractive secular trends. And we have carved out exciting strategic growth priorities in which we have already begun to demonstrate performance. Further, our transformation journey is designed to unlock value that allow us to grow faster than the industries that we participate in and help us to expand margins rapidly by 2025. And finally, our balance sheet is strong and we believe we will continue to get stronger, supporting incremental value creation above and beyond what are base businesses can do on their own with tuck-in M&A. Michelle, you can conclude the call.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-04-22 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Q1 2021 Pentair Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Lucas. Thank you. Please go ahead.
James Lucas: Thanks, Stephanie, and welcome to Pentair's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. We're glad you could join us. I'm Jim Lucas, Senior Vice President, Treasurer, FP&A and Investor Relations. With me today is John Stauch, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Fishman, our Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, we will provide details on our first quarter performance, as outlined in this morning's press release. Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties such as the risks outlined in Pentair's most recent Form 10-Q, Form 10-K and today's press release. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today, and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results. Today's webcast is accompanied by a presentation, which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Pentair's website. We will reference these slides throughout our prepared remarks. Any references to non-GAAP financials are reconciled in the appendix of the presentation. We will be sure to reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. I would now like to turn the call over to John.
John Stauch: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 4 titled Executive Summary. I would first like to start by thanking the entire Pentair organization and the contributions they have made to help deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all of our global channel partners and suppliers for their patience and efforts and working with us and our consumers to meet our commitments despite the effects of decreases in the South, canal blockages, supply chain constraints and, of course, the ongoing pandemic. Building off the momentum from last year, we started 2021 strong, with sales up 22%, adjusted EPS increasing 56% and free cash flow improving significantly from the comparable period last year. Our residential business has led the way as Consumer Solutions experienced a 34% increase in sales. Encouragingly, we saw sales in all three businesses in Industrial & Flow Technologies return to growth for the first time in over a year. We announced the acquisition of Ken's Beverage earlier this week. This is a strategic bolt-on acquisition that provides Pentair a valuable national direct service network to expand our commercial water treatment business. We believe we will be in a position to seamlessly manage the full customer experience from product development, sales, installation and service to ensure the best quality products are matched with the most reliable and dedicated service network for all commercial applications. We believe Ken's provides us a platform to grow from as well as an opportunity to continue to expand our products offered to this important channel. Our balance sheet remains in excellent shape, and we are well positioned to fund organic growth and inorganic growth opportunities and return capital to our shareholders through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. With a strong start to the year, we are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $2.80 to $2.95. While inflation remains high, we have instituted a number of selling price increases across the portfolio that we expect to help mitigate inflation in the second half of the year. The strong start to the year and continued strength in our Residential businesses gives us confidence that we will have another strong year of growth for Pentair. Equally important are the signs of recovery in our commercial and industrial businesses. We plan to continue to invest in our strategic growth initiatives, and we will remain disciplined with our balance sheet. Please turn to Slide five labeled 2021 Execution Expectations. As we highlighted at the end of last year, we understand the importance of delivering the core while we also build our future. The focus has been and will remain on consistently making our commitments. Our actual results for the past three quarters have come in significantly better than our expectations as residential demand has been very strong. While we have experienced robust sales and EPS growth, we have also improved our cash flow and our balance sheet is the strongest it's been in years. Building our future means focusing on the things that are within our control. We look forward to providing more depth on this topic at our June 10 Investor Day. However, this is a continuation of the hard work we have been undertaking for the past several years. It starts with our focus growth initiatives primarily in our Consumer Solutions segment. We are a leader in the pool industry, and we continue to build on our leading position. Investments in this area include automation, smart and connected solutions, energy efficiency offerings and now better filtration solutions. Within water treatment, we have expanded from components into systems and services within both residential and commercial. We have made significant investments in digitally building our brand and expanding our reach. We recently created a transformation office as we embark on the journey to drive growth while being more agile and flexible. Transformation can have many meanings. But to us, it means that we will have the right strategy, organization, leadership and culture while accelerating growth and driving margin expansion by leveraging our internal capabilities and reducing complexity. This is not an either or but a both and. We recognize that we must grow and drive productivity in order to maximize our ability to deliver for customers and create value for shareholders. We plan to continue to accelerate our digital innovation, technology and ESG investments, and we expect to fund many of these initiatives through our complexity reduction efforts. We believe that we are better positioned to deliver consistent growth and margin expansion while also generating strong cash flow. Our goal has been and continues to be delivering consistently for our customers, employees, shareholders and the environment. I would now like to turn the call over to Bob to discuss our performance and our financial results in more detail. After which, I'll provide an update on our overall strategic position. Bob?
Robert Fishman: Thank you, John. Please turn to Slide 6 labeled Q1 2021 Pentair Performance. First quarter sales grew an impressive 22%, with core sales increasing 19%. Consumer Solutions grew in excess of 30%, and Industrial & Flow Technologies returned to growth for the first time in five quarters. Segment income was up nearly 50% as we saw strong drop-through, and return on sales expanded 330 basis points to 19%. Adjusted EPS jumped 56% to $0.81. We saw price and productivity offset inflation in the quarter. This was the third consecutive quarter of strong double-digit sales growth within our residential businesses. But just as encouraging was our commercial and industrial businesses showing sequential improvement and some pockets of growth. We were very pleased with our first quarter performance, and we believe the momentum should continue. Please turn to Slide 7, labeled Q1 2021 Consumer Solutions Performance. Consumer Solutions sales growth was 34% as both businesses delivered double-digit growth. Segment income increased 54%, and return on sales expanded 330 basis points to 25.1%. Pool experienced remarkable growth of almost 50% in the first quarter. Traditionally, the first quarter is preparing for the upcoming pool season, but we saw strong demand flow through the channel as we believe pool dealers continue to do their best to keep up with robust demand. The theme of consumers investing in the backyard as part of their home oasis continued. Demand for new pools remained strong as many builders saw bookings well past the current pool season. An already strong pool maintenance space grew only stronger as the freeze earlier this year in the Southern U.S. caused many premature equipment failures due to water freezing within the equipment. Pool has experienced strong double-digit sales growth for three consecutive quarters, and this would not be possible without our operations and supply teams and their ability to continuously increase capacity and execute at historically high-volume levels. We saw strong demand for pumps during the quarter and continued to see broader adoption of our variable speed pumps as a new DOE regulation goes into effect later this year. Demand for heaters remains quite high, and we have significantly increased our production capacity. Water treatment delivered 12% sales growth as residential demand remained robust and the decline in commercial volumes showed further sequential improvement. Within residential products, we saw strong growth in valves, tanks, pitchers and faucets. We experienced strong growth in the U.S., Europe and especially in China. We're in the early stages of integrating Rocean, but we believe the acquisition will greater enhance our product offerings going forward. Within residential services, we continue to experience strong demand and healthy conversion of leads into actual orders. We've made good progress on our journey to become the trusted, nationally branded experience, led in part by our brand transition to Pentair Water Solutions. We are launching a number of new recurring revenue services, including preventative maintenance programs, service bolt-ons for plumbing services, cartridge change-outs and extended warranty programs. We are seeing continued signs of these foundational building blocks coming together, leading to more consistent, predictable growth. We believe that commercial demand is finally finding a bottom and expect comps to get easier going forward. We continue to build a strong new business funnel, particularly for our total water management offerings. We believe the addition of Ken's Beverage will help strengthen these offerings. Please turn to Slide 8 labeled Q1 2021 Industrial & Flow Technologies Performance. Industrial & Flow Technologies sales increased 7% in the quarter, led by another quarter of double-digit growth in residential flow, and both commercial flow and industrial filtration encouragingly posted modest growth in the quarter. Segment income increased 12%, and return on sales expanded 60 basis points to 14.5%. Residential flow grew at a double-digit rate for the second consecutive quarter as demand remains strong across residential, irrigation and ag spray. We also experienced strong growth across retail, Pro and OEM channels. Commercial flow returned to growth, with backlog growing for the first time in many quarters. While infrastructure remains soft, we were encouraged by a growing backlog within commercial. We were pleased to see industrial filtration return to growth in the first quarter and improve its backlog both year-over-year and sequentially. While headwinds remain in our longer-cycle businesses due to caution in larger capital investments, we saw solid improvement in short-cycle component demand. Within our food and beverage business, we are beginning to see orders for our beer membrane filtration systems, including a new system for beer stabilization. In addition, we continue to expand our IoT offering with existing beer customers. Finally, we have seen a substantial increase in backlog for our biogas systems. Industrial & Flow Technologies remains focused on reducing complexity, selective growth and margin expansion, and we are encouraged by the improving top and bottom line to start the year. Please turn to Slide 9, labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. While the first quarter is historically a period of cash flow usage due to seasonal working capital being built, we were very pleased to see only minimal usage this year and over $150 million year-over-year improvement. This was driven primarily by our pool business and improved linearity. We expect another good year of free cash flow driven by strong demand and continued disciplined working capital management. We ended the quarter at 1.3 times leverage, and our return on invested capital was a strong 16.3%. As we look at our cash flow needs going forward, we have a bond maturing in the second quarter, and we will be paying our quarterly dividend. Beyond that, we will continue to be disciplined in our capital allocation as we continue to work the M&A pipeline, and we continue to have in our plan a buyback of at least $150 million of our shares this year. Please turn to Slide 10 labeled Q2 and Full Year 2021 Pentair Outlook. We are initiating second quarter and updating our full year 2021 guidance. For the second quarter, we expect sales to grow 13% to 16%, segment income to grow 12% to 20% and adjusted EPS to grow 17% to 25% to a range of $0.69 to $0.74. For the full year, we expect sales to grow 6% to 11%, segment income to increase 10% to 16% and adjusted EPS to grow 12% to 18% to a range of $2.80 to $2.95. We continue to work through material shortages and inflation that is impacting the second quarter. We believe that our pricing actions taken in the first half will help mitigate full year inflationary pressures. We have not factored in Ken's Beverage into our forecast as we are awaiting finalization of the transaction. Embedded in our full year sales guidance is anticipated low double-digit growth in Consumer Solutions, with pool expected to be up mid-teens and water treatment up high single digits to low double digits. Within Industrial & Flow Technologies, we expect the top line to be up low-to-mid single digits, with residential above the segment average. While we are experiencing an increase in orders for the short-cycle parts of our commercial and industrial businesses, we have not yet seen larger capital spending materialize. Below the operating line, we expect corporate expense to be around $65 million, net interest to be in a range of $16 million to $18 million, our tax rate to be around 15%, and the share count is expected to average between 167 million and 168 million shares for the full year. Capital expenditures are expected to be around $65 million, while depreciation and amortization is anticipated to be about $80 million. We continue to target free cash flow to be greater than or equal to net income. I would now like to turn the call over to Stephanie for Q&A. After which, John will have a few closing remarks. Stephanie, please open the line for questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup.
Andy Kaplowitz: Good morning, guys. Nice quarter.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Andy Kaplowitz: John, just focusing on your Q2 guide for a second, I think we all understand that pool was unusually strong in Q1 versus normal seasonality, but is there any reason why pool would be down sequentially in your usually seasonally strongest Q2? How much of a boost did you see from Texas weather-related issues in Q1? Or are you worried at all that supply constraints could get worse? Maybe just give us some more color because for the overall company, you're still forecasting lower year-over-year growth in Q2 than Q1 despite easier comparisons.
John Stauch: Andy, totally understand. I'm going to have Bob answer that one.
Robert Fishman: Yes. While we're pleased with the Q2 guide versus the prior year, it's not lost on us that with the demand that we're seeing in the overall business, not just pool, why couldn't we have done as well sequentially versus Q1. We look at that, and we do face some material shortages in key components, resins, motors, circuit boards. And while we have shown an improvement over the last couple of weeks, it is an impact to the second quarter. We're also facing some inflationary pressures in the second quarter. And while we have increased prices, most of that will read out in the back half. So we're doing everything we can to catch up and basically satisfy this increased demand, but there are some supply challenges that we are facing in the second quarter.
Andy Kaplowitz: Thanks, Bob. And then just focusing maybe on that inflation, it looks like you got a nice uptick in productivity in Q1 and productivity plus prices more than offsetting inflation. It seems you've been able to get over the labor availability issues you talked about in the past. And we know your guidance in the past was for price and productivity to offset inflation, but is it possible for you to actually stay ahead of the inflation despite all these constraints?
Robert Fishman: That is certainly our goal. Obviously, in the second quarter, we have the inflation challenge. But for the back half of the year, what you just mentioned is our goal. I did want to congratulate the operations team, the supply chain. A lot of the issues that we saw in 2020 as we ramped up production, we really addressed head on and did a nice job. So a lot of that productivity improvement is driving the leverage over a fixed cost base and driving the efficiencies in a really cost-effective manner.
Andy Kaplowitz: And Bob, you're able to get the labor you need to meet this ramp up?
Robert Fishman: Labor continues to be a challenge, and it's something that we need to address. It's -- in many places of the business, it's a challenge, to be totally honest. But we -- our guidance should not be impacted by that, but it's certainly on our radar screen.
Andy Kaplowitz: Appreciate it, guys.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Lee: Hey, guys. Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. Great job on the quarter.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Brian Lee: You alluded to this, John, during the prepared remarks, but can you quantify a bit what your exposure is to Texas? We know it's one of the top three pool markets in the country, but specific to kind of your, I guess, indexing there versus other parts of the country, can you give us some sense? And it sounds like that's driven some near-term demand, just the winter freeze and the fallout of that. But do you see kind of with pool backlogs and how busy dealers are that some of that's even having to push into 2022 for people that are needing to go to their pools in Texas and fix things or outright replace them?
John Stauch: Yes. I think it's fair to say that there's an industry capacity constraint in overall pool that we're always working to the dealers, the pool builders, the availability of that as it relates to the consumer demand. As far as Texas goes, we did get a little nearer term on some of the break and fix that happened in Q1, but most of that will also be satisfied here in Q2 in the normal course of shipments. What I also alluded to in -- that Texas was more related to material supply chain challenges, and many of the resins are produced in that area of the country. And those -- that capacity is coming back online. It's getting better every day, but that's what Bob was referencing as well. So with that net, I can't call Texas a win for either Q1 or Q2. And I think it just goes into the overall demand being a large pool state that we always serve.
Brian Lee: Okay. Fair enough. That's helpful. And then I guess, just a second question here and I'll pass it on. Clearly, we've seen a good housing market here. We've seen the new pool number steadily ticking up for the past several years, especially here recently. Can you give us a sense of -- I know you're heavily aftermarket-levered, but percent of new pool mix versus retrofit, how much has that changed here of late? And do you have kind of an expectation on that trend continuing to shift maybe a little bit toward new pool even through the balance of the year and into next year?
Robert Fishman: Yes. I can take that one. Our mix remains fairly constant: roughly 20%, new pool; 20%, remodel; and roughly 60%, aftermarket.
John Stauch: The new pools are definitely up large on a year-over-year basis, and we still see that trend continuing. But as an overall impact to the business, it's not as beneficial as continuing to build the aftermarket growth and the remodeling growth for us. That being said, every new pool that goes in, we want to convince those consumers and the pool dealers to put all the new content in and make those smart automated pools. And that adds to the aftermarket opportunity later as well.
Brian Lee: Alright. Thanks a lot, guys.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Mike Halloran with Baird.
Mike Halloran: Hey. Good morning, everyone.
John Stauch: Hey, Mike.
Mike Halloran: So just some questions on the guide here, the first one at least. Obviously, good answer to understand why 2Q may be a little bit more muted relative to what 1Q would imply from a pool perspective. But inventories, lean in the channel, I mean, how do you think that plays out through the balance of the year then? I mean it seems like you're implying that there's some pushouts into the second half of the year. Supply chain constraints are kind of rampant throughout the industry. Not like that demand goes away. So maybe just help with some of the cadencing and how you're thinking about the year and what all of these challenges can equate to as you move over the next few quarters, not just 2Q.
Robert Fishman: In terms of the year, when you look at the -- what we guided for in Q2 and what that implies for the back half, it has slight revenue growth over some pretty big compares. So business did well in the back half last year. So we're pleased to see growth. Can we do better? Potentially. For us, we're also focused on margin. And while we will win the price cost war, there are continuing to be an element of strategic growth investments in the back half that are putting a little bit of a impact on our overall margin expansion. We think it's money well spent that will benefit 2022 and beyond, primarily in the pool space, in the water treatment side, but that does have an effect on our overall margin expansion.
Mike Halloran: Just a point of clarification on the first part of that. Are you implying pretty normal sequentials from 2Q into the back half of the year on the pool side?
John Stauch: I think, Mike, we're -- the way I'd say it right now is we're still trying to catch up. I mean the inventory in the channel is relatively low. We've been catching up since last year. We made -- I think you could see that we probably met sell-through demand in Q1. And we've got to do our best in Q2, Q3 and Q4 to catch up with the demand in the channel as well as continue to rebuild those inventory levels.
Mike Halloran: Thanks for that. And then switching gears to a different part. The more cyclical parts of your business where you've had a few more headwinds, how are you thinking about the recovery curve where you sit here today? Obviously, prepared remarks imply that trends are starting to get a little better. Aren't seeing the bigger stuff yet, but at least we're starting to see some progress. Maybe just some thoughts on that cyclical progression and what level of optimism there is right now.
John Stauch: Yes. I think the biggest level of optimism we referenced is it's nice to see commercial filtration starting to at least move sequentially better. And I think we said for this particular full year, it's still not going to catch up to where it was, but it is good to see the openings and things starting to drive that commercial filtration space again. So that was encouraging in the quarter. We saw some sell-through better than Q4, and we think that continually sequentially gets better throughout the year. As far as Industrial & Flow, I think we saw more break and fix and certainly, the recovery of some of the break and fix in those spaces. But we also started to see quote activity, order activity and backlog start to really move sequentially, Mike. So I think those are definitely where I was referring to encouraging, and we weren't ready to call that earlier, and I think we're now saying that we're sequentially seeing ourselves come off the bottom in the IFT side.
Mike Halloran: Good stuff. Appreciate it. Have a good one.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
Steve Tusa: Hi, guys. Congrats on the execution in a kind of a challenging supply environment, I guess. Just first of all, what are you assuming for price for the year?
Robert Fishman: We should see an improvement in price to, call it, 2.5% to 3%. I think earlier in the year, we were probably down in the low 2s. So we are seeing a nice uptick there.
Steve Tusa: Okay. And when is the timing of that increase going in? Is there kind of a -- are there a couple of bites at the apple here? Or are you kind of one and done in the spring? Like what's the timing of the price increases?
John Stauch: Yes. Steve, I'll take the first part. I'll have Bob give you a little bit more of the details, but we've increased those prices across the board where we're going to. But we're still servicing some backlog on the old pricing that works its way through in Q2. So we don't expect to realize those price increases fully until Q3 and Q4.
Robert Fishman: Yes, I would agree with that. We'll start to see them, Steve, in Q3.
Steve Tusa: When are you putting it through, though? Like when would that guy -- when would the guys -- when would the [guide be in] the channel?
John Stauch: We already have put it through, Steve. But we're still -- people bought -- we're still servicing the backlog, the product that -- yes, we took orders at preprice increases, so we're still servicing that in Q2.
Steve Tusa: Okay. And then just on the second half, I mean, it kind of looks to me at the midpoint like you guys are just kind of flat across the board, right, like flat on sales, flat on profits. I mean actually, margins might kind of be a tick lower year-over-year. I mean with that kind of price coming through in the second half, I would think things would be better with that on the margin front. Or is that -- is there just a -- maybe just for the year, give us what the kind of price productivity -- you expect that to be neutral for the year, that kind of price productivity -- sorry, inflation productivity equation? Maybe just give us the annual, what you expect there [Indecipherable] inflation.
Robert Fishman: Yes. For the back half of the year, so the headwind we are facing is continued higher inflation. But when you look at what we've done with price and the productivity that we're seeing, we will offset the inflationary headwind. So really, what it comes down to is if the higher end of our guidance does show some revenue growth, but the margin expansion is really impacted by the strategic growth investments that we're making in the back half.
Steve Tusa: Got it. And then one just last one for you. I guess this kind of complexion of the second half, if you're going to be reasonably flat, the toughest comps are obviously in consumer. So if your business is flat, should we think about the IFT business as being up and consumer being down? Is that kind of the right profile for second half?
Robert Fishman: Yes. For the second half, overall, again, if you take the higher end of guidance, you will see our Consumer Solutions grow. And then IFT, as we mentioned, will grow in the back half and for the full year, which is good to see. The question, I think, we have right now is can we drive have a better back half. And so again, not wanting to get ahead of ourselves, we have the natural demand that continues in many of our businesses. So at this point, I think our guidance is very prudent on the top line. And the question is can we do better.
Steve Tusa: Yes, great. Thanks, guys. Appreciate the details.
John Stauch: Thank you, Stephen.
Operator: Your next question is from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.
John Stauch: Hey, Josh Pokrzywinski. Happy Earth Day.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Happy Earth Day, John. Thanks for taking the question. So I guess maybe just to start off here on the pool front. No surprise. Any way to talk about kind of what's happening under the surface with whether it's kind of replacement versus new or wallet share versus like-for-like as -- yes, 50% is a lot of growth. I can appreciate that the last year has been kind of a unique environment, and comps play into it as well. But at the end of the day, I don't know if we've seen that much more kind of utilization in breakage. In theory, the stuff is always kind of out there, spinning around somewhere. Yes, how much of the strength that you're seeing right now kind of speaks to that upsell of the pool pad that you guys have been talking about versus the volume side of the equation?
John Stauch: Yes. That's a good question, Josh. And it's mostly on the upgrades, candidly. I mean we've got two things happening. We've got the sale of homes in warm weather climates have done really well, right? So we've seen a change and a big push to get to warm weather climates. And I think people are not traveling as much and using their backyard more as their vacation destination spot so they become more aware. Without a doubt, and we shared this, we've seen a lot better penetration than we've ever seen before as people want to extend the season and make sure that their pool water is the temperature that they want. But where we've been excited is we've seen the upgrades around the energy-efficient lighting, the automation and also the self-chlorination and the self-saltwater capability. So the maintenance of the pool side is well, Josh. So it's been a really good situation because the more we made those consumers aware, the more they were able to expand the offering. And we think the more that expands, the more people talk about it, and I think we believe that's a trend that's going to sustain.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe a question or a toss-up between you and Bob on the supply chain element for 2Q. Might be a little hard to answer, but if you guys could get infinite supply, what is that worth? Like how much is that bottlenecking holding back near-term results?
John Stauch: Yes. So I think we'll tag team that one, Josh. I mean first of all, I just want to thank our supply team, and we've been doing everything we can to just, first and foremost, just try to access material -- and the raw materials that we need. And so I mean, I'm bringing that up because I think we're seeing two things happen. I mean we're doing everything we can to get the volume out. And we're not really spending time on negotiations as much as we're spending time on trying to get the available material, which leads into the inflation issues that Bob referenced earlier. And then Bob will give you the art of possible here.
Robert Fishman: Yes. Where we started with was the $866 million that we just did in Q1. And with the backlog we're seeing and the demand, the question is why couldn't we see that -- our top end of our guidance is closer to $830 million. So we really view it as in that space, the $30 million to $35 million as the art of the possible if the supply shortage weren't there. Now again, I'll echo John's comments and congratulate the supply team because two weeks ago, that number was double, and they're doing a nice job of improving the allocation that we're getting for those materials. So that's how I view it. Then on top of that is the inflationary headwinds that we're seeing in the second quarter.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Got it. That is awesome detail. Really appreciate the color there, guys.
Robert Fishman: Thanks, Josh.
Operator: Your next question is from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research.
Rob Wertheimer: Hey, good morning, everybody.
John Stauch: Hey, Rob.
Rob Wertheimer: So a lot of things went right in the quarter. I know managing through this isn't easy. I just wanted a little bit more breakdown on water treatment, which is growing nicely. I don't know if you can characterize or split resi and commercial stabilizing, you said, I think. And just whether you're on a sustainable path there on penetration, et cetera, just talk about the drivers there. Thank you.
John Stauch: Yes. I appreciate it, Rob. Thank you. I mean I think water treatment has been doing really well and also is residentially exposed. I would say our R&I flow business has also seen a nice pop on the IFT side relative to demand. And obviously, they're being overshadowed by the strength in pool and the success of pool. So it's great to talk about it, Rob. I mean I think we've got several things going on. We've definitely spent a lot of time upgrading our capability around our products to sell to the independent dealer channel. And people are more aware of the water in their home these days, and they're doing things to try to make it better, either to -- either for base reasons or trying to improve the overall benefits regarding their water. So we've got a lot of interest, and we've been expanding our portfolio to be more consumer-friendly. We've also, through the acquisitions that we purchased, through Pelican and RainSoft, have the direct access to the consumer through the affiliate channel and/or building out the services network ourselves. And so thank you for noticing that growth. We feel we're making great progress there, and we're excited. And that's why I'm excited about Ken's. I mean we just now put a services extension on top of our ability to sell products into the foodservice space, where we've always had a nice product offering. And that allows us to create end-to-end solutions, inclusive of the service and the ability to take care of the customer when the customer needs us to show up. So really building out that part of the portfolio, and we really like the momentum, and we're seeing the fruits of the work.
Rob Wertheimer: Great. Thank you so much.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jeff Hammond: Hey, guys. So a lot of moving pieces around inflation and supply chain investments. Can you just remind us how you're thinking about incrementals in Consumer Solutions before and how you're thinking about them now, kind of given all that, those moving pieces? Is it same, better or worse?
John Stauch: It's generally the same, Jeff. We're comfortable in that 35% drop-through, which we actually did in Q1. And it might vary a little bit based upon the price cost squeeze. And then the only thing that's different in the back half of the year is those accelerated investments as Bob mentioned. So that's it. And you might ask why is those investments delayed. It's not like we did anything differently. We're trying to get those people in place and the assets that we're at to, digital, IoT, smart connected solutions, I mean, those are tight labor markets with a lot of people chasing the same skill set. So it's just more of a timing issue to put them in. And then we're also expanding the markets that we're serving. And so that's the investments that we're really talking about in the back half of the year. We think about it as that 35% is drop-through, and then it's only muted by any incremental investment that Bob mention
Jeff Hammond: Okay. Great. And then it seems like the early buy shifted for the industry from 4Q to 1Q. Is that more a function of just the demand environment we're in today? Or do you think this is kind of a new paradigm or a new structure where you kind of persistently do the early buy a little bit later? And just on the $35 million, is that just shift into 3Q as you catch up?
John Stauch: The answer to the second one is yes. We're hopeful we catch up throughout the quarter. And if we're not, we're expecting that to be early Q3 when we get that supply chain. As Bob said, the supply chain issue is getting better every single day. It's just a matter of how we muted them or mitigated enough to be able to solve it by the end of Q2. As far as the early buy, I mean, just remind you, I mean, this is a seasonable business. It's not necessarily cyclical where we do the early buy in pool. And we're trying to manage our capacity levels. So we're not spiking our labor and then laying the labor off. So we work to trying to fulfill those labor outlets. And basically, when you get this type of demand, there really isn't room for that early buy because you're full out trying to meet the ongoing demand and you're working through that season, Jeff. So you're right. I mean it feels like it didn't necessarily happen, and I would just say that it didn't shift. It just got to the need to sell to the market need.
Jeff Hammond: Okay. Great. Thanks.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies.
Saree Boroditsky: Hi, good morning. So just a follow-up on Ken's. Could you provide us with some more detail? You said it's not built in to guidance, but maybe some color on the sales and margins in the business? You talked about the service benefit, but any other commentary on what you're excited about there?
John Stauch: Yes. I'll let Bob give you the details. I do want to say one more thing. I have had a partnership with Ken's for some time. And Ken is someone we admire in his ability to have worked with his customer set and built intimacy around real needs for foodservice customers and the projects and the services that he provides. And he's built this business over his career, and we're excited that he's going to come and partner with us and be a part of our team and help us expand this. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it's not just growing his service levels, which I think we can do. It's also about them having the insights as to what other products those customers need and expanding our offering beyond just our water treatment that we sell to those customers. So I'm really excited strategically. And some of the best deals take the longest to get to the finish line, and we're just really happy that he trusted us and he's willing to be part of the Pentair family. And Bob, do you want to give the...
Robert Fishman: Yes. We mentioned in the press release that we spent about $80 million or we'll be spending $80 million for Ken's. Think of that as about 1 times sales. And then from an EPS contribution perspective, it's -- in 2021, it's minimally accretive. We need to invest in the growth platform in that business. We really do believe it's foundational for bigger things in the future. So that's how we're thinking about Ken's contribution in 2021.
Saree Boroditsky: That's helpful. And then maybe you could just update us on what you're seeing on the foodservice side. We've obviously been hearing some pretty positive comments from the restaurant space as things have opened up. Thank you.
John Stauch: Yes. I mean the percentages seem exciting, right? And I just want to keep reminding us that we're not anywhere near where we were pre-pandemic levels. But sequentially, as things open up, we're seeing things definitely feel better. And I think sometime in the 2022 time frame, we expect to be back to where we were. While restaurants are opening across the United States, they're a little bit slower to open in Europe. They have been opening very rapidly in China. But we've not yet seen the hospitality play, and that's the one that we'd also like to see, the hotels opening to the levels that they were before. But sequentially, definitely better and working our way toward hopefully getting back to where we were sometime next year.
Saree Boroditsky: Perfect. Thanks for the call.
Operator: Your next question comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen.
Joe Giordano: Hello. Can you hear me? Can you hear me, guys?
John Stauch: Yes, we can.
Joe Giordano: So I just wanted to touch on industrial. I mean it's good to see backlog building, and you've made a lot of changes to that business over the last couple of years. Do you feel comfortable that throughout all of that, share is being maintained? Because I feel like just listening to other companies talk, it sounds like a little bit more like spending is coming back. So I know you guys are being cautious here, but just curious to how you feel about share maintenance as you transition that business.
John Stauch: Yes. So first of all, I'm really proud of Jerome and team for the discipline because, as I said many times, I mean, we could chase growth here with some of the lower-margin projects, and that's not what we want to do. We want to use our configure to order and specification capability to win projects that either meet our margin potential or provide the aftermarket opportunities that we want to invest in. So we're trying to be disciplined. And I don't want to say we're muting because we're focused, and there's a lot of growth to be had around our core capabilities and skill sets. And I think where we have the right to compete and the right to win, that's where we're focusing. And I think that's going to produce a better set of business opportunities for us that produce the margin profiles that we desire. We've seen these businesses that are more cyclical in nature come back really strong. And then all of a sudden, you get all these projects, and then your cost to serve gets higher than the actual quote. And that's not what we're doing here. These are projects that we feel confident with and comfortable with and that they meet our skill sets, and that will lead to the profitability profile, for one.
Joe Giordano: Yes. That's fair. Last for me. Just I think some of the deals you've done here seem interesting, very strategic and make a lot of sense for what you guys are trying to accomplish, fairly small. So when I look at your balance sheet, just curious to what your appetite is for larger M&A. And what's the target environment out there? Are there larger assets out there that kind of meet -- fit in with your strategic profile right now?
John Stauch: Maybe. I mean I think my focus has been and our team's focus has been that we've carved out some specific areas that we think we want to grow. And we think we've got the organic capability to really grow. Now we always have to trade the make versus buy, right? Are we better off doing it ourselves? Or are we better buying the capability needed? Sometimes you don't have the channel reach, sometimes you don't have the brand or the skill sets. When we look at our spaces, there isn't really a large one that we need, and there's not really a large one that's available. And so I kind of like the path we're on, and I'm hopeful that more of these start to accelerate and that they add to our capability but don't distract us from the strategy that we're embarking upon.
Joe Giordano: And so just a quick follow-on that. If that's like the -- yes, how comfortable are you like getting leverage down? Like do you -- at what point do we think about more aggressive buybacks just to kind of -- from a capital allocation standpoint?
John Stauch: Yes. I mean I think we're really pleased with the cash flow generation progress we've made. I think Bob mentioned in his prepared remarks, we had a couple -- we have bond maturing and we had a little bit of cash flow need, and we usually utilize cash in Q1. But given where we sit right now, I think we're committed to the buyback that we said we would this year. And I think that still gives us capacity to do any strategic bolt-on deals that become available in the near term.
Joe Giordano: Thanks, guys.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
John Stauch: Hey, Deane.
Deane Dray: Hey. I would love to get an update on the pool app soft launch that you talked about last quarter. What's been the receptive rate? How many installations? And is it really pulling through the products that -- at a rate that you were expecting?
John Stauch: Yes. So I mean, just to clarify, Deane, I mean, we've always had our pool ScreenLogic app that's been out there, and we're pleased with the progress on the pool side. And it's -- where we've launched that new app was on the water treatment side. And yes, we've got a couple of new exciting products. We got the under sink Easy Flow, and we've got the salt sensor that we've launched. And we feel good about those and the connectability. Growing pains? Yes, right? We're servicing a new customer, and we've got tweaks. I think the soft launch, I would describe as successful, but now we've got a little bit of work to do to make it the ultimate product that the consumer desires.
Deane Dray: Good to hear. And then how about new product introduction expectations for the year? I think you had talked about a number of new IoT products. Any updates there on launches? And any impact on 2021?
John Stauch: Yes. Deane, and I appreciate it. I mean I'm really excited about one in pool, and this might be where you were focused. We launched a side stream filtration product in a soft launch basis. So we're seeing amazing results as far as the clarity of the pool water by putting what was the CPT X-flow membranes on the side of a regular pool filter application. And that smart filter capability that we have in the soft launch applications has really demonstrated superior results. So that one, I'm really excited because that's a category that we haven't really seen new product introductions in pool for some period of time. And then on the Consumer Solutions side, it's really about connecting to that app that we mentioned around the smart product launches, the technologies. And then the most exciting one we have is this acquisition, Rocean, that we purchased and more of a countertop POU unit that will be launched either later this year or early next year.
Deane Dray: Great. And how about any sneak preview on format, topics for the upcoming analyst day?
John Stauch: Well, we're going to make you wait because we want you there on June 10. But I think you can expect that we're going to talk about the fact that we think we have great well-positioned businesses. I want to talk a little bit about the strategic growth investments we're making, Deane, and why do we feel good about these investments and show you a little bit of the progress along the way. I'm going to give you some insights on how I think the transformation office that we're leading and how that transformation can create value and help fund this organic growth. And then I'm probably going to share with you that we've got a strong balance sheet, as previously highlighted here, and give some indications of how do we use that balance sheet to create incremental value as well. So that's probably what we're going to talk about. And of course, no Investor Day would be fulsome without Dr. Phil sharing you with some sneak previews that were we're going to bring the technology at Pentair and why we're excited about the longer-term technology investments.
Deane Dray: Looking forward to it. Thank you.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Bryan Blair with Oppenheimer.
Bryan Blair: Hi, guys.Great start to the year.
John Stauch: Hi, Bry.
Robert Fishman: Hey, Bry.
Bryan Blair: I was hoping that you could parse out the core decline in commercial water treatment in the quarter and give us a sense of how the monthly sales cadence progressed through Q1.
John Stauch: Yes. I mean -- I don't know, Bob, if you have that exact. I mean we're still down single digits in Q1 in the commercial water treatment. I think we're expecting to be inching hopefully, I mean, we got an easier compare in Q2, candidly. I mean just to remind you that the Q1 impact last year was muted as far as COVID, and then this is our first year-over-year comparison. And Q2 is where commercial filtration took a deep, steep decline. So you're going to see a pretty nice growth rate for them in Q2, but it's nowhere near where the 2019 levels were, but getting better off at the Q1 run rate.
Bryan Blair: Okay. And just a level set on pro forma scale for commercial water treatment. As demand continues to normalize and get back to prepandemic, core volume then layering in KBI, is that two 75 plus at that point?
John Stauch: Regarding when you say two 75, you're talking about the actual commercial water treatment piece?
Bryan Blair: Yes, commercial water treatment revenue at that point.
John Stauch: Yes. I mean that's -- I'd say that's directionally correct, yes.
Bryan Blair: Okay. Excellent. Thank you.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.
Julian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. Maybe I just wanted to circle back to the investment spend. You've mentioned it a bunch of times. And you gave some good color about some of the areas those funds are being dispersed toward. But perhaps maybe just help me understand the scale of that investment spend in the second half. Or is it just a sort of toggling function to sort of solve for that incremental margin that you're looking for? That's what I wanted to sort of better understand. And whether that deferral of investment spend, is that pushing much into next year as well? Or do you think the catch-up this year gets you to the right level medium term?
John Stauch: Yes. So let me tell you where we're spending it and strategically why. So in pool, it's really around how do we be a destination site through our pool brands on the pad to bring you into Pentair, help you understand what's available and then connect you to our channel. So there's no desire to work around our channel. We want to go directly through our dealers and our distributors to continue to service you, but we want you to come and learn what's available to you to help pull demand. And that's where the investment has been going in pool as well as making sure that we've got a consumer services mindset around both services that you might need as well as making sure there's someone to answer the phone or chat with you upon your particular challenges and then connecting you with the dealer to solve that for you. And we've been steadily seeing more consumer inquiries into our service network than we've traditionally seen the dealer network. So we've had to augment that and build that up. In water treatment, it's about accelerating our residential services offering, building our brand and again, being more effortless to do business with, which you should read into as digitally transacting. And that's where those investments have been. And then on the IFT side, as we mentioned before, we believe we've got a nice biogas upgrading capability and sustainable gas. And we want to shift the investments to North America, which traditionally been on the European side. And we think that we've got a nice run rate ahead of us to grow that sustainable gas offering over the next several years. So that's where the investments are focused. And then obviously, one of those categories, we just filled in with the acquisition of Ken's, which was a buy investment platform instead of trying to do it on our own. And as far as the actual dollars, Bob?
Robert Fishman: Yes. Just to help you quantify that, on our last call, we talked about that spend being roughly 1% of revenue. We spent a little bit of that in the first quarter. But as John mentioned, it does ramp as we head toward the back of the year. So think about a little bit more in Q2, but the majority of that spend, in Q3 and Q4.
Julian Mitchell: I see. And then at that point, you're at the right level sort of medium term? Or does it go up again next year?
John Stauch: No. I think at that level, we would expect to see that more flatten from a year-over-year standpoint because then, we've jump-started these programs, got the right people in. And then we're in more of a percentage of sales basis.
Julian Mitchell: Thank you. And then just one quick follow-up. If I look at sort of across the multi-industry group, Colfax and another company announcing a sort of separation into two pieces fairly recently. Just wondered your latest thoughts on the portfolio, overlaps between the two divisions. Or is it more of the view that the synergies are there now that you're sort of three years as a stand-alone company? And when you sort of look around, that public peers like Hayward and so forth, there isn't kind of obvious value creation from any kind of separation anyway.
John Stauch: I understand the question. We get asked that all the time, but here's the way I look at it. We move -- we help you move, enjoy and improve your water. And the move side is the $1 billion on the IFT side that directly correlates with that phrase. And very important -- I mean, it's hard to produce any water application without moving the water through some type of pumping application. And we like our portfolio there. We have an opportunity to improve it, focus it and really expand the margins, which I'm comfortable that Jerome and team is working on. And then we've got a really nice set of industrial assets, and there is some cross-utilization. The membranes that we talk about on the industrial side are the membranes that are servicing this pool filter that I mentioned and also, hopefully, will be the foundation for our salt-free softener that we'll introduce in water treatment in the next several years. So I think there's cross -- a lot more cross synergies. I think with the IFT side, it's about focusing it, returning its ROS to historical levels and making sure that we're disciplined with where we grow and how we grow.
Julian Mitchell: That's good to hear. Thank you.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Scott Graham with Rosenblatt Securities.
Scott Graham: Hey. Good morning, John, Bob, Jim. Nice quarter.
Robert Fishman: Thanks, Scott.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Scott Graham: I wanted to maybe square for my mind what you're saying, maybe more specifically on price cost. I apologize for beating this up. But raw materials prices increased throughout the first quarter. So what we see in the first quarter for inflation of 240 basis points, I'm just thinking that, that number probably goes up from here. And you're saying, to Steve's question, pricing, plus 2.5% to 3% for the year, with the emphasis on the second half. And are you saying that price can offset raw materials inflation? Or are you saying that you need maybe a little bit of help from productivity?
John Stauch: We need price and productivity both to offset inflation for the full year. That's what we said. And in Q2, as you imagine, when you're catching up in the channels, we are -- most of your orders there are at pre new price levels, and that's what we're still fulfilling, and the material supply has risen pretty rapidly here from a cost perspective. Everything sold in Q3 and beyond carries a new price -- selling price with it. And therefore, we see more of a positive contribution in Q3 and Q4 than we see the headwind in Q2.
Scott Graham: Yes. Understood that. Thank you. So also the productivity jumped in the quarter. And I'm wondering, is that the G&A initiatives? Is there something more than that? And can you sustain that level?
Robert Fishman: It's really a combination of a number of things. I mean our OpEx spending from Q1 of the prior year had not come down. And so we're benefiting from the efficiencies that we drove in the last half of last year and into this year. We're also driving a lot more volume, and the team is doing a really good job to create leverage. But also a number of the issues from last year around expedites and inefficiencies as we ramped production lines were much better at driving that extra production. So it's really across the board that's driving that productivity benefit in Q1.
Scott Graham: Got it. Last question from me. With the large competitor's IPO, how do you think that changes things in the market? Obviously, they now have more resources, and they can get more resources on top of that. What are you thinking about Hayward going forward as a competitor?
John Stauch: I mean I think they're -- have always been a formidable competitor. And I think to your point, they may be a more formidable competitor. I think the way I look at it, Scott, is it works its way through the way we think about our transformation. And we have to treat our pool business as if it was this independent business that's got to compete every single day with the agility and the flexibility against a set of competitors. We can't slow it down. So we're really working with our pool leadership team, and Mario is doing this in Consumer Solutions to make sure they have what they need to continue to stay in front. And so we welcome the challenge. I think it's going to make us better. And you want strong competition because that generally makes you a better company. And I ultimately think this will certainly put a kick in our butt, and we'll start moving forward at a faster rate.
Scott Graham: Appreciate your responses, thanks.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Nathan Jones with Stifel
Adam Farley: Yes, good morning. This is Adam Farley on for.
John Stauch: Hey, Adam.
Adam Farley: Going back to the capacity and labor management within pool. Is this -- is there any permanent capacity additions? Or is it mainly just running additional shifts? And does the pool business require any additional investment to increase capacity?
Robert Fishman: It's a combination again of things. We've added second shifts. We've also increased the number of production lines, for example, in heaters, investments that we made last year, so to satisfy demand. Certainly, for the current year, we're in good shape to -- going forward, as we look out a couple of years, there would be some investment required.
Adam Farley: Okay. And then shifting over to I&FT. Within the industrial business, I think you called out some strength in short cycle, but could you provide some color on what specific end markets are seeing some improvement?
John Stauch: Yes. I mean I think simply put, our industrial, more capital-intensive businesses, that need that capital investment to spur the demand. So it's really more in the industrial side we're seeing a pop. And then we're seeing some movement in the infrastructure side on our -- in the commercial and industrial side of our flow business. Those will be the two areas that we're encouraged by the trends.
Adam Farley: Alright. Thanks for taking my questions.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. There are no additional questions at this time. I would like to turn it back over to John for closing remarks.
John Stauch: Thank you, Stephanie, and thank you for joining us today. We believe Pentair is in the right space for the future. We believe we have great well-positioned businesses. We are accelerating investments in focused, higher-growth, strategic priorities. This includes our leading pool business and our growing water treatment business. Transformation is important to us, and we believe that our focus on our transformation efforts will drive higher levels of accountability and performance. Transformation should help us better allocate our resources as well as drive longer-term margin expansion. Our balance sheet remains quite strong, and we believe this provides an additional lever of value creation. Thank you for your continued interest, and we look forward to sharing more of our story at our Investor Day on June 10. Stephanie, you can conclude the call.
Operator: [Operator Closing Remarks]

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-01-28 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Q4 2020 Pentair Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your speaker today, Mr. Jim Lucas. Thank you. Please go ahead.
James Lucas: Thanks, James, and welcome to Pentair's fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. We're glad you could join. I am Jim Lucas, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. With me today is John Stauch, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Fishman, our Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, we will provide details on our fourth quarter and full year 2020 performance, as well as our first quarter and full year 2021 outlook, as outlined in this morning's press release. Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties such as the risks outlined in Pentair's most recent Form 10-Q, Form 10-K and today's press release. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today, and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results. Today's webcast is accompanied by a presentation, which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Pentair's website. We will reference these slides throughout our prepared remarks. Any references to non-GAAP financials are reconciled in the appendix of the presentation. We will be sure to reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. I would like to please request that you limit your questions to one and a follow-up in order to ensure that everyone has an opportunity to ask their questions. I will now turn the call over to John.
John Stauch: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide number 4 titled Executive Summary. I would first like to say how proud I am of the entire Pentair organization and the contributions everyone made to help deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders in a uniquely challenging year. Our teams navigated this unprecedented environment and I believe that our company will emerge stronger as a result. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all of our global channel partners and suppliers for their patience and efforts in working with us and our consumers to meet our commitments despite the effects of the ongoing pandemic. We are pleased to deliver 2% sales growth and 5% adjusted EPS growth for the year. We generated over 500 million in free cash flow and we turned over $275 million to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks. While navigating these uncertain environment and making sure our employees and customers were safe as possible, we continue to invest in our top growth priorities through digital transformation, innovation and technology. During the year, we successfully launched both the Pentair Home and Pentair Dealer Apps. We also launched a brand redesigned the pentair.com website allowing for better cross-functional use and microsite enablement based on the feedback on how people want to interface with us. We also were able to fill out our management team by hiring Bob, as our new CFO; Mario as the new leader for Consumer Solutions; Steve, as our Chief Supply Chain Officer; and appointing Jerome Pedretti as our IFT segment leader. We have been busy building out capabilities throughout the organization, including adding over 100 IoT engineers in 2020 to drive connected solutions for consumers and for our OEM customers. We introduced new products like fresh point and easy flow in our residential POU category. Our connected solutions self sensor for installed water softeners advanced our leading sustainable gas solutions offering to recover and reuse methane and CO2, as well as introduced our beer assist digital services remotely optimized our beer membrane solutions. By the end of 2021 we expect to have over 20 new IoT products in the pipeline as we continue to move our Consumer Solutions platform to Smart Solutions. We also made great strides in advancing our ESG stewardship. Most recently importing, our General Counsel, Karla Robertson to the additional role of Chief Social Responsibility Officer. We recently completed a comprehensive ESG assessment to identify key topics of importance to our shareholders, customers, suppliers, employees and communities. We are planning to announce specific targets, including science based environmental targets in 2001 to further advance our social responsibility goals and progress. We have spent the past few years repositioning our portfolio and making investments to build out the Pentair brand and create a better experience for consumers to help solve their water treatment needs. While we benefited from a residential focused portfolio in 2020, we believe that the momentum will carry into 2021 and beyond. I would now like to turn the call over to Bob to discuss our performance and our financial results in more detail, after which I will provide an update on our overall strategic position.
Robert Fishman: Thank you, John. Please turn to Slide 5 labeled, Q4 2020 Pentair Performance. During the fourth quarter we delivered sales growth of 5% and core sales growth of 3%. On a core basis, Consumer Solutions was up 8%, while Industrial & Flow Technologies declined 3%. I will discuss the details for each segment on the subsequent slides. Segment income was flat while adjusted EPS increased 3%. Our tax rate was 14%, while net interest came in at $5 million. Price improved from the third quarter. Productivity did not read-out in the quarter due to the fact that we paid bonuses this year and we continue to see some of our facilities disrupted with higher absenteeism due to COVID. Please turn to Slide 6 labeled Full Year 2020 Pentair Performance. Given the unusual timing of 2020 by quarter we thought it would be helpful to look at the full year results to better appreciate the progress we were able to make in these challenging times. For the full year, core sales increased 1%, with Consumer Solutions growing 7% and Industrial & Flow Technologies declining 6%. Segment income was flat for the year, while adjusted EPS grew 5%. Price and productivity mostly offset inflation. But as we highlighted in the third quarter, the robust growth in pool led to higher-than-usual rebate activity that lowered price. We expect price and productivity to offset inflation going forward. Given the challenges that we faced in 2020, we were very pleased to deliver overall growth while still investing for the future. Please turn to Slide 7, labeled Q4 2020 Consumer Solutions performance. Momentum for Consumer Solutions in the third quarter carried over into the fourth quarter. For the quarter, sales grew 10%, segment income increased 9%, and return on sales was essentially flat. Considering the challenges the team faced in the first half of the year, the fourth quarter performance was a strong close to a remarkable year, and we believe validation for the growth prospects of the segment's portfolio of businesses. Pool experienced tremendous growth of 15% in the fourth quarter and slightly above that for the full year. The total pool industry received significant tailwinds from the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced consumers to stay at home and increase their desire to invest in their backyards. This trend has continued into 2021 as demand for new pools and pool maintenance remains strong. We believe the business enters 2021 with strong momentum. While the market dynamics assisted in the growth of the pool business, this could not have been achieved had there not been previous focus on increasing dealers and driving new products into the industry. That strategy allowed pool to reap the benefit of the remarkable growth in 2020. This past year, we spent time building the foundation of data analytics, specifically around the performance of dealers and channels. This advancement allows leaders in the business to better dissect the areas where the business is winning and where there are opportunities to improve. Specific plans are being developed down to the individual dealer to accelerate growth in core product areas. The data shows there is still growth potential in the core, even though the business has seen significant historical growth. Water treatment grew 4% in the quarter, with strong residential growth being offset by continued weakness in commercial. In particular, we saw the second consecutive quarter of growth in China, which we believe is a positive sign that the markets hit earliest by the pandemic have stabilized and are showing potential signs of a sustained recovery. Residential components posted high single-digit growth with strength in all geographies and product lines. We saw very strong growth in our key valves product line, which is a positive indicator for overall industry growth. We launched the flat connected valve during the quarter and are seeing early signs of market acceptance. We believe the overall North American industry as well as Europe continues to benefit from consumer focus on in-home water quality. Our residential systems and services businesses both delivered strong double-digit growth as our investments to build out these businesses are beginning to read through. We had two new product launches during the quarter: our salt level sensor and the FreshPoint Easy Flow point-of-use filtration system for existing faucets. In addition, we recently announced the acquisition of Rocean, which builds out our point-of-use product offering and complements our already strong point-of-entry portfolio. Equally important, we believe Rocean's product offerings allow Pentair to participate in an even more meaningful way to help tackle the growing challenge of single-use plastic bottled water and its impact on the environment. Our commercial systems business was down low double digits in the quarter, but this was an improvement from the third quarter performance and the sharp drop off we experienced in the second quarter when many of our customers were forced to close due to shelter-in-place requirements. While our sales in this profitable product line have been down for three consecutive quarters, we are mildly encouraged that we have been outperforming the market. We attribute this in part to our strong cartridge replacements, mix of business and also finding new business opportunities, such as our total water management program we discussed last quarter. While we have one more tough comparison in the first quarter, we expect commercial systems to continue its recovery in 2021. Please turn to Slide 8, labeled Q4 2020 Industrial & Flow Technologies performance. Industrial & Flow Technologies, or IFT, saw sales decline 1% as residential and irrigation flow delivered double-digit growth in the quarter, while the other two businesses continued to be negatively impacted by a global freeze in capital spending. Segment income decreased 22%, and return on sales declined 280 basis points to 10.6%. Productivity was challenged in the quarter, principally as a function of a mix with lower margin backlog in addition to lower revenue spread across a higher fixed cost base. IFT has also begun some notable activities aimed at reducing complexity and reducing costs, which include the discontinuation of several product lines. Residential and irrigation flow grew 12% in the quarter, following 6% growth last quarter. This business normally does not experience strong demand in the fourth quarter, but similar to our other residential facing businesses and consumer solutions, there was broad-based demand for residential and irrigation following the slowdown in demand experienced during the second quarter. We saw all product lines contribute to the strong fourth quarter performance, and we remain cautiously optimistic entering 2021 given channel inventory levels are still slightly below historical levels. Commercial and Infrastructure flow declined 9% in the quarter as the business continues to experience soft demand. The business has begun to focus more intently on complexity reduction resulting in the decision to exit several product lines. The focus within C&I remains on improving operational efficiencies, in addition to building up the backlog with higher-margin business. Industrial filtration continued to be negatively impacted by a global capital spending freeze as seen in the 8% sales decline in the quarter. In addition to the broader capital spending freeze, many of our industrial customers have been negatively impacted due to worldwide COVID-related lockdowns. We are seeing sequential improvements, and we are starting to see some modest increases in orders exiting the quarter, resulting in an increased backlog. Encouragingly, we have begun to see an increase in orders for our sustainable gas solutions business. Please turn to Slide 9, labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. One of the biggest positive developments in 2020 was the prodigious cash flow generation we experienced. For the full year, we generated $512 million of free cash flow, which was well north of 100% conversion for the year. One of the biggest contributors to our strong free cash flow was the linearity of pool sales in the second half and a minimal amount of early buy in the fourth quarter. This resulted in a dramatic year-over-year improvement in receivables collection. We also showed further strengthening of the balance sheet, ending the year at 1.3 times levered and the majority of our revolver available. During the year, we returned over $275 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Last December, we announced that our Board authorized a new $750 million share repurchase authorization as there was only $100 million remaining under our prior authorization. In addition, the Board approved a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend to be paid in the first quarter. 2020 marks the 45th consecutive year that Pentair has increased its annual dividend. Our balance sheet remains in excellent shape to fund both organic and inorganic opportunities. And as always, we plan to remain disciplined with our capital. Please turn to Slide 10, labeled Q1 and Full Year 2021 Pentair Outlook. We are initiating first quarter and full year 2020 guidance. For the first quarter, we expect sales to grow 7% to 12% and adjusted EPS to increase 6% to 21% to a range of $0.55 to $0.63. March is historically an important month for the quarter, and we are still managing through sporadic and isolated COVID-related disruptions due to the recent global spike in infection rates and are doing our best to ensure the safety of all of our employees. Below the operating line, we expect corporate expense to be approximately $16 million, net interest of $6 million to $7 million, a 15% tax rate and a share count of around 168 million. For the full year, we expect sales to grow 3% to 5% and adjusted EPS to increase 5% to 10% to a range of $2.60 to $2.75. We recognize that our first half has easier comparisons that become more challenged in the second half. However, we expect continued demand in our larger residential focused businesses and remain cautiously optimistic for our commercial water treatment business to show improvements throughout the year. We remain focused on investing in our most attractive businesses. Below the operating line, we expect corporate expense to be around $65 million, net interest to be in a range of $20 million to $23 million, our tax rate to be around 15%, and the share count is expected to average near 166 million shares for the full year. Capital expenditures are expected to be around $65 million, while depreciation and amortization is expected to be around $80 million. We continue to target free cash flow to be greater than or equal to net income. I'd now like to turn the call back to John to provide an update on some of our key strategies.
John Stauch: Thank you, Bob. Please turn to Slide 11, labeled 2021 Execution Expectations. Our focus for 2021 does not change from last year as we are focused on delivering on our core while continuing to build out our future. As we enter 2021, our residential businesses remain strong, and we are encouraged to see ongoing signs of stabilization in our commercial businesses. Although we have not yet seen indicators of year-over-year growth, we are expecting recovery likely in the tail end of 2021. We believe that our smaller exposure to industrial capital spending will remain hindered for now. We have a long successful history of price realization across the majority of our portfolio. We will monitor closely the rapidly evolving inflation environment and respond accordingly. We are also pacing our growth investments and have the ability to modulate as needed, but we prefer to remain on offense and build on the momentum of the past two years. We recognize that we have opportunities to address our cost structure, particularly within IFT, and we plan to act as appropriate. We discussed last year the G&A benchmarking efforts we undertook and identified that we have room for improvement. We are well underway in terms of our G&A efforts and are looking closely at our overall global enablement structure. Our goal is to deliver transformation plans that we expect will drive significant ROS expansion by 2024 while funding our strategic growth initiatives. As we look to the future, our priorities are unchanged around growing both our pool and water treatment businesses. We have identified growing interest in our sustainable gas solutions business. I look forward to updating all of you in the future as we believe this business has exciting growth opportunities ahead. We believe that pool has a long runway of continued growth. The Department of Energy regulation going into effect in mid-2021 is shifting the industry even further toward variable speed pumps, which is a category we helped to create over a decade ago. Today, nearly 60% of the pumps we sell are variable speed, while the industry adoption rate is closer to 50%. Over the next two years, we expect the industry, including us, to move closer to 85% as it is expected that there will still be certain parts of the industry that will be able to use single speed pumps. We also continue to invest in our automation platform for pool and see strong adoption of our new offerings. In addition, despite being a leading brand in the U.S. on the pool pad, when a consumer contacts us directly on pentair.com, it has not been the best experience for the consumer. We believe that there's a tremendous opportunity of engaging the consumer and curating their experience through our existing channel while also ensuring that the consumer received the experience that they desired. Within water treatment, we believe there are opportunities to rapidly expand our $50 million end-to-end residential services business and to be the leader in advanced technology and connected solutions and residential point-of-use solutions through our existing technology and the acquisition of Rocean. We also have a leading commercial foodservice offering that we look to expand into other segments as well as add important services for our customers. In sustainable gas, it is merely focusing on our high-growth segment within Industrial and adding global capability to accelerate our offerings. Finally, I wanted to touch on our approach to capital allocation, which remains unchanged. Our top priority is our commitment to our investment-grade rating. Our strong cash flows allow us to invest in our top organic growth opportunities. From an M&A perspective, we remain focused on strategic bolt-on and tuck-in deals and focused strategic priorities, like I just shared with you. While M&A valuations remain elevated, we continue to actively build our deal pipeline and plan to remain disciplined. Finally, we are committed to returning cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and opportunistic buybacks. We believe that Pentair has a bright outlook, and we will continue to invest for the future while delivering on our core business. Our goal remains to deliver more consistent, predictable results for our customers, the environment, our employees, and our shareholders. I would now like to turn the call over to James for Q&A, after which I will have a few closing remarks. James, please open the line for questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Baird. Go ahead please. Your line is open.
Mike Halloran: So couple things here first, can you just help I also had a couple comments that Bob made on a whole and how that tracks for this year around inflation price cost? The commentary was price cost positive expectations this year, but not a lot of channel-fill even though there were some rebates last year inflation kind of hits you in the fourth quarter a little bit? And just give some context on how you think that balances out through the year and then what the pricing environment looks like for you as we sit here today?
John Stauch: I'll take the first part, I'll have Bob comment the second. It still like 18 I think inflation wise where we're seeing a lot of the commodities that we buy, hitting record levels, right. I mean if you think about its simple context just take a pump. The copper goes into a motor, gets wound copper is up it goes into a metal housing. Metal is at all time highs and that goes into a corrugated box that gets shipped to a customer right. All three of those are seeing record inflation levels primarily being driven by what we think is a spike the China recovery and demand, Mike. So I think inflation is high. I think as we enter this guidance and look at next year. We think we're balanced between the price, we think we can realize from the channel and where we are on the inflation pressures as we head into next year. If we need to do more, I think there is an opportunity to do so. Because I think the inflation that's hitting us will also impact the whole entire industry. Bob I don't know if you want to add anything.
Robert Fishman: I'll just add that price was challenged in Q3 and Q4, we did see higher rebates that miss that masks some of that price gains and the planning assumptions for the year or that price and productivity offset inflation. And then to John's point as circumstances change we will need to work on the different levers that are at our disposal.
Mike Halloran: That makes lot of sense. And then maybe just talk a little bit about the supply chain on the pool side? How you’re thinking about visibility as we go into the front part of the year backlog levels channel fill, things like that and any reason to think that whether besides that a normal sequential pattern is a reasonable thought process moving through the year?
John Stauch: No, I mean I think you're thinking about the right way. I think we've got our supply chain in our plant capacity to a level. Now we're shipping at rates that are helping us catch up in a more rapid pace and clearly the demand remains strong. But we're able to meet that demand. And I think right now, pending any other COVID disruptions which we're hopeful we're getting through most of those, we feel good that your assumptions are accurate, Mike.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Go ahead please. Your line is open.
Andrew Kaplowitz: John, Bob you’ve obviously - can you talk about the significant leadership change at the company. We know you've got a plan to get G&A out as do you think about 2021 maybe sort of talk about what's in the guidance. And it's interesting you talked about maybe getting out of several product lines and C&I and industrial filtration. So, how much could sort of the productivity in the self-help help you in terms of your margin in 2021?
Robert Fishman: Yes, so Andy I don't think we've made any decisions to exit any parts of our portfolio. I think we've got certainly areas of the portfolio that can do better. But when I step back and we looked at the G&A transformation, I believe it's more than a G&A transformation. I think what we learned for 2020 the way we sell globally, the way we interact with our customers a lot of the virtual capability that was brought in and how we work with our channel partners. The demand to have a more consumer-enabled and have that be an effortless process through ordering on the Internet that's a shift. And we think we have an opportunity to take a look at our global cost structure and to think about where we should put the work. And where is the right person doing the right work at. And there is an opportunity across the portfolio to drive significant margin expansion for that same in operations and sourcing. I mean we have factories that are at record capacity levels and we have other factories that are under capacitized right now. So all of that is and what we are going to have transformation plan. In 2021, I think it’s more planning the efforts to get after it and then I think we're confident in 2022 and beyond. We start to realize the benefits of all those effort.
Andrew Kaplowitz: And then I think you mentioned some improvement in orders within industrial filtration and turning backlog. So have you seen in general your customers start to revisit their budgets, you talked about still tough environment in capital spending, but maybe is that starting to turn you mentioned China, couple quarters in a row - a little bit better there. So in general, what are you seeing in some of those CapEx businesses?
Robert Fishman: Yes, so what we saw in 2020 for many of those businesses were down double-digits. And so the good news as we look into the 2021 plan is those businesses we're planning to be roughly flat. So stabilization for those businesses some growing backlog in certain cases and some signs of increased demand. So I would consider 2021 is being a stabilization year and potentially some upside if things improve.
Andrew Kaplowitz: Thanks guys.
Robert Fishman: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Go ahead please. Your line is open.
Steve Tusa: Good. So - throughout 2018 I mean, I'm not sure that was like that memorable year for your stock. And I think that there was some difference in the timing of seeing that inflation, if I recall, I mean you guys got I think like a point of price back then. But then in 2019 you obviously got a lot more price and I think the realization of the inflation kind of hit you mid season in 2018. So maybe just talk about like the differences in timing between now in 2018? Because it seems to be kind of like a slow moving train that you can see from a mile away and perhaps react to it. And then what are you assuming for price, are you assuming a point, are you assuming 1.5 like what, what exactly is the kind of price assumption in the numbers?
John Stauch: Yes, so first of all, Steve thank you for letting me clarify them - not looking for 2018 stock performance efforts, but if you recall 2018 started to experience significant tariffs that were put into place. And we made some decisions there to weigh it out and to go on cycle with a lot of our price increases. In retrospect I think we learned that might end up in the right playbook to use. What I was referring to is the 2018 levels of inflation feel like that. And I do think we're out in front of the price increases because it was a slow moving train. What I'm also saying that if we need to do more, we would do more Steve. Because I don't think we want to take that position again that we did throughout the 2018, which may despite catch up all year long if you recall.
Steve Tusa: Right and so, what is the price assumption?
John Stauch: And so for the question, again, the price and productivity offsetting inflation the assumption for prices back to the historical levels of around two points.
Steve Tusa: Two points, okay got it. I mean in 2019 you guys got I think like 2.5% of price. So I mean this is not that level is not, certainly not unprecedented in an inflationary time, am I correct?
John Stauch: No, it’s more normalized and I think when you look at 2018 and 2019 together it felt more normalized, but it was very disruptive from timing perspective as you mentioned.
Steve Tusa: Yes, okay that makes lot of sense. And then just lastly on this variable speed transition, how are you embedding that in guidance. And what are you assuming for, just remind us of kind of like what the profile is on that as you know every point of that conversion goes to variable speed kind of what that does from a revenue per unit and margin perspective?
Robert Fishman: Yes, so I mean - think about it is maybe 1.5 times the product price or sales price. Steve, when we sell at variable speed versus when we sell a single speed and not that the margins any better, but the margin dollars are much better. I think it's a slower conversion. I think we did made progress picked up about five points in the last couple quarters. And as we mentioned moving from 60.85 I think more of that is towards the tail end of 2021 and into 2022. As the channel reacts and begins to buy that for us, but I do think that's out there is a nice transition that will benefit us and its energy efficiency to. And so these are better pumps they last longer. I think is better value for all the customers that buy them.
Steve Tusa: One last question for you just on balance sheet, you guys are now at 1.3 times you’ve clearly, you're generating very strong free cash flow in a downturn like kind of eye-popping strong there. So clearly, you can kind of defend yourselves when volumes go down, and when you have a volatile environment? Another residential name like Linux is trading at a substantial premium to you guys, they have bought back basically 30% of the earnings growth in the last five years has been driven by buyback. And they do it in kind of a programmatic way. Why would this kind of free cash flow yield and with your balance sheet you could buy back 20% of the float programmatically over the next two to three years? Why not - be more aggressive on the buyback side. I mean what are you waiting for to come along on acquisitions to not at least be more aggressive in programmatic about the buyback given how cheap your stock is?
John Stauch: Well, I think we certainly have options, Steve. And I think we're going to look at all those options to create the best return. Right now, I think we are actively looking in the three areas I said within the M&A side, but those M&A deals are going to have, to have the right returns to be able to lean into them. And if we feel the stock is a better purchase, we'll make the deal on the stock. So I think we've got flexibility, and we're going to continue to maintain that flexibility. And I feel confident we're going to choose the right one that adds most value over time.
Robert Fishman: At this point, we have $150 million of share buyback built into the forecast, and so our typical starting point for the year. And then to continue to be opportunistic based on the circumstances.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen. Go ahead please. Your line is open.
Joe Giordano: We kind of touched around this a lot with the transition to variable speed. But how do you think about like the cadence of the year? Do you - is there maybe more of like a pre-buy than seasonal? Is there more like activity in the 2Q than like - than seasonal because of like a pre-buy ahead of a regulatory change? And does 3Q kind of see the offset to that? Is there maybe a little bit of like a shift in the order patterns this year?
John Stauch: Yes. Q2 and Q3 would be the heat of the pool season for our customers. And yes, we would expect to make significant progress during that time frame. I'm just cautioning, even though there's regulations that go in mid-season, I just don't think we're going to go all the way to the end point this year. And I think it's going to be opportunities for people to work through existing inventory supplies and work through the channel. We're spending all of our marketing efforts, helping people convince that - trying to convince the end consumer that now is the time to buy the better product. And so I think we're going to make progress, as you said, in the pool season. And I think the tail of that will fall into next year's pool season.
Robert Fishman: I'd say the good news from my perspective is, you know, built into our guidance of up 3% to 5% is a pool business that's growing roughly mid-single-digit-plus after a year where pool saw 17% growth. So the natural demand continues. Could it be better? Potentially. But not a bad place to be after seeing such significant growth in 2020.
Joe Giordano: Yes. Certainly not. And Bob, just on the tax rate, if we move into an environment where the U.S., U.S. tax law changes, how protected are you given your domicile? How protected do you think the overall rate is?
Robert Fishman: We would - We would see a little bit of headwind in that situation, but significantly less than our competitors would see. So overall, we like our tax profile.
Joe Giordano: Perfect. And then last for me. Just, John, you talked about sustainable gas a lot over the last couple of quarters that's something you're focused on. Can you scope that out a little bit, like what exactly are you selling into that market? How large is the business for you now? And where you think that can go?
John Stauch: Yes. So real quickly, we benefit from significant demand in Europe because Europe has really leaned into the environmental impact a lot stronger than we have in the United States. And most of our customers are in the beverage industries or the processing industries. And there's an opportunity to capture the off gases and turn them back into either energy, which produces value for them or to throwing them back into the process in the form of food-grade CO2. So it's a business that has substantial legs to it. What we're starting to see is an environmental movement globally. And certainly, our current administration is leaning in to try to do things that are going to help our greenhouse gases over time. So we see an opportunity outside of Europe now, and we want to make sure we've got the sales force, the engineering capability and move more to a standard product offering that's more of a plug-and-play with global partners that can help promote what we do. So we're very encouraged by the order trends and the projects that we've received outside of the traditional spaces. And that gives us excitement that with just a little bit more investment, we can certainly accelerate the outcomes.
Joe Giordano: How big is that business now for you?
John Stauch: Roughly $90 million in total.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Go ahead please. Your line is open.
Deane Dray: Can we get an update on the launch of the Home and Dealer apps for pool? You know, any color in terms of how many users, the level of engagement, are you seeing online ordering? Any updates would be appreciated.
John Stauch: Yes. I appreciate that, Deane. There's soft launches on both, and we moved to more hard launches here as we head into Q2. So the experience rate has been good without giving the actual quantification numbers. And really, what you need is the app, and then you need some smart products to connect to it, which is why we're spending time promoting the salt sensor and also the Easy Flow under sink application, as well as other POU units that we expect come from the Rocean acquisition, combined with our technology team. So the app is designed to do two things. It's to provide a better consumer experience, to be able to understand salt sensor levels retroactively on installed base. The new valve connects to it on pre-installs. And then it also gives you an understanding of what's coming through your water and your flow rates and your - you need to change your filters. But the more exciting aspect is connecting with dealers. So when a, an end consumer needs a service on any product they have or they're interested in learning more, we would have our dealers in that app as well and be able to connect the consumer with the dealer to help curate the experience for the individual. So very excited about the early stages of that, and its connection to Alexa, connection to Google Home, connection to Apple Home, all those other features. And so we're very excited, Deane.
Deane Dray: Great to hear. So we'll be watching that for the full launch. And then second question is, could you provide some more color on that growth you're seeing in China? You said the second quarter of growth. How does that look for the commercial side versus the residential side?
John Stauch: Yes. So candidly, residential is up more significantly. I mean commercial is back in China, but they're still experiencing a little lesser demand on the openings of restaurants and stores as people are still cautious about the pandemic. So they're back and they're open, and it's growing. But it's not growing at the same rate that the residential water filtration is growing at this stage, Deane.
Deane Dray: And then just the last one for me. Can you comment on the product lines that you exited in commercial. Just any color there, especially on the - if you could size it.
John Stauch: Yes. These are really small products...
Robert Fishman: Yes, those were small product lines. And just an example of us reducing complexity and driving cost out, but again, small product lines in terms of the C&I portfolio.
John Stauch: SKU reductions more than anything, Deane.
Deane Dray: That's good to hear. I appreciate that. I mean it's - it's walking away from unprofitable businesses. It's always the right decision. So I like seeing that. Thanks.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies. Go ahead please. Your line is open.
Saree Boroditsky: Thanks for taking my question. Could you update us on what you're seeing on the foodservice side? And should you start to see that improve as more restaurants open and need to change their cartridges?
John Stauch: Yes. So I'll take the first part, and Bob will give you the second. Yes, we saw a steep decline, significant double-digit decline in Q2 when the pandemic hit. And we've seen a modest recovery off of that deep decline into Q3 and in Q4. We're sort of in that flattish range now. And that basically has restaurants open at roughly half capacity or quarter capacity depending on where they're living. The piece that we have not yet seen the recovery on is really the hospitality side of the hotel industry. And we're expecting that, as we said in our prepared comments, probably to the tail end of 2021. That would be a really big help to that business. The, obviously, replacement of cartridges are continuing, probably at a slower rate because the usage is slightly slower. And our portfolio is skewed more to some of the faster service and to the drive-through coffee shops. So we do get a little bit better than the overall restaurant average.
Saree Boroditsky: Then you talked about opportunities to lower G&A spending by, I think, 150 to 200 basis points over time. Could you talk through any improvements you're looking for in 2021? And then what's driving that improvement?
John Stauch: Yes. We're going to get a little bit of leverage in 2021. That's about it, keeping the existing cost base and growing on top of it. What we're really looking to do is, how do we think of our centers of excellence and where do they best serve the business unit, the segment and the enterprise. Within that construct, how do we get the best resources, the point of impact. And that's globally, right? I mean we've all learned that some of our people are now able to work virtually or work from home. And we don't need all - the necessarily facilities we have. But at the same time, we want to create workspaces and collaboration centers for our businesses to work with customers and work with dealers on. So with this is going to be a fairly sizable transformation. I think in 2021 as I said not expecting a lot other than the planning elements of this. And then we expect significant contributions in 2022 and beyond, beyond G&A even as the sales and marketing resources also get more effective and efficient.
Robert Fishman: Yes and I would just add, we're really rallying around that theme of right work in the right place. And to John's point where should that work to be done closest to the customer at the product line, is it at the business unit level, the segment or the enterprise and then what is that work. So if I pick my own area of FP&A as an example I have big businesses like pool that probably drive their own kind of FP&A piece. But then I have other businesses that would benefit from an efficiency and effectiveness perspective of having a shared approach or center of excellence approach, it goes to data analytics as well. So those are the types of things that we're thinking through.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Go ahead please. Your line is open.
Julian Mitchell: Maybe just a first question on the assumptions and the guidance for the pool business, some of the consumer-facing businesses we cover guiding for double-digit declines in the second half. Heard your guidance about mid-single for the year for pool, but maybe help us understand first half versus second half dynamics?
Robert Fishman: Yes, I'll take that one and then, John if you want to add. It was important for us to specify mid single-digit plus as our guidance for the pool business embedded in our overall guidance. We continue to see strong momentum as we enter the first quarter, a good natural demand. So as the year plays out, we expect obviously stronger growth as we have a weaker comparison in the first half, but still strong business in the back half as we bump up against those bigger compare. So overall, I think we're optimistic about the growth in the pool business and that will certainly help free cash flow as well.
Julian Mitchell: But are you assuming the pool business is up or flat or down in the second half year-on-year?
Robert Fishman: Right now, we would say that we're at high historic levels, but generally flattish to modestly down in Q3 and Q4. That's at the mid-single digit level, if we get that mid-single digit plus, we would expect that we could be producing modest growth in the back half of the year. I think the more important piece that we want to make sure we convey is. Our quarters last year represented a softer Q2 as the orders came through the distribution channel. We were not yet producing those. So we had pretty sizable Q3 and Q4 as we're catching up and this year, if you think about the demand and the way we're meeting in Q1 and Q2 will have stronger year-over-year comparisons there. As we assess where the market is going, as we start to think beyond this pool year and the next pool year we'll have a better understanding as we exit Q2 what the back half of the year looks like.
Julian Mitchell: Thank you. And then my follow-up would just be around the segment margin assumptions. So it looks like segment margins might be up a few 10s of basis points this year. Maybe just help clarify that. And then also, again how do we think about the first half versus second half in terms of the margin expansion potential? Understand the volume leverage is a bigger tailwind in the first half and in the second half, because of the comp, but maybe give us any color around the inflation headwind and how that's falling first half versus second half?
Robert Fishman: Yes Julian I promise the first part of my answer here is not to filibuster. But I want to make sure we describe that one of the reasons we're setting up these three strategic growth investments two are in Consumer Solutions and one is in IFT. It’s really a disproportionately fund those with investments to drive the future. What we're going to do a better job on this sharing with you as we go forward is the value of the core. Meaning - to take a look at the core performance absent those incremental investments, we're getting the drop through as you would expect. We're getting the price and productivity offset inflation. The volumes coming through - a nice flow-through rate and then we're taking the opportunity to build out a services organization and residential in Consumer Solutions build out the front-end capability in pool. And then also make sure we put the investment ahead of the likely growth opportunities in SGS and there is pretty substantial investment there in those three things which drawdown those margins for both of those two segments. Absent that, I think we're pretty balanced then more normal year. And so, we'll do a better job highlighting throughout 2021 how we're doing in the core and then how these investments are starting to roll through.
Julian Mitchell: There is no rest of the question.
Robert Fishman: Was there a second part to the question?
Julian Mitchell: I guess it was really around that - is the margin expansion sort of steady through the year or do you see a bigger first half increase because of volume leverage and then the second half sort of rolls over because of the top-line comp and more inflation coming in?
Robert Fishman: Yes.
Julian Mitchell: That was really…?
Robert Fishman: Just I would say yes you're right, it's more in the first half and its lesser contribution in the second half, because of the - not so much the inflation, but the investments.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Go ahead please. Your line is open.
Jeff Hammond: I think you mentioned the supply chain stabilizing from your standpoint in pools. Can you just talk about where do you see inventory levels in the channel, is there is still need for destock or restock sorry?
John Stauch: Yes, we're catching up and yes.
Jeff Hammond: Okay. And then just on the first quarter guidance, can you maybe give us a little more color about how you're thinking in either the segments or some of the businesses that are driving that higher growth rate?
John Stauch: Yes, the guidance we gave was that 7% to 12%. And so again think of Consumer Solutions with pool driving significant growth in Q1 and think of the - IFT business has been roughly flat in those numbers.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Go ahead please. Your line is open.
Nathan Jones: I'm going to follow-up here on some of the strategic investments that you're talking about - they're starting to make I guess ramping up in the second half. Can you give us any color on kind of what the incremental level of increased investment is in 2021? And how you're planning for that to, I don't know whether it increases in 2022 in 2023. Are we continuing to ramp up the level of investment, when do you think we kind of we'll hit a plateau and maybe that becomes less of a drag on the margin increases?
John Stauch: Yes, I'll start with the investments that we see 2021 to 2020 that we want to make is more than a point of overall Pentair revenue kind of frame that out a little bit, Nathan. This is uniquely different capability than we have today. This is about building out our water treatment brand that people recognize so that they can come in and work with Pentair to help curate their water experience. This is about customer experience capability more consumer-related, so that we can quickly get consumers the dealer help and/or the technical support that they need to fix their particular challenges. So it's capability we don't have today. It's capability we think will add a lot of value. And then, and also it's about pretty more trucks on the road as far as the services in residential. The paybacks are enormous from an IRR perspective of a two year intervals. But the breakeven point is roughly a year when you put the sales team in place and you put the dealers in a geography and you wait for the return on the accrual of the annuity base there. So that's the type of investment we're making and we pace it a little bit more in 2020 then we would have liked. And we really want to accelerate it if we can here in 2021. And so, it can be modulated but that's an example of what it is and the likely levels a bit.
Robert Fishman: And for all of these investments what we're building strong business cases and return on investments, holding the teams accountable, because it's a significant investment for us and we want to make sure we get the type of numbers John just talked about in terms of return.
Nathan Jones: And if you don't need to modulate those investments we get back to kind of a more normal business environment through 2021? Would you anticipate ramping those investments up again in 2022 or are you kind of going to be at a level that you need to be at for strategic investments?
John Stauch: I think we would think that would be a new normal level with may be slightly more Nathan, but what we would then start to see is the benefit of what we think the Pentair transformation efforts would be as far as ROS expansion that would fund that and maybe give us a little more ROS structure.
Nathan Jones: Got it. That's great color. Thank you very much.
Robert Fishman: Yes, big picture from my perspective is that even with those strategic investments, our view is that with the Pentair transformation return on sales expansion will be significant by 2024.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Go ahead please. Your line is open.
Rob Wertheimer: Hi, good morning and thanks for all the clarity, this is a minor one?
John Stauch: Hi, Rob thanks, for the book by the way I’m mostly through it. So thank you.
Rob Wertheimer: Excellent, excellent hope you like it. So just to help me I guess maybe our apps a little bit newer, but with the pricing dynamic in pool and the rebates. You obviously had very strong sales and I understand that sort of generates higher rebates, how does that sort of reset next year if we continue to have strong sales, you retain more of the pricing, as rebate level stay similar. And maybe just explain that dynamic and I'm all set? Thank you.
John Stauch: Yes, I think more simply that the rebate structure resets off that higher base. So its goodness for the P&L in 2021.
Rob Wertheimer: Okay, perfect, perfect the environment obviously pretty strong. I mean, yes, [indiscernible] I mentioned, which I think it's true, you can get a contractor to do any kind of homework. I mean how far out is your visibility do you think on consumer demand heading into the summer. I know a lot of folks couldn’t get stuck on that one of two last summer and I'll stop there? Thanks.
John Stauch: Yes, we have strong confidence through what I would call this pool season Rob. And the real question mark, which we'll get through as we get more into the summer is how does that lead into the next pool season we start to see that at the end of Q2 and Q3 for the next buying season. And that's as Bob was talking mid-single digits plus, the plus is that we actually see upside in the 2022 pool season versus the 2021, which all indications are that demand is likely to continue, which is not ready to say that yet.
Rob Wertheimer: Okay, thank you.
John Stauch: Also I want to be in a chapter in your book on a positive side in the next version in addition, so I'm going to work hard at that I think.
Rob Wertheimer: You guys got a lot underway, which is awesome.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Blair with Oppenheimer. Go ahead please. Your line is open.
Bryan Blair: I know we're late in Q&A I'll just ask one. I was hoping you could update us a little more on total water management and how that's influencing your commercial trends stabilization. It's good to see there, you are clearly outperforming the market. I know that's early stage, but is that initiatives significantly accelerating into 2021 and could that be more needle moving as we look to the back half into 2022?
John Stauch: Yes, so let me explain quickly what it is, I mean in the commercial office water space many of the units that people buy and purchase are actually at least a rented to the maintenance groups that install them. So their monthly contract services, since we deal on the foodservice side with larger restaurant towards or franchises or chains, the more profitable ones just purchase the product from us and then do that replacement cartridges as they go along. But there is a huge opportunity to attack the smaller restaurants or the smaller franchises with more of the leasing model and that's what that is about. And yes, the uptick in the early going is a really nice proof of concept that shows that is a business model that people are interested in and has good returns for us and it's a good four way into having the right equipment for the restaurant. So we're encouraged. Obviously, we had to do that during COVID year, but made good progress last year and we expect to continue to expand as we go forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Rosenblatt Securities. Go ahead please. Your line is open.
Scott Graham: I do have a question, I'd like to go back and revisit the prepared comments on the G&A, where I wasn't quite sure you're meaning. John in the G&A, because I thought last quarter, we were talking about with the new management team in place, there has been identification of G&A reduction opportunities, some 150 to - 200 basis points per year the next three years. Are we on track for that this year?
John Stauch: Yes, I mean to get the not all of that savings, but we're on track to the longer term savings per G&A absolutely. So I want to compliment my by leaders who lead G&A. But as we started to work through this and COVID started to emerge. We are realizing some efficiencies we thought we could bring to the sales and marketing and the operation side as well. So I may be slowed the process down maybe 30 to 60 days Scott to make it a more enterprise wide look at what we need to do to support the segments more thoughtfully. And drive a higher level of return because there is a demand for the newer types of technologies and more digital transformation needs we do, we have to serve our customer, and I wanted to make sure we weren't putting more of the old legacy costs in. At the same time we're going to add the new cost, and I think that ships can drive significant on transformation opportunity for Pentair. Bob, you want to add?
Robert Fishman: Yes, I would just add that as a significant owner of a big piece of the G&A. We are definitely on track in terms of the numbers that you mentioned, and we still see improvement here in 2021.
Scott Graham: Thank you, that's very clear. The other question I had is about pools, the new pool build market in particular trying - just hoping you could base on what you're hearing from your distributors, anything that you're hearing from the contractors about - what new pool builds look like this year?
John Stauch: They are up. The pool permit data we have is partial for the states that we work and, but they're up anywhere from 20% to 25% in lot of those markets and regions. So that’s - I mean that's encouraging. And as you know, that's not the biggest part of our business, the biggest one is the aftermarket, but when you're putting your new pools you’re getting new pool pad and you're filling out that pool pad at least to further equipment in the aftermarket space down the road. So all encouraging data right now Scott.
Scott Graham: John to that end, if I may just tack this on to that, because I know that you're trying to look beyond your distribution channel and kind of like what rights and who is doing the installing. And - some of the work that you're doing in data analytics, are you finding ways strategically to get more content on the pad with the new pools, what are you doing there?
John Stauch: Yes so, I mean - just we believe our pool channel is the right channel, and these are professionals that we work with for many, many years, and we want to continue to work through them and with them. But when we sell into the channel, we don't know where the end product went unless it's an automated product that someone downloads an app, which we said is only about 15% of consumers today. So what we also know is that consumers out there are just trying to get something repaired or replaced. And right now, what is happening is these contractors or these dealers are really busy. So they're not always able to get to them. And so when I talk about getting more through the consumer, A) its helping them understand what they should be expecting in their pool pad as you mentioned, but B) if they just need some service, how much you can call Pentair and we can get your service technician out. And it will be through our channel because we want to continue to honor it, but we want to make sure that you're getting served within the timeframe that you needed to be, that's what we're really talking about, and I'm really excited by that Scott.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Q&A portion of today's call, I'd like to turn the call back over to John.
John Stauch: Thank you, James. And thank you for joining us today. We continue to believe that Pentair has a strong foundation and portfolio business to build upon. We have a strong purpose, mission and the vision focused on delivering smart sustainable solutions that empower our customers to make the most of life's essential resources. We believe that we are in attractive spaces that are expanding. We are a leader in the pool industry and our global Water Treatment business is helping us become an even more integral player to the global Residential and Commercial segments. We believe we have the right enterprise strategy businesses, talent and culture, from our win right values to our Pentair Integrated Management System and through our win strategies we are enabling all of our employees to continuously improve. Finally, we continue to prioritize providing superior customer experiences and delivering more predictable and consistent results. Thank you for your continued interest. James, you can conclude the call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-10-20 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Q3 2020 Pentair Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Jim Lucas, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.
James Lucas: Thanks, Mariama, and welcome to Pentair's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. We're glad you could join us today. With me today is John Stauch, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Fishman, our Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, we will provide details on our third quarter 2020 performance, as well as our full year 2020 outlook, as outlined in this morning's press release. Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties such as the risks outlined in Pentair's most recent Form 10-Q, Form 10-K and today's press release. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today, and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results. Today's webcast is accompanied by a presentation, which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Pentair's website. We will reference these slides throughout our prepared remarks. Any references to non-GAAP financials are reconciled in the appendix of the presentation. We will be sure to reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. I would like to request that you please limit your questions to one and a follow-up in order to ensure that everyone has an opportunity to ask their questions.  I will now turn the call over to John.
John Stauch: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide number 4 titled Executive Summary. First and foremost, we hope that everyone is and remains healthy and safe. I’d like to start by expressing my sincere gratitude to all of our frontline employees for their continued commitment to our customers and shareholders.  Our performance could not have happened without these teams and their dedication to the Pentair Win Right Values and our customers. While the world we live in continue to face much uncertainty, we were pleased to deliver strong third quarter results with double-digit gains in sales and EPS while also delivering robust free cash flow.  We’ll discuss the details for the quarter shortly, but we believe our mix of residential focused businesses has helped differentiate our results in these uncertain times. Despite the ongoing challenges and uncertainties that persist we have continue to invest in our top growth priorities in digital transformation.  We have successfully soft launched both the Pentair Home and Pentair dealer apps and we expect 2021 to be a great year for a number of new connected products across many of our businesses.  While our businesses are seasonally stronger during the second and third quarters, we are expecting a strong finish to 2020. I am proud of all of our businesses’ commitment to strong execution in a continued challenging environment.  I would now like to turn the call over to Bob to discuss our performance and our financial results in more detail, after which I will provide an update on our overall strategic position. Bob? 
Robert Fishman: Thank you, John. Please turn to Slide 5 labeled Q3 2020 Pentair Performance. During the third quarter, we delivered sales growth of 12% and core sales growth of 10%. On a core basis Consumer Solutions was up 23%, while Industrial & Flow Technologies declined 4%. I will discuss the details for each segment on the subsequent slides.  Segment income grew 14% while adjusted EPS increased 21%. Our tax rate of 13% was a true-up as we now expect our annual tax rate to be 15%. Price was minimal in the quarter as the elevated volumes we experienced in the quarter primarily in pool resulted in a higher than usual level of rebates with our channel partners.  Likewise, our productivity was offset by additional expenses incurred such as increased hiring to help keep up with demand and higher overall incentive compensation on a year-over-year basis.  Please turn to Slide 6 labeled Q3 2020 Consumer Solutions Performance. As a reminder, nearly 80% of Consumer Solutions serves residential markets. Many of our products has been in higher demand this year given consumers staying at home. For the quarter, sales grew 25%, segment income increased 39% to 24.2%.  Pool was clearly a strong performer this quarter with a 46% increase in sales. This follows a flat performance in the second quarter, which is worth discussing for a moment. In a normal year, the pool season starts in March or April. In 2019, we saw a late start to the season due to cool wet weather in several key markets.  This year, we saw a pause in business in the first part of April as the industry tried to understand the impacts of lockdowns in the U.S. By May, orders start seeing unprecedented demand as consumers sheltering at home were investing in their existing pools, upgrading their pools or seeking a new pool to be built.  In fact, dealers across the country began to experience a backlog of activity that resulted in many quotes for new pools being delayed as dealers were struggling to keep up with demand. As those events transpired, we experienced some delays in our supply chain at our own manufacturing plants in April as we adapted to a new normal that included social distancing within the plants.  This had a negative impact on productivity and affected our usual ability to deliver quickly, which resulted in a higher than usual disparity between our sell-in rates and the industry sell-through rates. As the third quarter began, we had our manufacturing ramped up and our supply chains in line and we worked diligently to meet strong industry-wide demand.  While the pool season officially ends in September, orders have remained healthy, albeit not at third quarter levels. Not only did pool see consistent linearity throughout the third quarter from a sales standpoint, but we saw strong demand across all product categories. Some products such as heaters have experienced above average demands as consumers are looking to open their pools earlier and close them later given we are all filled in the home for the foreseeable future.  Despite the higher than usual demand, and a delayed start to the season, we’ve continued to invest appropriately in the business and have made good progress in furthering our automation offerings, as well as expanding our overall product portfolio. There has been focus around an upcoming DOE regulation that will see further adoption of variable feed pumps.  We’ve been working closely with our channel partners on educating them on the upcoming regulation. We continue to optimize our variable to speed pumps to exceed DOE requirements in addition to introducing new select models of single speed pumps for categories that will still be able to use single speed pumps in limited applications.  While the pool season has been far from normal for the second year in a row, we still believe in the long-term growth prospects for this attractive space.  Further, we believe that the first half of next year should benefit from still solid demand in addition to an easier comparison. We will continue to build on our position as a leader in the pool industry and we expect 2021 to be a strong year for new products introductions for Pentair.  Water Treatment, which was formerly called Water Solutions is more appropriately named given the breadth of our offering in the markets we serve within Consumer Solutions. Water Treatment as a reminder is comprised of components and systems for the residential and commercial markets. While Water Treatment overall was up 2%, it has two very different stories to tell. To level set, Water Treatment revenue is derived from roughly 60% residential and 40% commercial markets. Within the residential facing businesses, we experienced near double-digit growth as consumers became more comfortable around dealers back into their homes to test their water and install new systems. We have seen an increase in demand for our brands as consumers continue to focus on the water quality in their homes.  On the commercial side, sales were down in the mid-teens which is a dramatic improvement from the declines experienced in the second quarter. While restaurants are experiencing a slow recovery, and traffic levels remain depressed, our portfolio and focus on the quick service restaurant market provided some relief to the depressed overall market.  We have had some success with new offerings like Total Water Management, which is a new seamless end-to-end service where we specify and install high-quality solutions and provide ongoing service to ensure consistent, great quality water. While in the early days of offering this new service, we are seeing strong interest from new and existing customers.  We expect the food service sector to remain challenged for the near-term, but we are encouraged that we are not declining at the same rate of the industry and are identifying the new areas of growth despite the challenging environment currently.  Please turn to Slide 7 labeled Q3 2020 Industrial and Flow Technologies Performance. Industrial and Flow Technologies or IFT saw sales decline 3% as residential and irrigation flow through in the quarter, while the other two businesses continued to be negatively impacted by a global freeze in capital spending. Segment income decreased 24% and return on sales declined 360 basis points to 13%.  Productivity was challenged in the quarter, principally as a function of a mix with lower margin backlog in addition to lower revenue spread across a higher fixed cost base. Residential and irrigation flow grew 6% in the quarter, following a 12% decline last quarter. While distributors are still not stocking across the board, demand for some of the higher moving items continued throughout the quarter.  The business experienced gains across all channels, particularly in the Pro channel and at retail. Within agriculture, our OEM sales were flat, while aftermarkets returned to growth. Commercial and infrastructure flow improved on a sequential basis as we continue to ship our lower margin infrastructure backlogs.  This mix negatively impacted the overall segment margin performance, particularly the drag on productivity. Orders in both commercial and infrastructure were down in the quarter, but the quote funnel in infrastructure remains active.  Industrial Filtrations continue to be negatively impacted by a global capital spending freeze, but the business saw the rate of decline improve sequentially. In the larger food and beverage and sustainable gas businesses, we have experienced softness in both components and longer cycle projects. The other niches within Industrial Filtration have also experienced softness.  Given this business overall is more exposed to capital spending, we would expect the order activities to resume in early 2021 as customers revisit their capital budgets.  Please turn to Slide 8 labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. While our sales and income performance were encouraging this quarter, we were exceptionally pleased with our cash flow performance. For the first nine months of the year, we have generated over $450 million of free cash flow. The third quarter benefited from strong pool sales spread evenly throughout the quarter and our ability to collect on those receivables.  We talked last quarter about the seasonality of our cash flow with the second quarter historically being the strongest period with a later start to the pool season and the shift of business to the third quarter, this contributed to higher than usual cash flow in the quarter. We entered the quarter with a net debt debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.3 times, which is at the lower range of where we have talked about our target levels longer-term.  Between our $900 million revolver and no meaningful cash outlays outside of the dividends, we have more than adequate capacity to fund our growth initiatives both organic and inorganic. We are trying to remain disciplined with our capital and we feel good about the strength of our balance sheet and expect to deliver free cash flow for the year greater than our net income.  Please turn to Slide 9 labeled Full Year 2020 Pentair Outlook. Following our strong third quarter performance, we have updated our full year sales outlook of approximately $2.95 billion and our adjusted EPS range is now approximately $2.35 to $2.40.  Below the line, we expect corporate expense to $60 million to $65 million, net interest other of approximately $28 million, a full year tax rate of 15% and average shares to be around $167 million. We expect free cash flow to be greater than 100% of net income.  I’d now like to turn the call back to John to provide an update on some of our key strategies. 
John Stauch: Thank you, Bob. Please turn to Slide 10 labeled Our Longer-Term Aspirations. Our first two years are focused on developing our new standalone strategy, aligning our organization to our strategy, improving our new product pipeline and growth capabilities, and developing the right operating rhythm. Growing the top-line organically, consistently and predictably is our main area of focus.  We start to growing the entire portfolio at least greater than GDP and delivering income from our core businesses, and we realize that not all businesses will contribute evenly, while we believe that our Consumer Solutions businesses are well-positioned to drive above average growth and are important to building out additional legs of the business and creating our future.  In addition, we continue to focus on improving our commercialization process, investing in our digital transformation to deliver more effortless customer experiences, and building our brand. We are focused on accelerating fewer, larger growth actions including expanding our content in pool and building out our residential water treatment offerings.  Within RFT, we are exploring a few promising growth areas around sustainable gas and smart solutions within our food and beverage business unit. In addition to growing organically, we believe that there are attractive areas to add tuck-in and bolt-on acquisitions. We expect this will primarily be within our residential, commercial water treatment business and includes both products and services.  The addition of Pelican and RainSoft portfolio have allowed us to both accelerate our learning and improve our growth performance. We are currently focused on building a robust opportunity funnel given many of the businesses we are looking at are smaller and privately owned. We are also focused on driving productivity and cash flow, while optimizing our ROIC.  PIMS, the Pentair Integrated Management System is an extensive toolkit that we must continue to deploy effectively. This includes not just our existing business and employees, but also future acquisitions and hires. We must ensure that PIMS is truly engrained in our DNA. We do not have a capital-intensive business and we believe this asset light business model will help us further optimize our longer-term investments.  We also believe there are further opportunities in our G&A spend that can become sources of self-funding for our growth investments. Our aspiration to become a top quartile performer in our space is well within our control and we believe we are well positioned across our portfolio.  Please turn to Slide 11 labeled Living Our “Win Right” Values Through ESG. One of the foundations of our culture is our longstanding commitment to our “Win Right” Values. These values help guide our organization which we work to achieve our highest potential. We are dedicated to holding ourselves accountable with the highest ethical standards as we drive to deliver on our commitments.  Our focus and our mission help to empower employees to make a difference within and beyond the workplace. As we experienced in our recent 2019 corporate responsibility report, sustainability is not an initiative, but it’s core to how we operate, the products we create and the customers we serve. Our goal is to demonstrate leadership as responsible corporate citizens in every country and community where we conduct business and whatever our products that put into use.  As we highlighted last quarter, over 60% of our solutions support water efficiency and roughly 75% of our solutions support energy efficiency. Our sustainable gas offerings are supporting CO2 reductions and reuse across the industry.  At Pentair, we are committed to building and advancing unity, equity and inclusion in our company and in our communities. We have amplified our focus on diversity and leadership roles and bench strength. We are committed to safety, and healthy workplace. We are focused on philanthropy and we walk the talk as our efforts spans six continents and reached more than 9.4 million in 2019.  We have strong governance practices. We have a diverse Board of Directors, which includes three female directors. The majority of our Board is independent and our Board is led by an independent, non-Executive Chairman.  We also have an anonymous employee helpline to report compliance or other concerns with dedicated compliance and audit functions. We also have a code of conduct in place for our employees and our suppliers to help align around responsible, sustainable business practices.  I would now like to turn the call over to Mariama for Q&A, after which I will have a few closing remarks. Mariama, please open the line for questions. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Your line is open. 
Aton Bookbinder: Hi, this is Aton Bookbinder on for Andy. 
John Stauch: Hey, good morning. 
Aton Bookbinder: So, 46% growth in pool, could you give us more of a breakdown of what you are seeing? Did you see an uptick from the normal 20% of original equipment business? And can you discuss any progress in catering for the share on the pool pad? 
John Stauch: Yes, we were very pleased as we mentioned in the prepared remarks. Coming into the quarter, demand was high, but making sure that we were able to fill that demand which was extremely important and we were able to ramp up manufacturing production significantly. So, again, pleased with the execution and very pleased with all of the works of our frontline workers.  The 46% was really as I mentioned across the board, across all product categories. Demand remains strong going into the fourth quarter and we are optimistic getting into 2021 as well. I would say that, I think a good way to look at that would be spread it over Q2 and Q3, because as mentioned in Bob’s remarks and talked for the last earnings call.  We were catching up and we still are catching up to what the demand is in the industry. As far as expansion on the pad, I mean, Bob mentioned, heaters is a category that has substantially grown this year. That would be another product that we probably added as far as the content on the pool and we are very pleased with our automation pull through over the last couple quarters as well.  And we think we are getting an uptick in our automation sales as more homeowners enjoy the ability to manage their pool more remotely or utilize it as it’s controlled through their iPhone. So, quite pleased with those two upticks. And as I mentioned, we ended the quarter even catching up as well. 
Aton Bookbinder: Thank you. And just as a follow-up. For margin in IFT pulled back sequentially despite higher volumes, you’ve been in the second quarter, can you talk about some of the factors that impacted margins and what you see as the outlook for margin while rightsizing the segment going forward?
John Stauch: Yes, from an overall margin perspective and also mentioned this somewhat in the prepared remarks is that, we did have a catch up of items like compensation-related expenses in the quarter. Rebates were higher than typical as the pool revenue grew significantly again ramping up production, expediting inventory to make sure we capped up it with the demand.  But those were some of the headwinds that we saw in the quarter. I would say that that Q4 from a drop through perspective does return to more normalized levels. 
Aton Bookbinder: Thank you. That’s helpful. I’ll pass it along. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open. 
John Stauch: Steve?
Operator: Steve Tusa, your line is open. 
John Stauch: Steve? You are on mute. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. 
Brian Lee : Hey guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe as a follow-up to the prior one a little bit if you guys could, can you quantify a bit on some of the trends here heading into Q4? I know you got a point of pricing in Q2, but then nothing in Q3 and then productivity did swing from being kind of a good guy to a slight bad guy, as well in the quarter.  Can you kind of talk about trends on those metrics in the context of Q4 expectations? And then, I guess, separately any early read on those two heading into 2021? 
John Stauch: Yes. I would say that, from a pricing and productivity perspective, a lot of the benefits in those two areas were somewhat masked, pricing by the rebates and then productivity by some of the compensation-related cost and some of the expedited and ramp up cost relating to pool.  So below that, it was very much in line with kind of what we saw in Q2 and as I mentioned, price and productivity to do return to more normalized levels in the fourth quarter. 
Brian Lee : Okay. Fair enough. So, maybe, not to put words in your mouth, but a point – a positive point on each if we are thinking about putting that into quantified terms for Q4 and heading into 2021? 
John Stauch: That would make sense at this point. 
Brian Lee : Okay. Fair enough. And then, just a second question on the guidance here would imply low-single-digit revenue decline implied in 4Q year-on-year. Can you give us a sense of how that breaks down between Consumer Solutions and IFT? And then also, I know you guys just put up a very big 3Q. So was there some pull forward activity or just trying to get a sense for the sequentials here into 4Q? Thanks guys. 
John Stauch: Okay, I view, last year’s Q4 as having been a solid quarter. This year’s Q4. Pool will continue to grow significantly. Demand is good. We satisfy the natural demand here in the fourth quarter. So, pool continues to do well. The residential businesses continue to grow, so outside of pool and the residential piece within IFT, we continue to face headwinds on volume within commercial and industrial.  And so, that is what’s bringing the overall growth rate down. We are hard at work in terms of addressing productivity challenges within the IFT business. And so, as I mentioned, again in my prepared remarks, we expect that the demand to continue for full in the early part of the year and we expect that IFT productivity will improve as well. 
Brian Lee :  All right. Thanks. I’ll pass it on. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open. 
Steve Tusa: Hey. Good morning guys. 
John Stauch: Hey, Steve. How are you doing? 
Steve Tusa: Sorry if I missed in the – missing the bell.
John Stauch: No worries. 
Steve Tusa: This morning, I guess, just getting out of bed here. So, just as we – I am not going to ask you to make a call on the weather or COVID next year. But when you guys kind of look out to what’s coming your way in particular on kind of the regulatory driver, when we turn the corner the next year, is it’s just like a really hard comp or is there something that kind of bridges you into future years and you can kind of keep this growth at a reasonable level obviously per pool, not saying that 20% is sustainable, but maybe just curious as to how you kind of gauge next year?
Robert Fishman: Hey. This is, Bob. Let me take a shot at it and then I’ll let John add to it. He is probably better at predicting the weather than I am. But yes, we had to net Q1, Q2, Steve, basis easier comparisons, obviously within the pool business. Demand is strong in the fourth quarter and we expect it will remain strong in the – as we go into 2021.  So, feeling good about that. As we face the tougher comparison in the back half next year, primarily in Q3, we should have a number of things going our way. We will have a number of new product introductions.  We’ll have the DOE regulation. We’ll have the IFT business that’s facing softer compares and hopefully an improved capital spending outlook. So, those are the things that could help us in the back half. But in terms of the first half of the year, again, much of it is pool and residential-driven. 
Steve Tusa: Got it. 
John Stauch: I think, Steve, we don’t guess the weather and COVID. We are expecting pool to have a very strong year next year, as well based upon the dealer activity and the pools and the pent-up capacity. Don’t know what it looks like by quarter yet. But I think Bob has given you a pretty good look at Q1 and Q2 easier compares and Q3 obviously we’ve discussed the growth maybe slightly more challenged.  But at the same time, we’ll probably have the same desires of the dealers in the channel to ensure the rebate is matched and I think we are expecting good year. And what we are doing now is, how do we get the IFT margins roll in. How do we get the year-over-year contributions of IFT to produce a lot of value next year. That’s how we are thinking about 2021, Steve, and we are excited about the way we expect to end. 
Steve Tusa: And then, just on the earnings bridge, productivity was little weak this quarter. Is there anything in kind of price and productivity in the fourth quarter that would influence the result there? Is it really just kind of a function of the volumes? 
John Stauch: It really is volume related as was mentioned, our guide suggests, that’s down low single-digits in the fourth quarter. A strong pool offset by continued challenge in commercial and industrial. But price and productivity will return to more normalized levels, because they are facing the Q3 headwinds that we saw around rebates and catch-up compensation. 
Steve Tusa: What I don’t quite understand about the fourth quarter is that, IFT wasn’t that bad this quarter. I mean, is there something that makes it worse next quarter year-over-year? 
John Stauch: Well, I think, we are starting to see the – we had the backlogs in – carried in from Q2 into Q3, Steve, that we’re able to shift through the backlog that we have and now we are trying to build the backlog, but mostly orders that we’ve taken in Q3 are really shippable next year.  So, we are not seeing our customers step up and want most of their products in IFT in Q4. And I think they are looking out in the horizon and trying to work more their deliveries in the next year. So, we’ll weather the storm in Q4 with IFT. But I do think we are starting to build the order rates and coming off the bottom as we look at IFT going forward. 
Steve Tusa: Right. So it shifts from kind of a weak 2Q into 3Q and then, I guess, the step back down, it seems like with the economy where it is, to go from positive 10 to negative 5 or negative 4 even is, it seems like a real kind of step back and it doesn’t seem like the trend in the business supported that step back.
John Stauch: Yes. I agree you, Steve. I also just – I know where it’s usual compared to the most of the industrial companies. But Q4 is not a highly strong quarter for Pentair. What mitigates that a little bit is the pool early by in the shipments of pool into the channel. Other than that, we tend to have a slightly weaker industrial end sales. 
Steve Tusa: Yes. Makes sense. All right. Thank you. 
John Stauch: Hey, Steve, I know you’ve always been focused on cash. I did want to mention that we felt that linearity of operations to drive great cash flow and I just want to make a note that that came through this quarter. 
Steve Tusa: Got it. Got it. Sorry. I meant to say great quarter guys. Great quarter. I meant to say that really. Thanks. 
John Stauch: Cash matters. 
Operator: Next question comes from Brett Linzey with Vertical. Your line is open. 
Brett Linzey: Hey. Good morning guys. Congrats on the quarter. 
John Stauch: Thank you. 
Robert Fishman: Thank you. 
Brett Linzey: Hey. I appreciate the color on the top-line for next year, but just want to focus on the cost side, you talked about some catch-up here on incentive comp here in the quarter. How does that roll into next year? And then, as you think about the temporary cost that come back, some of the restructuring savings you are going to have that do rollover.  What sort of the netting effect of those next year and what that inform for incremental margins for the total company? 
Robert Fishman: At this time, now we continue to be hard at work driving those productivity improvements. I mean, the fact that we are booking compensation this year means that will be a headwind next year which can be a good thing. I had talked earlier about opportunities within G&A. We had a benchmarking study done and it’s apparent that our G&A structure is really sized more for a much larger company kind of post-spin.  And so, we have, call it a three to four year runway here to not only improve how we spend our G&A dollars but to get back closer to benchmark. That study suggested that our spend today is roughly 150 to 200 basis points higher than our peers. And so we’ve got an opportunity within G&A. We’ve got an opportunity within complexity reduction within the IFT business primarily in skew reduction.  There is also opportunities within supply chain and procurement to become more efficient. So, plenty of things that we are working on now that should drive margin expansion next year. 
Brett Linzey: Okay. Great. And just as a follow-up on the IFT margins, you mentioned the negative mix in backlog. Was that a one quarter year-over-year event? Or should we expect some drag there for another couple quarters before it starts to normalize? 
John Stauch: We are seeing a little bit of mixed challenges within the commercial and infrastructure space. We are hopeful that that then normalizes going into 2021. 
Brett Linzey: Okay. Great. I will leave it there and pass it along. Thanks, guys. 
John Stauch: Thank you. 
Operator: Next question comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen. Your line is open. 
Joseph Giordano : Hi, guys. Good morning. 
John Stauch: Morning. 
Robert Fishman: Morning. 
Joseph Giordano : Hey, I just wanted to kind of follow-up a little bit on the regulatory pushing to next year and how do you think of the positive benefits on the price that you are going to get versus what maybe the volume benefit that you’ll get ahead of that from pull-through a single speed?  How should we think of all this in totality and maybe are you entering 2021 with a higher level of kind of visible backlog into the first half?
John Stauch: Well, two different answers. I mean, firstly, we are heading into next year, still catching up with the demand that we feel the dealer is trying to satisfy for the consumers. So we feel like we are going to be catching up for several quarters on the demand pull-through in pool. As it relates to DOE, I am always cautious on these transitions as to how the industry reaction and smooth that these transitions over time.  So, I don’t think there is a huge windfall necessarily in any one particular quarter. I think it plays out thoughtfully over time as people work around state-by-state and building out the inventory and still putting in the older product. The margin, actually the operating margin or the drop through margin on the variable speed is slightly lower, but the variable speed pump in itself is almost 1.8 times more expensive than the single speed.  So, overall, from a content and a simplification of our business model and giving people quite frankly a better pump, we think those things will work their way out over 2021 and 2022. But I think it will be a smoother transition over those periods. 
Joseph Giordano : Fair enough. And on the IFT, as you look through your total company and new product introduction being very focused on some of the resi applications and your capital deployment likely targeting there. What’s the business evaluation process looking out on IFT, like, how core are all these businesses are you thinking about them? Has that changed at all over the last two years? 
John Stauch: I certainly understand that the margins in IFT at this point in time are not where we want them. They are definitely not where leadership wants them. But I do want to complement the team. This is a truly global business. This is a hugely complex business. It’s an engineering oriented business and if COVID has been hard from a manufacturing standpoint across one part of the portfolio, it’s certainly been really hard to the IFT team.  That could be more proud of how they stepped up and they are answering the bell as far as getting their customers the products. Those are lot of inefficiencies in the way that you ship product or you deliver a product in an engineered order business when you got challenges as we are experiencing with stay home orders and COVID.  So, again, I just want to say that I think some of this is going to work its way out over time naturally as we get better at working through the new rules. The second piece is, we are seeing the activity around the focus in the portfolio.  We believe we have a really investible industrial business where we provide technology, especially smart technology, the membrane technology to a lot of sophisticated customers around the world that we are getting a lot of momentum on IoT related to those products.  We are also participating in CO2 recovery and CO2 use that’s getting a lot of push from the regulatories and it’s environmentally-friendly product. So really excited about some of those growth aspects. We got a good RNI business. It’s not going to be a rapid grower, but it’s got high margins and contributes nicely to the cash in the P&L and we got some project challenges in C&I.  But we got a new leader there and we are focused on what we need to do to write the shift there and make sure that we are going more after the aftermarket products, so less after the projects. But either we are going to see recovery in 2021 in a meaningful way in margin and IFT and I think over the longer haul, this is going to be a good contributor to Pentair’s portfolio. 
Joseph Giordano : And if I could just sneak one for Bob, it’s near about six months now, obviously interesting time to be starting a job anywhere, just curious as to – as you look about what you thought going in, in terms of how to budget and how do view this process like, what’s gone most according to plan? What’s been a little bit different and what kind of changes do you – are you kind of adapting to? 
Robert Fishman: Yes. Thank you for asking that. It’s been a great decision from my perspective to join Pentair. I could not be more pleased with the people that I work with on a day-to-day basis and the opportunity for the company. So, for me, that I have joined the company that has a great foundation. But there are opportunities for improvement.  The things that I am probably more focused on is around helping to drive consistent organic growth. We’ve implemented a number of processes around driving growth on a category level. We are developing better analytics.  So think of analytics of products and customers as opposed to necessarily just P&L. We have opportunities to drive efficiencies and margin expansion. And I am excited about both Consumer Solutions and IFT. So, from my perspective, a really great future here at Pentair and look forward to the start of 2021. 
Joseph Giordano : Thanks guys. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is open. 
Rob Wertheimer : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. 
John Stauch: Good morning. 
Rob Wertheimer : So, you’ve talked on this in a number of different ways, but just to sort of get a broader overview, you mentioned just trying to catch up with the strong demand that’s being going on with pool. Can you just sort of talk across the segments on the backlog/channel inventory versus normal. They are mostly fully caught up or whether the channel has a bit bunches on gains, just sort of characterize that across segments. Thank you. 
John Stauch: I would say that the catching up is generally a theme that applies across the portfolio. I think right now, we believe that inventory levels are correctly right sized with the exception of what we think is still a channel that needs more inventory for pool.  But I think most of our distributors and dealers are being prudent even in areas like commercial filtration where there hasn’t been any pre-stocking ahead of the expectation of restaurants opening or hospitality opening. So, I think right now, we are seeing a really nice situation where the demand is equal to the shipments that we are experiencing. 
Rob Wertheimer : Okay. That’s perfect. And if I may just ask a little bit more of a structural question, you mentioned, a consumer water treatment how you guys are able to get into homes again sort of – I know, you are working on education and just people aware of the good solutions that there are for the home. Can you touch a little bit on what the structural growth drivers are there?  Whether it’s signing up dealers or how you are getting that education out and how you really sort of take advantage of a reasonably lower opportunity? Thanks. 
John Stauch: There has been tremendous search demand. So people on the internet searching for water filtration or water treatment needs and Pentair isn’t a brand that you recognize if you do that and we are going to be. And the consumer cold demand that we think people want is the right solution for their particular need.  Water is not consistent both from an input across the world and it’s certainly not consistent from the way that you desire your water and Pentair has all the technology capability to take whatever input water you have and deliver the quality and the pace of the water that you want and that’s what we think the biggest opportunity for Pentair is and we think we have to build out the channel and the consumer pool and the demand and we have a lot of new products we are launching next year to do that to make you aware.  And the second piece would it be make sure that we are aligned with our service channel to be able to meet the demand and then give you the technology you need. So we’ve been at this for a couple of years. We’ve learned a lot from the Pelican and the Aquion acquisitions. And we are poised to really make a lot of progress in 2021 and 2022 around the residential water treatment side.  So we are excited, excited about the progress, excited about the learnings, and excited about the future. 
Rob Wertheimer : Excellent. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital. Your line is open. 
Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning everyone. 
John Stauch: Hello, Deane. 
Robert Fishman: Hi, Deane. 
Deane Dray : Hey. Hearing some more about this total water management initiative you have in commercial water treatment, just by the sound of it, what seem to be some of what you be doing at one of the major coffee chains globally. So, could you just size for us what the applications would be, what the opportunity is, what kind of investment? Thanks. 
John Stauch: Yes, Deane, I mean, that’s really a reference to – there are franchises and/or restaurants mainly that don’t necessarily the higher wealth of the company-owned stores in which franchisees are buying a lot of equipment and we are really giving them an expertise and allowing them to lease those solutions from us, right.  And really building a connectivity between us and that end-customer and renting them or leasing them the solution instead of them buying the solution. That’s what total water management is about, Deane. 
Deane Dray : Great. And is there an investment – a front investment that you need to be making? And can you give a commentary? 
John Stauch: Yes. We are obviously putting that unit into the field and instead of collecting the revenue from that unit at once, we are collecting that revenue over time as a way to promote our solutions. So, I mean, it’s in its infancy right now. Several million dollars of revenue, Deane.  And we just want to make sure it’s a solution that we have out there for our customers that they choose to rent that model and we are doing them an IoT enabled. So we know if they are being used and how they are being used and we have the ability to work with that partner to make sure they are optimizing their water experience. We are excited about that. 
Deane Dray : Good to hear. And then, on capital allocation, just given the strength in the balance sheet, given the cash flow and the line of sight on your cash flow, where do buybacks that in priority the stock sitting right by our calculations at the low end of its relative PE range for last three years. So, it really does look attractive if you want to make that case. So, just update us on buyback plans. 
Robert Fishman: From a buyback perspective, we start most years with the goal of buying back roughly $150 million of shares. This year we have done $115 million in the first quarter and then we suspended our buyback period our buybacks as we set free cash flow and liquidity.  Obviously, as free cash flow has been robust the last two quarters, we – you’ll see in the Q later today, we’ve removed the suspension around buybacks and certainly have that opportunity as we close out the year and move into next year. 
Deane Dray : Great. That makes sense. Thank you. 
John Stauch: Thanks, Deane. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Your line is open. 
Jeff Hammond: Hey, good morning guys. 
John Stauch: Hey, Jeff. 
Robert Fishman: Good morning. 
Jeff Hammond: Just want to go back to pool and kind of the momentum in the fourth quarter. I mean, I think if I hear you, you are seeing strong underlying demand and you expect that next year and inventories are still low. So, just, any read on further catch-up on inventories in the fourth quarter and what your distributors are saying about that early buy? 
Robert Fishman: I’ll start on that one. Again, I view Q4 as being satisfying natural demand. So, really not dipping into early buys, which is a good situation as we get into 2021. And so, Q4 is all about delivering on the orders that we have. That then sets ourselves up for a good start to 2021 as we deliver on early buys and more of the standard orders that will come. 
Jeff Hammond: And is it fair to say, like, underlying demand is, if you kind of put 2Q and 3Q together is like high-single-digit is kind of the order runrate into 4Q? 
John Stauch: I think it’d be higher than that, Jeff. I, for sure believe it’s double-digit as far as the underlying demand – actually double-digits. 
Jeff Hammond: And are you doing something different with early buy incentives to disincent early buy or?
John Stauch: No. 
Jeff Hammond: Okay. Okay. And then just quick on IFT, in your presentation you talked about growing the entire portfolio about GDP which would include IFT, but in the earlier question, the focus kind of continue to be more on the margin and margin improvement. So just talk about what changes to kind of drive the growth profile for that segment going forward? 
John Stauch: Yes, I can just focus. I mean, there are some of these businesses that it’s just doing the basics that’s going to generate 2% to 3% of growth and that’s okay. I think some of them are margin opportunity and let’s just do the 2% to 3% consistently and predictably every single quarter and let’s do it well. There is other businesses as I mentioned stable gas and our IoT offerings in F&B that have an opportunity to be high-single-digits over a cycle.  And that’s where we want to focus and so it’s really disciplined, Jeff. When you have projects in front of you, you could chase whatever projects you want and by the time you realize the lower margins, you are challenged and some of that still exists in this portfolio and we are working through that.  And that’s what we don’t want to do anymore. So we want each business to play its role in Pentair and by choosing what that is and making sure they are focused on it, I think they can be a big contributor to Pentair’s outcomes. 
Jeff Hammond: Okay. Thanks guys. 
John Stauch: Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Scott Graham with Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is open. 
Scott Graham : Hey. Good morning. Very nice quarter guys. 
John Stauch: Thanks, Scott. Appreciate that. 
Robert Fishman: Morning. 
Scott Graham : So, I wanted to understand a little bit about, I guess maybe I am just kind of not put a final point on this for the fourth quarter.  The low end of the EPS guidance suggest a quarter very similar to the second quarter yet, your highest margin businesses, demand is up double-digits, you are saying productivity is going to be better or the tax rate goes little bit the other way perhaps, maybe there is some cost to push things out the door because of COVID and bottlenecks. But is there something that I am missing here? I mean, typically, they are a like a flood factor in the fourth quarter? 
John Stauch: No, Scott, I mean, it is simply this. The hardest thing for companies today is to produce a low end of the guidance range when incorporates which you think a hiccup related to COVID could be that is it.  We are guessing at that end of the range to, how a second wave or a third wave how wanted to describe the COVID might impact Pentair. We know nothing today that would suggest it. But when you put a range out there, we want to have a range that we can address throughout the quarter, that’s simply what it is, Scott. 
Scott Graham : Understood. Thank you for that. A further question about your capital allocation, but maybe more from the M&A side you talked about water treatment being an area of potential targeting.  Could 2021, your - the residential businesses are doing better, you have a better – you have a better understanding of what consumers are buying off of your kind of very long and elaborate study of consumer buying habits and desires. Could 2021 be a pretty big year for M&A with you guys in water treatment? 
John Stauch: I hope so. I mean, we are continuing to look at options, Scott. I definitely look at M&As and accelerators to what we can do organically. Water treatment is definitely a focus area. I think where – that’s where the funnel is more robust and I certainly hope it’s accelerated. 
Scott Graham : Got it. Last question. The productivity number obviously being a bit of net number was depressed by the things that you guys talk about. What was the gross productivity for the quarter? 
John Stauch: It was more in line with what you would have seen in Q2. So, and then again, I had mentioned that that will return in the fourth quarter. So, productivity continues to be a consistent enhancer of the margins. It’s just unfortunate that that in Q3 we caught up on compensation and on the pricing side had higher rebates. But behind the scenes or underneath that, our gross number is very much in line with what we saw in the second quarter. 
Scott Graham : Right, which I also know I think includes some of your productivity, your cost out actions that you talked about two quarters – or a quarter and a half ago, and I guess, I am wondering have enacted any of those that we need to enact any of the, call it 80 plus million dollars that you had identified as the potential to lower cost this year? 
Robert Fishman: Yes. We – our goal was to take out cost in line with the volume drop and we’ve done a reasonably good job there. A lot of hard work has gone on within manufacturing and supply chain. We continue to spend less on what we call purchase spend, discretionary spend.  We’ve renegotiated. We took a hard look at policies across the board from travel and entertainment all the way to how we train people, recruit, relocation. And so, those are finding their way through, as well and on a full year basis will help 2021. 
Scott Graham : Understood. Thanks. Appreciated. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Your line is open. 
Nathan Jones: Good morning, everyone. 
John Stauch: Good morning. 
Nathan Jones: Great cash flow quarter there, John. 
John Stauch: Thank you. Thanks for noticing. 
Nathan Jones: No worries. A follow-up here on pool. You guys got off to a slow start to the selling days in 2Q 2019 around some of the bad weather in the southern states and the big states where pool installations happened. And last year you were pretty cautious telling that being there was labor constrain, it was difficult to catch-up with some of those things as the year went by.  This year, in 2Q, 3Q of 2020, you are probably closer to 20% overall growth. Can you try to square those comments from last year to this year? You were expecting to be on a catch-up because of labor constraints in the later part of 2019, yet the industry is being able to support such fantastic growth this year over the last six months.  And I am sure there was some inventory restocking, I know you did pool cope and now that is where selling out their own inventory in 2Q. I am sure you were catching up with some inventory refill into them in 3Q. But just if you could square those comments?
John Stauch: Yes, I can, Nathan. Let me just give you some – the way I think about it. I think, given the weather we know happen this year, because there was a good weather year. So let’s say nothing abnormal happened against this. We would expect it a double-digit full year, primarily because of the challenges we had last year and where we thought overall inventory was, I mean, overall double-digit.  I think, let’s say, we were close to mid-teens. I don’t think we are seeing more than the 5 point tailwind, in my opinion from what would be the COVID order rates, because I do think there is a constraint in the industry anyway.  I think what we are hearing and feeling is the demand is going to extend and that extension will be managed through the capacity that you are mentioning. So, that’s why we are sitting here today relatively confident we are going to have a good year next year. 
Nathan Jones: It does seem like there is still plenty of demand left going into next year to continue to see growth in the pool business in 2021. I know it’s a long way out to look at 2022, but do you think we are pulling some demand forward there and potentially that your below average growth for a year or two after we get past COVID if that ever happens? 
John Stauch: Nathan, I would not guess – I haven’t figured out 2021 yet, so to – just I am feeling 2022 is - like a COVID, I got elections, there is all kinds of things that have to unfold first. But I think which is being in people, I think people are really vacations might not be in the horizon and they are choosing destinations for second homes that they can retreat to and I think that has been a unique pull across the entire industry and most of those states are where a pool is in the backyard. 
Nathan Jones: I think that’s a fair evaluation. Just want to follow-up on Jeff’s question about the grow – all your business greater than GDP. Does the number of business, primarily the industrial businesses that – the last number of years have not been able to do that.  Do you have different strategies that you are going to deploy that now to get those businesses up to growing GDP? And what are the plans to those businesses if you are unable to get those up to growing at GDP levels? \
John Stauch: Yes. I think, just to put in perspective, we have product categories that sit below our businesses and there is some 23 of them and when we talk about that, we're talking about averaging and if something is not able to grow, we would look at how it's doing across its cycle and is it still doing well relative to the cycle that it's in.  But we want to make sure predictably and consistently that we can deliver that core every single year and that it starts with a positive contribution to our shareowners. The second piece is now let's talk about the strategic growth of our plan on top of it and we are trying to get both and that's not something we've done consistently over time and I want to be consistent with both of those. We need a stable core growing and then a few incremental things you can put on top of it. And then if you could put M&A on top of that, now you are really – you are really lightened up and that's our goal.
Nathan Jones : And just one clarification. I think I heard you say you believe that the inventory levels in per pool in the channel are balanced at the moment?
John Stauch: No, I think we're still catching up. We are balanced across the rest of the portfolio, that's enough in pool. Yes.
Nathan Jones : Okay. Thanks very much for taking my questions.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Emily Shu : Hey. Good morning. This is Emily Shu on for Andrew Obin. Thanks for squeezing me in.
John Stauch: No problem.
Emily Shu : Were there any supply chain adjustments made in the quarter to deal with the outsized pool demand and the catch-up? If you could just give some color on the overall state of your supply chain, that would be very helpful. Thanks.
Robert Fishman : I'll take that. We've talked about emerging from COVID stronger. I would say that's an example. We've added second suppliers where it made sense closer to the markets we serve. But generally speaking, Q3 was a quarter of ramping up manufacturing productions, adding a second shift, adding more people. So, I do think we've addressed the supply chain challenges, but also given us more optionality around manufacturing production.
Emily Shu : Okay. Great. And then – and my last question is just with the federal election coming up and potential change in administration, have you guys assessed if there could be any impacts to the business from a potential green new deal? Thanks.
John Stauch: While we are obviously, we are learning how to balance risks or opportunities all the time between tariffs and COVID and now election. I think, we are a sustainable solutions provider. So we would expect to benefit from any movement in green initiatives or societal changes that affect the environment in a positive way.
Emily Shu : Okay. Thanks so much guys. And congrats on the quarter.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Robert Fishman : Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Saree Boroditsky : Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in. 
John Stauch: No problem.
Saree Boroditsky : So with the implications that pool demand remains strong next year, how are you thinking about the opportunity to push through pricing since it was really not a contributor to sales in the quarter given rebates?
John Stauch: Yes. I think, listen, we – as Bob mentioned, we are deep in the planning cycle right now and one of the key inputs to any pricing decision is what are you seeing with inflation and what's going on with suppliers and material. And we'll make those assessments and based upon those assessments, we'll make sure that we're pricing effectively. So, this is the time we do that and if we need to make adjustments, we make adjustments.
Saree Boroditsky : Great. And then just following up on the 150 to 200 basis points in G&A opportunity. Can you touch on how you're thinking about the timing on this and how we should think about if any benefit into next year?
John Stauch: We think of it as a three-year runway more or less linear, so not back-end loaded. So improvements. And again, as the improvement in margins will come in two forms, it will be some cost out, but also avoiding cost as revenue ramps. So, I think it's good that we've got a three-year past year and we are hard at work at operationalizing that improvement.
Saree Boroditsky : Great. Thanks for taking my questions.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open.
Trish Gorman : Hey, good morning. This is Trish on for Julian. Maybe just one more follow-up on seasonality, I know you mentioned perhaps there is some contingency in the guide. But the implied Q4 guide suggests sales decline kind of high-single digit sequentially and then, versus normal seasonality at mid-single-digit increases.  And so you mentioned IFT kind of normal seasonality it's typically down into the fourth quarter versus the third. Should we expect consumer to follow normal seasonality as well? I know you said those satisfy kind of natural demand. But I think that's typically up quarter-over-quarter into the fourth quarter.
John Stauch: Yes. So – so simply stated, I think our normal seasonality is Q2 is our strongest quarter followed by Q3, Q4 and then Q1. And pool is the strongest in Q2 and Q3, because that - how it ramps for the season and then it usually has what's called an early buy, which is a level loading of the distribution base so that we can maintain our employment levels and satisfy the industry demand.  Other than that, we tend to see a tail-off with the Christmas season meaning that we've only produced probably to mid-December and shipping products in mid-December. So, the natural tendency is for Q4 to be a little soft across our particular lines. As Bob mentioned, we had a good Q4 last year. And so our IFT businesses, they are still experiencing that headwind on a year-over-year basis and that's simply what the challenge is in Q4.
Trish Gorman : Okay. Got it. Thank you. And then, just maybe one follow-up on free cash flow, given the strength to-date, as we look out, how should we think about working capital movements? And maybe free cash flow into 2021, do you think it's possible to grow free cash flow next year, given the products have built some supply in pool?
Robert Fishman : For free cash flow, again, our starting point is 100% of net income and that will continue to be our goal. I mean, to me, it speaks to the quality of the earnings that we have in here at Pentair. One thing as John alluded to was, there is nothing like linearity to improve free cash flow, either from a quarterly perspective or from an in-quarter perspective.  So, with the strength that we are seeing in pool, our factories are busy from the start of the quarter to the end of the quarter, and that revenue that comes in early in the quarter allows us to collect that by the end of the quarter.  So, I would say linearity will continue to be in our favor. We'll continue to drive free cash flow at or higher than net income. And also remain disciplined around things like CapEx.
Trish Gorman : Got it. Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to John Stauch for closing remarks.
John Stauch : Thank you for joining us today. We continue to believe that Pentair has a strong foundation and portfolio of businesses to build upon. We have a strong purpose, mission, and vision, focused on delivering smart, sustainable solutions that empower our customers make the most of life's most essential resources. We believe that we are in attractive spaces that are expanding.  We are a leader in the pool industry and our Water Treatment business is helping us become an even more integral player in both residential and commercial water treatment. We believe we have the right enterprise strategy, businesses, talent and culture. For our “Win Right” values to our Pentair Integrated Management System, we are enabling all of our employees to continuously improve.  Finally, we continue to prioritize providing superior customer experiences and delivering more predictable and consistent results. Thank you for your continued interest.  Mariama, you can conclude the call. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-07-23 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Q2 2020 Pentair plc Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Lucas. Thank you. Please go ahead.
James Lucas: Thanks, Mariama, and welcome to Pentair's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. We're glad you could join us today. I'm Jim Lucas, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. And with me today is John Stauch, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Fishman, our Chief Financial Officer.  On today's call, we will provide details on our second quarter 2020 performance as well as our full year 2020 outlook, as outlined in this morning's press release.  Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties such as the risks outlined in Pentair's most recent Form 10-Q, Form 10-K and today's press release. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today, and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results.  Today's webcast is accompanied by a presentation, which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Pentair's website. We will reference these slides throughout our prepared remarks. Any references to non-GAAP financials are reconciled in the appendix of the presentation. We will be sure to reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to John.
John Stauch: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide #4 titled Executive Summary. First and foremost, we hope that everyone remains healthy and safe. While the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to create uncertainty, our focus on the health and safety of our employees, our customers and our businesses continue to be our priority. Throughout the quarter, we built strong COVID-19-management capabilities, which are now part of our standard work processes. We recognize that there will continue to be disruptions due to the pandemic, but we believe we are better positioned to help manage any potential impact.  While we had withdrawn our guidance entering the second quarter, we were generally pleased with the overall performance of the company. We anticipated that our commercial- and industrial-facing businesses would face challenges as global capital spending came to a halt in April, but the rate of decline did moderate as the quarter progressed.  Our residential-facing businesses, including our leading pool franchise, saw healthy improvements during May and June and exited the quarter with continued improvement in trends. As consumers sheltered in place during the quarter, it appears swimming pools were being opened earlier and demand for swimming pools overall grew, resulting in increased demand for our equipment. Consumers also remain focused on their water quality, which led to improved orders for our Water Solutions business.  We are extremely pleased with our free cash flow performance as we generated over $400 million of free cash flow during our important second quarter. We use this cash flow to reduce our outstanding revolver balance and the result was further strengthening of our liquidity profile. We continue to position ourselves to take advantage of opportunities as business recovers. Residential comprises roughly 60% of our portfolio, and we believe these businesses should continue to benefit from improved demand. While we anticipate that the rest of the portfolio serving commercial and industrial will likely remain challenged, we remain focused on aligning the cost structure appropriately while continuing to invest in longer-term opportunities.  I'd like to thank all of Pentair's employees for continuing to deliver for our customers despite these unprecedented times.  Please turn to Slide #5 labeled Segment Focus. We wanted to remind everyone of our focus within our 2 segments, which remain relatively unchanged. Within Consumer Solutions, our largest segment, our primary focus is advancing our growth in pool both in gaining content as well as extending our aftermarket reach. As a reminder, there are approximately 80,000 new pools built each year and there are roughly 5.5 million pools installed in the ground.  We believe that automation represents a longer term opportunity, and we continue to evolve our product offering. We have launched the Pentair Home app and are rolling out a number of new products that can and will be interconnected.  We also wanted to comment on an upcoming Department of Energy regulation that goes into effect in July of 2021, which we expect will result in further adoption of variable speed pumps. As a reminder, this is a category that we helped invent over a decade ago. We estimate that roughly 30% to 40% of in-ground pools have a variable speed pump today, and we expect this number to only increase after the new DOE regulation takes effect. While we believe we are well positioned from a product standpoint, we are working closely with our dealers and distributors to better educate them about what the new regulation means as well as help them manage the transition away from single-speed pumps.  Within our Water Solutions business, we continue to invest in innovative components such as our flat connected valve for water softeners, while also expanding our residential systems business. Within our commercial systems business, we continue to invest in new areas around commercial office water and total water management. We see this as a long-term opportunity where we believe we are well positioned, and we look forward to updating you in the future.  Finally, we continue to focus on our M&A funnel, primarily around tuck-in and bolt-ons. During the quarter, we made a small acquisition of an in-floor pool cleaner company that expands our product offerings. We see opportunities for other product line extensions in pool and much broader opportunities within Water Solutions.  While our focus within Consumer Solutions is principally around growth, Industrial & Flow Technologies, or IFT, has more of a focus on productivity. We have reinforced our PIMS processes as we believe that there are a number of opportunities across the segment to improve the cost structure and also improve quality and delivery within a few select businesses. We continue to invest in productivity-enhancing technology in our manufacturing plants. While the focus in IFT is more on margin improvement, we believe that there are some potential niche-growth opportunities, particularly in our food and beverage business focused on CO2 recovery as well as our beer membrane business. We continue to prioritize our opportunities for both segments to ensure we are allocating our resources most effectively to optimize our shareholder value creation opportunities. We have a balanced focus between growth and productivity and believe that both segments are well positioned to make contributions to Pentair and all of our stakeholders.  Please turn to Slide #6 labeled What We Do Really Matters! Doing well by doing good has been a long-standing tradition at Pentair. Our purpose and our mission helped to energize our employees to make a difference within and beyond the workplace. Sustainability is not an initiative at Pentair, but instead is core to the products we create and the customers we serve. This slide is a brief snapshot of how some of our products are helping to make the world a safer, more sustainable place. Pentair is a water-focused company, and many of our products are energy-efficient solutions. Our variable speed pool pump has helped us to be named ENERGY STAR's Partner of the Year for 6 consecutive years, while helping consumers save nearly $2 billion in energy costs. Our Residential Water Solutions business has helped reduce the need for almost 10 billion of water bottles annually. We also have a leading CO2-recovery business within industrial filtration that has helped customers capture and reuse over 11 million metric tons of CO2 every year. We remain focused on leveraging our strong product and technology offerings to help our customers deliver smart, sustainable solutions. This is core to Pentair and essential to our purpose and mission in building a leading water treatment company.  I would now like to turn the call over to Bob to discuss our financial position and our results in more detail. Bob?
Robert Fishman: Thank you, John. Please turn to Slide 7 labeled Q2 2020 Pentair Performance. For the second quarter, our sales declined 11% and decreased 10% on a core sales basis. Consumer Solutions was down 8% on a core basis, while Industrial & Flow Technologies core sales declined 13%. I will discuss each segment's performance in more detail shortly.  Segment income declined 19% and return on sales contracted 180 basis points to 17.5%. We made progress on our cost-reduction efforts, but the timing of these actions reading out did not fully offset our decremental margins in the quarter. Below the operating line, our net interest and other expense ended the quarter at $8.1 million. Our adjusted tax rate was 16%, and our average shares outstanding in the quarter was $166.4 million. We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.59, which represented a 14% decline year-over-year. Overall, we were very pleased with the progression of the quarter following a difficult April. While there's still much work to do, we feel positive about our ability to align our cost structure with the weakened top line.  Please turn to Slide 8 labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. While the P&L faced its fair share of challenges during the quarter, we were extremely pleased with our cash flow performance and the further strengthening of our balance sheet. For the quarter, we generated free cash flow of $417 million, over a 20% increase for the comparable period 1 year ago. We used our strong cash flow performance primarily to pay down our revolver balance.  We ended the second quarter with $764 million available under our $900 million revolver. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio ended the quarter at a very manageable 1.6x. While we have one small maturity upcoming in September, we have no other pressing capital needs outside of dividends in the second half. We plan to remain disciplined with our capital, and we feel good about the strength of our balance sheet and expect to deliver free cash flow for the year equal to or greater than our net income.  Please turn to Slide 9 labeled Q2 2020 Consumer Solutions Performance. Consumer Solutions sales declined 8%, segment income decreased 11% and return on sales declined 80 basis points to 24.1%. Before discussing the full results of the 2 businesses within the segment, we wanted to remind you that Consumer Solutions is 75% residential and 25% commercial. Our pool business delivered flat sales for the quarter. This included a mid-teens decline in April, followed by continued improvements in May and June. As consumers were sheltered in place, it appears that more and more people were opening their pools earlier than usual. Further, demand inquiries for new pools were up substantially throughout the quarter as confirmed in various publications about dealers having limited ability to keep up with the increased demand. This resulted in strong demand across all of our product categories. While we were focused on meeting this demand, we were impacted in the quarter by COVID-related manufacturing delays and supplier disruptions, notably during the early part of the quarter when we would historically be ramping up productions. We have seen less downtime in our own manufacturing facilities and have been able to ramp up production in several key product lines. The supplier disruptions occurred principally outside the U.S., and we have worked to add suppliers in addition to our current suppliers being able to produce once again.  Within Water Solutions, the mid-teen sales decline does not tell the bifurcated story of the business. The smaller commercial business, which is exposed to restaurants and other hospitality industries, experienced a double-digit sales decline. It was encouraging to see the rate of decline moderate throughout the quarter, but we are not expecting any meaningful recovery for this business for the remainder of the year. Our residential business was a different story as we did see signs of improvement throughout the quarter in what can best be described as stabilization exiting the quarter.  Early in the quarter, many of our dealers and customers were unable to get into consumers' homes to test their water and install systems. As the quarter progressed, we saw dealer activity increased and we also saw some pockets of stabilization in our components business. We believe Consumer Solutions is well positioned as we enter the third quarter based on the strong demand in pool and the continued improvement in orders.  Please turn to Slide 10 labeled Q2 2020 Industrial & Flow Technologies Performance. Industrial & Flow Technologies, or IFT, saw sales decline 14%, with all 3 businesses down in the quarter. Segment income decreased 26%, and return on sales declined 240 basis points to 14.1%. The rate of decline in IFT was steep, limiting our ability to quickly take out cost, but there was a sequential improvement in sales as we exited the quarter. We are working on rightsizing the cost structure in IFT according to the demand run rate as we believe the top line will likely stay pressured in commercial and industrial as customers continue to pause their capital spending and reduce their aftermarket orders to lower asset utilization. Our Residential & Irrigation Flow business experienced a low double-digit sales decline as customers were actively managing their own balance sheets and their demand was severely impacted earlier in the quarter due to many states residents being sheltered in place.  We experienced an improvement in activity as the quarter progressed, with orders in June up significantly versus April. Commercial and infrastructure flow posted a high single-digit decline in sales, with commercial demand down low double digits as the smaller infrastructure business continued to ship its backlog. We are monitoring orders closely in this business, but it appears to be too early to determine at what rate the backlog will be replenished. Industrial Filtration was hardest hit during the quarter, with sales declining just over 20%. This was broad-based as virtually all industries served saw a severe freeze in capital spending as well as lower asset utilization that had a negative impact on our aftermarket sales. It remains to be seen when these trends will reverse, and we are preparing for this part of IFT to remain under pressure for the remainder of the year. We expect the top line to remain pressured in IFT, and we are taking appropriate actions to rightsize the cost structure. We expect decrementals to improve throughout the second half of the year.  Please turn to Slide 11 labeled Full Year 2020 Planning Assumptions. Despite a brief period when COVID first appeared in the U.S. in a meaningful way, our pool business has enjoyed an otherwise stronger first half of 2020. We expect this trend to continue in the third quarter as demand remains strong across the channel and we make progress in satisfying the strong demand the industry is experiencing. Our Water Solutions business, on the other hand, is not expected to have a second half recovery as hospitality and commercial offices are likely to remain impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We are also watching closely as COVID infection rates increased in key water quality states such as Florida, Texas and California. If tighter shelter-in-place restrictions are instituted, this could have an impact on our Residential Water Solutions business. As we stated earlier, IFT is expected to not see much in the way of recovery as we anticipate customers continue to pause their capital spending for the remainder of the year.  Finally, the pandemic environment continues to create challenges for us as we make base economic assumptions. We expect continued uncertainty, but with the expected performance of our pool business, we are reinstating guidance as we expect the rest of our portfolio to face continued challenges.  Please turn to Slide 12 labeled Full Year 2020 Pentair Outlook. While full visibility remains limited, with half of the year behind us, we are reinstating the full year guidance. For the full year, we expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2 to $2.20 on total sales of roughly $2.8 billion. Below the line, we are expecting an adjusted tax rate of 16% and average shares outstanding of approximately 167 million. We continue to target free cash flow greater than 100% of net income. Capital expenditures are expected to be $60 million to $70 million while D&A should approximate $75 million, and noncash stock compensation should be around $20 million.  I would now like to turn the call over to Mariama for Q&A. After which, John will have a few closing remarks. Mariama, please open the line for questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.
Joshua Pokrzywinski: So no surprise, first question on pool. John, can you just talk a little bit about point of sale in the marketplace versus your business? Anything on backlog channel inventory that we should be thinking about as we head into the second half, and how maybe those two come into lockstep?
John Stauch: Yes. I think -- first of all, I think we're pleased with the order trend and the sell-through rates in pool and very excited about the business' resiliency. And as we think through what's happened in the channel, I think most of that -- those orders in Q2 were served through inventory, so there's an opportunity, and certainly, the demand is to refill that inventory in the channel and continue to meet the external demand. So that's why Bob's comments we're very optimistic about what the back half looks like, and we're very hopeful that we continue to see that strong demand.
Joshua Pokrzywinski: Got it. And then I'm assuming I win some sort of price or a T-shirt for a nonpool question. Just on commercial filtration. I would imagine that shelter-in-place was pretty punitive to things like restaurants and institutions. Any kind of swing factor that we should be aware of where 2Q maybe doesn't tell the story, but June exit rates or July, some of these organizations went from 0 to something better than 0. Any shift in demand there that you can speak to?
John Stauch: No. I think because even in June, you'd have to look as two halves. I think as the country started opening up, certainly in June, very strong demand recovered. And as we started to see a pullback across the main states, and certainly across the United States, we started to see the trends start to slow again. I think our forecast assumes we just don't see recovery. And in fact, we continue to see continued pullbacks to deal with the pandemic. And so I think it's a balanced place to be right now.  As Bob's notes determined, we saw a big -- we did see a big pickup in residential. And residential water quality, especially in people's homes, is a high-demand area. That accelerated throughout the quarter. And we've muted that expectation in the back half of the year as well as we're concerned if states start to reverse their views on the openings. I think the highlight would be we did see China recover in the quarter, and we're very optimistic certainly of its year-over-year June rates and what we see as the trends heading into Q3. So that does give us the indications that when things start to stabilize around the pandemic, that we really feel the strength of our portfolio will start to unfold.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jeffrey Hammond: So just on the pool kind of supply chain issues, can you just talk about what you think defers into 3Q as a result of that? And just what's your assessment of kind of those supply chain issues? Have they fully abated? Or are they still lingering?
John Stauch: Yes. So Jeff, we're carrying a fairly substantial backlog into Q3. The order trend was very positive throughout Q2. And yes, we did have some supply disruptions primarily related to COVID and our supply base. And so we are consistently trying to meet that demand, and we expect a very strong July, and we're doing everything we can to meet the existing demand and also the demand that was created in Q2.
Jeffrey Hammond: Okay. And then IFT kind of surprised me in the model and the upside, like where did you see maybe better trends versus what you were expecting? And then I think Bob made a comment on decrementals getting better, how should we look at decrementals for the back half for IFT?
John Stauch: Yes. We'll split this answer, Jeff. I think on IFT, first of all, I think on long-cycle businesses, you carry a little bit backlog into the quarter. So we did have a backlog from some orders that we had booked in previous quarters that we continue to ship throughout Q2. But also I am as pleased that we become less dependent on large projects and we've got more of a recurring revenue stream across the IFT portfolio than we had maybe 3 to 5 years ago. So I think the efforts around the team to position ourselves in more predictable revenue stream started to show through, especially in -- as orders started to pull back. And I think we're positioned not to return to growth anytime soon, but at least to mitigate the downside growth potentials that we had in the last cycle.  So I feel good about where we are in the portfolio. As Bob mentioned, we still have cost actions here to rightsize the business to where the trends are going to take it. We've been encouraged with a little bit of the order pattern as we started Q3, but we got to get this business in line with what the longer-term revenue stream looks like. And those are actions that we'll be discussing here throughout Q3. I'll have Bob talk about decrementals.
Robert Fishman: Thanks, John. There is a tremendous amount of work going on around the cost structure, understanding fixed variable, discretionary, nondiscretionary, especially within the IFT business. I would say the best way to model the back half is to continue to use low to mid-30s as decrementals for that business.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America.
Andrew Obin: Just a follow-up question on pool. As we look at sales reported by public distributors, how long do you think it will take for your sales sort of to match what the industry is doing? And as I said, I'm using public guides as an example, but there's just the disconnect. You guys were flat, the industry pool I think reported up 14%. Should we expect the gap to close in third quarter? Or how long does it take?
John Stauch: Yes. I mean we're going to do everything we can to close that gap in Q3. And as I said, I think the orders continue to remain strong. So I think, through the back half of the year, we expected to see our revenue increase significantly, Andrew.
Andrew Obin: Fantastic. And just on the supply chain, you did talk about adding suppliers. Are you at -- in the same geography? Or are you guys considering maybe derisking supply chain and moving some of the suppliers to the U.S.? Can you just talk about how you're thinking about your supply chain post-COVID?
John Stauch: Yes. I think -- like most companies, I think we have to first do what we need to do to get our demand out. And what we have is, in a couple of cases, we have suppliers that use Mexico as the source of that production. And as you know, Mexico was hit hard in COVID here throughout Q2, and that disrupted the supply chain a little bit. As we move forward, I think we're very aware that supply chains are going to need to be much more localized, not just the U.S. but also in Europe and also in China. I think the disruptions that were caused as the pandemic worked its way through, highlighted a couple issues. But as a reminder, I mean, tariffs were another indication of where supply chains needed to move as well. And there hasn't really been any movement, and feeling better about where tariffs are going to be longer term, which really, I think, drives all of us in the manufacturing space to think about more localized production to serve the demand and the needs, but also to balance and derisk the aspects associated with disruption to global supply chains, Andrew. So I think that's a trend not just for us but for everybody.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
Charles Tusa: What was the impact of the supply chain issues, dollar volume-wise?
John Stauch: Well, it was a big piece of what would have helped close the gap between the industry trends and where we shift our products, Steve. Let's just put it there. Part of that being that, as Bob mentioned, we got off to a slow start in the quarter as the orders started coming in just from our manufacturing operations and ramping ours up to the demand. But then when the supply disruptions happened, as I mentioned earlier, that put us further behind and now we're digging out of that aspect.  We've seen a strong demand across the entire equipment portfolio, so it's not just a product line. And as we head into Q3, we're confident we have a path to get the customers their orders within Q3, but we also see the demand working its way into Q4 as well, Steve.
Charles Tusa: How strong were our orders kind of in June and July? You said you can grow significantly? I mean are they up more than double digit?
John Stauch: Yes. No, not more than double, that'd be triple, right?
Charles Tusa: Sorry.
John Stauch: They're up double digits. They're definitely up double digits.
Charles Tusa: They're not 100% right. So are they up more than 20?
John Stauch: Yes.
Charles Tusa: Okay. So can you, in consumer, actually hold the flat line this year, do you think, for this segment?
John Stauch: I think that would be aggressive. I think like we said on -- I think it's Slide 11, Steve, we expect and -- listen, we acknowledge the pool, we think we're just going to have a good year this year anyway. As you know, we had easier comparisons year-over-year. And we didn't have great weather last year, and we've had tremendous weather for the pool season this year. In addition to that, we think that the shelter-in-place has changed the consumers' behaviors, primarily around seasonal products that aren't always purchased, "Okay, we're going to use our pool earlier, so let's talk about our heaters. We're home, and we're maintaining our pool, should we consider chlorinators? Should we consider automating our pool?" Those are all the things that we are hopeful for long periods of time, that our consumers would begin to understand and start to invest in it. And we're really encouraged about those order trends related to that.  So we're acknowledging pool is going to have a really good year, and our only limit there is our supply chain and making sure we're managing through it. We're acknowledging the fact that we probably had a much more optimistic forecast in Water Solutions. And the commercial impact in the likelihood that people are going to open up their offices for people to come back to work or that hotels and hospitality sections are going to see travel to the level that we used to, that's what we're taking out of this look as we build this guide, Steve. And so I would think it would be very hard for Consumer Solutions to get all the way back, but I do think we're encouraged by the trends. And as we started to see things open in June, we really liked our positioning in the Water Solutions business, and we started to see that recovery. But then towards the end of June, we saw it pull back a little bit as a lot of closures started to happen.  So I know it's a long-winded answer, but I just wanted to give you the color. And I felt that slide was important because while there's a lot of optimism in our businesses, the final bullet point is the sobering reality that none of us know what's going to happen with this pandemic, both in the impact that it has on the economic outlook to our businesses, but also on what it's going to do to our global supply chains and our own manufacturing factories.
Charles Tusa: Right. Sorry, one last quick one. On productivity, you did $9 million this quarter. Is that kind of a good consistent run rate for the back half? Or do you have some more kind of costs coming through timing-wise that can improve that in the last couple of quarters?
Robert Fishman: We're focused on improving that number. Again, looking at the portfolio of businesses, we think there's opportunity to do better than that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Vertical Research Partners.
Brett Linzey: Just wanted to circle back on the DOE efficiency changeover. How do you see that playing out as we roll into next year? Do you expect some prebuy of the single-speed ahead of the deadline and then you get the mix up kind of beyond '22? Or what's your thought process there?
John Stauch: Yes. We've always felt that there would be some prebuy just because of the way the other industries have handled transitions of this like. I think we obviously are working with our distribution and dealer channels to help understand that the value of the variable speed is significant, both in the form of how quiet it is, its efficiency and just the fact that it plainly is a better pump. So while we do expect some of that prebuy to mitigate the impacts of not having it available next year, we really are hopeful that more of the mix switches to the variable speed pump in a very short order here.
Brett Linzey: Yes. Got it. And then just on price, encouraging, you're able to hold the line there in both the businesses in the quarter. Just given the strength in pool, you've got some commodities moving against you, do you think you have a price lever to kind of move price back up through the second half of the year, specifically in pool?
John Stauch: I think it's going to be a more normalized pricing environment, similar to the way we approach this year. While there are some challenges across certain product lines, I mean, overall, commodities have generally held in there, and we haven't seen significant inflation. So I think it's going to be a more normalized year as we head into the season.
Operator: Your next question comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen.
Joseph Giordano: Can you hear me?
John Stauch: Yes. We can, Joe.
Joseph Giordano: All right. Good. So just following up on that question on the regulatory change. Just can you kind of frame out what that means for you guys on like a margin profile basis or -- and what it means to the competitive landscape and who's producing efficient single-speed versus variable speed, and how that kind of works for you guys, the give and take in the industry?
John Stauch: Yes. So this has been a product that's been out there for 10-plus years. And as I said in my comments, we helped with the channel and the needs, primarily on the high-cost energy states, introduced this product. So we've been the leader in it for a period of time, but candidly, everybody has got a variable speed pump. And I think our biggest challenge across the industry I think is getting people to understand that even though the cost of that product is almost double, the value in the pump both in how long it lasts and the value it creates is significant. So there's not really a change in margin profile. It goes out at more revenue and it throws out more margin dollars, but not higher margin.
Joseph Giordano: Got it. That makes sense. And I was just curious about kind of like the channel evolution. Have you seen more of your business going through like an Amazon-type sale more recently? How has that kind of shifted over time?
John Stauch: Online has definitely picked up on do-it-yourself products like filtration or replacement filtration cartridges. There's definitely interest in water filtration that's going through those online channels. And then just as a reminder, we have our own online capability that we've got through the Pelican acquisition that we utilized to take some of that demand and shift it over into more of a water expertise because what we want to do is give people the right solution, not just sell them a product that they think they need.
Joseph Giordano: And what was that -- I mean, as it shifts towards that channel, what does that mean for you guys from a margin standpoint?
John Stauch: Well, I mean, we think -- I mean, there's always going to be a curated set of products in any industry in which people are going to be able to do and replace themselves. We don't necessarily feel in pool or in our Water Solutions businesses that, that solves the real consumer concern around taste and quality of their water. And so we believe, long term, that creates leads that really drive the nice services revenue for us over the longer term.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brian Lee of Goldman Sachs.
Brian Lee: Just maybe firstly on the decrementals on Consumer Solutions, specifically. They seem to come in pretty strong, a bit better than we would have expected given the 8% decline in sales. Anything in the quarter that might have helped the margin profile? Was it all a function of mix? Or was there something else? And then how should we think about whether this level of decrementals in the segment sustains in the next few quarters?
Robert Fishman: For Consumer Solutions, again, mix was helpful in the quarter. And we expect that trend to continue in the back half of the year. There's also, within Consumer Solutions, a number of productivity plays that are underway. So I expect decrementals to continue to do well within the Consumer Solutions segment.
Brian Lee: Okay. Fair enough. And then just secondarily, with respect to mix in the pool business specifically, do you see different margin profiles when it comes to business coming from renovation projects as opposed to new construction? And are you seeing -- I think you mentioned both, but are you seeing trends in those 2 segments being similarly strong? Or is one outperforming the other? It sounds like backlogs on the new construction side are actually above average according to some of the supply chain players, but just be curious to hear your read and also what the relative impacts are from one type of business versus the other?
Robert Fishman: Right. When we've been looking at it, both new construction and remodel are both strong in this environment. And the margin profile is very similar between those 2 pieces. So again, good news from our perspective in terms of consistent demand in both of those areas.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Rosenblatt Securities.
Scott Graham: I have three for you. If you could just give us a quick comment on IFT mix. Can you maybe tell us also when the new pool inquiries, when your dealers and when trade is expecting that to manifest into actual breaking of grounds? And if you could also tell us what your thoughts are on reinstating share repurchases.
John Stauch: Sure. So I'll take this with Bob. I mean it's interesting, and I want to frame that, I think when we heard the pandemic hit where we saw it start to hit late March and April, when we checked with the channel in pool, I mean, it was -- the phones weren't ringing and people were nervous. And what happened throughout Q2 is people started to focus again on how do I get a quality of life with what I have versus maybe vacationing and going elsewhere. So we saw that demand come in very, very strong and continues be strong through this call today.  So I think that is a signal, and usually people know that they're not going to get a pool built in weeks. It's usually a couple of quarters. And so I think we feel good about that trend and what could happen in the new and remodeled pools as it goes forward. As a reminder, Scott, we look at every one of those opportunities as a way to convince that particular homeowner that there is a best solution for that pool. That includes automation, it includes their ability to dose the chemicals in themselves and maintain that pool themselves and get the best overall experience. So we love the new pool trend and the remodeled pool trend because it's our best opportunity to increase the content.  We obviously continue to serve the installed pools, which is, again, you're using your pool and you're going to run through your equipment, but that tends to be more of a like-for-like replacement. So we like the trends right now. We think it's continuing in the right direction, and we're hopeful it continues into 2021. Bob, do you want to talk about the capital allocation question?
Robert Fishman: Yes. On share repurchases, to me, it fits within the whole approach around capital structure. We continue to have a very balanced, disciplined approach. First and foremost, to me, it begins with driving free cash flow greater than or equal to net income. And we're on our way to do that here in 2020 and very pleased with the second quarter from a free cash flow perspective. The debt position at the company at 1.6x, very manageable, especially with covenants of 3.75. And then our liquidity position, if you were to take what's available in the revolver and add it to the cash, is over $850 million. And to me, what a difference 90 days makes, we were coming out of Q1 with that same liquidity position closer to $500 million. So $350 million higher going into the back half of the year.  All those things then give us the optionality around return of cash to shareholders and investing in the business. We targeted $150 million of buybacks this year. We completed $150 million. We may resume the share repurchase in the future, but depending on market conditions and our capital needs, we still need to make that decision. We'll continue, obviously, to pay the dividend and invest in our highest margin growth opportunities both organically and inorganically. So I would best describe it as a balanced capital structure with really a lot of optionality but based on our liquidity position.
John Stauch: And then, Scott, your final question was really about mix in IFT. And I would say they're all relatively the same across the businesses, except we do better when agriculture does better. So we haven't seen that uptick in demand on ag this year as it pertains to OEM ag or spray irrigation ag, but that's the one piece of the portfolio we love when the market is strong.
Operator: Your next question comes from Bryan Blair with Oppenheimer.
Bryan Blair: I wanted to circle back on the runway for new pool demand for a minute. Is it reasonable, given construction backlogs, labor constraints, the limited length of the construction season, to assume that the spike in new pool demand is going to remain significantly supportive through 2021? Or am I oversimplifying that?
John Stauch: That's a reasonable expectation. Obviously, there's all kinds of things that you need to consider like economic impacts, how people are feeling about their 401(k)s, those type of things. But based upon the trends we've seen right now, it's very realistic to assume the scenario that you shared.
Bryan Blair: Okay. And you touched on M&A -- the M&A funnel in your prepared remarks. Has the pandemic in any way shifted, meaningfully impacted, the specific technologies or capabilities that are of interest to you as you scale Water Solutions or tuck-in to the pool platform?
John Stauch: Yes. I mean it's reinforced several. I think we just did a small one in pool that we think really fits nicely in the portfolio. It's in-floor cleaning, so as you build and create a remodeled pool, it's the ability to put the jets at the bottom of the pool to create more of a mixture of filtration capability. So that's an example of a technology that you wouldn't go retrofit, but you'd certainly put in a new and remodeled pool. And adding that as a portfolio is really nice to have.  As we think about where we want to take Water Solutions, we really believe more than ever now that the trends are going to shift faster, meaning people want touchless solutions when it comes to dispensing water. They're going to come back into office buildings and have a different feeling about the water they drink. And so people are going to maybe tend to think of branded water or certain forms of water being dispensed to a taste profile or a health profile that they seek. So all of those things were in our portfolio, and I feel we either want to accelerate the innovation internally or augment them with channel accelerators and/or service offerings into the markets that we'll go to. So I expect that we'll have some looks at some deals over the next 6 to 9 months. We're going to continue to be disciplined, as Bob said, because most of this capability we can do organically. But if there's an accelerator out there that we can put in as a bolt-on or tuck-in, we're going to consider it.
Operator: Your next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup.
Andrew Kaplowitz: You obviously had a big cash flow quarter in Q2, and we understand the cash flow strength and seasonality coming out of pool, but could you continue to see working capital tailwind in the second half, given the strength in pool? And obviously, your guidance have greater than or equal to 100% conversion. I mean it's a little vague. So given what we've seen already, it would suggest that you could see conversion well above 100%. So I don't know if you could just comment on that.
Robert Fishman: Yes. So I would describe this year as a typical year from a free cash flow perspective. I would not describe '18 and '19 as such because of movements in working capital. But to us, it's playing out like we thought it would.  In Q2, we saw strong cash collections and we did not have the headwind of payables in the first half that we had in '19. So that's 2 reasons why we're up so significantly at the turn. We'll continue to drive positive free cash flow in the back half of the year. What I really like about the profile right now is that the linearity, both in Q3 and Q4, is going to be much better than what it's been in the past. So I start each quarter off level-loading the plans and then having the opportunity to collect that cash. So I like the linearity.  We do have potential to be better than 100% of net income. That's what we're calling right now. But overall, I think we've got exactly the right focus on free cash flow. One of the things we've changed in the last 90 days is building out a free cash flow forecast down to the business level. And so we have accountability around everything from CapEx to inventory to cash taxes throughout the company. So it always helps me when the company as a whole are focused on this metric. So I expect we'll continue to have strong cash flow performance in the back half of the year.
Andrew Kaplowitz: And then, John, can you give us a little more color into your comments regarding frozen CapEx in industrial filtration? If I'm not mistaken, it's a backlog business, so could you comment on the backlog trends you're seeing? And then as your customers have slowly come off of shelter-in-place, have they started to spend at all? Or is it that they're just waiting for more economic certainty? I think you mentioned in the past that you had a number of self-help opportunities in this particular business, so what are they? And are they helping you at all?
John Stauch: Yes. It's a great question. I think when you think about our industrial filtration offerings and you think of food and beverage and then you think of our membrane applications into broad industrial, many of our customers just don't yet have any economic outlook for the business that they can feel comfortable at. And even within F&B, even though that the stay-at-home liquor and beer sales have been pretty tremendous, we have to offset that with the hospitality demand that has dropped off considerably. So a lot of our food and beverage and beer customers that we're very intimate with are considering beer manufacturing in remote locations around the world that they're uncomfortable making that strategic investment right now given where the pandemic is.  So we -- I don't want to say it's a freeze, and I've been very careful with that because our dialogue has really been about more where they're going to put it and when they're going to do it versus if they are.  And then on the industrial side, our customers, again, are in need of capital investment to accelerate productivity, and most of our membrane offerings create that, but they're in the evaluation stage of where those will be. So we've chosen that word carefully, pause, because we think it is really paused right now pending either more of a freeze or a reboot to that capital spend to drive the productivity they need.
Operator: Your next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: I want to circle back on the new pool construction industry, and we've been stuck at this 80,000 capacity for a while. Do you think the industry is going to put new capacity in place and you're seeing any signs of that? And how would that change your mix? I mean you're typically 85% more about aftermarket, but would that increase the new pool sales?
John Stauch: Yes. Deane, I don't know if I can get there yet. I mean last year, we did have a pullback, as we talked about, due to weather. And this year, there's a little catch-up. And we'll be looking at those pool permits and the pool permit trends by these states as we go forward.  I'm encouraged because I do think most people in these warm-weather states when they retire and/or they choose to be there, they look at the pool as a necessity for their lifestyle. So I think we believe that the trends are still in our favor. Where it goes and how fast it goes, I'm not ready to make that choice yet, Deane. I do think what we can do is continue to make you aware of if you have a pool, how we can help you maintain it better and how we connect you with our professional channel that can give you the solution that we feel is best for you.
Deane Dray: Got it. just an observation. I'm surprised that there's not more penetration of the variable speed pump because it is such a compelling economic decision. So anyway, that looks like the natural lift there is for more sales. And the second question on the Home app for automation. Where does that stand today? How many installations or users do you have? What's the expected pull-through in terms of products?  And then more of a qualitative question is, does that in any way put you in competition with the pool service folks? I mean these are your channel partners typically. Or does that enhance the relationship?
John Stauch: Yes. Deane, thank you for asking. I mean we soft-launched it, so we've got it in the test phase right now, around a couple products that we've introduced. And so I believe we'll start to see that acceleration into 2021. We want to make sure that we work the bugs out and we're giving you a better end-user experience. It brings all of our in-home products into one Pentair app and makes it more consumer-friendly. So we have a dealer-specific app that we'll have so that more technical needs and understanding will be supported through the dealer network. And then the consumer app will give you things more like things are good or I need more salt or I need to adjust appropriately.  We think it's actually going to augment and accelerate our dealer relationships, Deane, because the main point of the app, and I call it the -- quite a bad analogy now -- but I call it the Uber app, is how do we connect you with the best dealer for your particular solution or need? We still believe, and I strongly believe, that we're going to be best served if we're giving you the right expert decision for your water quality needs, and then we're connecting that with our best dealers to give you the best experience. So we're trying to create the awareness through the app and give you a better experience. But when you need something, we're not going to be at odds with them, we're going to connect the consumers through our best dealers.
Operator: Your next question comes from Damian Karas with UBS.
Damian Karas: Just a few minor model questions on my end. First, I want to ask you about the investment. It just -- it looks like you've been cutting back on R&D a little bit in the first half and in particular in the second quarter. I know you've talked about, John, continuing your long-term strategic investments. Just wondering if that's perhaps the result of maybe some of the facility shutdowns that you had in the second quarter? Or just any thoughts on what's going on there?
John Stauch: You nailed it. It wasn't by choice. It was because R&D was one of those functions that was hard to maintain at the consistent levels that we had prior year. It was the one function certainly in Pentair, but probably in the industry, that was hard to do remotely in work-from-home. And we are, candidly, on some of the key NPI programs, probably lost 90 days, and I would expect that R&D spend to pick up here in the back half of the year as we try to catch up on some of those interruptions in those projects. We are back now. Obviously, social distancing and working through all of the different requirements, but yes, that was a result of COVID, not from a strategic choice.
Robert Fishman: And I would just add to that. We do spend $60 million and $70 million of capital which is, to be honest, probably a little bit higher than what we talked about on our last call. And we look at that capital spend in 3 buckets: safety, growth and productivity. On the safety piece, we won't compromise on that. On growth and productivity, spending a little bit more there, building the business cases to drive positive NPV and holding the teams accountable. We also expect to see benefits from that spend in the future as well.
Damian Karas: Okay. Great. That makes sense. I'll leave it at that. I appreciate the time.
Operator: Your next question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel.
Nathan Jones: I guess I'll start just a question on the overall guide. I mean it looks like you've got pretty good visibility into a strong second half for pool, and it looks like you've taken a pretty conservative approach to the IFT business in the guidance. Can you just talk about how you approached giving guidance for the full year, particularly the second half? Have you taken a pretty conservative outlook to IFT where you're really confident that you can deliver that second-half guidance? And if things get a little bit better than you've built into the guide, then maybe there's some upside? Or do you think it's more of a realistic kind of look at the second half?
John Stauch: Yes. Nathan, I mean first of all, I'm pleased that we could introduce guidance again. I think it's important externally to frame the goalpost of what you're trying to accomplish, but also it's very important internally that people are working towards expectations and actions and targets that they're held accountable for. And I feel really good that we worked as hard as we could in Q2 to deliver the best result. And that's always been our goal here, how do we keep our people safe? And how do we continue to lean in and produce the best financial results possible? That being said, the fourth bullet that I put on that one slide is that uncertainty around how the pandemic plays out is still a question mark for us. It's easier to think about it now with only 6 months in front of us and really more like 5 as we work through July. So I think we've got a better reasonable estimate of where we're going to land. And so I think we think it's an appropriate expectation. And there are scenarios that get to the high end and there are scenarios that are on the low end, Nathan. But one of the things we don't want to do is have to pull back guidance because there may or may not be some issue that we have to deem to be material. So a big thought process was, what do we feel comfortable with? And how can we give The Street what they need and give ourselves what we need to continue to operationalize the business and then deliver the best financial results possible, Nathan.
Operator: Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.
Julian Mitchell: Maybe a question around the cost reduction. I think you alluded earlier in this call to some stepped up cost-cutting perhaps at the IFT segment. But if I look at the guidance provided in the release, it looks like you're only assuming about $4 million of restructuring for the year and maybe $1.5 million, $1 million or so in the second half. So just trying to understand, am I misreading that? Or is there a lot of pending restructuring to be announced? Or is the cost-cutting more of a variable-type approach and that sort of flows back once the top line recovers?
Robert Fishman: Yes. I would not associate any of the cost-reduction efforts relating to restructuring. We're primarily focused on our variable labor and our discretionary spend. So those typically do not bring significant restructuring costs with them. We'll continue to evaluate the top line and take actions as we need to, but the focus is primarily on those variable components.
Julian Mitchell: And then my second one, sticking with IFT. That relative resilience you saw in the commercial and infrastructure business, with the organic sales only down high single-digit in the quarter, is that a trend you think stays fairly similar through the second half? Or is there something where as the backlog softens, it gets worse? Just trying to understand what's moving that business specifically more, is it the backlog or is it the flow-driven part, and how you see them in the second half?
John Stauch: Was that specific to a business, in IFT? Or is that a broad item?
Julian Mitchell: Yes. Yes. No. So specifically around the commercial and infrastructure piece.
John Stauch: Yes. So we had a fairly decent backlog, and we saw orders remain strong through Q1. I think what you're feeling from us is the anticipation that I mean it's municipalities and some of the commercial building needs might be lower in the future. And so it's not necessarily indicative of a trend we know. It's more indicative sequentially of a trend we're anticipating.
Julian Mitchell: I see. So the down high single digits is a reasonable sort of run rate in that sense?
John Stauch: Yes. Yes.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to John Stauch for closing remarks.
John Stauch: Well, thank you for joining us today. We are all navigating these uncertain times together, and I would like to offer my best wishes to all of our employees, customers and shareholders and urge you to all stay safe as we grind through this pandemic. While no one is expecting the type of year we have all experienced, we continue to believe that Pentair has a strong foundation to build upon. We have a strong purpose, strong mission and strong vision focused on delivering smart, sustainable solutions that empower our customers to make the most of life's most essential resources. We believe that we are in attractive spaces that are expanding. We are a leader in helping people move, improve and enjoy their water, and we are making the world more sustainable through our smarter systems and applications. We have the right enterprise strategy, businesses, talent and culture. Our win right values, our leadership competencies and our Pentair integrated management system enable all of our employees to continuously improve customer experiences and deliver more predictable and consistent results.  Thank you for your continued interest. Mariama, you can conclude the call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-04-30 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thanking for standing by, and welcome to Pentair's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Jim Lucas. Please go ahead, sir.
Jim Lucas: Thanks, Shelby, and welcome to Pentair's first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. We are glad you could join us today. I am Jim Lucas, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. And with me today is John Stauch, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Borin, our Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, we will provide details on our first quarter 2020 performance outlined in this morning’s press release. Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the Company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as the risks outlined in Pentair's most recent Form 10-Q, Form 10-K, and today's press release. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today and the Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results. Today's webcast is accompanied by a presentation which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Pentair's website. We will reference these slides throughout our prepared remarks. Any references to non-GAAP financials are reconciled in the Appendix of the presentation. We will be sure to reserve time for questions-and-answers after our prepared remarks. I would like to request that you limit your questions to one and a follow-up in order to ensure everyone an opportunity to ask their questions. I will now turn the call over to John.
John Stauch: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide number 4 titled Executive Summary. This is certainly a historic time that we're experiencing and the last few months have tried the patience of the entire world and Pentair. I would like to extend my sincerest sympathies to all that have suffered loss during this horrific global pandemic. I want to also thank all of our employees, their continued efforts to stay safe and protect each other. We're taking care of our customers, and will continue to focus on delivering the best financial results possible. I also want to take a moment to thank our COVID-19 Crisis Response Team for all of their efforts to respond to this global challenge and a very special thank you to all of our manufacturing employees for their tremendous commitment to our customers and to Pentair. They truly represent the spirit of our culture. And I appreciate their dedication, their courage, and their contributions to the first quarter results. We were very pleased to deliver adjusted EPS for the quarter that was above the high-end of our prior guidance range, inclusive of the challenges from COVID-19 that initially impacted our business in China earlier in the quarter, and then globally toward the end of the quarter. We also recently announced key hires for CFO and for our previously announced segment structure. First, I would like to welcome Bob Fishman, who will become CFO tomorrow, May 1, as part of an orderly transition for Mark Borin who previously announced he would be leaving Pentair for another opportunity. Bob joins Pentair after a long successful career at MCR, where he was a central part of the company's transformation from a hardware and systems manufacturer into a software and services provider. We also announced the hiring of Mario D'Ovidio to lead our Consumer Solutions segment. Mario joins us most recently from Electrolux and brings a strong background from several consumer influenced businesses focused on multiple channels. Mario will bring a growth mindset and a sense of urgency to our Consumer Solutions businesses. Jerome Pedretti who has been with Pentair for nearly 15 years will lead our Industrial & Flow Technologies segment. Jerome has held experiences at Pentair and has proven himself as a developer of talent. He also embraces our PIMS processes and culture, and we utilize his experiences to improve the operating capabilities of the Industrial & Flow Technologies businesses. Finally, we announced the elimination of the COO role, and that Karl Frykman, will help oversee an orderly transition with Mario and will also work with me to the end of the year as a Special Advisor. I would like to personally thank Karl for his leadership and partnership over the years. Turning back to market demand, when we formally withdraw our quarter and annual guidance at the end of March, due to lack of visibility, we're planning for significantly reduced demand throughout the remainder of 2020. We do not have clarity at this time around the potential impacts to each of our lines of business or when the markets will recover. Because of lack of clarity, we're taking appropriate actions to adjust our cost structure, while still keeping a focus on the longer-term as we expect that demand will eventually return for most of our businesses. Finally, we're focused on maintaining a strong liquidity position. Pentair is a long track record of being a strong cash flow generator, and our balance sheet is in a solid position. We understand that the remainder of the year will be a challenge to bring uncertainty. However, we believe that our strong operating culture and well-positioned businesses will eventually prevail over this pandemic and its impacts on the economy. Please turn to Slide 5 labeled COVID-19 update and focus. Our focus has been and will continue to be on the safety and well-being of our employees, while also being mindful of serving customer demand to the best of our abilities. Our business in China and Southeast Asia saw considerable negative impact in the first quarter, but we did not see much impact in Europe or the U.S. until later in the quarter. While we have seen our operations in China return to more normalized levels, demand still has not returned to China and Southeast Asia to levels before the pandemic. Outside of China, we have seen softening demand to start April, and we took actions to reduce the bottom-line impact of expected revenue declines. In the short-term, we're focused on cost reductions in line with lower revenue levels. We feel good about our balance sheet, cash flow, and liquidity and believe that we are well prepared to survive the storm. We remain focused on our long-term goals and strategy, and we will continue to prepare to take advantage of opportunities when business recovers. Please turn to Slide 6, labeled Consumer Solutions. I want to spend a few moments on our portfolio exposure and what demand trends we are currently experiencing. Consumer Solutions is a $1.6 billion segment comprised of our pool and our water solutions businesses. As you can see on this slide, Consumer Solutions is approximately 75% residential and approximately 75% of the revenue serves installed/aftermarket base. Our pool business is a leader in the North American pool equipment business. There are approximately 5.5 million pools installed in the ground. Our dealers continue to operate in most geographies and we expect the aftermarket business which represents roughly 80% of our pool business to see some short-term softness, but not to the extent that we might expect will occur in the new pool construction and remodeling parts of the business. While we had a solid start to the season in March, we have seen some softness to start April. We believe that inventory levels in the channel are in line with historic levels. But we'll be monitoring demand throughout the season. Our Water Solutions business is made up of components, residential systems, and commercial systems. Within our components business, we have not yet seen many changes within the important wholesale channel. Residential systems, which includes the Aquion and Pelican businesses we acquired last year are somewhat dependent on in-home visits and retail traffic. While we have not yet seen a material drop-off in demand, there are concerns over consumer behavior in the short-term. Finally, our commercial systems business has large exposure to restaurants and hospitality. They've seen significant slowing of demand, as expected with the closures of businesses in these industries. While we expect some short-term disruptions for our Consumer Solutions segment, we continue to believe that water quality will remain a key focus for consumers and other commercial businesses and we anticipate this business will be well-positioned when markets eventually recover. Please turn to Slide 7, labeled Industrial & Flow Technologies. Industrial & Flow Technologies or IFT is a $1.3 billion segment comprised of our Residential and Irrigation Flow, Commercial and Infrastructure flow, and Industrial Filtration businesses. As you can see, IFT is a more diverse segment than Consumer Solutions with approximately half of sales tied to various industrial markets. IFT does however generate approximately 65% of sales in the installed aftermarket base. Within Residential and Irrigation flow, we have seen some slowing among our distributors. So this is more in the retail and professional channel. This business is where we have some exposure to agriculture and while the OEM exposed business is down, our aftermarket business is performing better than it did a year-ago. It is important to note that the majority of the Residential and Irrigation flow portfolio consists of products that are breaking sticks in nature and tend to be less discretionary purchases. Our Commercial and Infrastructure Flow business manufacturers' larger engineered pumps, it tends to be a backlog-driven business. Our commercial businesses have seen some slowing of orders but backlog has not yet been impacted. Within infrastructure, which is the smaller piece of this business, we're seeing strong backlog but we'll be watching orders for any signs of slowing given this is a long cycle business. Our Industrial Filtration business is comprised of a number of product lines that serve a wide variety of applications. For instance, we have a strong niche in beer membrane filtration, and other components of the beer industry. We also have a sustainable gas business that recycles CO2. We continue to feel comfortable about our overall portfolio given our large installed base and limited industrial manufacturing exposure. Our products are solutions that help customers solve needs and will be prepared to serve demand when it returns. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mark Borin to discuss our financial position and our results in more detail.
Mark Borin: Thank you, John. Before discussing the business, I want to first welcome Bob to the team and I feel proud to be leaving a strong finance and IT team as I move on to the next chapter of my career. It is hard to leave after 12 years with Pentair, but I believe the company is well-positioned and will emerge from this current situation stronger as a leading water treatment company. Please turn to Slide 8 labeled cost structure and actions. This chart is to help illustrate our cost structure and the levers available to us as the top-line visibility remains challenged. Materials is our biggest cost at approximately 40% of sales, and is the one piece of our structure that is truly variable. We're engaged in a number of supplier rapid renegotiations to continuously look for opportunities to further reduce input costs. The rest of the cost structure has variability but requires actions on our part and many of the actions come with causes and/or consequence. In the short-term, we will look to drive manufacturing labor reductions in line with volume declines with temporary measures such as furloughs to keep as much of the team intact for the eventual recovery. Although a significant portion of our overhead is fixed, we are focused on deferring and reducing non-labor outside spending. We're targeting overhead reduction at roughly half of the potential volume drop. On the operating expense side, we have implemented hiring freezes and we're driving significant savings from delaying, reducing, or eliminating purchase services and travel. There are other costs to go after depending on the extent and level of the volume decline. And we also recognize if the decline is expected globally in the second quarter carryover to the remainder of the year, then sales and management incentive plans may not pay out at planned levels. We're taking necessary actions in the short-term to mitigate the expected top-line decreases and we'll watch closely for signs of stabilization before looking to pull additional levers. Our goal is to manage through this environment to the best of our abilities, while doing what we can to prepare for an eventual recovery. Please turn to Slide 9 labeled balance sheet and access to liquidity. With liquidity and focus, we want to spend a few minutes highlighting why we feel comfortable with our financial position. As this slide illustrates, we do not have any meaningful debt maturities for the next few years. We ended the quarter with $169 million in cash and $326 million available under our revolver. Given the seasonality of our pool business, we tend to use cash in the first quarter, and our second quarter tends to be our strongest cash generating period, given the collection on the pool receivables. We do not expect that trend to change this year and therefore we anticipate our financial position strengthening even further as the second quarter progresses. We ended the first quarter with a leverage ratio of 2.1 times which is well below our 3.7 times covenants. Given the dramatically changing environment, we have lowered our capital expenditures forecast by over 10% for the year. During the first quarter, we repurchased $115 million of our shares. But we suspended the buyback during the quarter and are currently choosing to remain on the sidelines as we focus on our strong liquidity. Please turn to Slide 10 labeled balance sheet and cash flow. This is our standard slide we present each quarter. On the left hand side of the page, our free cash flow improved rather dramatically from the comparable period last year. As we highlighted on our fourth quarter earnings call, we did see some timing issues around payables at the start of 2019. But we believe that this year's performance is more reflective of our normal seasonal pattern. The right hand side of the page highlights our debt position at the end of the quarter. While we covered our liquidity position on the previous slide, we would point out that we have a healthy mix between fixed and variable debt, our average borrowing rate for the quarter was a very respectable 2.6% and we ended the quarter with 14.4% ROIC. Overall, we feel our balance sheet is strong and while the outlook for the P&L in the near term is a bit challenging given the lack of visibility, we believe that our balance sheet is well-positioned to help us navigate through these uncertain times. Please turn to Slide 11 labeled Q1 20 Pentair performance. For the first quarter overall sales grew 3% and core sales also increased 3%. Segment income grew 13%, return on sales expanded 140 basis points, and adjusted EPS increased 21%. This performance was helped by positive sales mix, price costs, and productivity. Below the line we saw an adjusted tax rate of 16%, net interest other expense of $7.5 million, and our average shares in the quarter were 168.7 million. Please turn to Slide 12 labeled Q1 '20 Consumer Solutions performance. Consumer Solutions saw sales increase 9% with core sales growing 7%. Pool grew at a low double-digit rate against an easy comp and more normal weather pattern. The pool season appeared to start-off more positively this year. And as John alluded to earlier in the call, it seems anecdotally that pool owners who are sheltered in place are opening their pools perhaps a bit earlier than normal. Our Water Solutions business grew high-single-digits in the quarter as positive acquisition contribution help offset sharp declines in China and Southeast Asia that were impacted by the global pandemic. Within the larger U.S. market, demand had not begun to falloff at the end of the quarter and we are monitoring trends closely. The segment had strong segment income performance growing 13% year-over-year and ROS expanded 80 basis points to 21.8%. We are pleased with a strong start to the year by Consumer Solutions, but we expect that this will reverse course in the second quarter. While we plan to manage the cost structure accordingly, we remain focused on the long-term opportunities for the segment. Please turn to Slide 13 labeled Q1 '20 Industrial & Flow Technologies performance. IFT reported a 3% decline in sales with core growth down 2%. Residential and Irrigation flow saw flat sales performance as positive pricing and a still healthy professional channel was not enough to offset weakness in agriculture and retail. Commercial and Infrastructure Flow experienced a mid-single-digit decline in sales, as some of the backlog-driven business was negatively impacted by COVID-19 related delays. In addition, we continue to focus on improving internal delivery rates for this business, but overall backlog remains solid and we are monitoring the order book closely. Industrial Filtration saw sales decline low-single-digits due primarily to global delays and global projects. Similar to Commercial and Infrastructure Flow, this is a backlog-driven business and we will also be closely monitoring the order book for the business. Segment income was a positive story with a 9% year-over-year increase and ROS improved 150 basis points to 13.9%. While mix and price costs were positive contributors, productivity was especially strong. While its mix of businesses will create some near-term challenges for IFT, there remain a number of self-health opportunities that we remain focused on intently. I would now like to turn the call over to John to discuss our assumptions for the rest of 2020.
John Stauch: Thank you, Mark. Please turn to Slide number 14 labeled 2020 current planning assumptions. While we have suspended our guidance until better visibility returns, we wanted to provide some of our current planning assumptions to help you understand how we're approaching the outlook for the remainder of the year. First, we are planning for recessionary environment. Forecasts call for double-digit declines in GDP in the short-term and it's hard to imagine that we would be immune from these external forces. While we have some businesses that may fare a little better than others such as our pool and water solutions businesses, other parts of the portfolio might see more significant near-term headwinds. As a result, as Mark highlighted earlier, we are aligning our costs with a lower expected value. We do have additional cost levers to pull if necessary. But we want to be thoughtful in pulling any of these levers too soon. We've made a number of significant investments to better position our Consumer Solutions business. And while we may delay some of those investments, we do not want to cut them off altogether. Our Pentair employees have been a big part of building our businesses. And I would like to keep our talented teams in place. And I'm hopeful that we can weather the storm and aggressively pursue opportunities in our segments as the economy recovers. As Mark highlighted earlier, we feel our liquidity is in a very strong position. We have historically been a strong cash flow generator. And I believe that we're well-positioned financially to weather this uncertain environment. Finally, our goals remain on protecting our employees, customers, and our businesses. We will continue to optimize our free cash flow and liquidity. And we expect to deliver the best financial results possible in near-term, while focused on our longer-term strategies. Before I turn the call over to Shelby for Q&A, I want to thank Mark for his partnership to me since 2008, and his tireless dedication to Pentair. I'm sure when Mark said he would stay to oversee a smooth transition, he never envisioned a quarter like this. I'm very excited to have Bob on board and he and Mark are driving a seamless transition. I'm very confident that Bob will be a great replacement for Mark, but I'm still losing and will miss one of my best friends. I wish you all the best, Mark. You truly deserve it. I would now like to turn the call over to Shelby for Q&A after which I will have a few closing remarks. Shelby, please open the line for questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley.
John Stauch: Hello Josh Pokrzywinski, how are you?
Josh Pokrzywinski: Hi, good morning guys.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Well thanks. How are you guys doing?
John Stauch: Good.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Excellent. So I guess just first question anything that you can share with us, John, on exit rate, any kind of shutdown impact, impacting the commercial and hospitality level? Just trying to get a sense of maybe kind of the snap the line impact on demand today?
John Stauch: Yes, Josh, I mean clearly we thought we're going to have a Q1 and quite frankly, it would have even been better than it was given the fact that we had to at given times we had five factories that were completely closed, and we were working through all of the global challenges around the shelter in place or the orders, country-by-country. So as I'm sure many companies have already shared that that became a little bit disruptive. Really proud of the teams about how they moved to create the social distancing and get most of our factories up and running because we didn't see supply chain disruptions very much but we did leave a little bit of backlog heading into the quarter. We did see starting April that the order rates are declining. And as I mentioned in my comments, we're not going to be immune. I think the fact that most global restaurants hospitality, et cetera closed, it's going to take a while for our distribution channel to balance that inventory need. One of the things we did learn though is that when these restaurants come back and open up, they're more likely to change those cartridges out for our water filtration unit. So that's the visibility we need to actually be able to call it. But across the portfolio as we started April, we certainly started to see order declines and revenue declines.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Got it. And maybe just a follow-up that might be a little bit easier to point to, anything in the portfolio or any sites that are closed as non-essential as we sit here today?
John Stauch: Right now all of our factories are open. The degree of open and degree of capacity varies obviously, Josh, but right now we have 100% of our facilities deemed to be essential and therefore available to produce product.
Operator: Your next question is from Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jeff Hammond: So really understand that the guidance pull but just trying to get a better sense of kind of April trends, as we and I don't know if you can go through either by business, what you're seeing in order of magnitude or what's proving most resilient versus most challenged as you look across the board, just trying to get a sharper more granularity there.
John Stauch: Yes, Jeff, I appreciate the question. I mean I'd answer it a couple ways. First of all, we're global business, as you know, so everything's in a very degree of response to what's going on with this pandemic. I don't think April's a great month to judge anything on in general just because it's a very short month; it's got some holidays in. But if I put it in a context, I mean nothing was immune from an order softness, even including our pool business. As we mentioned, in our comments, I do think while we believe our pool business is likely to hold up through this at least Q2 because it is a key season and we do think those in-ground pools are going to be serviced, we do think that we're going to see a slowdown or push-out as some of the remodeling or the new pool builds as people monitor their spends. So I would just say overall, I mean we saw a pretty sharp decline in April to start. And we think our steepest decline for the year will be Q2. That being said, we also have the season for most of our businesses that might help mitigate it. So we're in a observe mode here for the next week or two as we watch orders and the order patterns. And also as we make sure that we're checking beyond our distributors into the sell-through into the channels, because that's key for us is what's tapping the sell-through to the consumer and then we can make our decisions on what we think the buy is going to be for the rest of the year.
Jeff Hammond: Okay. And then so you mentioned pool is maybe one of the more resilient ones what specifically are seeing the sharpest declines into April?
John Stauch: I would say things like Ag OEM where we have the OEM offerings or we have into maintenance or equipment builds that would be on the sharper side, but they're here in the sort of like a 20% decline kind of range.
Jeff Hammond: Okay. And then just on the Industrial segment, margins looked really good there. If you were to see a 10% to 15% decline in that business on a full-year basis like what -- how resilient can the margins be or how should we think about decrementals?
John Stauch: We're thinking mid-30s.
Operator: Your next question is from Steve Tusa of JP Morgan.
Steve Tusa: Sorry that that last answer was that for kind of total company what you would target for, what was that decremental margin comment again related to?
John Stauch: I would say the question was specifically to IFT but I would say it would be relatively same across both ends of the portfolio and so that's both the total company and an IFT response.
Steve Tusa: And that's for 2Q or that's for like total year?
John Stauch: I would say if you look at the revenue for the total year, I think that would be the relative expectation we would have. So sales minus material, and then mitigated by cost actions to get to somewhere around a mid-30s decremental.
Steve Tusa: And are you taking any of these cost actions? Are you taking structural costs? Do we see -- are we going to see restructuring go up? Or is it more of the temporary actions like furloughs and things like that and just kind of waiting and seeing how the volumes play out?
John Stauch: Yes, our actions right now been limited to trying to pace the manufacturing labor in accordance with the volume declines and utilizing furloughs in those particular areas to make sure our employees are well taken care of and be there when the volume comes back as well as aggressively attacking purchase services and obviously getting benefits from things like PED and no Trade Shows for remainder of the year, Steve. So that's been where we are today which has been a cash focus. We have not yet looked at those 2008, 2009 levers, those are the ones that we're talking about would be the next lever to pull or any permanent reductions. And that would be based upon how we see things start to uncover here as we work our way through Q2.
Steve Tusa: Got it. Okay. And is there a revenue decline that kind of breaks those decrementals like if revenues are down, I know Lennox talked about if revenues are down greater than 20% that they're decrementals kind of go to hell are you, a) is there like a level of revenue that you're thinking about that like hey, all bets are off on kind of those, those decrementals for you guys?
John Stauch: I think you probably gave a pretty good answer there that once you get up to that like mid-20s then I think our decrementals start to get worse, right? I mean there's a level one of actions we're taking right now, we feel very confident. If volume continues to get challenged, we take that next set of actions and can still hold those decrementals. But yes, when you start, if you got up to like a mid-20 number, I think the decrementals would start to get worse. I don't see that at the moment, I don't see that happening in the long-term. And so what we're really looking at is really where are the longer-term order rates are and where are the longer-term sell-throughs for our products, and then have more visibility of product line by product line, what we think the impact is going to be, not just for 2020 but what we think a potential recovery could be into 2021. So I mean, really what we're doing is trying to position ourselves as best for how we recover.
Steve Tusa: Right. And what are you seeing so far in April in the pool business?
John Stauch: Sell-throughs have hung in through the visibility that we have not to our original forecasts, but we're doing relatively okay. But as I mentioned, I would be concerned as we proceed here through Q2 and Q3 that we start to see a slowdown or a pullback in the new construction build side or the new remodel which is a much higher price tag for the end consumer.
Steve Tusa: Got it. One last one for you. Inflation has been kind of a stubborn drag for you guys. Any potential relief there? And then on free cash flow, can you guys kind of as volumes go down, can you translate that into better cash release some working capital?
John Stauch: Yes. Mark? You want to --
Mark Borin: Yes. So first just on inflation is we talked previously, certainly see that moderating this year and continuing to just focus on kind of that price cost being more neutral and not being the headwind that has been in the past so and looking for opportunities to mitigate continued inflationary pressures. So pursuing those things pretty aggressively. And then on the cash flow side, that's certainly the way we would think about it as well as is looking -- as we see that volume decline looking for opportunities on the working capital side to help us further, further improve the overall cash flow performance. But keeping track of it as you would expect really, really close monitoring of our customer receivables and ensuring that we feel comfortable that that those are continued to be credit worthy. And those are going to come in as planned, managing and monitoring our payables. And then being opportunistic, if necessary, to the extent we see places where we can help customers. We haven't seen a significant amount of that yet. But if opportunities come up where we need to help customers or work with our suppliers, we're certainly going to look at that as well all within the context of managing our own liquidity, which as I said in my comments we feel very good about.
Operator: Your next question is from Brian Lee of Goldman Sachs.
Brian Lee: Good morning, not to beat a dead horse here. But just on the pool business, know a lot of focus here just around the run rates and sort of activity levels you're seeing just because it's such a big piece of the business for you. And it sounds like it's been more resilient here at least in the early part of this COVID crisis. Would you say that, it's actually been tracking better year-on-year, even through the month of April. I know you're saying there's some slowdown, but the comps from last year, at least for the early part of Q2 are pretty, pretty solid. So wondering if you're still tracking better to that degree in the pool business?
John Stauch: I'd say no. I mean, I just clearly share with you where we are. I mean, the sell-through to us matters because it's ultimately an indicator of how our distribution channel is going to prepare to support the dealer channel for those views and held up, like I said, for the most part, but we expect that as we move through Q2 and head into Q3 that we're going to see the order rates decline primarily around servicing those new pools or remodel pools. That's the working assumption right now. So I would say as we head into Q2, I don't think this pool business will fare better, it's not going to be immune to a year-over-year headwind.
Brian Lee: Okay, fair enough. And then just a second question here on price, you had a positive two points here in Q1. Just wondering if you're expecting this to soften through 2020 given the weaker demand outlook, or just maybe if you could provide some context around how you've seen pricing trends in prior downturns and how you'd expect this one to compare to those?
Mark Borin: Given the nature of our business, much of it through distribution, we would expect to see kind of price continue to readout. A lot of that price has already been put in and so it's in place. And it's at lower levels, again as I mentioned earlier, lower levels than we saw in late 2018 and into 2019. But continue to expect to see kind of price readout and again offset inflation.
John Stauch: And I think if we thought about price adjustments as we head in 2021, that's probably where you'd see less of an increase if things continue the way they were.
Operator: Your next question comes from Joe Giordano of Cowen.
Joe Giordano: I apologize if you touched on any of these things in your prepared remarks, I had some issues getting into the call, but can you talk about the spending that you're going to plan on doing for some of the new tech enabled parts of the consumer platform like how does that change in an environment where you're managing cash and there might be slower adoptions of these things as consumers are a little bit weaker. So can you just talk about how you're thinking about those businesses going to help, how kind of fundamental they are to the forward view of the dumping?
John Stauch: Yes, so just to put in perspective, the big consumer enabled investment we're making across Consumer Solutions is really the front-end win capability to be able to create a digital lead and to be able to transact that lead all the way into a collection. That project is ongoing; it will be completed by the end of the year. But order of magnitude think about a $3 million to $5 million kind of cash flow spend there, so not sizeable or significant in any one quarter and certainly something that I want to get after because of the impact it has in the business. There's natural delays in spend things like new product developments, new product development actions. Those are going to delay even if I didn't want them to because our lab capacity is not yet back up to 100% and a lot of new product designs are being pushed a little bit, at least a quarter to the right. As I mentioned, the Trade Shows, the marketing activities, et cetera, they're going to have a lot less impact. And so they're easier to moderate the spend on as we think about the investment cycle and the value of that investment. So I mean I think the only one that I'm keeping going really is our web enabled and I think it's important that we continue to build our brand and lean into this as a water expert, and a Consumer Solutions leader and that that's really, just that web capability, which I think is pretty modest given our overall cash generation.
Joe Giordano: And how you're thinking about like the pacing of like once economy is open, how willing are people going to be to have people in their house, so how fast do commercial facility start ramp-up like I know you're not giving forward guidance but how you guys kind of framing that out once kind of orders are lifted?
John Stauch: No, you got it right. And in my remarks, I said our Consumer Solutions water business or Water Solutions has several different channels. There's the traditional lead generation which would be more localized in nature, health probably not going to state fairs to do that business or kitchen and bath show, but you're still doing direct mail. We're seeing a lower response rate as far as the overall customer asking people to come and do the water filtration installs. That being said, we have a higher yield of the people that are asking to the actual convert, right. So less quotes but overall a higher percent of those quotes turning into sales. And that's what we're monitoring here as we move through. I mean other industries are dealing with this too. And I think we're just moving to contact less visits, training our employees to not touch things while they're there, looking at wearing masks, all those types of things to prepare for a safety environment. So we'll see how that unfolds in the next couple of quarters that's really where we're, Joe.
Joe Giordano: Okay, and just last for me, I'm just done. Can you touch on the productivity you saw on consumers this quarter being a little bit light?
John Stauch: Yes, I would say primarily two things mix of business. As I recall, I mean both businesses did fair bit well. We did have some challenges to get product out in our pool business. We continued some of those investments, as I said, but we also had to move to the shelter and place expectations primarily in China first where we had China shutdown. And so across all of our factories even though we were up and running between social distance things and the types of things we had to do to keep those factories running, we certainly weren't at 100% of our expected productivity yields.
Operator: Your next question is from Andy Kaplowitz of Citigroup.
Andy Kaplowitz: John, can you talk about your China and Southeast Asian business in particular, you had good momentum going into the pandemic. You mentioned you're back online, but demand hasn't recovered. So where is it versus pre-pandemic demand and is there any more color you can give us in the shape of the recovery? Is it UV? Anything more that you can give us there?
John Stauch: Yes, I can. I obviously am very interesting curious of how things unfold because they were the first experiencing -- experience things they're first to go back to normal or you saw they work. But candidly even though we're having and seeing restaurants open in China, we're not seeing the traffic in those restaurants anywhere near pre-pandemic and think of that maybe is a third or 50% and the aspects of people coming back into the capacity used to have. When it comes to the residential commercial side and the retail elements, the way people transacted was going into a retail area, looking at the particular device that they wanted to buy, and then ordering online, that traffic is also a lot slower than it was pandemic. So while our capacity is up and running, we're seeing demand slowly recover but at a very moderated rate. And I can't predict when it's going to come back to pre-pandemic levels. But let's say it's climbing up the curve slowly.
Andy Kaplowitz: That's helpful. And then if I look at your food and beverage filtration business around the world, not just China obviously, you talked about it falling-off significantly, when the shelter in-place initiatives ramped up, has that rate of decline stabilized yet outside of China and how much overall exposures you have to that particular filtration business?
John Stauch: Yes, so a couple of things. In filtration our F&B is really around pure membrane filtration components into dairy into beer and then as the CO2 recovering the sustainability. So productivity and efficiency is what it really promotes on the Industrial Filtration side, that business is still doing relatively okay, especially given the fact that beverage is generally up across the world. If you flip that into Consumer Solutions, that's where we've got the water filtration into hospitality. So hotels, restaurants that is the business that's been extremely challenged. And while we expect that to come -- start coming back online as we see states and countries open, I think that's going to be a long slug to get back to anywhere near pre-pandemic levels.
Operator: Your next question comes from Saree Boroditsky of Jefferies.
Saree Boroditsky: Thanks. So you suspended your share repurchases on lower CapEx in the quarter. Could you just talk to how you're thinking about capital deployment in this current environment? And what was unique in the market in order to start lifting these restrictions?
Mark Borin: Sure. As I talked about, the really a very strong focus on liquidity and maintaining our liquidity in light of the uncertainty and so we're going to wait and see with respect to share repurchases and just how we deploy and utilize our capital. So really pulling that back and sitting on the sideline and waiting to see how things play out. We continue to pay our dividend and that's something that's very important to us. And so we'll continue to look at that as well. But that would be something that we would see as a priority, as we think about how we're allocating and spending our capital.
Saree Boroditsky: And then you highlighted material savings as one cost stuff that you're targeting. Could you provide some color on how your conversations with suppliers are progressing and are you getting any pushback there?
John Stauch: Yes, couple of things. I mean I want to be clear. I mean, as far as direct sourcing savings, we're expecting inflation to moderate, but I haven't put a lot of savings into the forecast regarding that just because of the length of time it takes to realize. What I was talking to is purchase services more discretionary spend or outside purchased services. And listen we're not the only company doing that. So delaying, deferring, eliminating is really what we're doing there. So it's not really supplier negotiations, more of our choice not to spend.
Operator: Your next question is from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Hey just wanted to wish Mark all the best and a welcome to Bob when he starts I think you said tomorrow.
John Stauch: Well, he's actually officially there tomorrow. He's been here for --
Mark Borin: He's been here for two weeks and he's intently listening to this call.
John Stauch: And he's listening on this forecast. He owns this forecast. And he's been a big part of it. So thank you, Deane.
Deane Dray: That's good to hear. All right. So first question, I guess I'm qualified as one of these high quality problems to ask because I'm still kind of unclear. Why did you pull the first quarter guidance, when you ended up with what we would consider a high quality beat? You've pulled the guidance in right towards the end of March so you probably had a good sense of how you were going to shake out in the quarter?
John Stauch: Yes, I appreciate it Deane. That is a great question, I mean, but here's really where I was at. I got to a point where we have large facilities, especially at support pool and pool as you know is a big piece of our overall revenue stream. And as these state shelter and places started to be named and there was confusion about what was essential and non-essential, I felt we needed to pull the guidance because the decision on any given day could become a material event to Pentair's earnings and disclosures. So we were able to work through those better than I anticipated and we shipped more products than I thought we would. But that's -- that's the short answer to you.
Deane Dray: That's -- that's real helpful. And just on that theme because we were watching this carefully regarding which businesses states were saying were essential, and it wasn't clear whether pool servicing was going to be consistently considered essential or not like in Connecticut, it was in parts of New York and not the whole state, it was not. So where does that stand in terms of state-by-state? I will not go through them all, but just are they all now considered essential or are there pockets where it's not?
John Stauch: I would struggle saying all. I think we're well into the 90% type of range where our pool dealers are sharing with us that they're servicing pools in their particular areas, and probably even higher than that and pool turns green if you don't do anything with it. So it's also an outdoor backyard type of activity. So I think they've been able to work through that relatively well-being. But we're in constant contact with that channel that channel is reporting that they're back servicing pools for sure.
Deane Dray: Yes, we agree. We think that's well-positioned. And then last question is I know it's not a big piece of the business but on the municipal side, what's your sense of the muni-budgets over the near-term, a big chunk of your businesses break and fix that tends to be really resilience but in terms of projects, there's usually a delay before munis start pulling back, but is there anything different this time? What's your expectation?
John Stauch: I think it's lack of visibility right now, Deane. I mean one hand you would say in your gut, that states are going to be challenged certainly for budgets and tax revenue. And they're going to see a compression of the overall tax revenue and how to spend it. So you'd say that that would be a negative potential headwind that would start to unfold in Q3 and Q4. In the same sense, a lot of these states and the federal government are talking about infrastructure builds to try to get people working again. So I don't know yet. And that's a big part of the lack of visibility that we're referring to. So we're monitoring the backlog. We're monitoring the orders. It is a break and fix for the most part, Deane. But that's the one that I really have no visibility into at the moment.
Operator: Your next question is from Nathan Jones with Stifel.
Nathan Jones: I'd like to start on channel inventories outside of pool; I think you said on the pool business you think the channel inventories there are okay. But could you comment on the channel inventories outside of pool, any expectations you have for destocking and what kind of impact that could have on the top-line over the next two, three quarters?
John Stauch: No, I really -- really don't have the specificity except everything looks more normal, Nathan, it doesn't walk out of line. That being said, we don't yet have all of that visibility around the sell-through into the dealers, into the channel. And one of the things we'll be monitoring. One of the areas that I would envision the inventory being slightly high, and I don't mean by a lot, but a little bit would be in the foodservice area where if we think about our revenue streams as we exited the quarter to where we are and what mode that channel is in right now. I think these inventory in the channel will service the startups and will have that slower ramp-up in that particular business than we will in most of the others.
Nathan Jones: Fair enough. A follow-up on that productivity question from earlier. With volumes likely to decline ahead here, does that put pressure on your expected productivity numbers for the year? If we take out discrete events like having to close down a facility or something like that and the impact that could have? Or are you able to accelerate productivity actions to make up for that, just how you're thinking about productivity in a declining volume environment?
John Stauch: No, you're right it does put pressure. And if you don't get the cost out in the labor and the overhead in the factory, you end up producing unwanted inventory which usually challenges you and the recovery occurs. So it is the keenly -- it is the most focused area we are. We also learned and the last recoveries both in this one in valves and control to the downturns in 2008/2009. And valves and controls is the area that you got to have the most amount of focus on because if you don't get after that cost on the input side, you don't see in the short run from a P&L issue but you start seeing it in the form of cash and then you don't benefit when the market recovers as I said. So it is Playbook 101 to make sure we're pacing that manufacturing cost with the downturn volume and it should reflect orders more than sales data.
Nathan Jones: Okay, I've got one more. I'm going to have one more crack at the top-line question because we don't have a lot of historical data about these businesses and how they've reacted in recessions. You said you're preparing for a recessionary environment. Can you give us any color on what these businesses have typically seen in a recessionary environment? And whether it's a reasonable expectation for this time to be shorter and sharper than historically?
John Stauch: Nathan, I got all of these notes in front of me. Don't give guidance on revenue. Don't get -- I'm not going to give it to you even though you asked it different way. I mean, here's the challenge we have, this is not like anything we've seen before. When we took a look at this and people say looking at 2008/2009, you're looking at 2000. What recession are you going back to? Keep in mind our businesses got residential, significant residential exposure. And when we entered that 2006, 2007, 2008 timeframe, we're talking about housing starts, two to three times normal levels. And that that was an inventory that had to work its way down. We're not in that situation with housing today. Where we're at is the pandemic is causing stay at homes, it's causing loss of employment, it's causing stress to people on where are they in their spending patterns. And until there's visibility there, it's hard to predict how those wallets can open up again, and then how that demand comes back across our businesses. That's -- that's why I can't give you a number, Nathan.
Operator: Your next question is from Scott Graham of Rosenblatt Securities.
Scott Graham: Yes. Hey, good morning, and good luck to you, Mark.
Mark Borin: Thanks, Scott.
John Stauch: Thanks, Scott.
Scott Graham: So I'm going to beat that dead horse a little bit further. I'm sorry, but that's the best way. So, we are April 30 and we're kind of the first month and you were kind of giving us some order rate numbers as sort of we turned into April, I guess I was curious to understand that the use of the word sharp, which we're just trying to hang on to anything here to try to make our models work, essentially. And then you turned around and you the first place you went to was Ag which is a very small business and you said down 20, down 20 doesn't feel sharp to me, maybe that's to you, but if Ag OEM down 20 in April on orders, are you suggesting that that was the worst business model?
John Stauch: That is sharp. That's -- I would think -- I feel sharp to me, especially given the Q1 we had, Scott. So keep in mind, we're continuing to see orders rising throughout Q1. And even though the pandemic worked its way across the globe in various degrees, we did still see demand hang in there to what would have likely been up until the last couple of weeks of March. And even some of that was, we still saw orders, we didn't know if that was customers buying inventory with the anticipation of supply chain disruption et cetera, et cetera. So but you had an April and I think most people have been very planful the way they thought about reacting to shelters in place and overall volume and demand. And just like us, if we're going to see a decrease in Q2, I mean shouldn't we pace our manufacturing in line with that that expected decline and get in front of it in a planful way as I think a lot of our customers were doing. So yes, you got the outer end of where I think Q2 could be. But that being said, I don't think April was indicative of any pattern or trend yet. And as we enter into May and June, we'll have a much better clarity, primarily because this is our season. This is usually our peak quarter in the year, Scott.
Scott Graham: Yes, no understood, understood that was great additional color. Thank you. Just one other question. And I'm hoping you can connect these thoughts maybe very simply. You have in your decremental of 60, and that's with no cost actions. And you're now alluding to a sort of mid-30s number. So can I take that to mean that that line, that connection is very simply all of these variable cost actions that you're doing because obviously, you're not doing anything structural yet, is that how you get there?
John Stauch: Yes, yes.
Scott Graham: I told you, it would be simple. Thanks a lot, guys.
John Stauch: Thank you, Scott.
Mark Borin: Thanks, Scott.
Operator: Your next question is from Julian Mitchell of Barclays.
Julian Mitchell: Hi, good morning and I'd like to give a thank you to Mark for all the help. Maybe just my first question around you've mentioned that several times the issues in the hospitality and restaurant sector, maybe just size those for us in terms of Pentair kind of firm wide. How large is that piece of your end-market exposure, where you're most worried about a sluggish recovery? And then could you just remind us or update us on the status of organic sales trends within Aquion and Pelican and how satisfied you are with their integration to-date?
John Stauch: Yes, so 6% of sales roughly would be that that commercial food service revenue for overall Pentair. Okay, most of that tied to cartridge replacement, or aftermarket replacement. And we'll call that the predominant 75% to 80% of it and the 20% maybe on original equipment install. As far as the second question, yes, very happy with both of the acquisitions for different reasons. So, as a reminder, what we like about the Aquion acquisition was it made softener systems and POU systems and that systems integration and capability is something we're excited about as we start to brand it Pentair and Pentair Water Solutions and offer it to a broader channel set. This front-end, though, is an affiliated channel. And that affiliated channel primarily works through Home Depot, and the traffic in Home Depot is not there to demand or ask for those leads. And also a lot of those leads come from larger appliance purchases where softening the water is kind of critical. So let's say we've seen a drop-off in the demand on that front-end of the channel. Opposite story, the Pelican Water Solutions where we do our own direct lead and we market and we can market on digital media, things like Facebook, I see us on LinkedIn, et cetera. Those are different channel dynamics. And as I mentioned earlier, even though we're getting less leads, we're converting those leads at a higher rate, meaning we have a much more interested party to gaining. So the revenue up on the direct channel is up significantly, I mean it's in line with what we expected. And on the other side, we have seen a fall-off demand because of our retail traffic, as I mentioned, but we're happy with the systems capability that it brings. And that's why I want to continue to invest in the front-end of the channel because I think if we're doing our lead-generation and we're converting that into our systems and the things we're selling, we gain that higher margin but we're also controlling our own destiny. And so that's why I'm excited about seeing through the Water Solutions piece.
Julian Mitchell: Thank you very much. And just my follow-up question, you'd noted that the sell-through of pool product has been good so far in Q2. And I just trying to hone in on that sell-in, there was a company this morning also in the sort of building products arena focused on tools. They talked about double-digit sort of point-of-sales increase in April but their sell-in into that market could be down 30% or so. So enormous disparity between the sell-in and the sell-through. I guess what I'm looking at Pentair. Am I right in thinking that there is a large disparity, but perhaps not on the scale of what that tools company had mentioned they had seen in April?
John Stauch: Yes. I think you're thinking about it, right. I think the magnitude is a lot less than Tool Company. But that is exactly where I'm at meaning I think the sell, sell-through the channel remains positive, I would expect us to be in a sell-in negative not because there's extra inventory today but because that channel is got to anticipate the falling demand as it looks forward into the new pools and remodeled pools. And I think they'll moderate their orders until they see that that part of the market continues to unfold.
Operator: Steve Tusa of JP Morgan has a follow-up question.
Steve Tusa: Hey, guys, sorry. Did I say you had no basically no disruption from the kind of plant shutdown in California?
John Stauch: I did not say that. So thank you for the clarification. What I said was at one point we were shut down or told to shut down, we deemed ourselves as essential. Got backup online, obviously, not at the full capacity. And quite frankly, Steve it was as I mentioned having backlog and pass-through at the end of the quarter which is not a normal pool that is actually a facility in which we have backlog and past dues still due today.
Steve Tusa: Okay. So like you would -- would you have been able, was there any meaningful impact to the quarter?
John Stauch: There would have been at least another $10 million of revenue from that one plant alone.
Steve Tusa: That said, it's -- thanks for not I mean a lot of companies are kind of using obviously many trying to kind of use this as many piece as possible. We appreciate you guys just kind of eating that to a degree and putting it in the results. So thanks for the clarification. Best of luck in the second quarter.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Mark Borin: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: There are no other questions in queue. John, do you have any closing remarks?
John Stauch: I do. Thanks Shelby. Thank you for joining us today. I just wanted to take a moment to remind everyone of our long-term strategy which remains unchanged. We believe we serve large and stable end markets, particularly within our Consumer Solutions segment. Our pool business has a proven track record and we believe we're positioning our Water Solutions businesses to take advantage of helping consumers and businesses solve their water quality needs. We still see a number of growth levers longer-term. Our 2019 acquisitions of Aquion and Pelican help move us closer to the consumer and we have continued to invest in building our digital capabilities and new product pipeline. In addition, we're accelerating PIMS to help fund many of our growth initiatives. We've been and will continue to be focused on disciplined capital allocation. We started with our commitment to our investment grade ratings. We've increased our dividend for 44 consecutive years and are proud to be a dividend aristocrat. We expect to continue to use our strong cash flow to fund the most attractive growth opportunities. Before I turn the call over to Shelby for Q&A -- I just want to let everybody know that we are navigating these uncertain times together and I would like to offer my best wishes to all of our employees, customers, and shareholders. Thank you for your continued interest. Shelby, you can conclude the call.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-01-28 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thanking for standing by, and welcome to the Q4 2019 Pentair PLC Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Lucas. Thank you. Please go ahead. 
Jim Lucas: Thanks, Mariama, and welcome to Pentair's fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call. We are glad you could join us today. I am Jim Lucas, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. And with me today is John Stauch, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Borin, our Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, we will provide details on our fourth quarter 2019 performance, as well as our first quarter and full year 2020 outlook as outlined in this morning's press release. Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the Company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as the risks outlined in Pentair's most recent Form 10-Q, Form 10-K and today's press release. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today and the Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results. Today's webcast is accompanied by a presentation, which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Pentair's website. We will reference these slides throughout our prepared remarks. Any references to non-GAAP financials are reconciled in the appendix of the presentation. We will be sure to reserve time for questions-and-answers after our prepared remarks. I would like to request that you limit your questions to one and a follow-up in order to ensure everyone an opportunity to ask their questions. I will now turn the call over to John.
John Stauch: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 4 titled, Executive Summary. We were very pleased to deliver fourth quarter and full year results in line with our expectations. Despite a few macro challenges at the beginning of 2019, we stabilized performance, we continued to invest in our top priorities, and believe we made very good progress in further positioning Pentair as a leading water treatment company.  During 2019, we completed two strategic acquisitions that allowed us to move closer to the consumer and we made great strides in accelerating our growth investments around marketing, brand building and innovation.  While our Pentair Integrated Management System or PIMS has been a strong foundation for how we operate our company. We continue to evolve PIMS to go well beyond just operational excellence and make it an integral part of driving the high performance growth culture.  As we approach the two year anniversary of becoming a pure play water company, we believe our strategy is sound and we must continue to be agile to better align our organization with our strategies and just as important to better align with our customer base, we are moving to two reporting segments. I will discuss the new segment structure in greater detail shortly.  We are introducing guidance today for 2020 and we expect to return to core sales growth and solid segment income and EPS growth, along with strong cash flow performance.  I also wanted to take a moment to comment in a second press release that we issued this morning. Mark Borin has informed us that he is resigning from Pentair as CFO to accept an operational leadership opportunity at a private employee-owned company.  Mark has been a trusted partner for the last twelve years and has been an important leader in building a strong finance foundation at Pentair. We have commenced a search for our new CFO and Mark plans to remain in his role with Pentair through the search process and to assist with an orderly transition. Mark will truly be missed and we wish him continued success as he moves to the next chapter of his career.  Please turn to Slide number 5 labeled Executing a Consistent Strategy. When we embarked on a strategy as a pure play water company a few years ago, we were excited at the significant opportunities that existed with a leading cool franchise, we have a large installed base to serve and therefore significant opportunity to increase content.  We also identified a number of exciting opportunities in residential and commercial water treatment and we continue to build on our strong foundation. We have made notable progress in the migration from being a component supplier to offering systems and solutions to help consumers solve their water quality needs.  Sustainability awareness is increasing around the globe and we have a broad portfolio of technologies and services to help solve many of the world’s challenges regarding access to clean, safe and great tasting water.  During 2019, we made two strategic acquisitions that we disclosed to the consumer. We have learned a lot in a short time about consumer needs and preferences and we look forward to updating you throughout the year as we expect to further expand our business to directly solve these consumer desires.  We have shared with you in the past that we identified two key priorities for Pentair; advanced pool growth and accelerate residential and commercial water treatment.  We continue to fund these initiatives as well as build out our overall capabilities. These investments are now in our base and we plan to continue to fund the most attractive growth opportunities as we head into 2020. We made a lot of progress last year around digital transformation, innovation, technology and building our brand.  During 2019, we consolidated 35 websites to one Pentair.com, which resulted in a 60% increase in web traffic for the year. We are still in the early stages of our digital transformation. We are very pleased with the progress we have made in a short time and we are excited about what more we can do.  Also in 2019, we had an enterprise-wide launch of Salesforce.com that is enabling our various businesses to better share information and is linked to our digital strategy with customers. As the company completed its separation in 2018, we identified a need to improve our new product development pipeline and we are pleased that 2019 was a productive year for our technology development initiatives.  Over the next 12 to 18 months, we expect to introduce a number of exciting new water treatment solutions and today, we are proud to give you an update on the major progress we have made on our journey to develop smart IoT-connected solutions.  This past year, we made significant investments to build the internal talent and strategic partnerships to develop our IoT cloud architecture that supports our residential, commercial and industrial applications.  Based on this IoT platform, we developed two Apps, the Pentair Home App for the consumer and the Pentair Pro App for our dealers. We expect these apps to seamlessly connect an entire suite of soon to launch residential products. Ten in total throughout 2020 including a smart water softening valve, two new pool automation systems, and a host of residential flow control products.  Considering the breadth of our residential water products, this new IoT platform is a major differentiator for our single product category competitors. We believe this new platform will play a key role to raise Pentair’s brand awareness with consumers as we become the go to company for solving consumer water needs.  We also believe it will create increased dealer loyalty by generating new sales leads, as well as improved customer loyalty to more easily attainable service offerings.  Finally, we expect this platform to also enable improved sales of additional Pentair products and services, as well as being avenue to drive recurring monthly revenue services directly to Pentair. We have also made significant progress in both commercial and industrial food and beverage applications.  The next generation of our leading RO system for high-end coffee shops, and other food service applications is now IoT enabled for real-time performance monitoring and to incorporate new features to while predictive maintenance of key system components including the pumps and filtration elements.  Finally, in our food and beverage business, we developed and implemented the brewer cloud, an IoT solution to enable monitoring of the service for our industry-leading beer membrane filtration systems.  The IoT service includes 24/7 support, a proactive monitoring and reporting. The use of IoT is helping to accelerate the adoption of the innovative BMF solution and enable the service contracts to scale efficiently with real-time analysis.  By using the brewer cloud service platform, we’ve been able to demonstrate strong increases and production efficiency for customers. Ultimately, we believe this IoT service solution helps both stronger, strategic customer focus relationships with our brewing partners, also opening up new application opportunities for our products.  The final element around our strategy is disciplined capital allocation. We recently announced that 2020 will mark the 44th consecutive year of dividend increases which places Pentair in rather a lead company as a dividend aristocrat. We plan to continue to use our cash flow to fund the most attractive growth opportunities both organically and inorganically while still being mindful of returning capital to our shareholders and remaining committed to our investment-grade ratings.

Over the past year, we completed a 5,000 person North American segmentation analysis that has provided us detailed information on how consumers make purchases decisions. In essence, codifying the customer journeys with Pentair and our products.  This helped us move forward with an informed decision on how to better position our portfolio to align with our strategies and our customer base.  We must move with a greater sense of urgency in supporting the needs of our varying customers. This segmentation data helped inform us as we reorganized into two business segments, Consumer Solutions and Industrial & Flow Technologies. While the businesses have always had different customers, influencers and go to market strategies, various parts of our business are more closely aligned.  We believe the new alignment into a business to consumer-focused segment, Consumer Solutions, a primarily business-to-business driven segment, Industrial & Flow Technologies, better positions our teams to build upon our core strengths, more aggressively pursue our growth opportunities, increase productivity and enhance profitability.  The ultimate goal is to exceed the expectations of our customers, and all other stakeholders and we believe that we can do that. But we have moved forward into 2020 with great enthusiasm.  Let me now expand in more detail what the two segments are. Consumer Solutions is made up of pool and water solutions. Historically, pool comprised the majority of our prior Aquatic Solutions segment, while Water Solutions is comprised what we historically refer to as Residential and Commercial Filtration that was part of the Filtration Solutions segment.  Water Solutions consists of components, systems, end-to-end services and our focus on the China’s Southeast Asia region. The objectives for the Consumer Solutions team are to accelerate revenue growth and income, enhance consumer branding and experiences, and build an expanded services capability. We believe the opportunity to grow our Consumer Solutions business is significant.  Industrial & Flow Technologies or IFT is made up of three businesses. The first piece of IFT is the remainder of what was previously in the Filtration Solutions segment. These businesses are focused on Industrial Filtration, including a strong niche in food and beverage filtration.  The other two pieces of IFT comes from the previous Flow Technologies segment. The two businesses are Residential Irrigation Flow, big, small pumps and Commercial and Infrastructure Flow, which is primarily larger engineered pumps. This segment is primarily focused on B2B customers.  The businesses that make up this segment have similar operational characteristics and we believe combining these businesses in this new structure can realize incremental value in the areas of engineering, solutions, sourcing, technology, IoT innovation and regional support. Our new segment structure is focused on better alignment around our product and service offerings by customer type to maximize the customer experience and drive profitable growth. We expect this new structure to further each teams’ ability to prioritize opportunities, accelerate decision-making processes, optimally allocate resources, innovate to develop improved new products and services, and maximize our go to market strategies.  I would now like to turn the call over to Mark to focus on our financial results in more detail. Mark? 
Mark Borin: Thank you, John. Please turn to Slide 7 labeled Q4 2019 Pentair Performance. For the fourth quarter, overall sales increased 2% with core sales down 1%. Segment income grew 5% and adjusted EPS increased 13%. We'll provide more color on the individual segment performance shortly.  Below the line, we saw an adjusted tax rate of 13.4%, net interest, other expense of $7.3 million and our average shares in the quarter were $169.3 million. The lower tax rate during the quarter and for the full year was the result of our tax strategies being spread over a lower income level in 2019 and we would anticipate a higher tax rate in 2020 as we expect income to grow. For the third consecutive quarter, price was in line or better than inflation and productivity was strong in the quarter.  Please turn to Slide 6 labeled Full Year 2019 Pentair Performance. This slide looks at Pentair’s full year performance. For 2019, sales were flat with core sales down 1%, while we experienced a very slow start to the year, we saw continued stabilization in the subsequent quarters, and an overall improvement in our performance.  For the full year, segment income was down 4% and return on sales declined 60 basis points to 17.5%. Price nearly offset inflation for the full year and productivity built momentum as the year progressed. The adjusted tax rate for the full year ended at 16%, net interest other was $34 million and the average share count was 170.4 million. Adjusted EPS of $2.38 represented a modest year-over-year increase.  Please turn to Slide 9 labeled Q4 2019 Pentair Segment Performance. This slide lays out the fourth quarter performance of our three segments; Aquatic Systems’ core sales grew 1% as normal early buy programs returned to more historical patterns. Segment income for Aquatics grew 9% and return on sales increased an impressive 260 basis points to 30.8%.  While we have to wait to see how the spring season unfolds, we are encouraged that our channel inventory appears closer to more historical normal levels.  Filtration Solutions saw core sales decline 2%, segment income fall 4% and return on sales contract 210 basis points to 15.8%. There continues to be a number of moving parts to Filtration Solutions, but overall, we believe the business is better positioned exiting 2019. On the residential and commercial side, the integration of Aquion and Pelican made good progress throughout the year. In the core business, we saw systems grow nicely, which impart offset continued softness in the components business. Within the Industrial business, there was some softness during the quarter due to the shipment timing of certain large orders. We continue to invest in the residential and commercial business, which did had some impact on the income performance during the quarter. However, we believe this better positions the business going forward.  Flow Technologies saw core sales decline 1%. However, segment income grew 10% and return on sales expanded 150 basis points to 13.5%. While the top-line remain mixed within Flow Technologies, strong pricing and easier inflation comp and improved productivity contributed to the strong income and ROS expansion in the quarter.  We made a number of investments in Flow Technologies in 2019 to help improve productivity and we would expect that momentum to carry into the New Year.  Please turn to Slide 10 labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. Our balance sheet ended the year in great shape with leverage comfortably below two-times, a well-balanced mix of fixed and variable debt, and our average borrowing rate just below 3%. Free cash flow for the year was just below $300 million and we were clearly disappointed in the results. However, we believe that most of the contributing factors were one-time in nature and we would expect 2020 to see cash flow return to greater than 100% conversion of net income. As the table on the left side of the slide shows, the two biggest contributing factors to the weaker cash flow performance were working capital and other accruals.  The biggest comfort within working capital was around payables timing. Just as we had increased prices to help mitigate unprecedented material inflation, we experienced a similar phenomenon from many of our suppliers. The timing of some of these increases and our subsequent actions saw inventory come on the balance sheet and the timing of payables slip from the end of 2018 into the beginning of 2019.  With that now behind us, we expect working capital to normalize and not be as big of a swing going forward. Within other accruals, there were a number of one-time factors that were not big individually, but collectively added up to contribute to the year-over-year swing. This includes timing of tax payments and pension termination that included the funding of an annuity.  Similar to the comment on working capital, we have now cleaned up most of the long-term liabilities on the balance sheet and we would expect less volatility in this category going forward. Our long-term cash profile remained unchanged and we are committed to delivering free cash flow to be greater than our net income. The balance sheet has a lot of flexibility and we strengthened our overall capital structure throughout 2019.  Please turn to Slide 11 labeled Q1 2020 Pentair Outlook. For the first quarter, we expect core sales to be up 4% to 6%. We expect Consumer Solutions to be up 9% to 11% driven by pool. We would remind you that the pool season in some years varies from a March to April start depending on weather, but overall, we expect a strong pool performance in the first half.  We expect Industrial & Flow Technologies to be flattish reflecting modest recovery on our Residential Irrigation business, offset by slightly softer Industrial sales. We expect segment income to be up approximately 9% to 13%, driven by solid volume growth, better price cost and improved productivity. We expect adjusted EPS to be in a range of $0.48 to $0.51 per share.  Below the line, we expect corporate expense to be approximately $17 million to $18 million. We expect our first quarter adjusted tax rate to be around 17%. We also expect net interest other expense of roughly $8 million and shares to be approximately 169 million to 170 million.  Please turn to Slide 12 labeled Full Year 2020 Pentair Outlook. For the full year, we expect core sales to be up 2% to 4%, driven by an expected 5% to 7% increase in Consumer Solutions and relatively flattish top-line performance from Industrial & Flow Technologies. We expect segment income to be up around 3% to 6%. We are introducing guidance of an adjusted EPS range of $2.50 to $2.55 per share.  Other items embedded in our guidance include, expected corporate expense of approximately $65 million, an adjusted tax rate of 17%, net interest, other expense of $27 million to $29 million, and an average share count for the year of 168 million to 169 million shares.  We are targeting free cash flow greater than 100% of net income, capital expenditures of approximately $60 million, depreciation and amortization around $80 million and non-cash stock compensation expense to approximate $25 million.  Before we turn the call over to Q&A, I would like to take a moment to thank everyone, especially, John for the support I have received through my long tenure with Pentair. I believe that Pentair’s strategy is strong and I am excited about what we have built here. I will help to ensure an orderly transition and I am excited about the opportunity to become an operating leader at a private employee-owned company.  I would now like to turn the call over to Mariama for Q&A, after which John will have a few closing remarks. Mariama, please open the line for questions. Thank you. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. 
Jeff Hammond : Hey, good morning guys. 
John Stauch: Good morning, Jeff.
Mark Borin: Good morning, Jeff.
Jeff Hammond : Just with the segment change, can you give us a better sense of how you are thinking about pool core growth versus Filtration within that 5% to 7%? And then, Mark, you mentioned inventory levels kind of approaching normal. Would that suggest there is still a little bit high or lean coming into the year? Thanks.
John Stauch: Sure. So, first on core growth side, you can assume that the majority of that higher core growth in the first quarter and for the full year is driven by the pool business within Consumer Solutions with their Residential Commercial Filtration Systems side being little bit more moderated but also contributing to the higher core growth.  On the inventory side, yes, we see inventory levels now back to more normalized levels and so, as we’ve talked about throughout the year, that was the objective and we saw those come back in line and we would anticipate not having to really comment on inventories going forward. 
Jeff Hammond : Okay, great. And then, looking at the new segments, it looks like the margin differential, pretty start – just how do we think about capital allocation, portfolio simplification within the two segments, and just maybe comment on where you think entitlement margins should be in the two segments? Thanks. 
John Stauch: Yes, I think, one of the reasons to put the like businesses together we mentioned was really about the consumer focus and we had the opportunity to share digital marketing strategies across the Water Solutions and pool. We all have the ability to utilize branding, messaging and also when you think about where the pool revenue is by states and geography, those are huge water opportunities from a drinking water perspective. So there is a lot of strategic growth opportunities on the Consumer Solutions side.  On the IFT side, we think we have a lot of operational efficiencies we can drive both in the way that we – it’s a very global business. So the geographical footprint has the opportunity to be better understood and better optimized. And we also have project learnings from each of the businesses Jeff that we think we can expand to PIMS capability to be more efficient in a way that we deliver projects to our end-customer base.  So, ultimately, we feel really good about this line-up. Both have margin opportunities. I think in the short run, you are going to see more margin expansion in the IFT side while we invest heavily in the Consumer Solutions to build out the consumer side, but as you know, the Consumer Solutions businesses have a higher starting ROS level. 
Jeff Hammond : Okay. Thanks guys. 
John Stauch: Thank you, Jeff. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open. 
John Stauch: Steve? Steve? Maybe the mute button Steve.
Operator: Steve Tusa, Your line is open.
John Stauch: Should we come back to Steve?
Jim Lucas : Yes. We’ll go to the next question. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. 
Brian Lee : Hey guys, good morning. 
John Stauch: Hey, good morning. 
Mark Borin: Good morning.
Brian Lee : Morning. Just a question on the guidance, I guess for Q1 and 2020, it would seem to imply the segment income growth is fading quite a bit starting from the 9% to 13% in Q1 to average out to just a 3% or 6% for the full year. I assume some of that is the tougher back half comps versus the first half, but maybe give us a sense for what else is embedded in there moving through the year in your assumptions that kind of drives little bit of that fade as you move through the year?
John Stauch: Yes, I think you nailed it. I mean, we have some easier comparisons than the first half of the year and we believe that we are going to get back to normal seasonality given what we are expecting around the overall demand in our business.  So, you got it. The second one is, we are going to continue to invest in our growth opportunities and that core assumption of that continued investment is in all year, but it’s muting kind of the back half performance. 
Brian Lee : Okay. Fair enough. And then, John, speaking of investment, you talked about the water services opportunity here in resi and commercial. Can you maybe give us some more context, the infrastructure you have in place today for that? What new investments you are making there? And then, what sort of revenue opportunity and timing is reasonable to expect there?  And then maybe just if I could squeeze one in lastly, just on the margins, with respect to that opportunity any sense of where that stacks up in terms of ROS ranges versus the rest of the portfolio of offerings? Thanks guys. 
John Stauch: Yes, so, what infrastructure we have, we purchased Pelican which gave us the end-to-end solutions and the in-home residential experience that we think we can move forward under what would comp Pentair Water Solutions. And we want to be the fully integrated supplier to be able to give to consumers good quality drinking water at their point of use in the home.  We also think we can expand that capability into commercial and really utilize our commercial expertise and our water expertise to expand where you work and where you live. So, we are building out that infrastructure and capability. A lot of that’s digital.  The rest of it’s really highly around the technical capabilities we are bringing around our ability to solve those solutions either in the home or in the commercial application through carbonation and/or chilled water and/or salt free applications.  So that’s really where we’ve been spending our time. I would also say that the margins in these businesses start out on a really nice basis. Think about around 20%-ish and we believe that growth highly leverages both the investment and the existing infrastructure we have. 
Brian Lee : All right. Thanks guys.
John Stauch: Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. Your line is open. 
Steve Tusa: Hey, sorry about missing that – missing you guys calling. 
John Stauch: No problem, Steve. 
Mark Borin: Hey, Steve. 
Steve Tusa: The kind of the bridge for next year, can you just kind of clarify what kind of the magnitude is some of these moving parts when you said you have investment and then you know, price inflation, productivity, just kind of the big buckets that roughly you are expecting for next year? For 2020?
Mark Borin: Sure, sure, let me try to walk through it, Steve. So, maybe first just thinking about price cost. As we talked before, we expect to be back to kind of a more historical normal level, look at price cost kind of offsetting and being in that 1% to 2% range.  We have got the – so that’s embedded in the core growth and volume growth, on top of that, we would expect to see drop through and that’s kind of mid-30s range to 40% on the volume drop through. And then, from a productivity perspective, John referenced earlier, we would expect to see productivity coming out of Industrial or the IFT segment.  And then offsetting that, we certainly do have there are some things that will be headwind in 2020 coming out of 2019. If you think about incentive compensation and some other variable expense items that would have been lower in 2019 that really is headwind to negative productivity in 2020. So that would be an offset to the actual productivity that the businesses are driving. 
Steve Tusa: So, ultimately, kind of on a net basis, productivity versus kind of those investments, is that flat? Is that still positive or what would you kind of expect to see on that front?
Mark Borin: Yes, it’s kind of flattish to slightly positive. 
Steve Tusa: Okay. And then, on the cash flow side, big working capital headwind this year. Are you expecting working capital, you said it’s going to be now 100, greater than a 100 to net income, do you expect to see working capital as a positive obviously next year, if that’s the case?
Mark Borin: So, I think, working capital, think of it as a positive on a year-over-year basis. So, as I said in my comments, it’s negatively affected us this year primarily looking at payables timing and a little bit on just receivables and much of that is related to the situation from 2018 and then bleeding over into 2019. And as we look at 2020, we are back to – well, I think it’s a more normalized level.  So we shouldn’t see big swings either to the positive or the negative frankly on working capital and you know, just to be clear on the guide around a 100% of net income versus a 100% of adjusted net income, we do recognize there are certain things that are reflected in adjusted net income that our cash expenses and so that’s also part of – as we think about what the reasonable expectation on a conversion basis.  So, it’s something on an adjusted basis, just slightly less than a 100%. But the guide would be greater than a 100% of net income. 
Steve Tusa: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot guys. I appreciate it. 
Mark Borin: Thanks, Steve.
John Stauch: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: Your next question comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen. Your line is open. 
Joe Giordano : Hey guys, good morning. 
John Stauch: Hey, Joe. 
Mark Borin: Good morning. 
Joe Giordano : Hey, and so, I wanted to start on the segmentation. Just like optically, it seems like you are putting the assets that you have been more happy within one bucket on the ones and another like. Is some sort of portfolio change or sale of a business or spin of a business? Is that like something that’s on the table? Or is that even something that’s been thought about?
John Stauch: No. I mean, clearly, this is more of a growth in operational efficiency and we like the business as we have. I do think when it comes to prioritizing across the portfolio, you can expect more of the capital allocation as far as the acquisition to be on the Consumer Solutions side.  And as far as the day-to-day growth investments, probably in the near-term on the Consumer Solutions side. But we have businesses that have performed well in the IFT side and we want to continue to prior to those – prioritize those within the IFT space. So, to answer your question just say simply, no. We don’t anticipate a spin. 
Joe Giordano : I understand the business-to-business versus the business-to-consumer, but like within the consumer, the channels are pretty different. So, with pool versus like the in-home resi filtration, so can you talk to what the – how this changes that what you guys act internally or how can you – like what are you leveraging out of this? 
John Stauch: Yes, I mean, starting with the point that we sell over $1 billion a year of branded pool products and we have a very active user in pool that references and comes to the Pentair.com website often, right? So, we have a really large despite there is 5 million installed pools with an active user Googling and certainly seeking more information about their products.  That gives us the ability to bring traffic to Pentair.com and then make those consumers and more aware of the types of things we can do to also help their quality of water in their homes. From there, we expect to take those leads and move them to our independent dealer channels and solve those - needs of those consumers.  And so, we are starting from a really good place and when I mention that our web traffic is up 60%. A lot of that increased web traffic is people looking for drinking water or in-home solutions. And then, with our Pelican direct-to-consumer and services model, we are expanding that to do things beyond just to solve free systems that they offer.  And we have the ability over the next three or five years to really build what we think is the right services and consumer focus to model that we can give people the national awareness and the differentiation by zip code that I think people want. 
Joe Giordano : That’s helpful. And then, maybe last from me, what’s the embedded expectation for Ag in 2020? I assume that’s all going to be in Industrial, I mean, it has a pretty easy comp particularly in the beginning of the year. So, kind of what was the end – kind of percentage of sales or how big was that business in 2019? And what’s embedded in growth for the Industrial business there?
Mark Borin: So, you want the Ag business? 
John Stauch: Yes, it’s another that we’ve talked about that a bunch this year, yes. 
Mark Borin: Yes, yes, we’re – the overall guide includes an assumption of Ag being around flattish. So, you are right. There should be easier comps overall, but we are not anticipating any big rebound and just in terms of size, that business is about kind of 15% of the IFT segment. 
Joe Giordano : Okay. Thanks guys. 
Mark Borin: Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Halloran with Baird. Your line is open. 
Mike Halloran : Hey, morning gentlemen. 
John Stauch: Good morning.
Mark Borin: Good morning, Mike.
Mike Halloran : So, first, staying with the segmentation side, maybe just a more in-depth discussion on lessons learned. I know you obviously just addressed the – whether there was divestitures associated with a lot of the core work you did.  Obviously, the investment dollars are – you've already mentioned are starting to swing towards the digital side because of some of the work you did. Anything else that you would point to that you are capitalizing or changing where you are allocating your capital early internally? Or where are the investment initiatives might spring up based on that work?
John Stauch: Yes, just to thank the internal Pentair team, so may we did – as I mentioned in my script, 5,000 people in the United States wait in. Those are consumers of water as to how they engage and buy water and how they want to buy and engage water and we use that to reform where we think we want to go.  As you could imagine the type of web capabilities or digital capabilities we need on B2B business is a more things related to awareness, content, some dealer portals and then also on the consumer side, we need to have the consumer engagement and the ability to work directly with the consumer and the dealer to satisfy that need.  Also, when you think operationally, we got to get to next day shipments and same day shipments in our Consumer side of the business. We don’t need that same type of infrastructure capability on the IFT side. So, what we learned about how we can differentiate ourselves against competition in these spaces inform how we create the segmentation and then build the capability around the businesses to help each of the business to succeed.  Mike, that’s what we really learned and those are lessons learned and I am very proud of how we’ve organized the organization. I am very optimistic and excited about what we can do with these two organizations. 
Mike Halloran : Makes sense. And then, just on the capital allocation side as we think about 2020, what’s the M&A environment look like and how are you thinking about kind of the acquisition opportunity versus the buyback opportunity as you sit here today?
John Stauch: Yes, so, as we continue to generate cash and have opportunities, I like what we are doing organically and I think we are well positioned today and we have to opportunistically participate in the M&A at the right return levels.  There has been some acquisitions that have been announced and kind of went beyond us here and I think we have to be disciplined because we have to, when we engage in acquisitions deliver a significant ROIC over some period of time. So, we are going continue to be disciplined and we have options and I think those options gives the ability to create the best shareowner value. 
Mike Halloran : Appreciate it. Thank you. 
John Stauch: Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Your line is open. 
Eitan Buchbinder: Hi, this is Eitan Buchbinder on for Andy. Good morning. 
John Stauch: Good morning. 
Mark Borin: Good morning. 
Eitan Buchbinder: So, coming out of the third quarter, you had an expectation for an Aquatics core sales decline and ends up slightly positive. What happened during the progression in the fourth quarter that may have benefited this segment in your initial forecast? And are there any scheduled price increases that may have impacted sales? 
John Stauch: Sure. So just in terms of that looking at the sequential on why they did slightly better than forecast, really just continued back – getting back to what I said is a more normalized level. So, good solid demand in the quarter and really nothing unusual from an overall demand perspective. 
Eitan Buchbinder: Okay. And looking towards next year’s guide, core sales within Industrial & Flow Technologies, they are expected to be down 1 to up 1. With the understanding that the legacy Filtration segment is coming off of relatively easy comp albeit for part in the portfolio, could you maybe parse the expected performance of the different pieces?
John Stauch: So, in Consumer Solutions, right, we guided sort of for the full year up 5% to 7%. I think portion of that is being driven by the pool business within Consumer Solutions. And then, the Filtration piece that’s in there is, maybe kind of the mid-single-digit, low mid-single-digit type of growth and the pool piece would be more of that kind of mid to high-single-digit. 
Eitan Buchbinder: Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Your line is open. 
Nathan Jones: Good morning, everyone. 
Jim Lucas: Good morning. 
Nathan Jones: I know this is not the primary reason for consolidating here to two segments. But typically, you do see some cost reductions come out of these kind of combinations. Are you guys expecting to see cost savings by consolidating down to two segments and if so, could you quantify that for us?
John Stauch: I do think over three to five years, Nathan, without a doubt we are going to see functional efficiencies across these two segments and driving higher efficiencies to the businesses. It’s not the main intent of doing this.  As a matter of fact, we are adding back resources and the differential capabilities into the businesses and segments based upon the needs we have. But over a three to five year period, I do think we will start to identify function-by-function, how we can differentiate ourselves in these segments and that will drive some value. But I can’t quantify right now, Nathan. 
Nathan Jones: Fair enough. Productivity over the last couple of years has been a little up and down. Are you guys confident now that you're on a path to be able to more consistently deliver productivity quarter in, quarter out? Do you see any specific discrete headwinds this year or anything like that we should be aware of?
John Stauch: But Mark mentioned the headwind. I think the reinstatement of variable compensation, which tends to be extremely low in a tough year like 2019, it is going to come back to a headwind as we head into 2020. That’s the only thing we see out there in the horizon. We have added about 2% of revenue over the last couple of years in the form of investments in the R&D, sales and marketing, and the development of people as we mentioned.  And we continue to invest and I read for you some of those big advancements on the IoT side and the digital front. I do think now that’s going to stabilize as we go forward and that level of investment will continue. But we don’t see those sizable year-over-year headwinds that I think has been mitigating what has been real productivity in the businesses.  And finally, growth. I mean, when you get back to growth and you get core volume growth, that goes a long way in factories to drive productivity. So I think the cost input sides have stabilized and I think our ability to invest is going to pay dividends and continue with an investment will no longer be a year-over-year challenge.  And then, when we return to growth, we should see ourselves getting back to the productivity that you mentioned, Nathan.
Nathan Jones: Okay. So just on the investment side, you have reached a plateau there now. You are comfortable that you have the right spending level there. It's not too high, it's not too low. That's kind of what you anticipate going forward?
John Stauch: I mean, it’s going to vary up and down a little bit, Nathan, but we probably have over the next three to five years some G&A opportunity and at the same time, we are going to continue to invest in more innovative products around R&D.  So, a couple of the lines that are going to move from quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year. But overall, we don’t see a step change investment that’s required to grow our existing businesses. 
Nathan Jones: Great. Thanks very much for taking my questions. 
John Stauch: Thank you, Nathan. 
Mark Borin: Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies. Your line is open. 
Saree Boroditsky : Thank you, good morning. 
John Stauch: Good morning. 
Saree Boroditsky : Going back to the comments on Ag, last year, you saw some headwinds on the precision side from the late planting season. Could you just comment on what your expectations are for that side of the business?
Mark Borin: Sure, as I was tracking earlier about sort of the expectation for Ag coming into 2020, thinking of it sort of being flattish. So it was down last year and really returning to flat. But not anticipating and nothing is embedded in guidance in terms of any significant recovery. 
Saree Boroditsky : Okay. And then, could you provide some color on what you saw geographically. I believe last quarter you talked about some moderating growth in Europe along with some continued growth in China. Did these trends continue in the quarter and any expectations for next year?
John Stauch: Yes, very similar really from the commentary I would had last quarter in terms of geographic split. So, some softness in Europe in certain product lines. We continued to see good momentum in China and then, the remainder of the puts and takes coming out of North America. 
Saree Boroditsky : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. 
John Stauch: Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Scott Graham with Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is open. 
Scott Graham: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. 
John Stauch: Hey, Scott. 
Scott Graham: And good luck to you, Mark. 
Mark Borin: Thanks, Scott. 
Scott Graham: So, two questions for you, really one of the things you were talking about last year was that you had a little bit excess inventory in the channels in the other business – in the non-pool businesses. I guess, my first question would be, how are you feeling about those? And then, secondly, I am hoping you can unpack the Filtration margin decline in the quarter by size of issue and the impacts that the carryover effects of the same into the first half. 
John Stauch: Yes, so let me take the margin impact in Filtration and I’ll hand the rest over to Mark. I mean, what we are doing in Pentair Water Solutions is adding what’s called a global retail center. We think of it as a salesperson in a vehicle that helps the consumer be able to take a look at the product that we are trying to sell and see that product in action in the actual vehicle itself.  We are accelerating the rate of investment of putting those vehicles and those people on the road and training those new sales organizations, right. So, think of that investment being significantly ahead of the revenue that they generate. And right now, we are targeting somewhere around three quarters of $1 million a year in revenue from a vehicle that’s been in place for 12 months or greater.  And so it takes a while to ramp up to that level and to have that working. So that is the primary investment that’s continuing in Filtration and we’ll probably continue for some period of time as we believe that we are doing the right things to drive long-term value, but there is a push of cost ahead of that growth. Mark, can you take the second please?
Mark Borin: Sure, and just to go back to sort of the inventory question. So, it’s a good point. We talk about pool or inventory both in the pool and then some of the other business as it relates to some of the buy ahead that happened in the back half of 2018.  So, a couple of things that introduces and factors into our guidance for 2020, but it also helps explain the Q4 2019 performance as on a year-over-year comp basis, we’ve got the tougher comps in 2018 that are tied to that buy ahead that was related to the price increase. 
Scott Graham: So, I am translating that to mean you are okay with the inventories in the channels as we enter 2020 in those businesses?
Mark Borin: That’s correct. That’s correct. So, my comment on sort of normalized inventory levels would be applied really across all of the businesses. 
Scott Graham: Thank you. And John, if I could just revisit your response, you talked about the investments, is that the only item that drove down the margin? Or were there other factors as well in Filtration?
John Stauch: Yes, I mean, Filtration, on a historical basis, there is a lot of different pieces to that business is that we talked about with different margin profiles. So, some of that is just a mix in the fourth quarter related to other quarters as we just look at the makeup of the product sales in a quarter. 
Scott Graham: That’s great. Thank you. 
John Stauch: Thank you. 
Mark Borin: Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Brian Drab with William Blair. Your line is open. 
Joseph Aiken : Good morning. This is Joe Aiken on for Brian today. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about what you are seeing in some of your end-markets right now. Are you seeing more stability across some of those end-markets right now? And particularly on the Industrial side, are you seeing demand start to level off there?
John Stauch: Well, two different questions. So let me try to address. I think when we look at the linearity of our revenue and you take a look at moving throughout a year from Q1 to Q2 to Q3 to Q4, we have seen significant stability in most of – all of our product categories.  Where we are exposing residential commercial, we still see resilience and we still see a strong consumer sentiment driving incremental demand. In Industrial, yes, I mean, things had gotten a little slower globally. We don’t have a lot of Industrial exposure, but the product lines we have, have shown basically more of a flattening of the quarter-to-quarter growth trajectory. 
Joseph Aiken : Okay. Thanks. And then, just on the non-pool residential business, I know you mentioned some normalized inventory levels, what are your expectations in terms of revenue growth for that business in 2020? 
Mark Borin: That would really be tied to kind of my comment on the Filtration business. So, sort of the low mid-single-digit growth rate. 
Joseph Aiken : Okay. Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions. 
John Stauch: Thank you. 
Mark Borin: Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is now open. 
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning. This is Trish [Ph] on for Julian. Just a quick one on the Consumer Solutions segment, kind of what percentage of sales go through ecommerce at this point? And I don’t know if you have any target for that and then just any significant difference in margins there between ecommerce and other distributions?
John Stauch: Yes, I don’t have a target for that, primarily I would look at – what we are trying to do is, consumer-enabled which is different than B2C, right? So, we are trying to gauge the consumer and make the consumer aware of all the different options available to them. And then we are trying to bring it through a professional channel either in the event of us providing those services or our affiliated partners bringing that through their channel.  Our direct-to-consumer business today is just Pelican and it’s what they did before. I think of that is $20 million to $30 million maybe, that gives us a little bit in the form of a product the rest of it’s all sold to services. 
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Great. That’s helpful. And then just, maybe any early feedback on the Pentair home App? I know it’s launched last quarter, but anything there?
John Stauch: Yes, well, we did a soft launch and we'll be continuing to take the consumer feedback and evolve it. But we are excited. We obviously are not trying to be the integrated home platform. There is other companies who will lead in that area, but we want to tie into those platforms. And then, we want to have a whole suite of products and capability that would help you make the consumer more aware of their water needs.  Where I am most excited by though is on the dealer side, right? And as we provide a connectability of that App and allow the consumer to get their dealers scheduled or request the service in an most efficient way and then also follow-up on the consumer experience, that’s what we are really excited about with that application launch.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. 
John Stauch: Thank you. 
Mark Borin: Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Brett Linzey with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open. 
Brett Linzey : Hey, good morning all.
Mark Borin: Morning. 
Brett Linzey : Hey, just I want to come back to the 2020 guidance specific around just margin. So you said core incrementals of 30 to 40 for the total company. What are you expecting for margin performance by segment? Do you think both are up year-over-year? And then, any color on restructuring what you are targeting for this year?
John Stauch: Yes to margin expansion in both segments. And right now, we are not targeting or forecasting any major restructuring or restructure. 
Brett Linzey : Okay. And then, it looks like you are guiding a 2% divestiture in Consumer Solutions. It looks like it takes place later in the year, well maybe just some color there strategic rationale what’s being sold?
Mark Borin: Sure, and just to clarify, so there is kind of a net going on in Q1. So there is the acquisition timing of Aquion and Pelican from 2018 that lapses and coming into this quarter. So that’s about $12 million and then, the rest of it is the sale of the agriculture business that we had announced previously. So that sale has been ongoing and so, the guide reflects the assumption that that business has been divested in 2020. 
Brett Linzey : Okay. Great. I’ll pass it along. Thanks. 
Mark Borin: Thank you. 
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to the company for closing remarks.
John Stauch: Thank you for joining us today. Despite the challenging start to 2019, we made great progress with respect to our vision to build a high performance growth culture. We believe we have significant opportunities ahead of us and with our customer-centric structure and shared services support platform, we are ready to further advance the Pentair strategy more efficiently and with a greater sense of urgency. I speak for the full Pentair team when I say we are excited about our future, optimistic about 2020 and motivated to create value for all key stakeholders in the near and longer-term. Thank you for your continued interest. Mariama, you can conclude the call. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-10-23 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thanking for standing by. And welcome to the Q3 2019 Pentair Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Lucas. Thank you. He may begin.
Jim Lucas: Thanks, Dorothy. And welcome to Pentair's third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. We're glad you could join us. I'm Jim Lucas, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer, and with me today is John Stauch, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Borin, our Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, we will provide details on our third quarter 2019 performance as well as our fourth quarter and full year 2019 outlook as outlined in this morning's press release. Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the Company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as the risks outlined in Pentair's most recent Form 10-Q, Form 10-K and today's press release. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today and the Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results. Today's webcast is accompanied by a presentation, which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Pentair's website. We will reference these slides throughout our prepared remarks. Any references to non-GAAP financials are reconciled in the appendix of the presentation. We will be sure to reserve time for questions-and-answers after our prepared remarks. I would like to request that you limit your questions to one and a follow-up in order to ensure everyone an opportunity to ask their questions. I will now turn the call over to John.
John Stauch: Thank you, Jim and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 4 titled, executive summary. We are pleased to deliver solid third quarter performance. In particular, our return to segment income growth and ROS expansion. And building on our performance from the second quarter. We are maintaining our full year EPS guidance. We've seen price cost stabilized and we are encouraged to see further signs of top line stabilization in our important aquatics business. We continue to invest in our two key strategic growth priorities. Advancing pool growth and accelerating residential and commercial water treatment.  These investments are centered on building out a consumer experience inclusive of our brand, channel, innovative products and services. We continue to believe we are well positioned to return the core sales and income growth in 2020. And I'll talk little more later in the call about our optimism about long-term strategy an prospects.  I'll now turn the call over to Mark to discuss our third quarter results and updated full year outlook. Mark?
Mark Borin: Thank you, John. Please turn to Slide 5 labeled Q3'19 Pentair performance. For the third quarter, overall sales increased slightly and we saw core sales declined 2%. Segment income grew 1% and adjusted EPS increased 7%. We'll provide more color on individual segment performance shortly. Below the line we saw an adjusted tax rate of 15%, net interest, other expenses of $7.7 million and our average shares in the quarter were $168.6 million. The tax rate in the quarter reflects our long-term strategy spread across a lower income base in 2019 resulting in an expected full year adjusted tax rate of 17%.  Finally, free cash flow was just over $150 million and in line with normal seasonal patterns. We were pleased to see segment income grow and ROS expand despite the softer top line and we believe this is a reflection of price cost stabilizing following the headwinds of significant inflation we discussed in prior quarters.  Please turn to Slide 6 labeled Q3'19 Pentair Segment Performance. This slide lays out the third quarter performance of our three segments. As expected our Aquatic segment experienced a 5% core sales decline against an extremely tough comparison. Following rather abnormal weather during the first half of the year, it appeared that weather in much of the country was more normal during the quarter and a result was an improved sell-through. Aquatic saw segment income declined 9% and ROS contracted 60 basis points but still came in north of 25%.  As we have repeated throughout the year, we remained focused on exiting 2019 with channel inventories more in line with historical levels. Filtration Solutions reported core sales growth of 4% with solid contribution across all business lines but particularly within the smaller food and beverage business as we shipped out some of our improved backlog in both beer and sustainable gas. The integration of both Aquion and Pelican remain on track and both businesses performed in line with our expectations. Segment income grew 17% for Filtration and ROS expanded 50 basis points to 16.5%.  In Flow Technologies, core sales declined 5% during the quarter. We continue to see strong headwinds in our Ag business both OEM and after market. Despite the soft top line performance, segment income grew 4% and ROS expanded 170 basis points to 17.1%. As a reminder, Flow Technologies was hit hardest by tariffs and broader inflation in the segment half of 2018 and a comparison in the quarter was its easiest of the year.  While we continue to see mix results across the three segments, we are most encouraged by size of stabilization and price cost as well as only one more quarter of tough top line comparisons for our products. Please turn to Slide 7 labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. Our balance sheet continues to strengthen and third quarter delivered another seasonally strong quarter of free cash flow. During the third quarter we had one bond matured and we have another maturing in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, we successfully issued a 10 year note during the second quarter. Between our healthy free cash flow and improved leverage ratios, our balance sheet remains well positioned to fund both organic and inorganic growth opportunities.  Please turn to Slide 8 labeled Q4'19 Pentair Outlook. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate core sales to be roughly flat. We expect Aquatic Systems to be down approximately 1% to 3% as we continue to focus on making sure channel inventories return to more normalized levels by the end of the year. We expect core sales growth in both Filtration Solutions and Flow Technologies to be essentially flat. We anticipate segment income to be up approximately 6% to 8% as we expect price cost to further stabilized and we continue to drive productivity. We expected adjusted EPS to be in a range of $0.64 to $0.66 per share. Below the line we expect corporate expense to be approximately $14 million to $15 million. We expect our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate to be around 17%. WE expect net interest and other expense of roughly $8 million and shares to be approximately 169 million. Please turn to Slide 9 labeled Full Year 2019 Pentair Outlook. For the full year, we expect core sales to be down roughly 1%. We expect total sales to be essentially flat with roughly 2% contribution from our two acquisitions offset by 1% headwinds from FX. We anticipate segment income to be down around 3%. We continue to expect our full year adjusted EPS to be approximately $2.35 per share. Other items embedded in our guidance include expected corporate expense of $60 million to $63 million and adjusted tax rate of 17%, net interest other expense of $35 million and an average share count for the year of roughly 170 million shares.  While there are undoubtedly many moving pieces to our 2019 pack to expected flat EPS, we continue to be encouraged by signs top line stabilization and further price cost improvement. We are encouraged by the performance our businesses are delivering in light of the top line challenges faced this year.  I would now like to turn the call back to John.
John Stauch: Thank you, Mark. Please turn to Slide 10, labeled Executing a Consistent Strategy. We continue to be focused on driving our long-term strategy and we believe there is a lot of evidence at the focused investment we are making is the right investments and driving results. Most people would agree that global water quality is a challenge. While many companies are participating in offering to solve this global issue, we've chosen to focus primarily on the residential and commercial markets. There is little argument that consumers can benefit from taking ownership of their water experience.  They can do it to their own taste and with solutions that meet their individual needs and preferences. And Pentair has a variety of solutions to help consumers treat, move and enjoy water. In fact, Pentair is one of the few total solution providers to residential customers. Also, when we aligned on our strategy nearly two years ago, it started with our leading Aquatic franchise. With over 5 million pools installed in the US, and over half of them being over decade old, there is large and installed base to serve. We've built the strong business focus on new product development and strong dealer loyalty.  The introduction of the Variable Speed Pump nearly a decade ago created awareness around energy savings and the results has compounded with other product categories from LED lightly to hybrid heaters. We believe the continued adoption of automation which is small today, roughly 275,000 pools versus an opportunity north of 2.5 million pools in the US, creates a new avenue of growth where we have leading position.  Within residential Filtration market, the acquisition of Aquion and Pelican earlier this year moved us being leading component suppliers to now being a provider of systems and solutions. We've learned quite a lot in our short time owning both of these businesses, and we believe there are many paths to create value as we help consumers solve their water challenges in their homes.  On the commercial side of the business, we've historically enjoyed a strong position in food service area. Increasingly, we are focusing on total water management with customers and we believe this presents an opportunity, better positions us with many our existing and potential customers. Within the commercial office water space, customers are increasingly looking at opportunities to decrease the use of plastic bottles. And we've a number of technologies today that can serve this space. And we believe there are opportunities to further expand in this area.  Outside of the residential and commercial verticals, we've a number of technologies we've developed around nano and ultra filtration. As we develop new IoT products, we see even more opportunities to solve customer challenges. For instance, within the beer industry, we've approximately 150 plants globally that use our digital BMS system, enable our customers to become more sustainable, lower cost, move from static to dynamic live reporting and improved overall operating performance. We've transition this technology into the sustainable gas industry and we believe there are opportunities to expand this technology to other parts of our portfolio over time.  We also continue to believe there are multiple paths to drive consistent, sustainable growth especially in our core residential and commercial businesses. And our recent acquisition allowed us to move closer to the consumer. And while we have built stronger aquatic business, we believe that by better focusing on the consumer not only the dealer, it will enable us to maintain an already healthy growth rate in one of our best businesses.  We believe that we have the right portfolio, the right strategy, the right culture and the right technologies to further our positions as a leading water treatment company. With the strong core to build from and healthy balance sheet to support both our organic and inorganic opportunities, we look forward to demonstrating our strategy to our shareholders in Q4, and in 2020 and beyond.  I would now like to turn the call over to Dorothy for Q&A, after which I will have a few closing remarks. Dorothy, please open the line for questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. 
SteveTusa: Hi guys, good morning. Hey, can you just breakdown a little more like what’s going on in the Flow business? The revenues were way off versus our model, but the profits kind of held in. and I know this dispersion in the margin profile of some of those businesses, so and that was one. I think, in the first quarter that was tougher to kind of figure out. What’s going on in that segment? I think the other two are pretty straight forward. What’s going on in this segment?
JohnStauch: Yes, Steve, let me speak to the revenue miss and I’ll let Mark to give the details. But during the end of Q2, we saw a little both positive in some of the Ag orders. And right out of the gate in Q3, we just saw that Ag did not recover at all, so we had anticipated a little more recovery sequentially in Q3. And it just slide out, didn’t happen.  So now we’ve adjusted heading into Q4 next year the fact that we don’t see Ag recovering at all. And I think the lot of the global data would suggest that, and we’d probably figured it out right now. But that was a little bit of a bounce in Q3 that we had expected that didn’t happen. 
SteveTusa: How big is Ag? It isn’t that relatively profitable? Shouldn’t that had a -- shouldn't that have had a kind of more negative impact on the margin like? What am I missing on that front?
MarkBorin: Yes, Steve it’s Mark, and it’s a great question. What we saw positive signs here were two things really, you’ll see price cost getting better. As I said in my prepared comments, Flow was hit hardest by the inflation pressure so we see price cost turning positive in Q3. And then also productivity, we touched on that in Q2 that, that although we weren’t, we didn’t see the productivity reading out in Q2 we saw signs that gave us a high degree of confidence that we would start to see that in Q3 and that’s really what happened.  So, you’re right that, being down in Ag from a mix perspective would push margins down and income down but, that was --we were benefited by better productivity and improved price cost. And Steve-- 
SteveTusa: And how big is Ag, for you guys?
MarkBorin: Ag would be somewhere in the $200 million range. 
JohnStauch: Per year.
SteveTusa: Okay, and then one last one just on the Aquatics, pool made some pretty positive comments that their channel is clear. Can you kind of validate that comment or are there other considerations and thinking about next year a little bit, I would think you guys have some easy comps here coming up in the first half of ’20 or is there something else that we should keep in mind when thinking about kind of the trajectory in the next year?
JohnStauch: Yes Steve, so I think you’re right. I mean we do track a lot of our largest customer’s earnings calls and we agree that inventory is definitely getting more normalized here. And our goal is in between now and the end of the year and make sure that it gets into that normalized pattern.  I do think though that, the pricing this year is relatively more normal which we’ll not suggest that any of the channel would reach to do the buy heads that we saw last year with a much more elevated pricing levels so, Mark, I don’t know if you want to add anything more?
MarkBorin: Yes. I agree, I mean, we’ve said we continue to believe that by the end of the year, we’ll exit with normal levels and we think of 2020 more in line with historical normal seasonal stabilized perspective. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.
NathanJones: Good morning, everyone. Just maybe thinking a little bit about where the returns organic growth comes from in 2020. I think we have probably being in the pool business thinking kind of understand why that should return to growth. But I mean look if I'm having a look at the last couple of quarter's results; organic sales have been down with positive impacts from price. This quarter, you're down to with 3 points to price, and volume down 5. Outside of the pool business with -- what I would imagine are moderating price tailwinds and some negative volume trends here, where would you expect the growth to come from in 2020 outside of pool?
JohnStauch: Well. I mean it’s good question, and I thank you for asking. But I mean, I think first of all, we beyond pool, we also had some channel inventory in both Filtration and Flow. That was built up for some of the same buy ahead patterns that happened in last year's Q3 and Q4. So this year's Q3 and Q4 have those difficult comparisons and then Q1 and Q2 of next year have much easier comparisons across Filtration, Flow and Aquatics.
NickStokes: Okay. So some tough comp issues this year for the same reasons is pool latest ones next year. That makes sense. Can you maybe talk a little bit more about some of these? You talked about focused investments being the right investments and driving results. Maybe talk a little bit more about where those investments and what kind of results you're seeing them drive? And maybe specifically a little bit more about building out the channel for the commercial and residential filtration.
JohnStauch: Yes, so we have three specific growth priorities in both pool and residential and commercial filtration. It’s really about having, I’ll start with commercial first, and it’s about having the best commercial systems and capabilities. And we’re really excited about the technology that we’re building to sell at commercial office water opportunities, as you know, people are seeking carbonated water and they’re also seeking flavored carbonated water.  So really excited about the investments we made on technology side, while we’re more than a year away from launching that product that our product is really better solution that we think that the market will benefit from. So excited there. We are also through both the acquisitions and also internally within Pentair; we’re having the best residential systems. Smarter, more innovative valves technology, smarter water softener systems technology, I am hooking those to automation and then having the services piece to the Pelican acquisition to complete that last mile. And we’re really excited about the progress of that in home sales capability, and the build out of what we call our mobile resource centers which are our brands that we go out and sell with. So huge progress there. On the pool side, we continue to see technology advancement, new technologies around filtration, new technologies around automation, so we’re excited that that penetration rate will show up.  When you look at the sell-through rates of pool in both Q2 and Q3, they’re back to the high single-digits again. So once we get through this inventory channel issue and the pool business normalizes, I think we’re very positive that we’ll see that return to growth next year.
NathanJones: On the commercial water filtration product, the flavored and bubbly water, have you guys done enough work to kind of talk about what you think the size of that opportunity is for you?
JohnStauch: I think it’s really fragmented. I think the overall momentum is there. I think what we wanted to do is make sure that we have the systems that can give you chilled, heated, sparkling and as you know our other peer filtration is a big part of that overall component. So we want to be talked about in the space, and we want to make sure we have the right systems that can solve any solution, that basically a commercial customer has. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.
JoeGiordano: Hey guys, good morning. John, I just wanted to clarify something you said earlier on Steve’s question regarding Ag, Flow. I think you mentioned that there was some headwinds kind of exiting Q2 about Ag, that didn’t materialize in the quarter. I was under the impression that once Ag that when we have that bad weather in the first half that like any recovery in Ag was taken out of guidance. So I'm just a little confused about, can you kind of square that for me? +
JohnStauch: Yes, there are two forms of Ag. We have a precision Ag spray business and that we did address earlier and that is a very-very high margin offering. The other part of Ag is more of the pivot Ag spray in the irrigation side of the business, that’s specifically what I was referring to.
JoeGiordano: Okay, so this is the irrigation not the precision, okay cool. Okay, can you talk about maybe some of the impacts you’re having with some of just the internal cost that you shared? Because clearly, I mean, particularly in Flow, I mean, you’re seeing the margins come through on weak number on a weak growth number, so may be you talk about some at a high level maybe there’s a couple of examples you can kind of take us through or sort of some things that are being done differently today than maybe a year ago, across the enterprise maybe?
JohnStauch: Yes, sure. One of the things we talk a lot about is we separated with optimization and really looking at where did we have complexity and how can we get after complexity reduction and into the Flow Technology segment was certainly one of those businesses where we saw high degree of that skew rationalization things, that inherently drives up cost and drive down margins.  And the team really got after that in as we exited 2017 and throughout 2018, and so we started to see those activities and actions pay off here in 2019. And also, we’ve also talked about some of the factories where we had some challenges. We’ve been investing in automation and other technology to replace and improve some of the older equipment and machinery that’s used in some of those factories that’s also starting to readout early stages. So there’s more of that to comments, we think about 2020 but we’re again seeing favorable signs and encouraged by what we’re seeing. 
JoeGiordano: And one last for me on, if we look and it’s too early to talk 2020, but if we just think about the situation where there is inventory cleaned up through your partners, and we can start ramping a little bit. When I think about free cash flow, there’s nice performance here in the quarter. Is that going to be, how much of the headwind do you see that being into ’20 as things kind of ramp up and start producing at higher rates?
JohnStauch: I think we still have opportunity to really focus on cash flow and we continue to view cash flow targeting at approximating adjusted net income, so we wouldn’t change that point of view even though as we grow to your point, there maybe some working capital type things that we need to invest. But there are opportunities in other places that we would manage and balance out to have that long -term target still maintained. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Baird. 
MikeHalloran: Hey, good morning everyone. So a couple ones first, just on capital usage here, any thoughts to bring back being more aggressive on the buyback side again? And then secondarily related to that, how’s the M&A pipeline look? What's the willingness, ability to bring something in and how are the evaluations looking out there?
JohnStauch: Yes, I mean I think clearly we’re focusing on execution right now Mike and part of that was making sure that we’re delivering on our commitments, Q2, Q3, and Q4 so that’s our first focus area. I think there are the growing opportunities to invest in the platforms that I mentioned. And we’re continuing to look at those tuck-in acquisitions I would say that feed more what we’ve done already.  But you can never time those. We have no idea where they’re going, and we just want to make sure that we’re protecting the balance sheet heading into next year and giving ourselves flexibility to do what we think is going to drive most amount of value. 
MikeHalloran: The pipeline on that side, John?
JohnStauch: Good. 
MikeHalloran: All right, and then just some thoughts on the price cost side, you talked --it seemed like you’re implying the price cost side should be a little bit more favorable moving forward from here. Maybe talk about puts and takes on the pricing side? Is that kind of flattened out a little bit relatively to the commodity side? And how you’re thinking about that moving into next year?
JohnStauch: Yes, so maybe the way to think about it is, we had significant price cost headwinds as we talked about coming out of last year and into the beginning of this year. Now what I referenced in Q3 in particular was favorability because we’ve got favorable price and we have inflation moderating. As you move forward that favorable year-over-year price will start to be a little bit more than normal, at a more normalized level versus the unusually high price increases that we had in 2018 that spilled over into 2019.  So, I don't -- it's more of a stabilization story rather than a benefit. It’s just mitigation of what had been a pretty significant headwind. And on the inflation side, one thing to always kind of keep in mind is inflation is not just the material or commodity inflation, but we certainly also have labor inflation and we don’t see that going away or moderating. So that will continue to be part of how we think about what our 2020 will look like.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
JeffHammond: Hey, good morning guys. Just on, can you just talk about what is in forming the lower growth rate in filtration and then just as you look forward here a lot about our macro-slowing and just where and just where are you seeing some signs of slowing in your business outside of that Ag space?
MarkBorin: Sure. As we-- as I talked about in Q3, we saw pretty, pretty improved performance in the food and beverage part of the filtration business. That moderates a little bit in Q4, so that's part of the story. We do see continued stabilization and incremental improvement on the important residential and commercial side. Both the systems and components businesses, where those -- the investments in those acquisitions took place. So overall, just more of a moderated view given their performance in Q3, and then would expect to kind of as we think about moving into 2020. A similar level of performance and starting to see some of the investments that John talked about reading out and improve core sales growth.
JeffHammond: Okay, and then just on pool. What are you assuming and what are customers telling you about kind of the normal early buy situation? And then just, if we look into 2020, certainly you've got some easy comps and typically this business grows mid-to-high single digits. Should we think of 2020 is kind of an easy comp and you can get back to those levels or above? Thanks.
MarkBorin: So on the first question and from an early buy perspective, we're seeing kind of a consistent early buy pattern, of last year was a little bit unusual because of the blend of the impact of the price increase. But what we're seeing this year is more in line with kind of the historical trends. In terms of next year, as we said, we're exiting Q4, you see that the Q4 guide is what I would think of as back to a little bit more level of normalization improved income performance, flattening of the top line, which had been decreasing, and as we think about 2020, we're just going really focus on getting back to what we believe would be performance in line with our long term objectives.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. 
DeaneDray: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Hey, very well, thank you. How about, can we put a little finer point on the working down the excess channel inventory and pool? If we had been thinking it was around a $60 million excess it just based on commentary about expected 4Q normalizing. How much should we think about that $60 million haven't been worked up so far?
MarkBorin: So as we talked, and we worked down some of that inventory in line with sort of our expectations and we continue to see that coming down further in Q4 and exiting the year at levels that are in line with more historical seasonal patterns. 
DeaneDray: Okay, and then on pool, John, you talk about some of the new product development in filtration and pool and automation are just to set expectations, might you have some new automation offerings for the 2020 season? 
JohnStauch: Yes, we do already. And I think we're learning how to sell it better. We believe everybody can benefit from that automation capability. It's a different type of sale though. And we have that we believe the right products that can really help the user along, and we have to tweak our ability to sell technology. It's not like selling a product. It's more like selling a service or capability. And so we learned a lot this year. And I think we're encouraged by the progress we're making in Q3 and Q4. And I think those products can really accelerate as they head into next year. 
DeaneDray: When you say sell a service, is that something that Pentair would benefit from on a recurring basis or is that a pool dealer that would be part of their revenue stream? 
MarkBorin: Well, clearly the vision would be that everybody would benefit, right? And that at the end of the day, most people buy technology on more rented basis because they believe whatever they have is going to be obsolete. We'd have to line the channel that way, Deane but ultimately, we think that's going to be the right answer. We're launching in this quarter, the new Pentair Home App, which basically is a broad umbrella that takes all of the suite of products that Pentair offers and allows you to be connected into that Home App. And we're hopeful that as the consumer sees more and more things that are available to either connecting with Alexa or Google Home or Apple or whatever your devices that you start to see the benefits of, some of the monitoring your water quality, and then starting to buy some of the products and services that would attach to that.
DeaneDray: That's good to hear. And just last one for me when you talk about the commercial office water opportunity, are you thinking and still we agree that it's still very fragmented. Are you thinking of a rental opportunity or would this be equipment sales or both?
MarkBorin: Today, it's about having the right systems and likely out selling them, Deane, as you know the market does rent them. The end solution providers do rent units. Don't know yet if that's the space that we want to be in. But we were -- we introduced carbonated water some 8 to 10 years ago. We were probably early in the market. We have all the technology and we deliver that for food service and so how do we bring that into a commercial office environment in a productive way, if that's what people want. As you guys know, there's a lot of fickle drinkers. The first one is get tea and coffee.  Most all tea and coffee needs to be filtered, so you don't scale the units or cause damage to those units. And our filtration plays a big part in that. And if we expand that filtration into other forms of water, we think there's a huge opportunity for Pentair. And look, this is forward thinking, we believe we have the technology where it's probably not a 2020 launch, it's probably somewhere in 2021. 
Operator: Your next question comes from a line of Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley.
JoshPokrzywinski: Good morning, guys. Quick question on price cost, I guess, with working down channel inventory and kind of generalized market weakness, some of that related weather earlier in the year. I would imagine it's harder to get price certainly, probably more room for incentives than to try to raise prices in the channel. Is that something we should expect to start expanding more rapidly from this point now that we've kind of cleared the season, cleared the channel overhang from an inventory perspective?
JohnStauch: I think the best way to think about it is, as I said before, it's just more of a normalized level of price, as you know a big chunk of the price that we see overall comes from the pool business that they had unusually high price last year in response to inflation. This year, they had a price increase that would have gone into effect in September, which is the normal timeframe that those price increases go into place. And I call that a more in a more normal historical level and something similar in the other businesses. So we are not seeing --we didn't see any unusual reaction to price this year as a result of channel inventories and but we do see just going to a more normalized level given that last year's higher price was really driven by that incremental inflation. 
JoshPokrzywinski: Got it. And then I guess as it pertains to the aquatic season, just as we kind of round it down there in the third quarter, obviously you had a slow start with weather and particularly in some of the warmer regions that would have been bigger contributors in the first quarter. Did any of that get made up later in the year just with the season, maybe stretching out longer, not even weather related, but just thinking of folks are always going to be busy kind of May through August, but maybe they do an extra job in September. Is that something that you guys noticed and maybe sets up, accomplish and think about and sell through next year? 
MarkBorin: Yes, I think some of it will. I don't think first of all, the comp is meaningful enough. But yes, those pool builders will continue to work as long as they can in those areas. And they'll fill in jobs in the slower season that they would have otherwise not done. But they will also probably likely celebrate the holidays that exists in Q4. And so you're not going to see that same level of build that you tend to see in the more summer seasons. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies.
SareeBoroditsky: Good morning. Could you provide some color on what you saw geographically? I believe last quarter you talked about Europe and China being positive. Did that continue? And any expectations as we look forward towards the end of the year?
JohnStauch: Sure, that -- it did continue. So we had commented earlier in the year that we saw some weakness in Europe, particularly on the filtration side, as we move through the year in Q2, and then again in Q3, and we really see to the balance of the year, we saw improvement there. So Europe now has -- is back to moderating growth and China as well is returned to a reasonably good growth level.
SareeBoroditsky: And then just a more longer term question on aquatic. How should we think about the impact from the Variable Speed Pump Legislation that goes into effect into 2021?
JohnStauch: We believe in 2021 it should help our overall sales. Variable Speed Pumps for us today are probably just over half of our total pumps sold. They do sell at a higher sell through value. So we do believe as the transition happens. Those of us who've been through these transitions before always have to go question, one of those dates going to really happen and will there be slippage and also, how does the inventory work its way through. And so we're not putting anything into 2020, obviously, and, we'll see if there's a relative bump in 2021, but overall should be positive to our business.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.
JulianMitchell: Thank you. Good morning. Maybe just following up on that geographic point, you had emphasized some of the weakness in Ag. We've talked a lot already about residential trends in the US in the past few months. Just wondered if you could give any detail around what you've seen in some of the more commercial or industrial markets in the US? If there's been any particular shift in demand from month-to-month since July?
JohnStauch: Nothing significant from a month-to-month perspective, our -- 80% of our businesses overall is driven by the residential and commercial end markets and as we move through the balance of the year, we've talked about sort of the inventory impact, but beyond that the underlying demand has remained positive and we continue to see that kind of reading out through the balance of the year.
JulianMitchell: Thanks. And then on your sort of segment Income Bridge I guess on slide 5, when we're thinking about the productivity portion of that in aggregate, it looks like it's probably a maybe a $20 million tailwind or something for the year as a whole. If you could just sort of clarify that sounds about right and then when thinking about next year, do we think about some of those measures that you've accelerated around productivity pushing that number up or is that a pretty good run rate for the current demand environment?
MarkBorin: Yes, I think what you're seeing in Q3 is more in line with the level that we would anticipate. And I think to remember kind of what makes that up. There are multiple elements. So there's material productivity which is we're working on trying to mitigate some of the inflation headwinds. There's operating costs productivity that would think about that as you're looking at opportunities to reduce G&A costs. And then there's factory productivity, but then what's offsets that is also the investments we're making in the growth areas around R&D and selling, marketing investments and technology and things like that. So as we think about this year and into next year, we will continue to look for increasing levels of productivity but utilizing some of that to continue to invest in the areas where we see the biggest growth opportunities.
JulianMitchell: Thanks very much. And one last quick one for me. Looking at the filtration operating performance, you had pretty healthy sales growth there in Q3. The incremental margin was around 20% or so. Is that a reasonable sort of placeholder for that business with its current mix or do you see anything sort of one time within that figure? 
MarkBorin: I wouldn't call it one time but with this, this is where we do have the residential systems and also the consumer services and we are significantly investing in those businesses, right. So we're very encouraged by the top line growth we have and we continue to add back digital marketing, advertising, branding and R&D spend to really accelerate the long-term growth there. So I think this is a more normalized pattern, as we head into 2020 is benefiting from the growth and then reinvesting a portion of that income back into fuel more growth.
Operator: Your next question comes from a line of Walter Liptak with Seaport Global. 
WalterLiptak: Hi. Thanks, good morning. I want to ask a geographic question, and understand the comments about the EU filtration kind of moving up from moderating growth in China doing okay, now. I wonder if we could just get a little bit more detail about why that as we look at macro numbers, Europe continues to get worse. China, the GDP numbers continue to weaken. What's going on with your sectors or the market share that's helping those regions?
JohnStauch: Yes, so let me talk about China, first. In our China business, we said before in China, Southeast Asia overall is residential and commercial filtration primarily. And think about that being just north of 100 and some million dollars on an annual basis. So the growth rates we're talking about are really about starting from a relatively low base in a very enormous market in which we have a dedicated China team and we have a dedicated factory dedicated R&D lab. And we really invested a lot of new product growth and marketing.  So, we're winning in a space that may or may not overall be growing, but we have a lot of runway left in that area. In Europe, Mark gave the overall numbers and that is appropriate. Within those overall numbers, those things that are doing well in Europe, and there's things that aren't doing so well in Europe. So as we look at you know, some of the global industrial product lines, we definitely saw slow downs. And when you take a look at some of the more installed base, residential and commercial aftermarket businesses they're doing okay. Than no way would we call a robust market environment.
WalterLiptak: Okay. Can you help us with the size of the EU industrial business?
MarkBorin: Yes, I think it's roughly $100 million. 
WalterLiptak: $100 million total for the year. 
MarkBorin: For the year, right. Not in a quarter.
WalterLiptak: Okay, great. And then just switch gears over to the R&D, hearing about the investments in 2020, or is it similar levels of R&D, but more focused around some of these growth opportunities, or should we expect some kind of a step up in R&D spends?
JohnStauch: Yes, I think you're going to expect a step up. I've said many times that we have the ability to invest a lot more in R&D. And we'll feel better about that investment when we feel marketing has done the work to produce the roadmap of where our R&D will be best utilized. And we're really excited about our automation platforms and we have a global innovation center around automation, one Pentair solution that would work across the enterprise, really excited about that roadmap.  And then around our treatment, and water treatment Innovation Center, really excited about the nano and ultra filtration technologies out of the CPT acquisition our X flow business, and expanding those into both residential and commercial, very excited.  And then as I mentioned earlier building systems capability that takes that technology and gives the overall solution. Those are the double downs for me and the team, and I'm going to accelerate that investment in 2020 and probably 2021. And we're encouraged and excited by the products of the other end of that investment.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.
BrianLee: Hey, guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just first one on price going back to that topic to clarify a bit. I know 2019 was a bit of normal with the three points here and I know it's early for 2020. But do you think it's reasonable to assume we just settle back to somewhere around the point in price for next year, like we've seen in past years, or was the pricing this year late enough in the year where there's still some spillover into the early part of next year? 
JohnStauch: Yes. I think about it a slightly higher than that, 1% that we've seen, so prior to 2018 for the few years prior to that, it been right around 1%. But that was I call that like historically low, so something in the 2% range is probably a little bit more in line with what would be historically normal. With a rounded range on that 50 basis points. Okay. I mean, I think it's too early to say. The businesses that went out in September as Mark said, I mean, we were out in that range that Mark said and we saw those pricing stick, and we’re generally well received by the overall customers, and there was a more normal, and then we'll see how the others do. 
BrianLee: Okay, great. That's helpful. And then just a second question going back to Flow for a second. I know you, you kind of walk back to core growth outlook for that segment through the year and you sort of did the opposite last year and walking it up through the years. So how do you de-risk the view here for 4Q just given how lumpy it's been all year, and then as you think about 2020, is this a segment you'd expect to grow year-on-year along with the overall business? Thanks.
MarkBorin: I can't call it de-risk. I can just tell you that it represents the last multiple quarter trends, it doesn't produce any incremental upside sequentially from things growing off of how they did the previous quarter, and then there is some year-over-year benefit as you look at Q1 and Q2 in this business next year. And then we'll see how confident we are when we come up with the guide of being able to drive organic growth in Q3 and Q4 of next year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Vertical Research Partners.
BrettLinzey: Hi, good morning, guys. Hey, I just wanted to come back to Aquatics. You talked about some of the technology and growth priorities you have there and pool. As we think about those incremental costs and price moderating, but also some relief on ROS and other spending. What's the right incremental margin range we should be thinking about next year as you maybe see a more normal top line?
JohnStauch: This business has a fairly sizable drop through. And because it's sales wise material and a really efficient manufacturing process. So good drop through. I'm not going to give you an answer because this is a huge value contributor to Pentair. I want to invest in this. And I think we have some really exciting technologies in the pipeline here as well. And we'd like to put some investment back into sales channel. Primarily around the aftermarket side, I think we do a really nice job with our dealer channel covering both new pools and remodel pools.  I think our opportunity is and being further down the aftermarket cycle with the services channel, and making sure we're the company of choice for consumers and that services play. And then also making sure that we go back to our roots and I'd still say we are the technology leader, but we used to be significantly more advanced than we are today. And we believe we have those technologies in the pipeline and need to drive them through a new product development phase, and that will be an investment thesis for 2020 as well.
BrettLinzey: Okay, great. And then shifting to restructuring, it took I think $6 million this quarter, $7 million last quarter. Are you budgeting more spending in Q4? And then just thinking about the payback? Did most of that get realized in the quarter? Do you see some of that rolling over into 2020 and from saving standpoint? Thanks.
JohnStauch: So we don't include in our guidance and expectation around restructuring, but I would anticipate there would be some incremental restructuring again in Q4. And the investments and restructuring that we've made in this year really wouldn't see those necessarily reading out now. But those would be part of how we think about 2020.  As Mark mentioned, we're attacking some of the factories and some of the efforts within the factories. Those tend to have a little bit longer payoff than just structural changes to the business. So we have a right investments, we do have a larger footprint than we need and it is always geographically perfect. So we've addressed some of that especially the flow side, as Mark mentioned. And while we're seeing the margin improvement, I think there's still an opportunity for more margin improvement down the road.
BrettLinzey: Okay. And geographically where those costs were focused restructuring? 
JohnStauch: Little bit everywhere. Yes. End of Q&A
Operator: And there are no further questions. At this time, I will turn the call back over to our speakers for closing remarks. 
John Stauch: Thank you for joining us today. We are encouraged by our third quarter performance, and we continue to see further signs of stabilization in our core business. We saw further productivity improvement in the quarter and we continue to build on our strong culture. We've been investing and we'll continue to invest in our key growth strategies, as well as digital enterprise capabilities to better serve our customers. We have a strong capital structure, solid free cash flow and we will continue to invest in our strategy to be the leading residential commercial water treatment company. Thank you for your continued interest. Dorothy, you can conclude the call. 
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-07-23 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. My name is Rob and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q2 2019 Pentair Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After your presenter's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Jim Lucas, you may begin your conference.
Jim Lucas: Thanks, Rob. And welcome to Pentair's second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. We're glad you could join us. I'm Jim Lucas, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer, and with me today is John Stauch, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Borin, our Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, we will provide details on our second quarter 2019 performance as well as our third quarter and full year 2019 outlook as outlined in this morning's press release. Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the Company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as the risks outlined in Pentair's most recent Form 10-Q, Form 10-K and today's press release. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today and the Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results. Today's webcast is accompanied by a presentation, which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Pentair's website. We will reference these slides throughout our prepared remarks. Any references to non-GAAP financials are reconciled in the appendix of the presentation. We will be sure to reserve time for questions-and-answers after our prepared remarks. I would like to request that you limit your questions to one and a follow-up in order to ensure everyone an opportunity to ask their questions. I will now turn the call over to John.
John Stauch: Thank you, Jim and good morning everyone. Please turn to Slide Number 4, titled Executive Summary. We are pleased to deliver second quarter results in-line with our expectations, even as weather issues lingered throughout the quarter. We continued to believe that the underlying demand trends in our businesses remain healthy and we have plenty of growth opportunities ahead of us. Our second half outlook demonstrates progress against unprecedented inflation inclusive of tariffs and we now believe that we will get back to our 18% tax rate for the remainder of 2019 and for 2020. Our recent acquisitions Aquion and Pelican are performing in-line with expectations. Further, both deals help us accelerate our Residential Water Treatment strategy, which I will provide an update on later in the call. We are continuing to invest in our top growth priorities and I will provide more color on our focused opportunities after Mark shares details on Q2 and our updated guidance. I will now turn the call over to Mark.
Mark Borin: Thank you, John. Please turn to Slide 5 labeled Q2'19 Pentair Performance. For the second quarter, we saw core sales increased 1%, segment income fall 6% and adjusted EPS was down 3%. We will provide more color on the individual segment performance shortly. Below the line we saw an adjusted tax rate of 18%, net interest/other expense of $10.6 million and our average shares in the quarter were 170.5 million. We had originally expected our tax rate to increase in 2019 due to proposed IRS rule changes, because the proposed rules have not yet been finalized and enacted, as well as actions to help mitigate the expected impact; we now believe our full year adjusted tax rate will be at the 18% level we reported in 2018. Finally, free cash flow was well north of $300 million and in-line with normal seasonal patterns. As John, mentioned in his opening remarks, we are pleased to deliver operational results in line with expectations, despite the lingering weather issues. Please turn to Slide 6 labeled Q2 19 Pentair Segment Performance. This slide lays out the second quarter performance of our three segments. As this slide illustrates two of our three segments delivered core sales growth in the quarter. The one exception was Aquatics, which continues to be impacted by weather delays and excess channel inventory. Aquatic saw segment income declined 4% on a 2% core sales decline. Filtration Solutions returned to growth, delivering 1% core sales growth. We commented that the first quarter results were impacted by a number of one-time issues and we believe that the second quarter performance shows that many of those issues have moderated. Segment income was down 4% and margins declined 250 basis points against a very tough comparison last year and negative mix during the quarter. We saw growth in our industrial and food and beverage businesses, while residential was relatively flat in the quarter. We continue to focus on positioning Filtration Solutions to drive more consistent and predictable growth and anticipate margins mixing up over time. Flow Technologies delivered 5% core sales growth as price continue to read out and we also saw improvement in our commercial and infrastructure businesses. Although the agriculture markets continue to be down for us, agriculture performed in line with our revised expectations. Segment income declined 6%, however, the segment margin decline was half the rate we experienced in the first quarter. This was the last tough comparison around inflation and we are expecting flow margins to turn positive in the second half. Please turn to Slide 7 labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. We are pleased with our second quarter cash flow performance and delivered $343 million in free cash flow, which is in line with normal seasonal patterns. During the quarter, we successfully completed a $400 million 10-year note offering, which was used to repay debt incurred to fund our first quarter acquisitions, and will also be used to help fund our second half debt maturities. With the new offering, our debt structure is now predominantly fixed and we continue to have strong balance sheet optionality. Also in the second quarter, we repurchased 150 million of our shares in line with our annual share repurchase plan. Please turn to Slide 8 labeled Q3'19 Pentair Outlook. We anticipate third quarter sales, core sales to decrease 1% to 3%. We expect Aquatic Systems to be down 8% to 10%, as we continue to focus on making sure channel inventories return to more normalized levels by the end of the year. We expect Filtration Solutions to be up 1% to 3% and Flow Technologies to be flat to up 2%. We anticipate segment income to be approximately flat to up 2%, as we expect inflation comparisons to ease and price to fully read out and we continue to drive productivity. We expect adjusted EPS to be in a range of $0.54 to $0.56 per share. Below the line, we expect corporate expenses to be approximately $14 million to $15 million. We expect our third quarter tax rate to be 18%. We also expect net interest other expense of roughly $9 million and shares to be approximately 169 million. Please turn to Slide 9 labeled Full Year 2019 Pentair Outlook. Slide 9 looks at the different components of our updated 2019 outlook. For the full year, we expect core sales to be flat to down 1%, as we continue to expect price of roughly 3% for the full year. We expect flat to up 1% with roughly 2% contribution from the recently announced acquisitions offset by 1% headwind from FX. We anticipate segment income to be approximately 2%; we expect full year adjusted EPS to be approximately $2.35 per share. Other items embedded in our guidance include corporate expense of $60 million to $65 million, a tax rate of 18%, net interest other expense of $37 million and an average share count for the year of 171 million shares. As we look at our 2019 second half and full year expected performance, it is important to consider the unusual circumstances we have experienced in 2018 and the first half of 2019. Starting in the second half of 2018 and through the first half of 2019, we experienced significant material inflation partially driven by tariffs of over $120 million. In 2018, we implemented price increases in part to address this dramatic increase and inflation and the net result was a significant increase in inventory levels in our distribution channels. Through the first half of 2019, as these elevated inventory levels are being worked down, several of our key markets and pools in agriculture were hit with historically wet cold weather, resulting in a delay and inventory channel levels being worked down. We believe this perfect storm of unusual external factors resulted in far from normal experience in the first two quarters of 2019. As we look forward to 2020, we expect to return to a more normalized level of performance more in-line with our long-term expectations. I would now like to turn the call back to John.
John Stauch: Thank you, Mark. Please turn to Slide Number 10, labeled Focused Strategies. I wanted to provide an update on our two focus growth strategies. We recently completed a comprehensive North American residential consumer segmentation, which has provided great insights into how to better position two of our key businesses pool and residential and commercial water filtration for differentiated growth. The segmentation analysis gave us granularity as to our customers' needs, behaviors and key attributes. These insights allow us to better understand their buying behaviors, as well as customer journey mapping in future product insights to meet their needs. These insights are critical to driving our marketing efforts and to be more targeted in the types of personas that we want to engage with in the future and how to best connect them with our channel partners. As we focus on advancing pool growth, we have opportunities in both the new and replacement markets. Whether only about 75,000 new pools built a year, we see opportunities to increase our content per pool, particularly around automation and connected solutions, as well as new products in the areas of remote monitoring, advanced energy efficiency and simplicity of maintenance. These are also similar opportunities with approximately 5 million installed in ground pools, we continue to look at the poolpad as pools ecosystem. Through this lens, we are developing more efficient treatment technologies as well as smart, an IoT enabled products that seamlessly configure and operate more effectively together. These solutions are being managed by what we believe are best-in-class apps that enable a superior user experience, as well as opportunities to drive improved levels of customer service. Accelerating residential and commercial water treatment is our other primary growth opportunity; the first area we are focusing on is end-to-end residential consumer filtration. Here our two recent acquisitions are playing an important part. Aquion brought to us systems capabilities as well as affiliated RainSoft dealers. Pelican brought an online capability that expands our omnichannel reach. Similar to what we have done in Aquatic Systems, we have been looking at water treatment applications throughout the home as a system offering. Through this work, we have identified many customer back opportunities to create differentiated water treatment products and systems. We are developing more efficient treatment technologies tackling some of the challenges that are top of mind for consumers today, such as lead removal and delivering great tasting water at every tap in your home. We also been developing and we will soon be launching the Pentair home and Pentair pro apps that bring our new suite of smart IoT enabled products to life. These sets of apps seamlessly connect consumers, water treatment service providers and Pentair to provide product performance monitoring, control and service. The second opportunity we see is building our commercial filtration business. We have enjoyed strong presence in foodservice historically and we plan to continue to focus in this area. There are other areas such as commercial office water that offer additional growth opportunities over time. We believe that these are two significant and focus growth opportunities that can accelerate our organic growth rates and create significant share on the value. I would now like to turn the call over to Rob for Q&A, after which I will have a few closing remarks. Rob, please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Steve Tusa: Just thinking about the fourth quarter, I mean, how are we -- how do we think about kind of the comp there in Aquatics, there is a lot moving around, obviously you had a bit of a pre-buy last year, you're still saying it's going to be I guess, up what -- are we comfortable with that?
John Stauch: Hi, Steve; when you say up -- time up, revenue up, income up, just trying to…
Steve Tusa: Yes, I guess whatever revenue and income, I think it's up -- I don't know, I'm sorry I've been in another call, so I didn't -- I'm not -- maybe I missed that. Just talk about -- just talk about how you approach the comp in the fourth quarter I guess?
John Stauch: Yes, first to talk about Q4 overall. So, with respect to Aquatics, Aquatics on the top-line is when you work out the math is down slightly.
Steve Tusa: Okay.
John Stauch: In volume, so that is kind of acknowledging a bit of the comp from the prior year, as well as are the continued working down of the inventory that we talked about previously. The other two businesses, we do see those as improving from a revenue perspective some of that's driven by price and some driven by volume. And when you look at the bottom line and think about kind of the year-over-year we start to get, we get more help from price, we are less of a headwind from inflation. We certainly had the acquisitions are embedded in there, so those start to add as well. And then productivity gets better in Q4, if you remember last year we called out some challenges in the Flow business, so we start to see some productivity improvements. They start to read out in Q3, but then continue to ramp up in Q4.
Steve Tusa: And when you think about the myriad of items, the kind of hit the other businesses, the non-Aquatics business in the first quarter could you maybe just discuss any changes in some of the bigger moving parts in the first quarter? You know the negative items like there were some weakness in Europe in Filtration, there were few things. And any kind of changes on those front that bounce back or anything here, I mean, it looks like it was a little more stable and a little better in those businesses.
John Stauch: Steve, I think that's the right way to think about it. Things were a little more stable, you know, in particular -- in filtration, we did call out a number of what I referenced a sort of unusual or one-time type items in Q1. Those stabilize and moderated in Q2. We didn't see certainly a headwind from Europe, for example, in Q2, in filtration and the businesses was better performance in Q2 and we would anticipate seeing something similar as we work through the balance of the year.
Steve Tusa: Okay.
Mark Borin: Steve, the only issue we had in Q2 outside of Aquatics was weather impacting our irrigation businesses and flow in Q2 and that didn't get better off the Q1, but other than that is we don't think that's a lingering effect because the seasons kind of come and gone.
Steve Tusa: And then are you guys buying back stock? Did you buyback any in the quarter? And what's your appetite for the second half?
John Stauch: Yes, so we've bought back 150 million shares in the quarter and that represents our plan for the year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones from Stifel. Your line is open.
Nathan Jones: Good morning, everyone. I'd like to focus a little bit on the productivity line here. It was a headwind of $6 million bucks to operating income in the quarter. I know your net growth investments against underlying productivity there. So, can you just give us a little more color on what led to that $6 million headwind in the quarter?
Mark Borin: Yes, Nathan. It's frankly it's a number of sort of small items that you know that individually don't really amount too much, but overall what drives the $6 million. I think one of the things that we see is, we do see productivity starting to build. As you know productivity, as we start to work through, it takes a little time to work its way through inventory. So, we can see that building up in inventory and that's what gives us confidence that we will start to see that, that productivity number churn as we work our way into Q3 and Q4, and we see our operational and supply productivity actions starting to read out.
John Stauch: Nathan, I would just add that we have significant progress on sourcing that we're making up on against the inflationary issues and that is a positive, and we feel confident about that continuing. We had one lingering productivity issue, which is our larger pump flow business and we're continuing to experience headwinds there that we feel confident, we've got the on-time delivery back up and we've got most of the past due being worked down as we head into Q3 here. So, we feel good about that turning around to a positive in the back half of the year, as Mark mentioned. And I just, like, lastly mentioned that these two growth initiatives, we have a great pool business and we're continue to invest in it despite what's going on with the weather headwinds. So, we're putting a fair amount of sales, customer service support against that. And then also on the end-to-end residential solutions, which is our Pelican business; we're investing heavily to build out the brand in the marketing efforts there. So, those are some negatives against what I think is a sustained positive productivity that you should see in Q3 and Q4.
Nathan Jones: Well, I wouldn't call growth investments in negative even though that does negatively affect that productivity number. But maybe I could push you a little bit further on this because I did go back and read the transcript from third quarter last year. And there was talk about productivity improvements coming from sourcing improvements that would come at a later date. There was talk about some of these inventory, the productivity improvements building an inventory and three quarters later, we're still seeing a negative number here in productivity. So, any color you can -- if more color you can give us on where the confidence comes that we are going to see a turnaround in that number in the second half of the year, when it's been quite a long time coming here.
John Stauch: Yes, Nathan, all I can say is that, as I said, we do start to see it actually reading out in inventory, which would then come through and we see it through the P&L. And the funnels that gives us the confidence are built in a very detailed granular level action start to build up and we see them starting the anniversary and carry over. So, I can't comment on sort of the relationship to last year, but certainly when we look at this year and the activities that the teams are working on, we feel confident about the Q3 and Q4 trajectory there.
Nathan Jones: Would you be prepared to give us a number that you'd expect out of that productivity line in the second half of the year?
John Stauch: We wouldn't specifically comment on that other than to say that, it certainly is going to improve over the number that we see for Q2.
Nathan Jones: Fair enough. Okay, thanks for the help. I'll pass it on.
John Stauch: Nathan, I share your energy and passion around this. I think we feel good about the sequential run rate of our cost structures, if they go forward. When you look at a year-over-year, I mean, if you take back at Filtration Solutions Q2 last year and the ROS that they had, you saw a pretty high ROS. So, we've got some year-over-year comparables in this Q2 that aren't the same comparables as we head into Q3 and Q4. In growth is such a huge component of this drop through that, that's why Mark is not going to give you an exact number at this time.
Nathan Jones: Fair enough. I'll pass it on. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Joe Giordano from Cowen. Your line is open.
Joe Giordano: So I just want to start on Aquatics just talking through the progression throughout the year. So, we make last quarter we kind of readjust everything, we have some -- you had some tough comps coming through in the back half of the year. And so what, -- what when you look at that landscape today is different versus three months ago outside of like some of the weather impacts, when you think about second half specifically for the revenue side of things for Aquatics?
Mark Borin: Yes, really, Joe, the underlying fundamentals continue to be similar to what we commented on at the end of the first quarter, it's really the impact of continued wet cold weather in April and May that significantly impacted sort of our ability to bring down those inventory levels, and so the inventory reduction is led to the right and now that's what's effect in Q3 and Q4. That's really the story for a products, both on the top-line and then when you think about the drop-through on to the bottom line as well.
Joe Giordano: And then when I think you mentioned in the slides commercial office water, I'm not sure I remember hearing too much about that in the past. Is that something new that you guys are working on, can you kind of talk to that opportunity what that landscape looks like?
John Stauch: Yes, thank you for bringing it up. I mean it's really as we have a good foodservice relationship and when you take a water in foodservice it's really critical and important to our end consumers even the form of making coffee, pizza dough, making sure they got safe clean water and good tasting water for their restaurant customers. We also have all those products that we sell into the commercial office water space. And what we're seeing with the office space is being reconfigured and redone, as people want the good tasting water more at the tap, or the capability and then we feel we have superior technology around carbonation capability and also mineral dosing or flavor dosing capability. We could bring that either through OEM partnerships. We can bring that through our existing channels or we're looking for ways to accelerate that through service or total water management in the commercial office water space. So, it's an area that we've been strategically working on for the last 18 months and we really feel like we've got great technology and great products to bring to market there and just wanted to highlight it is an area that we're going to be focusing on.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Deane Dray: Let's stay with the commercial office water opportunity because it does seem like a natural fit for Pentair that whole sector is seeing a disruptive change getting away from that five gallon jug business. But it does bake the question, how do you approach this from a growth ambition how much would be organic, you're looking at M&A in this opportunity? Some folks have approached it with rentals, other outright sales through dealer networks, but some additional color would be helpful as well as a timeline, if you could?
John Stauch: Yes, Deane, I appreciate it. You know clearly the market from a service or delivery perspective is highly fragmented, which has always been a challenge to kind of breakthrough and make sure that your products and capabilities are there. I won't mention by name, but several large OEM producers are looking to get in this market, primarily around delivering the flavored and/or carbonated water needs as well as there's other partners that are thinking about how we bring heated water for tea and coffee to bear. So, I think the movement of having fresh new differentiated technology advanced products is a great opportunity for Pentair, to certainly partner and bring those products through. As far as going to the services end, or doing the last mile, Deane as you mentioned, I think that would have to be more likely an inorganic strategy, which is not what I was addressing today, but I was talking about bringing those products to market.
Deane Dray: Certainly, that makes sense. We'll be watching that space carefully. And then going back to the Aquatics and the inventory and the channel, you had sized it previously at $60 million excess. Where do you think that stands today? And then, just remind us on what the weather impact because that has you get lower utilization of pools, fewer starts and some of those starts just don't happen that they get pushed out to next year, but just share with us the ripple effects of the weather and how that's reflected in your guidance?
Mark Borin: Yes, sure. As I mentioned, when we look at Q2, we had assumed some level of inventory reduction and because of the weather impact continuing from Q1 into Q2, we didn't see that. So, the overall level of inventory did not go up. It's not that we built inventory in Q2. It's just that the planned reduction did not happen at the rate we had anticipated. And so now that, that inventory level that existed is got to be worked down further in Q3 and Q4. So, think of that, if you think about the level in which we adjusted the guidance for Aquatic Systems revenue that's reflective of the further need to reduce inventories, driven primarily by weather.
John Stauch: Deane, if I could just add that I mentioned 75,000 pools, new pools being built. If you put that in context, I think, we estimated at the beginning of the year be close to 80, which is generally what last year was. So, clearly we're seeing in your point the 80,000 going to 75,000 being the labor constraint on that pool construction build and that's likely to slide to the right. Now, we're confident based upon the demands in the area that we think we're going to see those pools get built actually next year based on the overall demand. But weather had to have an impact we think on pushing some of those pools outside of this year's building build cycle.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley.
Joshua Pokrzywinski: So, just to continue down the Aquatics path here. John, just between the absence of destocking and you talked a little bit about the weather push outs. And I know you individually, you probably don't want to make too big of a deal out of each one of those is maybe positive drivers for next year. But if you add all these things up plus some of the commercial initiatives, is Aquatics a business that instead of being a mid-single-digit grower can go to something more like high single-digit next year, just as you start to sell the underlying demand versus destock, and maybe catch up on some of these weather anomalies, whether it's push out or just kind of an unseasonably rainy year?
John Stauch: Yes, normalize this business has grown mid-to-high single digits Josh, if you go back. I think fundamentally you know overall demand in the aftermarket on the 5 million pools needs to have more penetration of the new pool pad, which is what I'm really pushing here to say that if you put more content into the new pool. And you expand your average pool content you will build your aftermarket capability to basically replace those with like-for-like product. If that like-for-like doesn't exist then you're looking at a channel that needs to go sell your products or upgrade the consumer for you. So, I think we got to take advantage of a shift in focus here and make sure we're spending as much time building out the new content in those 75,000 pools and then benefit from that aftermarket revenue stream as we go forward. The big shift we're having here and where I think we're going to see a huge penetration is on the connected pool side itself, Josh. But I am challenged the team I said, that's a different sale right. I mean it's a technical sale and it requires a little bit more customer and consumer support. So, we're very bullish about what this business can continue to do because we see substantial opportunity in front of it. I cannot guess what weather is going to do next year if we learn one thing from all of this, it's that we've got to have contingency plans against whether not unfolding the way we wanted to.
Joshua Pokrzywinski: That's fair. But I guess mathematically just selling the underlying demand next year, yes, gives you a few points head start anyway right?
John Stauch: We do think the labor constraint that affected us this year will be in catch-up mode and we do think we'd be entering next year with a relatively healthy backlog, correct.
Joshua Pokrzywinski: Got it. And then, just one more on the more commercial filtration initiatives. What's your sense on the channel penetration or kind of that channel build out your presence with dealers. Because I know you have a great business on more the national account side, but in markets that are perhaps a little bit more fragmented or, it sounds like there is something a lot of investment on the product, but is there product in the right dealers hands and is that dealer base something that you can penetrate easily?
John Stauch: Yes, that's our opportunity, Josh, and I wanted to call it out today, because we are focused on building out the acquisitions around the residential side. But we don't want to forget the fact that we have a really good commercial offering and we're also simultaneously working on that. And what that means is getting back to what we used to be great at and what we are going to be great at, which is selling the spec and working with our global partners to convince them that we have a superior product and that they should be designing and specking that, that product into their expansions. I think a global hotel chains, think of all the hospitality efforts, think of anybody who's moving their stores overseas, those are great opportunities for us to make sure that we're designing in our Everpure product in all of those instances.
Joshua Pokrzywinski: Thanks, John. I'll leave it there.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Jeff Hammond: Good morning. Just wanted to go kind of touch on price cost and productivity, it looks like you're kind of got price matching inflation this quarter. How should we think about that delta in the second half. And then on productivity, I think, you're nicely positive in 1Q and went negative. I know you mentioned the one large pump business, but what's the change there?
Mark Borin: So, you kind of hit it on price cost, so we do expect, as we sort of thought throughout the year that the price that we referenced about three points of rice should offset inflation. So, that continues to be the point of view. And then just on productivity, as we talked about, there is some negatives that affected us in this quarter. John referenced the fact that last year was a pretty solid quarter for us so the comp is there and that kind of read its way through year-over-year productivity. And then we've got all the actions in place that have been worked and we are starting to see read out through inventory that will then find their way into the P&L starting in Q3 and Q4. So, we've got good visibility to the actions and the things that are going to take place in the Flow and Filtration businesses that should drive that incrementally improving productivity.
Jeff Hammond: So, price versus inflation, you still think is neutral in the second half, you don't get a net positive with some of the deflation?
John Stauch: No, I mean no, because you get the deflation and also just the timing of price. So net-net, it continues to be kind of a push. I mean, I think Mark you were also -- you're putting labor inflation in there as well.
Mark Borin: Yes, total inflation, but not just the material inflation.
Jeff Hammond: And then just last one on Aquatics. If you kind of our successful kind of getting inventory down, within line with what's kind of this new guidance? Where do you see inventories entering 2020 versus normal? Thanks.
Mark Borin: Yes, our plan and what our updated guidance is reflective of is inventory levels being brought to a more normalized level. So, -- and when we do that, we look at sort of days on hand on a forward basis and think of it that way. So, we're looking at it, what it was historically and then bring in the inventory levels down to sort of that more normalized historical level on a day's basis.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Lee from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Brian Lee: Just maybe on filtration again, can you elaborate a bit on the trends you're seeing there, it seems like you had a nice rebound off of 1Q, you had the one-time issues there. But you mentioned food and beverage was up, resi is down in the quarter, but maybe any more color there and also the trends you're expecting heading into the second half?
John Stauch: Sure. Yes, so just thinking about the different businesses, residential and commercial I think of them as sort of flat in the quarter. And then as I mentioned industrial was strong and food and beverage was moderating. We see those trends kind of continuing. We start continue to see residential and commercial improving as we work our way through the year. Within residential is where those two acquisitions exist so those is, as we referenced are performing in-line with expectations, but we're really seeing some exciting opportunities from a growth perspective there and starting to see the rationale for why we did those deals starting to read out and really giving us some confidence that there is some great ideas there, they're going to help us continue to grow those businesses, but then also help us think about the broader residential portfolio. So overall, we're seeing the trends going in the right direction and seeing that continue through Q3 and Q4.
Brian Lee: Okay, fair enough. And then just maybe a follow-up on since you bring it up on the new acquisitions, I noticed that a subtle tweak here. But it seem like you're taking down the full year contribution from 3% to 2% in the updated guidance, maybe if you could comment on what's driving that as well?
John Stauch: Sure. We haven't talked about it necessarily, but we did announce earlier in the quarter that we were getting out of what we refer to is the aquaculture business. So, that wasn't actually reflected in our original plan or guidance and so that's the slight tweak. So, it's not that the acquisitions aren't performing at a level of expectation, it's that we've included an additional divestiture that, you're right that's pulling down the top-line acquisition number.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi guys, this is Jason [ph] on for Julian. How are you?
John Stauch: Good. Good morning.
Unidentified Analyst: All right. Just a couple of quick ones on Filtration and Flow in general trends, I know you guys have said that the residential and commercial trends are improving throughout the quarter. I just kind of wanted to clarify that, that is sort of an underlying demand commentary and not a reversal of maybe sort of one-time issues that you saw in both of those businesses in Q1. And if so, is there any sort of bifurcation in the differences of strength between the residential and commercial underlying market?
John Stauch: Let me hit part of that first. I mean, as you recall, when we talked about putting in the price increases last year in September, relative to the tariff and the inflationary impacts, we did see some inventory pull aheads in the residential and commercial flow & filtration space as well. We felt like we work through all of those in Q1 and work those inventory issues behind us. So, we had already started in a better inventory position in Q2 and that is continuing to read out here as we head into Q3 and Q4, meaning that we don't have those same challenges that we had in Aquatics. Mark, I don't know if you want to add.
Mark Borin: No, I think that, I mean, I think you picked up on that correctly. So, it's not -- it's underlying fundamentals rather than reversal of anything specifically one-time other than the things, John, that you mentioned.
Unidentified Analyst: But I guess just as a quick follow-up, would you characterize the underlying demand as sort of improving? Or is this sort of just an inventory issue that was being worked through as a result of pricing increases across last year? I guess what I'm trying to get at is, is it sort of, are the customer conversations getting better, or is that, you know, the issues that were present in Q1 are just completely behind you and now Q2 and Q4 tell sort of the different story?
John Stauch: On filtration, residential and commercial are improving. We're excited about the awareness of the products and the offerings available in the channel and the migration towards more of those making into the consumers' hands. In irrigation flow, I'd say no. The weather patterns did not read out in Q2 and we think we're going to be relatively experiencing the shipment demand as we head into Q3 and Q4 as well. Those are submersible wells.
Unidentified Analyst: Understood. Thank you for your time.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Walter Liptak from Seaport Global. Your line is open.
Walter Liptak: You commented about the perfect storm in the channel inventory. I wonder, first, is it -- or is it not far enough behind us where we can do a postmortem on the situation with the inventory build from tariffs and weather? And then I don't mean to -- Monday morning quarterback, but have you learned anything from it? Like what could you have done differently? Because I don't think that the tariff issues or weather are going to go away. What is about the channel that you can do to keep this from happening again?
John Stauch: Yes. We're hopeful that this goes in the category late '08-'09 financial crisis of the learning that we don't have to ever use again. When you can think about 10% material inflation over the course of a couple of years and then raising prices to mitigate that impact, we did not anticipate that the channel would buy so much ahead of that demand. You know and we realized that and we corrected course as you're -- what did we learn from that, I think we have a lot of sell-through metrics, we have a lot of information available to us that we're now looking at to make our own assumptions of what's in the channel, so that we will rely on partners it's one thing, but we also want to make sure that we're triangulating that information and ensuring that we feel like the sell-through is reflecting what we know it to be. So, there's always a learning and I'd say that's the learning and I think we're more informed now and we have a better idea of what our actual end sales are through the channel versus into the channel.
Walter Liptak: Okay, great. And then switching gears over to your comments about segmentation, you know, we've seen other companies like IDEX do a really incredible job with segmentation. And it sounds like you're doing product segmentation, I wonder if you're doing channel or customer segmentation too? And then as a follow-on on the product question, the R&D spending, what do you do -- doing the track some of the incremental R&D? How much is R&D going up, just some looking for some data or details about the kind of return you're expecting from some of these investments?
John Stauch: Well, first of all, thank you for noticing the segmentation comment it is in fact a consumer end user segmentation. And it was pretty exhaustive and a particular piece of marketing that we're using significantly and you can sense by our confidence level that gives us extreme confidence because as we start to target these personas, or we start to understand these personas better and we've used marketing campaigns, we're actually seeing the results from it. And you know these personas and the consumer needs, attributes and behaviors that we're spending time to understand are true and they're ringing out. And now we're building product sets and customer support around those that we can continue to grow faster. So, thanks for noticing. On the R&D, I'm a big advocate that we need to spend more and have the right differentiated and innovative product. I think these marketing insights that we're creating will give us a better connectivity to what's needed. So, I don't know, in the short run if it's spending more, it's spending more wisely and having the right products available to the right customer set.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Brett [ph] from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, just want to come back to Q3, if I'd just assume normal incremental margins and progression you talked about in flow and filtration. Basically implies you need some margin expansion in Aquatics in Q3 to get to the midpoint of the guide, I just want to make sure I'm thinking about that right?
Mark Borin: Yes, that -- maybe slightly, but that -- but not the margin decline that we've seen in the first -- in the first quarter and the second quarter.
John Stauch: Think about it as what we had half a month worth of price benefit last year and we're getting a -- that's we're getting the carryover of this year of that price and what we're seeing is the price in inflation headwind year-over-year significantly positive across all three businesses.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. So, despite the lower absorption, you expect to see you think you can overcome all that?
John Stauch: Yes, yes.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, good. And then just geographically, maybe just walk around the different regions, we didn't really talk about China. I think, last quarter you said Europe was a little bit weaker than you had expected. How was Europe specifically in the quarter and then maybe any color on China and what you're seeing there?
John Stauch: Sure, yes. So, overall, we saw Europe kind of get back from some of the negative commentary made in Q1 to growth in Q2. So, Europe it was a positive story and we think that's going to continue through the rest of the year. China continues to grow. I mean, so as we've talked before it's not a huge market for us overall, but we see strong growth in China, that's a continuation from the trend that we saw in Q1, continuing in Q2, and we expect to see that as well continuing through the balance of the year.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, good. Thanks. I'll pass it along.
John Stauch: Thank you. All right, thank you for joining us today. We continue to believe that we will exit 2019 positioned to deliver more normalized performance in 2020. We are accelerating PIMS and sourcing and strengthening our productivity culture. We are funding the two key strategies discussed earlier in the call, and we hope you share in our excitement for these two key growth strategies. We have a strong capital structure, solid free cash flow generation and we will continue to invest in our strategy to be the leading residential and commercial water treatment company. Thank you for your continued interest. Rob, you can conclude the call.
Operator: Thank you, sir. And ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation today. This does conclude today's conference call and you may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-04-17 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. My name is a Zetania, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Pentair 2019 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host Mr. Jim Lucas. Sir, you may begin your conference.
Jim Lucas: Thanks, Zetania and welcome to Pentair's first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. We're glad you could join us. I'm Jim Lucas, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. And with me today is John Stauch, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Borin our Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, we will provide details on our first quarter 2019 performance, as well as our second quarter and full year 2019 outlook as outlined in this morning's press release. Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties such as the risks outlined in Pentair's most recent 10-Q, Form 10-K, and today's press release. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today, and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results. Today's webcast is accompanied by a presentation, which can be found in the Investors Relations section of Pentair's website. We will reference these slides throughout our prepared remarks. Any references to non-GAAP financials are reconciled in the appendix of the presentation. We will be sure to reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. I would like to request that you limit your questions to one and a follow-up in order to ensure everyone an opportunity to ask their questions. I will now turn the call over to John.
John Stauch: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to slide number 4 titled Executive Summary. As we shared earlier this month, our first quarter of 2019 reflected cold wet weather in many parts of the country and this had an adverse impact on our first quarter sales of our high margin pool and specialty ag spray businesses. This weather pattern combined with distribution inventory that was created to avoid our heavier than usual price increases related to 2018 tariff impacts created a significant impact to the bottom line. The slower pull-through of demand in Q1 related to weather and pool, means that we expect inventory will now be worked out of the channel in Q2 and Q3, causing the further reduction to our full year guidance. While these two events created unique impact on the business, we feel that this situation is isolated to 2019 and our overall thesis for our pool business remains healthy and intact. On a more positive note, we completed two strategic acquisitions during the first quarter that further our strategic initiative to accelerate residential and commercial water treatment. Both acquisitions are performing well and the integrations are on track. I will now turn the call over to Mark, who'll provide more detail on Q1, Q2 and the full year forecast. Mark?
Mark Borin: Thank you, John. Please turn to slide 5, labeled Q1 2019 Pentair Performance. For the first quarter we saw core sales declined 4%. Segment income fall 16% and adjusted EPS is down 12%. We'll provide more color on the individual segment performance shortly. Below the line we saw an adjusted tax rate of 18%, net interest other expense of $8.5 million, and our average shares in the quarter were 172.5 million. Net interest other expense was a bit higher than planned due to the two acquisitions closing earlier than expected. Please turn to slide 6, labeled Q1 2019 Pentair Segment Performance. This slide lays out the first quarter performance of our three segments. Following robust growth in 2018, which we believe was somewhat elevated as distributors bought inventory ahead of price increases as we commented on our fourth quarter call, first quarter core sales in Aquatics declined 6%. Segment income in Aquatics declined 13% as the produced top line led to under-absorption in the quarter. Core sales declined 6% in Filtration Solutions, but segment income was flat due primarily to positive mix. Within the core residential and commercial business, we saw two areas of softness that we believe are short-term in nature. First, we experienced lower component sales as Aquion is now represented as intercompany sales and is no longer reflected as external sales. Second, Europe saw ongoing weakness but the comps are easing. While this had an impact on our first quarter sales mostly due to timing, we continue to see positive growth prospects for the key residential and commercial piece of Filtration. We note that the food and beverage and industrial businesses were on plan for the quarter. Flow Technologies reported flat core sales but that does not capture the story of the 22% segment income decline. While price helped the residential piece of Flow, we saw our specialty business, which is exposed to agriculture crop spray faced significant top line pressure. Specialty is one of the most profitable product lines within Flow and the sales in this contributed to the income decline in the quarter. We are rightsizing the cost structure of specialty to the adjusted demand levels now expected for 2019. Please turn to slide 7, labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. Our first quarter saw cash flow usage in line with seasonal trends as we tend to build working capital in advance of the important residential selling season primarily in our Aquatics segment. In addition, we closed on two strategic acquisitions during the quarter and saw our debt level increase as a result. While our debt level increased from the end of 2018, we expect cash flow to turn positive in the second quarter and we anticipate debt levels coming down as cash flow improves throughout the year. While we did not repurchase any shares during the first quarter, we remain committed to buying $150 million in 2019. Please turn to slide 8, labeled Q2 2019 Pentair Outlook. We anticipate second quarter core sales to be flat to up 1%. We expect Aquatic Systems to be flat to down 1%, Filtration Solutions to be flat to down 2% and Flow Technologies to grow 2% to 4%. We anticipate segment income to be down approximately 5% to 7% as some of our more profitable businesses continue to see short-term top line pressure. We expect adjusted EPS to be in a range of $0.63 to $0.66 per share. Below the line we expect corporate expense to be approximately $14 million to $16 million. We expect our second quarter tax rate to be 22% as we anticipate a true-up during the quarter. We also expect net interest other expense of roughly $11 million and shares to be approximately 171 million. Please turn to slide 9, labeled Full Year 2019 Pentair Outlook. Slide 9 looks at the different components of our updated 2019 outlook. For the full year, we expect core sales to be flat to up 1%. We continue to expect price of roughly 3% for the full year. We expect total sales growth of roughly 1% to 2% with roughly 3% contribution from the recently announced acquisitions offset by a 2% headwind from FX. We anticipate segment income to be flat to up 2%. Our full year adjusted EPS range is $2.30 to $2.35 per share. Other items embedded in our guidance include corporate expense of $60 million to $65 million, a tax rate of 20.5%, net interest other expense of $38 million, and an average share count for the year of 171 million shares. I would like to turn the call back to John.
John Stauch: Thank you, Mark. Please turn to slide number 10, labeled Full Year Guidance Update. Before I discuss our longer-term outlook, this slide is meant to be a helpful look at what has changed since we provided our initial 2019 guidance. While we do not like to use whether as a reason for sales miss, the reality is that cold wet weather had a pronounced impact on two of our businesses, pool and agriculture precision spray. The main change from original forecast is our very profitable Aquatics business. In 2018 Aquatics delivered higher than average growth of 11%. We anticipated that some inventory was pulled ahead of the price increases, but it is worth talking about what was -- what has happened to the start of the year. Wet and cold weather delayed pool construction activity in several key markets such as California, Texas, and Arizona. The inclement weather also impacted pool openings in other parts of the country primarily the Sunbelt. As a result, sell-through in our distribution channels was impacted and therefore inventories were not reduced at the levels we would have expected if the pattern would have been more consistent with historical trends when weather was not a factor. Of importance is that we have not seen any significant changes in demand trends within the key Aquatics markets. Our dealers continue to report strong backlog and while weather created delays, we expect inventory levels in the channel to come down as activity resumes in the second and third quarters. Within Flow Technologies, we saw our higher margin agricultural precision spray impacted as many parts of the country were under water to start the planting season. Given these delays and the limited number of months in the season, we are not anticipating a rebound in activity and are adjusting the cost structure of this business accordingly. With Aquatics and the specialty business in Flow experiencing slower topline growth rates in 2019, this has led to reduced expectations for segment income and adjusted EPS growth. We do believe this is a short-term issue, but unfortunately, the weather-related delays were compounded by the higher inventory levels in the distribution channels. Please turn to slide 11 titled Segment Positioning. We wanted to take a moment to speak to our three segments and why we believe we are well-positioned for the longer term. Aquatic Systems is a leading franchise where we believe long-term demand trends remain in place. We expect to continue to invest in dealer engagement and consumer pull. We have been expanding aftermarket products including in the faster-growing automation space. We have built a strong business and while the growth rate in 2019 is not up to historical standards, we believe that averaging 2018 and 2019 is more reflective of the longer term growth rate of this attractive business. As we mentioned earlier in the call, we strengthened our residential and commercial water treatment business with two strategic acquisitions. Aquion brought water treatment systems capabilities and an affiliated dealer network, while Pelican brought a water conditioning systems capability and an established e-commerce platform. In 2019, we will experience some modest impact to the topline as former component sales to Aquion are recognized as inter-company sales. We continue to focus on digital marketing and engaging consumers to build our brand. Flow Technologies continues to be a business where we are focusing on leveraging our core PIMS competencies and improving margins. While parts of the Flow portfolio have been impacted by inventory and weather issues, we are accelerating operations, sourcing, and structural changes to improve our overall cost structure to create a solid foundation for 2020. Please turn to Slide 12 titled Long-Term Value Creation Goals. This is an updated version of a chart we have referenced in the past, but an important slide as it highlights our longer term goals. With last year's separation and our emergence as a pure play-focused residential and commercial water treatment company, we remain committed to delivering more consistent performance. We continue to believe that we have a portfolio capable of delivering low to mid-single-digit core sales growth over this cycle. With a portfolio capable of delivering positive price coupled with the relentless focus on productivity, we expect segment income to grow mid to high single-digits. We generate strong free cash flow and have committed to repurchasing 150 million of our shares annually. We believe that this should result in top-quartile EPS growth and disciplined capital allocation would add upside to a strong base performance. We recognize that consistency is the key to being recognized as a top-quartile performer and we remain committed to achieving these long-term goals. I would now like to turn the call over to Zetania for Q&A after which I will have a few closing remarks. Zetania, please open the line for questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
Steve Tusa: Hey guys, good morning.
John Stauch: Hey Steve.
Mark Borin: Good morning Steve.
Steve Tusa: So, just curious as to what really kind of changed from when you gave guidance in I guess late January or early February to today. I mean I missed it as well. But pool was very clear that they were not going to have the greatest first quarter on the planet and with the destocking impact, you guys actually had guidance like above what they said they were going to guide. I don't know what that is. That's either a disconnect -- there's a disconnect somewhere. What happened there? Why didn't you guys just come out in January and say hey first quarter was going to be -- is going to be weak given these dynamics?
John Stauch: I think it's a fair question and a good question Steve. I think the different dynamics are it's easy to sit here now and look backwards at what inventory is in the channel. But as we raised prices last year, primarily related to the tariffs, we knew there was a little bit of inventory in the channel being built. But that's all based upon what the expected sell-through is through our dealers into the markets that they serve. And so we had anticipated that the inventory would be dealt with in Q1. But the significant drop in the sell-through produced more inventory in the channel and therefore it didn't make sense to continue to sell into the channel. And that was really what happened later in the quarter Steve.
Steve Tusa: No, I understand that. And I'm just saying like is there something in the FP&A function here that you guys aren't kind of picking up what the channel is saying? Because again like it was a public company telling you what the growth rate was going to be. And if there was destocking in the first quarter, then you guys would have been below that growth rate instead of guiding to something like 4% to 6%. And then going around to conferences and kind of not really insinuating it all that things were weak over the course of the quarter. Because I think visibility here is a question that I'm getting from investors all the time. And I think there's just a bit of a confidence issue that people have that you guys aren't picking up the right PVs in the channel.
John Stauch: Yes. Again, I wish it was that easy Steve. I think we're looking at four days of inventory on hand and there's a lot of inputs in there. And I do want to remind everyone there's more than a distributor, right? I mean the pool market and also part of this is distributors in Flow as well, it's not just all pool. And there's lots and lots of distributors and lots of estimates that go into a four days of inventory on hand. And I think we didn't know till late in the quarter that we were in the situation we were and as soon as we knew, we went out and told people and we dealt with it accordingly. And we're taking out the cost and we're taking all the actions we can to position ourselves the best we can for next year. I don't want to damage a great business like pool and I think we're off doing all the right things to grow share and pull demand in that particular business. And I think it's demonstrated that success consistently over a series of years. And I do want to remind you that the tariff changes and the significant price increases was part of this issue as well and those don't happen often.
Steve Tusa: Sure. On Filtration, what was the -- why was that weak? Because I mean I think we were expecting some weaker sales in Flow given the flooding and all that kind of stuff which is completely legitimate issue. Everybody is kind of seeing the weather and the flooding out there that's definitely not specific to you guys. But Filtration was definitely weak. Can you maybe just talk a little bit more about what happened there? And you guys cut guidance there as well and revenue.
John Stauch: It definitely was slightly weaker than we expected Steve. I think weather impacted it as well primarily on the service and the installs. The timing of the acquisition was positive as far as the reported acquisition, but it also changed the way the intercompany sales moved from us to those two acquisitions because we sell to both of them. And then we did experience slightly weaker European demand which we have adjusted our full year guide to reflect.
Steve Tusa: That also would have been helpful to know that you're going to kind of like have a little bit less of an organic impact from these deals that could have been communicated better probably at the time of the deal just some feedback. That's about it. Thanks a lot.
John Stauch: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.
Nathan Jones: Good morning, everyone.
John Stauch: Good morning, Nathan.
Nathan Jones: I'm going to follow-up on the pool business here. I understand it's seasonal. I would have thought that customers would have been making these decisions -- spending decisions on an annual basis. And if we had cold weather in the first quarter that might defer revenue out of the first quarter into the second quarter or third quarter. Can you guys talk maybe a little bit more about the dynamics there and why you're not just going to catch that the revenue up? I mean, I can understand why the spray business doesn't catch up. But I'm just a little confused on why that pool -- the pool revenue wouldn't just shift from one quarter to the other rather than disappear altogether?
John Stauch: Yeah. It does. I think clearly, if we didn't have the inventory situation in the channel that we have, part of the Q1 miss would be made up in likely Q2 and Q3, Nathan. I mean, there is limited labor. So people don't go out and necessarily hire more. They're going to slide job's a week or two, or so in the schedule. And so they tend to do as best they can to make them up in the season. What we're really reflecting in the outward quarters is the fact that we still have to deal with the inventory in the channel. So, I do think the dealers will make up the demand. I do think that, our channel partners will see that demand come through and it's more muted on us because of the inventory build that occurred from the Q1 sell-through.
Nathan Jones: So does that mean there was more inventory in the channel than you guys had predicted when you reported 4Q? I mean, you said you thought there was $30 million of pre-buy in 4Q 2018 ahead of the price increases. Did that end up being higher than you expected which is part of what contributes to this 2018 was higher than it should been and 2019 is lower than it should be?
John Stauch: Yes. I mean, what we anticipated to be about a point of headwind for overall Pentair is now a couple points of headwind. Now again, I'm reminding you that it's not just pool. There's a little bit in the Flow Technologies distribution channel as well related to the weather, but yeah as I was mentioning, we were looking as you looked at days of inventory on hand forward-looking in Q4 it felt like 30. Because of the lack of sell-through that happened in Q1 that number expanded and it's got to be dealt with in Q2.
Nathan Jones: Okay. I just want to follow-up on Steve's question about maybe looking inwardly at your own forecasting tools. Have you run a root cause analysis on this thing kind of looked at the FP&A processes to see if there's things that you guys can do to improve the predictability results here?
Mark Borin: Nathan, yeah, I mean, as you'd expect we have our PIMS toolkit and that doesn't just apply to how we run the operations it applies to how we run our back office functions as well. So we are using our root cause countermeasure tools to try to understand what are the things that we could had better visibility to and gotten more out in front of. But as John said, sometimes it's a little bit easier to do that when you're --when you've got hindsight information to look at. But that's the information that we need to think about and how do we put that more at the front end rather than seeing it at the back end. So absolutely, we're working on that and looking for improvements across the board.
Nathan Jones: Is there anything that you found that you could -- that you could share that could change -- could improve those kind of processes? Are you still in the -- are still in progress?
Mark Borin: That would be such an easy answer, if that was it. I mean, there's no way we could predict the Q1 weather patterns.
Nathan Jones: That’s fair.
Mark Borin: I mean, California Arizona and Texas I mentioned are such significant markets to the pool business. And what happened there was so unusual as far as the wet cold weather and that stops production or stops pool builds for a period of time, because they can't move machines in. So, I don't know what we could do. I mean, we always run sensitivity analysis on our forward-looking analysis, but that's not one we would've predicted.
Nathan Jones: I should have qualified that question to be outside of weather effects and things that were -- would be obviously unpredictable?
John Stauch: The answer is no. Because I mean, we found out afterwards as we shared in our Q4 call that we felt there was inventory in the channel and that inventory would have normally burned off in Q1. The specialty ag business was also uniquely impacted and that all happened throughout the process in Q1 as well. So those two things led to the Q1 challenges and we've not sensed -- we’ve not put in a forecast of the recovery in pool and we've not put any recovery of the specialty ag in the outlook. And then we've adjusted demand to be what we think are on the lower ends of our forecast models and then we're working the cost actions to go build the foundation for 2020. And that's the only way I could think of reacting to the situation.
Nathan Jones: Okay. Fair enough. I'll pass it on. Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: Your next question comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen.
Joe Giordano: Hey, guys. Good morning.
John Stauch: Good morning, Joe.
Joe Giordano: So, I don't want to keep asking the same question, but one thing that's confusing to me a little bit. I -- I heading into the quarter when you had your look at inventory and pool I totally understand that that changes because of weather on a day's basis, because the demand side of it changes. But like on a gross level of inventory that number is a fixed number. And so if we're saying that this is largely going to like shift quarters on the revenue side that's where I don't get why the overhang doesn't like kind of fix itself sooner. Because yes we could change like what we thought was 40 days is really 50 or something like that, because the denominator changes but the top -- the actual amount of inventory was a fixed number of units. So that's kind of where I struggle with. I don't understand that.
John Stauch: That's fair. I mean, I think the one thing I'll remind you is that, if it was just a product sale it was not dependent on labor required to install it. I do think you'd see a quicker recovery. But the labor is not excessive, right? I mean, it's not going to like you're going to go out and add more labor to build more pools in the short-term. So it will come through the channel clearly and we do think that that will spread itself over Q2 and Q3. But the Q1 hit to us is going to be reflected as an inventory reduction in Q2 and Q3. It won't affect the channel that same way.
Joe Giordano: How much is that -- like is that actual construction element weighing down? Because I always -- we talk about this business being like that's not really a big piece of it at all. So I'm just curious as to how that-- 
John Stauch: Well, every dealer is out there either installing a new pool or they're also out there doing the aftermarket aspects or scheduling the aftermarket pool product install. So they're -- they generally are the same people and they're going to do their best to get those pools in place. And so there will be a delay on both ends the aftermarket and the new pools.
Joe Giordano: Okay. And then on the forward guide for that business so 2Q implies like more of a seasonal sequential ramp than normal, which I guess maybe some of that is a snap -- a little bit of a shift in that demand. But the second half guide is essentially flat year-on-year versus last year and we keep talking about how much pull-forward there was and that was a plus 12 comp. So, how comfortable are you with the back half being flat year-on-year? And what kind of visibility do you have into that?
Mark Borin: Yeah, Q2 and Q3 as we talk will be impacted by the inventory coming down and then Q4 we expect kind of as you look at it sequentially, it will pick-up and get better and we'll see some of that recovery coming through. And we -- when we look at it for the full year we're confident that the full year expectation is appropriate. And as John said, we factored in everything that we know today as we look at the out quarters.
Joe Giordano: Okay. And then, if I could just shift quick to last one on Filtration just to follow a bit on what Steve asked initially, to me that was like the biggest surprise was the magnitude of the miss there. It's not pool. It's not Flow. And it was a pretty sizable miss versus the initial guide. So the -- your comment on lower component sales like not being intercompany makes sense, but that -- those I assume were kind of factored in, because you announced those deals before you gave the initial guide. So, can you maybe talk through what -- some of a little bit more detail there?
Mark Borin: Yes. Let me just frame that. I mean, the intercompany sales are roughly about a point overall total Filtration Solutions for the year, okay? Which will give you an impact on kind of what it is per quarter. Keep in mind we did not have the acquisition as a contribution in Q1. We had it closing after Q1. So these two things you're seeing the benefit of the acquisitions. But we had not forecasted in the quarter the impact of the intercompany sales. But the real impact that we saw was a little bit slowing in Q1 where the weather impact us. We do expect to catch that up in Q2. And then the European trends are not where we'd want them to be. And that's really the reflection that we added to the full year forecast. I don't think we know that. I think we're anticipating it and we're planning for it.
Joe Giordano: Good. Thanks guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mike Halloran with Baird.
Mike Halloran: Hey, good morning guys.
John Stauch: Hey, Mike. Good morning.
Mike Halloran: So question on the margins on the Flow side. So talk a little bit about the inefficiencies in the mix side please? And then also when do you think that can normalize back to what your previous run rate suggestions were? And how long does some of these headwinds render?
Mark Borin: Yes. Sure. The biggest contributor to the margins in Flow is the mix impact from the decline on the specialty ag spray business at a higher profit component of that overall portfolio. So that's the -- is the biggest driver. And then the other driver is just the timing in how price works its way in throughout the year as all their price actions take hold. We had talked last quarter about the couple of factories. Those are stabilizing and we see those not having a negative impact to margins during the year and improving as we get through the balance of the year.
Mike Halloran: Sounds good. And then when we think about the second half of the year here, just explain what's changed now versus your previous guidance. Obviously, so, on the Aquatic side the assumptions on the top line have come in a little bit. Obviously, we're adjusting a little bit through some of the costs on the Filtration side that are no longer external sales. Anything else you would point to that's changed in the back half of the year versus the previous guidance?
Mark Borin: Sure. I mean, I think the -- overall when you think about it, not a lot has changed. So that's how I characterize kind of the headline. We talked before about just the timing of inventory and how that works off. But -- and then specialty that the business that we referenced right the softness there. We have not projected that that is going to improve as we work through the balance of the year. And so those are probably the two biggest factors when we think about what's different, but overall really the back half of the year is not significantly different than what we had previously been thinking. We have also not assumed like any benefit from tariff relief in this outlook. So that's consistent with the previous outlook. And we've also most of the operations and sourcing and the targeted actions this year are not expected to have 2019 benefits. But they generally are expected to offer contributions in 2020. Meaning, we're driving the activities this year and assuming it's going to take a longer-term to -- longer time to realize it, and therefore are really driving them as a 2020 foundational benefit.
Mike Halloran: So in other words, if you hit your plan, your expectation is that the run rate exiting 2019 is slightly lower than what you were originally expecting, but not meaningfully lower like the front half trajectory would imply?
Mark Borin: Yes. That's correct.
Mike Halloran: Good. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.
Mark Borin: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning everyone.
John Stauch: Hey, Deane.
Mark Borin: Good morning Deane.
Deane Dray: I might have missed this, but are you able to separate and quantify the impact of weather this quarter from the inventory dynamics?
Mark Borin: We didn't specifically quantify it earlier Deane. But think of it as $30 million to $40 million. So if you think about the majority of the Q1 impact is really driven by weather, which as John said delays the bleed off of that excess inventory that then happens in Q2 and Q3.
Deane Dray: Got it. I just wanted to make sure that part had been quantified. And then just is there any ripple effect on pricing? I know you called out the 3% pricing assumption. But with an incentive to work inventory down, is there going to be any compromise on pricing? And what might the dynamics be there?
Mark Borin: No. No. The overall pricing profile stays the same as you referenced, we talked about 3% for the year, and so nothing changing from a price perspective.
Deane Dray: Got it. And just last one for me is, it's more of a business model question and maybe it's just an observation. But as Pentair has refocused the portfolio to a water pure play, you've lost that benefit of earnings diversification that you had when nVent was part of the company. So now we're -- we see this vulnerability to weather that really maybe just as magnified versus what the company structure was before. Is this variability or vulnerability just something that comes with the more focused portfolio? And has that been part of the framework that you're looking at for the company Pentair as it is today?
John Stauch: Deane, I think it's a great observation. The answer is -- to the first question is, yes. I mean, that is definitely exposed more vulnerability on weather impacts. Now what we got to do is build more diversification into our portfolio to account for that. I mean, we did see spots of that. I mean, we did have a good China quarter. I think things in China have improved. We had that little bit of softness in Europe. Normally that wouldn't have happened. But I think the diversification of portfolio is something we will focus on and ensure that we do not subject ourselves to these types of weather patterns and the variability that they can cause.
Deane Dray: Got it. Thank you.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets.
Scott Graham: Hi. Good morning.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Mark Borin: Good morning.
Scott Graham: So kind of a follow-on to that question. Would it be fair to say that even though Aquatics is really the flagship, the best business, the highest margin and all of that that the business will be built more going forward through organic means aftermarket, consumables that kind of thing and then your acquisitions would be more focused on the other two segments?
John Stauch: Yes. I mean, I think, the pool business is well-positioned, and I think we have a lot of organic growth runway remaining. And I think we continue to innovate there from a new product perspective, and we continue to have good intimacy with our channels and our consumers and understand what they have. So I think that's going to be more of our organic strategy as we go forward. As evidenced by the two acquisitions that we just did, our goals in Filtration Solutions is to build out a closer-to-customer model and also make sure that we're doing our part to drive demand in the channel. The overall penetration rate of Filtration systems in homes is relatively low. And, although, it's better in the commercial office space and/or commercial restaurant space, it's still not where we think it should be or can be. And so, most of our acquisition activity will be focused about, how do we drive that demand and how do we get closer to the customer to drive that demand in Filtration.
Scott Graham: Good. Thank you for that, John. That helps. My follow-up is, really, not to beat the horse even deader here, but would you be able to maybe answer this question, because you indicated that there doesn't seem to be a much of a change in demand on the pool side. I'm not quite sure what you meant by that. And maybe, the question specifically would be, what was sell-through by your dealers in the quarter?
Mark Borin: Yes. When we see -- when we talk to our dealers and we hear from our -- from the builders and understand, sort of, what's going on out in the market, backlogs remain high, business remains solid. So when we talk about we're not hearing anything from an underlying perspective that the market is slowing, it's based on those discussions and that insight. And that's really what -- kind of, what informs the way we're thinking about that. I mean, sell-through, from the information that we have access to, remains strong. I think, we'd expect an impact in Q1 from weather, but as we said that starts to turn around and as we move into the heavy season here in Q2 and Q3. So, again, underlying trends in demand, we're not seeing anything that would indicate softness there.
Scott Graham: So your -- from what, I think, I'm gleaning from this is that, your distribution channel is kind of normalizing right now?
John Stauch: I mean, I can't speak to that. But I can tell you, what Mark is saying is, the sell-through is accelerating, right? The March sell-through was definitely towards the end high from the dealer channel and then we also know the dealer channel is going to make up. As we mentioned, most of that whether loss in Q1, they're going to do their best to make that up in Q2. Why that's muted to Pentair is, because there is that inventory in the channel that needs to be worked out before we're going to see the benefit of that recovery of the channel shift.
Scott Graham: That makes sense. Thank you.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.
John Stauch: Hi, Josh Pokrzywinski.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Hey, good morning, guys. 
John Stauch: Good morning, Josh
Josh Pokrzywinski: Just a follow-up, just a finer point on pool that I think Mark raised earlier, I want to not miss it in passing that, the business should normalize by the fourth quarter. I guess, just given everything we've seen from tariff pre-buy and even your callouts about the inventory position exiting the year. I guess, mathematically looking at guidance, you do have to pick up the growth rate by the fourth quarter. Is that explicitly something that you're calling for? And, I guess, why not take a more conservative track, just given some of the surprises this quarter?
John Stauch: I think, we have, Josh. I mean, I think, if -- when we take a look at what our new estimates are in that sell-through demand throughout the year, we are assuming taking inventory down to at or below normalized historic levels, right? It is still a growing market and is still a growing industry. And so, you'd expect inventory to actually be accelerating through this period. I think, what we wanted to do is, make sure we forecast it on the downward end. And I know it looks like Q4 is out of the norm, but we would expect our normalized patterns to continue and Q4 is usually a pretty good quarter for Pentair.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Got it. And then, I guess, just following up a little bit on Deane's question on pricing. Looking holistically at price-cost productivity, I know you kind of think about that, those three different legs of the stool. I would imagine there was some drag there from all the disruption this quarter. But thinking about that total bucket the rest of the year, how should we think about that gap closing, improving or getting worse? I would imagine something happens in the world as it pertains to rebates or pricing power, given volume. But just thinking about it holistically, should that get better or worse from here?
Mark Borin: Yes, you hit on it. It does get better as we move through the year, which is in line with sort of how we expected it to move. Just, with the timing of when price is impacted with rebates and other things. But, as we said on our earlier guidance, we continue to believe that effectively price and inflation will offset each other. So we continue to view that as the overall way to look at the guidance and that's a full year statement, so we see that and we sort of see that starting to turn as you get into Q2, Q3 and Q4.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Got it. And if I can just sneak one more here, more of a question, philosophically, on how you guys get impacted from a weather perspective. If I think back to 1Q of 2018, I think, some other folks in the broader construction ecosystem called out weather then in January. Was there anything in the comp that would have said, 1Q of last year wasn't particularly smooth sailing on the weather front?
John Stauch: No, Josh. Last year's Q1 actually was one of our stronger organic growth quarters of the year. I think we benefited from some of the tax changes that occurred and demand was strong out of the gate. So I'd say, we don't think that weather had a significant impact on Q1 of 2018 at all. And usually if it happens earlier in the quarter, it's not as big of a deal, because those things can get made up. I mean, really, what we're talking about is the end of January and February was six significant weeks in a row of a consistent pattern in the states where it matters to us.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Got it. All right. Thanks, John.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Brad Vanino: Hey, good morning. This is Brad on for Jeff. Just to clarify something. In the first quarter, it seems like cash flows is particularly weak. I understand some of the abnormalities going on there. But just, on a full year basis, what's your confidence on hitting the target?
Mark Borin: Yes, I mean, Q1 cash flow, as you referenced, is traditionally our weakest quarter. As a reminder, Q1 of last year was when we were going through this separation. So we were -- there's noise in 2018 and sort of the visibility to what a run rate level of Q1 cash flow for this separate water business would look like. So this, I think, is the -- in many respects, sort of, the new view of what Q1 looks like and we'll start to turn that in Q2 and go -- and to turn positive in Q2 and then continue that through the balance of the year. So, remain confident in our ability as we target cash flow to equal adjusted net income.
Brad Vanino: Okay. That makes sense. And then, just on the strategic initiatives and investments you have going on. You talked about on the last call, some flexibility to kind of throttle those back, should demand kind of weaken a little bit. Just given what happened in the first quarter, have your strategic investments changed and plans for those for this year? And kind of -- does that have any kind of trickle-down impact over the longer term?
John Stauch: No. I think we're focused on still building out a portfolio that we think has a lot of runway around organic growth. Couple of small additions that we're looking to do again on the tuck-in side, on the residential and commercial Filtration side to continue to build out our portfolio. And then from an organic standpoint, continuing to make the consumer aware of what Pentair can bring to the table. And then how we bring that through our channel partners, and how we give the consumer what they want. That's where the strategic investments are and we're going to continue to invest in high-priority areas throughout 2019.
Brad Vanino: All right. Thanks for the color.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.
Rebecca Yuan: Hi, guys. This is Rebecca Yuan on for Brian. Thanks for taking the question. So aside from the weaker demand in Europe that you've pointed out, have you seen any slowdown in your end markets? And can you maybe speak to the growth trends you're seeing or any broader macro comments?
John Stauch: No, we haven't. I mean, we did as evidenced by our particular outlooks for the year adjusted to what we've called the lower end of the ranges for some of our revenue forecasts that we could get ahead of the cost curve and work on the foundational aspects. But as I mentioned, I think we're starting to see a stronger China as we move forward here in 2019 and we think we got maybe one more quarter of headwinds in Europe. Some of the slowdown started in Q3 and Q4 last year for us in our particular markets. And overall, we think that our end markets continue to be solid and I think our position in those end markets is solid.
Rebecca Yuan: Okay. Thanks. And then just as a follow-up for some of long-term goals that you highlighted, can you maybe give us an idea of the time frames whether it's like three years or five years?
John Stauch: Well we'll continue to move rapidly to build out the portfolio in those strategic growth areas. I mean, yes, this is a three to five-year vision and we want to move aggressively and fast as we can to achieve that vision. But it's a combination of organic growth efforts that we're doing with marketing and sales and new product development organically as well as a series of tuck-in acquisitions that we would do over time. Can never time those and obviously we continue to try to grow the funnel, but executing them is not always within our control.
Rebecca Yuan: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Walter Liptak with Seaport Global.
Walter Liptak: Hi, thanks. I wanted to ask a capital allocation question. The share repurchase, it looks like there was no share repurchase done in the first quarter and with the shares that you guys talked about, it looks like 80 million in the second, have you started on the share repurchase yet this quarter?
Mark Borin: We can't really comment on the timing of when we're in the market doing share repurchases. But as I said in my comments, we're committed to the 150 million for this year and would expect to execute that in the -- from now to the balance of the year. And you're correct, we did not do any purchases in the first quarter. And generally, that's because as we talked about cash flow, we utilize cash in the first quarter and so we think it's most prudent to manage the planned buybacks in Q2 three and four.
Walter Liptak: Okay. And with the share repurchase, can you be opportunistic with it? Could you do a bigger amount in the first -- in the second quarter? Or do you have to spread it through the rest of the year?
John Stauch: Short answer is, yes.
Walter Liptak: Okay. All right. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.
Julian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. Maybe just a question on something below the top line for a change. You talked on slide 13 about optimizing the cost structure in the operational footprint and it was notable that your SG&A to sales rose quite a bit year-on-year in Q1. Is there any way that you could quantify the scale of the savings program, when we're thinking about the sort of base number for 2020? And then also looking at the sort of operating profit in Q1, the GAAP profit was about 30% lower than the adjusted segment profit. It looks like there was an asset impairment charge in there. So maybe just give us some background on that charge?
John Stauch: Sure. I'll handle the first one and I'll let Mark handle the second. I think when we talked about going forward what our actions are I mean, the first and foremost I think making sure that our sourcing activities are connected to our business units and quite frankly, the product lines is the number one priority. Because we have to have the anticipation of what's happening in the commodities that we're buying and be able to make the determination of either cost out on the sourcing side or value-added -- value engineering on the cost side or be able to price appropriately and give our distributor partners enough heads-up that those pricings would come. The second one is the operational footprint. Some of our businesses have way more capacity than they need and that capacity might not be in the right regions. And so getting after the operational footprint is the second largest priority. The third one on the operating structure is making sure that we're adjusting our cost investments to the priorities of the company and not what we feel is the priorities of the individual product lines of the businesses. And that is a huge opportunity for us. And as Mark mentioned, we're going to right-size the areas that are affected by what we call more cyclical trends where they're not going to recover any time shortly. That's really the cost efforts. I don't want to quantify it yet, because they're fairly sizable targets internally that we expect to go after and get as a foundation for 2020. And at the appropriate time, we'll share what those benefits are. Mark you want to handle the second part?
Mark Borin: Sure. The asset impairment items think of those as relating to the optimization and some of the actions and activities that we talked about in 2018. Part of that was exiting certain businesses. In this case, these are a couple of cost-based investment businesses. So they're not businesses that are part of what we're running as Pentair, but small investments. And we wrote those down in Q1 based on an updated view of what we would be able to sell those assets for. But it's -- so it's not something new. It's really just the continuation of some of that work that we talked about last year. And as we finalize that and get those things behind us that was an adjustment that we had to record.
Julian Mitchell: Thanks for the color. And just my follow-up would be around the top line in Flow Technologies. The core sales were sort of flattish in Q1 guided to grow 2% to 4% in Q2. It sounds like ag is still going to be weak. So maybe just talk a little bit about, how much of a reacceleration in the resi parts of Flow you expect? And what types of products were really affected by the excess channel inventories in Flow?
Mark Borin: Sure. So maybe a couple of things. So in Flow, there's really three parts to that business the residential, and irrigation, and commercial, and infrastructure and the specialty business. So as you said specialty is -- pulls numbers down. But then we do expect to see the residential irrigation and commercial infrastructure parts of the business start to pick up as we move through the balance of the year. Some of that comes from price. So we -- a lot of the price impact that we're projecting for the year is coming from the Flow business and particularly in the residential side and then that starts to readout as we move into Q2, Q3 and Q4. And so those are the -- those would be the biggest drivers there. The residential irrigation business would have been impacted in Q1, somewhat by the channel inventory and weather and that starts to correct itself as we get into Q2, Q3 and Q4.
Julian Mitchell: Thank you, very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Drab with William Blair.
Brian Drab: Hey good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a point of clarification. I'm not sure that it was clear, what exactly was the weather impact on the Filtration business? And which markets were you seeing that in the months?
John Stauch: It's just as you think about the installs of water treatment and water conditioning systems, they were affected by some of the weather patterns and those are like days, right? So we pushed -- we didn't get to do it in a day. So they pushed out their installs weeks or so. And that's why we feel that that all will be recovered in Q2.
Brian Drab: Okay. So it just made it harder, even though these are -- and this is all primarily inside jobs, right, I mean you're installing food and beverage Filtration system, you're installing something -- it's in a factory, it's in a facility? You're just saying that the weather in general just kind of dampened -- sorry about the pun which kind of dampened that activity. Is that what you're saying?
John Stauch: Yes, it was minor in Filtration. But yes.
Brian Drab: Okay. Okay. And then can you quantify at all what growth or decline overall you reported in Europe and in China for the first quarter?
John Stauch: Yes. I mean China had a recovery and was up double digit. And in Europe, we're talking about modestly down.
Brian Drab: Okay. You broke up a little bit on my end on China. You said it was -- what you said in China?
John Stauch: Double digits and then we were modestly down in Europe.
Brian Drab: Got it, okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.
Andrew Obin: Hey guys, good morning.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Andrew Obin: Just a simple math question. So if I look at the guidance on Aquatic Systems before for the year and where you end that up, it seems there is eight percentage points difference, which is, I think for the year is a little bit over $80 million. And if I look at the delta for first quarter versus what you were guiding or versus what you reported, so it seems $30 million. So if I think that $30 million is a combination of a little bit too much inventory and weather that sort of implies that non-weather-related stuff is $60 million for the remainder of the year. Is that how I should think about it?
JohnStauch: On the outer end, yes, you got it right meaning the inventory did not get worked down in Q1 as we've said. And that inventory will be worked down in Q2 and Q3. And so yes, you got it right. So the weather impact for us, you've got it quantified correctly. The rest of it is the inventory burn that we're expecting in Q2 to Q3 and using the outer end or the lower end of the projections as you do that math. So yes, you got it right.
Andrew Obin: And I'm just struggling with the concept. So you said if you can't do pools in Q1, so you can hire people to dig pools in Q2 and Q3. Because it seems that you say there are labor constraints. And I'm just struggling to understand the concept I apologize?
John Stauch: Yes. So again, we're talking about a couple of things. Certainly, they will do their best to work as fast as possible to build those pools in Q2 and Q3. But as I've said, we're not going to benefit from that because we have to work our inventory down through our distributors and dealer channels. And so that will recover in the industry, but because Q1 demand was so soft and the inventory did not get reduced in Q1, we are planning on reducing our inventory in Q2 and Q3 as all of that activities that you mentioned gets happening in the outer end of the market.
Andrew Obin: Got you. Thank you so much for taking my call.
Operator: And your final question comes from the line of Damian Karas with UBS.
Damian Karas: Hi, good morning everyone. So a follow-up on Aquatics, you highlighted some of the areas of U.S. that were most impacted by the colder weather and the inventory destocking. Just thinking about your expectations for the further destocking over the next one to two quarters here and then what ensues. Could you give us a sense on whether you're really expecting a similar level of activity across all these regions? Or could there be some dispersion or any unique regional circumstances that you're perhaps factoring in?
John Stauch: We're not factoring any unique dispersion or circumstances. What we're doing is trying to get below this and get to the bottom of the range. And so, we're assuming that the inventory gets worked out. Obviously, it's not perfect. The inventory is not ideal or perfectly balanced by region or all those other things. But we feel like we need to work to get this inventory out of the channel. We have a great business. It's a business that has performed historically at the upper single-digit growth range and we believe it's going to perform again to mid to upper single-digit growth range. And so what we want to do is get it right-sized from the inventory perspective, work on the demand pull to the consumer, our new product development and all our great marketing and sales activities and make this business the right business -- the great business it used to be in 2020 and beyond. That's what we're doing.
Damian Karas: Okay, sounds good, makes sense. And just on CapEx. So you've guided that $10 million higher. Just wonder, if you can give any additional color on what led you to up the budget there and just any color on where you're planning to spend this?
John Stauch: Yes I think we've gone out and made sure that our businesses understand that capital was important factor in driving productivity. It doesn't matter if it's not on -- it's on the software or the front-end, marketing and sales-related activities, as well as automation in the factories and capital investment in the factories to drive productivity. So just a philosophy of Mark and myself that we need to use capital to help drive productivity and we wanted to make sure that the businesses have the capital they need to do that.
Damian Karas: Got it. Thanks for clarifying.
Operator: I would now like to turn the call over to Pentair for any closing remarks.
John Stauch: Thank you for joining us today. We continue to invest in our prioritized growth initiatives around advancing pool growth and accelerating residential and commercial water treatment. We're driving operations, sourcing and cost-out actions where appropriate, particularly in our Flow Technologies segment. We have a strong capital structure, solid free cash flow generation and we will continue to invest in our strategy to be the leading residential and commercial water treatment company. Thank you for your continued interest. Zetania, you can conclude the call.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-01-29 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. My name is Kathy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q4 2018 Pentair Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Lucas, you may begin your conference.
Jim Lucas: Thanks, Kathy, and welcome to Pentair's fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. We're glad you could join us. I'm Jim Lucas, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. And with me today is John Stauch, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Borin, our Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, we will provide details on our fourth quarter and full-year 2018 performance, as well as our first quarter and full-year 2019 outlook as outlined in this morning's press release. Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties such as the risks outlined in Pentair's most recent 10-Q, Form 10-K, and today's press release. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today, and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results. Today's webcast is accompanied by a presentation, which can be found in the Investors Relations section of Pentair's Web site. We will reference these slides throughout our prepared remarks. Any references to non-GAAP financials are reconciled in the appendix of the presentation. We will be sure to reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. I would like to request that you limit your questions to one and a follow-up in order to ensure everyone an opportunity to ask their questions. I will now turn the call over to John.
John Stauch: Thank you, Jim, and good morning everyone. Please turn to slide number four, titled Executive Summary. 2018 was a very busy year for Pentair, and one we are very proud of. We completed the successful separation of nVent to shareholders, we developed a detailed and executable residential and commercial water treatment strategy, and we overdrove our 2018 commitments despite the impact of tariffs and inflation. In addition to financial performance, we returned nearly $700 million to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. Our cash generation remains strong, and our balance sheet is in great shape. To start 2019, we announced agreements for two strategic acquisitions that will help us advance our residential and commercial water treatment strategy. After Mark discusses our financial performance, I will speak more about these two deals. We are very pleased with what we believe was a successful 2018 for Pentair, and we continue to believe we are well-positioned for 2019 and beyond. Please turn to slide five, labeled Financial Highlights. Before turning the call over to Mark, I wanted to spend a moment reviewing some of the highlights for the quarter and the year. In the fourth quarter, we saw core sales grow 6%, and our adjusted EPS grow 15%. For the full-year, our sales grew 5%. We expanded our return on sales 60 basis points, while making a number of strategic growth investments to position us for the longer term. Adjusted EPS grew 21%, and we generated over $400 million in free cash flow. For 2019, we expect core sales to grow 4% to 5%, segment income to increase 8% to 12%, and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.60 per share, an increase of 6% to 11%. Once again, we are targeting free cash flow to approximate adjusted net income. While we expect some of the headwinds we face in 2018, mostly inflation to continue, we believe we are well-positioned to deliver on our commitments once again as we anticipate consistency, predictability, and sustained performance to return to Pentair. I would now like to turn the call over to Mark to discuss the fourth quarter results and provide more details on our full-year 2019 outlook before I provide an update on our key strategic growth initiatives.
Mark Borin: Thank you, John. Please turn to slide six, labeled Full Year 2018 Pentair Performance. As John mentioned, core sales grew 5% for the full-year. Our Aquatic Systems businesses led the way with robust 11% core sales growth, while both the Filtration and Flow segments contributed low single-digit core sales growth for the full-year. Segment income increased 8%, while ROS expanded 60 basis points to 18.1%. We are particularly pleased with our segment income and ROS performance for the year given the significant inflation headwinds we faced. Adjusted EPS grew 21% to $2.35 per share, which exceeded our initial 2018 guidance of $2.20 to $2.30 per share set last February. Finally, we generated over $400 million in free cash flow. With strong core sales growth, ROS expansion, and adjusted EPS growth, we were very pleased with our full-year 2018 performance. Now, turn to slide seven, labeled Q4 '18 Pentair Performance. For the fourth quarter, we reported core sales growth of 6%, ROS expansion of 40 basis points to 18.1%, and adjusted EPS growth of 15% to $0.60 per share. We will provide more color on the individual segment performance shortly. Below the line, we saw an adjusted tax rate of 18%, net interest/other expense of $6 million, and our average shares in the quarter were 174 million. As we mentioned at the beginning of the call, we bought back another 100 million of stock in the quarter. Please turn to slide eight, labeled Q4 '18 Pentair Segment Performance. This slide lays out the fourth quarter performance of our three segments. Aquatic Systems delivered another strong quarter with 13% core sales growth and 10% segment income growth. We do believe that some of our distributors likely pulled forward some sales in an effort to beat the impact of our price increases. We believe Aquatics remains well-positioned entering 2019, and its industry dynamics remain favorable. Core sales were flat in Filtration Solutions, with segment income growing 8% and return on sales expanding 170 basis points to 17.9%. Throughout 2018, we have been refocusing our filtration business to be less depended on lower margin lumpy project business and instead focused on our core component and systems businesses. Although the top line trends were less favorable than in 2018, we were pleased with the income and margin performance of this segment. Flow Technologies reported 4% core sales growth, which represented its fifth consecutive quarter of improved sales performance. The segment income performance was adversely affected by rebate activity as increased volume levels in front of price increases occurred in the quarter. Overall, Flow Technologies is entering 2019 with its price realization more in line with the increased inflationary pressures that materialized in the second-half of 2018. Please turn to slide nine, labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. We are very pleased with the results of 2018 as we significantly reduced our debt levels, while returning nearly $700 million to shareholders. We ended 2018 with our net debt to EBITDA leverage at less than 1.5 times. Shortly before the end of 2018, we announced a 3% dividend increase for 2019, which will mark our 43rd consecutive year of dividend increases. We announced agreements for two acquisitions that when completed we expect to invest $280 million. Although we do see some seasonal cash usage in the first quarter each year, we believe we remain well-positioned to invest in our core businesses, look at attractive strategically aligned tuck-in or bolt-on acquisition targets, and continue to return cash to shareholders. Please turn to slide 10, labeled Full Year 2019 Outlook. Today we are introducing our 2019 outlook. We expect core sales to grow 4% to 5% which is comprised of about 3% of price and 1% to 2% of volume. We expect total sales growth of 5% to 6% with roughly 3% contribution from the recently announced acquisition, offset by 1% headwind from FX and another point headwind from divestures. We anticipate segment income growing 8% to 12% inclusive of acquisitions. While inflation is anticipated to remain a headwind, we expect price to principally offset inflation for the full-year and productivity to provide to our improved performance. We are introducing an adjusted EPS range of $2.50 to $2.60 per share, an increase of 6% to 11%. Other items embedded in our guidance include corporate expense of $60 million to $65 million, a tax rate of 20.5%, net interest/other expense of $37 million, and an average share count for the year of approximately 172 million shares. We wanted to provide some additional color on a few items. First, the increase in corporate expense is reflective of how we allocate some of our cost in addition to four quarters of our new structure as 2018 represented just three quarters given the timing of the separation of nVent last April. Next, we are guiding our 2019 tax rate to increase to 20.5%, but this requires some further explanation. Late in 2018, the IRS proposed new regulations that if approved as final could present a headwind to our current tax rate of 18%. These proposed changes are not expected to finalize until June or July if they do indeed get approved as final. However, we are factoring in a 250 basis point increase to our full-year tax rate. We expect our first quarter tax rate will remain at 18% with any true-up happening in Q2 or Q3 if and when the regulations are finalized. Finally, our estimated share count of 172 million does account for us buying back $150 million in shares for the full-year, which is consistent with our previously communicated long-term plans regarding buybacks. Please turn to slide 11, labeled Seasonality Expected to Continue. We wanted to remind everyone that our business does experience some seasonality during the year. The past two years have seen similar trends that we would expect to continue. We thought this would be a useful reminder as you think about the quarterly distribution of sales and adjusted EPS. Please turn to slide 12, labeled Q1 '19 Pentair Outlook. We anticipate first quarter sales to grow 4% to 5% with all three segments contributing. We expect Aquatic Systems to be up 4% to 6%, Filtration Solutions to be flat to up 1%, and Flow Technologies to grow 3% to 6%. Segment income is anticipated to be up approximately 2% to 5%, and adjusted EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.52 to $0.55 per share, which would represent growth of 6% to 12%. Below the line, we expect the first quarter tax rate to be 18%. Net interest/other expense of roughly $7 million, and share to be approximately 172.5 million. While the first quarters are seasonally lightest period of the year, we believe we are positioned to see our core sales growth trends continue. I would now like to turn the call back to John.
John Stauch: Thank you, Mark. Please turn to slide number 13, titled Pentair Strategy Summary. We have used this page consistently in our earnings presentations to remind everyone of strategy to the leading residential and commercial water treatment company and to share with you the areas where we are investing in growth. Our focused areas of strategy remained on advancing growth in pool and accelerating residential and commercial water treatment which requires investment at the business and the enterprise level. Our approach to capital allocation remains disciplined. And we are committed to maintaining our investment grade rating, reinvesting in our most attractive core businesses and paying a competitive dividend. We also look at a balanced approach between M&A and intelligent buybacks with our M&A decisions being informed by overall valuations and the quality of assets available as well as our ability to integrate them successfully. Please turn to slide 14, labeled Two Strategic Deals. We discussed throughout 2018 that accelerating residential commercial water treatment is one of our two key strategic growth initiatives. We also discussed throughout 2018 that we are building our M&A funnel, and we are very pleased to have announced agreements for two strategic acquisitions that help us further this key growth initiative. On January 7th, we announced that we have signed agreements to acquire Aquion and Pelican Water Systems. We discussed last quarter that we are in the early innings of moving up the value change, from being a leading component supplier, to introducing smart, connected, branded products and solutions. We expect these two acquisitions to add roughly $110 million in revenue, and combined, have margins that are above the Filtration segment's average. Both of these acquisitions help us further our move up the value chain. We are really excited about Aquion bringing a national affiliated dealer network which is under the RainSoft brand. Aquion also brings a diverse line of whole home water treatment systems in addition to ozone and ultraviolet disinfection systems and internet-enabled solutions. Pelican is an exciting acquisition for us because it brings us a direct-to-consumer model through a proprietary ecommerce platform. Pelican also has a number of innovative water treatment systems and services that we'll be able to sell through all of our distribution channels. We still expect these acquisitions to close in the first quarter of 2019 subject to customary closing conditions and necessary regulatory approvals. We remain excited about our opportunity to advance our residential and commercial water treatment strategy. I would now like to turn the call over to Kathy, for Q&A, after which I'll have a few closing remarks. Kathy, please open the line for questions. Thank you.
Operator: Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.
Nathan Jones: Good morning everyone.
John Stauch: Good morning, Nathan.
Nathan Jones: Mark, I think you commented that you thought there was a little bit of pull-forward in aquatics business. I know it's probably pretty tough to try and estimate how much that was, but any kind of color you could give there, and if you think there was any kind of pull-forward in any of the other businesses that's worth calling out?
Mark Borin: Yes, I talked about it in the Aquatics business and also referenced a little bit in Flow as well. And if you think about it, it's probably about one to two points of growth in 2018 that then presents a headwind for 2019.
Nathan Jones: One to two points total for the year or just that in the fourth quarter you're talking about?
Mark Borin: For the year.
Nathan Jones: For the year. I would also like to talk about that productivity bar that you guys disclosed, which was fairly low in 4Q and in 3Q. Can you maybe talk about what the delays are there on seeing the productivity improvement? And then I think you talked about, for 2019, price offsets, inflation and productivity drops to the bottom line, so many any discussion about what you're expecting out of productivity in 2019.
Mark Borin: Sure. I think as you think about it amongst the three segments and then when you look at the segment performance in Q4 you can see that good performance in Aquatics and Filtration. And so really the productivity story for Q4 was driven by Flow Technologies. And they're main drivers of productivity there relate to some operational challenges in a couple of factories that manufacture large pumps. And so we saw that in Q4. The team has been focused on improving that, and we see that likely turning around in the first-half of 2019.
Nathan Jones: Okay, so a couple of discreet things there that are dragging the productivity numbers down in the second-half, they get solved in the first-half. Any idea what we should expect out of productivity in 2019?
Mark Borin: As we think about kind of our overall guidance for 2019, we talked about price and inflation kind of offsetting each other, and then the margin expansion coming from volume and from incremental productivity.
Nathan Jones: Okay, thanks. I'll pass it on.
Operator: And your next question comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen.
Joe Giordano: Hi, John.
John Stauch: Hey, good morning.
Joe Giordano: Good morning. So, can you guys talk on the filtration side, I know this is a real focus for you guys. Can you talk about maybe the brand that you're building here, and as you're bringing in these new businesses you're getting out of some kind of non-core assets there as well. Can you talk about the value proposition and how it's changing and also like how consistent is the messaging around this one cohesive Pentair filtration brand, and kind of where you see this going?
John Stauch: Clearly it's not today. And it is our goal to have a Pentair brand that represents our filtration opportunity. And these acquisitions that we bring in are helpful in that regard because we have to get close to the consumer. And the consumer is making choices, and we have to make that a brand-based loyalty program in which then we can give the whole value chain of distributions in the products to the systems to also the services that are necessary, either through our direct channel or our affiliated channel. So, it's important as we think about building it out. I ultimately think that most consumers just want water as a service. They don't necessarily care about the products or the components that they're buying. They want a solution for the zip code or the geography or the country they live in, and that's where this is all heading, Joe. And that's why we think we need to have that consumer touch and be close to the consumer to be able to bring that story forward.
Joe Giordano: And as that kind of happens is that something that leads to like a sustainably more predictable higher margin business like consistently?
John Stauch: That's absolutely the goal. I mean, these are -- our residential commercial filtration business today is already higher margin, but I think you mentioned the predictable and consistency part of that is the main driver. And making sure that there's more of an annuity-based view of how we service that customer over time.
Joe Giordano: Okay, that's great. And then two kind of clarifications here, do you have any color on the margin guidance by segment into '19, and on your comment about price offsetting inflation, is that a consistent statement across all three segments as well?
Mark Borin: That would be consistent generally across all three segments. And no, we don't have specific guidance on segment profitability for 2019.
Joe Giordano: Is there anything with direction -- like we could do the math to get to it -- not a segment level, but is there anything you'd point out on an individual segment basis that we should take into consideration as we do that?
Mark Borin: I think if you think about our overall segment growth of 8% to 12%, and continued strong margins in aquatics and the upside that we talked about on flow technologies businesses that productivity in Q4 turns around, I think that would kind of frame the way to think about 2019 by segment.
John Stauch: Joe, we expect them all to improve, but we do want to maintain some flexibility for our strategic growth investments as we think about ramping up or ramping down the investment based upon how we see the organic growth. So, don't want to lock into specific targets by segment, but we're expecting them all to improve.
Joe Giordano: And Mark, can you just get into that tax thing that you mentioned, just -- I think there's some people who aren't sure exactly what this is. So what is this proposed regulation and how does it apply to you guys? And then I'll -- thanks.
Mark Borin: Yes, sure. I know that's a new data point. So, right at the end of 2018, the IRS published new regulations, and a lot of that related to them writing regulations around laws that were passed a year earlier. And specifically related to us, and not surprisingly part of our global structure, there were regulations specifically around the deductibility of interest in the United States, and it's those new regulations and the technical interpretation of those that applied to us, and that's where we see this headwind of 250 basis points, going from 18% to 20.5%. As I said in my prepared remarks, we've included that in our guidance for the year. The regulations are proposed right now, so they're not final. As proposed, they're effective as of January 1st, 2019, which is why we put them in our full-year guidance, but they wont actually get finalized, we don't think, until the end of June or perhaps early July. And so that's why we guided to 18% in Q1 because they wont have been finalized, so we wont implement them in Q1, and then we'll see what happens in Q2. And if they're revised or if they're kept the same as they were originally proposed, and then that'll inform the tax rate in Q2 and the true-up that would happen in Q2 to get to a full-year rate of 20.5%.
Joe Giordano: Great. Thanks guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mike Halloran with Baird.
Mike Halloran: Hey, morning everyone.
John Stauch: Good morning, Mike.
Mike Halloran: So, quick question here then on just underlying assumptions for the broader environment as you work your way through the year here. It seems based on the guidance that core trends are expected to be relatively stable through the year. Just want some clarification on that, and if there's anything that we should know about trajectory as we work through the year on the demand side?
John Stauch: Yes, I mean I think you read it right. I mean we're expecting about three points of price in this outlook, and we got one to two points of volume. And we're basically seeing the same core trends throughout the year, Mike. I mean as we mentioned, I think given the substantial price increases that were put into place in Q3 and Q4 we do think that distributors and dealers took advantage of buying a little bit ahead, so we'll probably expect a little slower start into Q1. And if you recall, we had a very strong Q1 last year, and we probably expect to have a stronger Q2 or 3 outlook as we did have such a great Q2. So, we're going to see that type of movement I think as we go through. But overall, core trends remain stable. We're not necessarily a new housing install, we tend to be more of the aftermarket served, and certainly in the residential commercial space we're close to 85% in the aftermarket side, and so all those trends feel pretty much the same as they were last year.
Mike Halloran: Any regional variances you would point out that you're seeing right now?
John Stauch: No, I mean I think we're aware, and then we're hearing that China is slower. I mean it's a good news/bad news story for us, I mean it's less than 4% of our overall revenue so we're not big enough to really matter in China. And our opportunity to continue to grow our business there is because we're not starting from a big base, so we have an opportunity to expand our revenue. So, other than that, I think Europe remains the way it generally was last year. It wasn't a huge contributory factor in '18, and we don't think it's a huge headwind in '19.
Mike Halloran: And then just one clarification, the Aquion and Pelican acquisitions, those are assumed in your guidance, and based on the divestiture acquisition contribution first quarter versus the rest of the year, it seems like those are soon to be coming in at the beginning of the second quarter, late first quarter, is that about right?
Mark Borin: That's right, so we're expecting to close sometime here in the back-half of the first quarter, and we've added them to guidance on that basis.
Mike Halloran: All right, great. Thank you for your time. Appreciate it.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Mark Borin: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Patrick [indiscernible] with JPMorgan.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my call. Had a few questions, but maybe first just on the cadence for the year, the first quarter segment income growth of 2% to 5% versus -- 8% to 12%, I think you mentioned maybe the pull-forwards impacting the top line a little bit in the first quarter, but what's impacting the margins, is it just inflation still a drag in the first-half and it gets better in the second-half. Just curious if you could help understand the underlying factors behind the profit growth in the first quarter versus the full-year guide being a little bit lighter.
Mark Borin: Sure, yes. John had mentioned before that Q1 last year was a really strong quarter, so that certainly the year-over-year comps are a part of that. I talked about the guidance around the corporate investment being up slightly year-over-year, and a fair bit of that comes in the first quarter, in particular because of the timing of the separation last year, and that our standalone structure was in place from May 1st going forwards. So, those are really the key drivers, the underlying operating performance is not that significantly impacted as you look quarter-over-quarter.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. That probably answers my second question; I missed the first part of the call around corporate going up so much. That's probably because of that standalone structure not being in place, so my first -- I guess you had said that, I guess, earlier?
Mark Borin: That's right, and then just overall kind of the way we allocate to the businesses.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. And then just on interest expense. Is that just going up because of the deals?
Mark Borin: That's right, so that includes an assumption around the interest associated with the two acquisitions.
Unidentified Analyst: And then on tax rate, if finalized, can you just confirm the normalized rate for 2020 would be that 20.5%?
Mark Borin: That's right, 20.5% would be our new run rate.
Unidentified Analyst: And then are there things you can do capital structure-wise, to offset some of that, or was it kind of it is what it is?
Mark Borin: We're always looking for opportunities to effectively manage our structure, just like any company. So, we'll -- the tax team will be looking to be as efficient as possible, but based on our existing structure, the 20.5% is our estimate for 2019 and would be our run rate going forward.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. And then sorry, one last clean up for the first quarter, that the growth you expect is you're going to get the three points of price starting in the first quarter, or does that layer on more in the back-half of the year, you start a little bit slower there?
Mark Borin: Yes, most of the price was driven by the increases that we announced in Q3 and Q4 of 2018. And so it's pretty evenly spread throughout 2019. A little bit lower in the first quarter, and then slight ramp, but for the most part, pretty balanced.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Thanks a lot, guys. Good luck.
Mark Borin: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jeff Hammond: Hey, good morning, guys.
John Stauch: Hey, Jeff.
Mark Borin: Good morning.
Jeff Hammond: So, what's informing the better growth profile in the organic for Flow Tech?
John Stauch: Well, they had been building a backlog primarily around the commercial infrastructure, Jeff, and so, we were able to build that backlog up, and that's helping a lot in volume. We also had some buildup in the residential and irrigation side, you know, we had -- as we mentioned last year, we had one kind of global de-stocking incident that happened in the Middle East with the distributor. We switched over a system and identified that they had too much inventory. So those headwinds are gone as we look forward, and that's helping, yes.
Jeff Hammond: Okay, then just on the price cost dynamic, are you contemplating a move in the list three from 10% to 25% or how is that captured in your price?
John Stauch: Yes, our inflation assumption includes the increase from 10% to 25% in list three that's scheduled for March 1st. So that is built into our inflation assumptions for the year.
Jeff Hammond: Okay. And then on the last one, just on the acquisitions, can you talk about the long-term growth rates of those businesses, and what you're kind of putting in the outlook or expecting for those businesses in terms of growth in '19?
John Stauch: Yes, I mean, we see -- you know, the Aquion acquisition being somewhere in that 3% to 5%, longer term growth range, and then we obviously see Pelican, which has been historically growing at very strong double-digits, close to 20% as being at least for the near term, the expectations that we have upon it. So it's really about how do we think about these all at the right time, you know, and after we get regulatory approvals behind us, we'll take a look at the better longer-term outlooks for these businesses.
Jeff Hammond: Okay, great, thanks guys.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Mark Borin: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Jeff Reive: Hi, good morning, this is Jeff Reive on for Deane Dray. So just sticking to the deals, will the new e-commerce capabilities from the Pelican deal have any meaningful conflicts with your dealer channel?
John Stauch: Don't expect them to, which -- it's a different segmentation of the overall consumer market, and it's very specific and targeted to areas in which they feel like they can help, you know, more ZIP code by ZIP code. So we're excited to be able to explore it deeper. Again, after we get the regulatory approvals, and we're hopeful that we can maybe take that capability and expand it and really help our dealer channels as well.
Jeff Reive: Got it, thanks. And then maybe just more broadly, can you give us an update on your M&A pipeline?
John Stauch: Yes, I mean, we have a really well-thought-through strategy that we align with our board on, and I think it was an exhaustive global strategy that we feel really good about being aligned on, which really gives us a better visibility to the types of deals that we're looking at. So we're always looking at building the funnel. But it's also about, you know, do they meet the strategy and then ultimately, are they cultural fits and are they financial fits? And so, right now, I'd say we have a strong funnel, but what makes it to a final acquisition stage also has to get through that cultural aspect and also the financial aspects.
Jeff Reive: Great, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brett Linzey with Vertical Core Research Partners.
Brett Linzey: Hi, good morning, guys.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Mark Borin: Good morning.
Brett Linzey: Hey, just want to come back to inflation. Sounds like that's an all-encompassing number with the tariffs included, you know, if I'd assume three points of price, you know, and you're going to offset commodities and inflation fully, that's about $85 million to $90 million. If you could just unbundle what is commodity inflation in that number, and then how much is tariff-related?
John Stauch: Yes, we've been hesitant to try to unbundle the two, because there's the direct impact of the tariffs, but then there's really the indirect impact of tariffs and that's been the trick is to be comfortable identifying that. So when we think of our kind of inflation number in total, it's really the combined impact of both of those things and there's the direct impact that tariffs is not really that relevant, it's really more important to think about the total.
Mark Borin: Yes, and also keep in mind about, you know, just a little under about 30% of that number as you do the math, next year is also wage inflation, you know, which is -- globally wages are up as well.
Brett Linzey: Okay, that's helpful. And then filtration, just want to understand the demand backdrop there, and what you're seeing, I mean, the business showed some signs of life in Q3, softened in Q4 and the Q1 guide implies a little bit of a slow start here, maybe just a little color on demand and what you're seeing from a regional perspective as well?
John Stauch: Yes, there's -- we have three different businesses underneath filtration. One is food and beverage. We have also a business focused on the industrial filtration side, and then the third one is our residential and commercial filtration where these two acquisitions fit. The residential and commercial has been relatively steady. It's a global business, and it's been growing in low-to mid-single digits for the last year or so. We have had a little bit of volatility as we mentioned earlier on some projects on the food and beverage side. We expect those to be behind us at the end of Q1. Don't want to continue those as an excuse, but we went out and really de-backlogged our large projects. On the food and beverage side, it really moved more to a component strategy which has also been a big lift to the margins in Filtration Solutions overall. So, once we get through Q1, we have that year-over-year impact behind us and then we are moving forward.
Brett Linzey: Okay, great. I'll pass it along.
Mark Borin: Thank you.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning. This is Rebecca on for Brian. Just following up on the filtration margins that picked up this quarter, I was wondering how of that was shifting away from the lower margin productions versus if price helped at all. And then, how we should think about the trend for 2019.
Mark Borin: Yes, sure. And price has a smaller impact in the Filtration business overall. John just talked about those three businesses price you really see that just in the residential and commercial side of the business. So it is less about price. It is about the mix as you referenced. And then also just core productivity in segment as they have opportunities to get after some of the lower productivity and lower margin businesses and improve that. So it's less price and more productivity and mix.
John Stauch: Yes, and sequentially we would expect the performance this year to roll in the next year. Obviously, the year-over-year impact will start to shrink as we realize that benefit of the mix in 2018.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And then, just following up on that question about the ecommerce channel, can you provide a little more color on your strategy heading into 2018 in terms of the dealer channel? And then how much wholesale change do you expect for filtration in the U.S. and how you are struggling [ph] any potential customer channel conflicts?
Mark Borin: Yes, we are after the end consumer. And we believe by being closer to the end consumer, we can bring those leads back to not only the acquisitions that we're looking at closing. And again, we need the regulatory approval to close them. But also those leads can be also served by our independent dealer channel. And I think it gives us an opportunity to give to the customer the right solution that they are looking for. And so, that's where we are going with ecommerce platform is to make sure we've got a targeted solution by ZIP code that meets the consumer needs and then ultimately bring in the right solution through all of our channels to that consumer, and we will continue to built that out over time, and we will share more information when it's available.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thanks. I'll pass on.
Operator: Next question comes from Damien [indiscernible].
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning everyone.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Unidentified Analyst: In Aquatics, could you elaborate a bit on your outlook for the 5% to 7% core growth there? I think you still have some solid price that's carrying over from the September increase. So could you maybe just talk a little bit about the drivers there, and how much recent growth investments are expected to contribute in 2019?
Mark Borin: Sure. So you're right, Aquatics is our strongest segment from a price perspective, so price certainly makes up a big chunk of the core sales growth for Aquatics. And then the remainder are coming from volume, and I mentioned in earlier questions around the impact of the pool and so thinking of 1% to 2% impact overall for the business and a lot of that coming from the Aquatics business. So that's factored into the way we think about our volume assumption for the year.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And I wanted to ask you about China, obviously, it's been a key strategic focus area for you, could you maybe give an update on how the region performed in the quarter and what kind of growth expectations you have for China and Southeast Asia for 2019?
Mark Borin: Yes. And it's less than 4% of our revenue, and I am not apologizing for that. It's just wise. It's going to be a strategic growth investment and why we need to get behind it and grow at a much faster rate. 2018 was a really solid year for repositioning, we were able to get four, five, new products launched here in the back half of the year and through the ministry of health approvals in China. Then we also were able to make some pretty bold moves through our distributor channel, and move more direct so that we can participate in the e-commerce platforms in China. So I think we repositioned and did all that in 2018. You know, we were lower on the growth side in Q4, you know, probably closer to low single-digits. As we head forward we're expecting double-digit growth in 2019 to continue, and we would be very disappointed if we weren't closer to 15% to 20%, because again, we're starting from a relatively low base.
Unidentified Analyst: Right, makes sense. Thank you very much.
Mark Borin: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, it's Jason on for Julian. Just one quick question on the pricing tailwind that three points expected in 2019, would the correct way to think about this be since it's contingent -- so, a portion of it is contingent upon offsetting a 25% of re-rating of tariffs…
Mark Borin: No.
Unidentified Analyst: That is not -- never happens, you know, the pricing could come in a little bit lower, as not all of that would be necessary to offset the rest of inflation or is that 3% sort of locked in, and you would just see the inflation side of the equation come down and you would just enjoy a nice tailwind from that?
Mark Borin: Well, first of all, just in terms of determining price, so as I said the majority of that is from the actions that have already been taken, and then some that would -- still to be taken, but it's not going to be dependant on what happens with the status of the list three moving from 10% go 25%. And you know, how that all ultimately shakes out if and when that changes or who knows what else may happen with respect to tariffs, you know, that's yet to be seen. So right now our guidance is based on you know, the assumption that I talked about earlier. And we wouldn't expect that to change.
Unidentified Analyst: Definitely. And then just a quick one on the core sales guidance, infiltration solutions, you've given a lot of helpful color around Q4 and the Q1 trajectory, just given the wide range of outcomes that seem to be embedded in that 1% to 4%, could you kind of just talk to what it would take maybe in terms of the underlying demand environment to get closer to that 3% go 5% on the high-end organic sales guidance, and how that sort of differs from the Q1 environment right now?
Mark Borin: Yes, I think it's a good catch, I mean, it is our most global business and we have a wider range on Filtration Solutions because we do have more than -- you know, half of our revenue come in from outside the United States, so we see that the U.S. economy remains strong, and we feel like there's no real reason why see slowdown in Europe right now and as we mentioned earlier, we do see some volatility in China. So I think the range is there, because of its global aspects, and also, some of the industries that they're serving, food and beverage and also the industrial investments being tied somewhat to -- just industrial on oil and gas, so again there's more volatility in those spaces, and so, we just included a wider range to capture that.
Unidentified Analyst: Understood, thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Joe Aiken with William Blair.
Joe Aiken: Hi, good morning, just had a quick question looking at our model. Do you have any expectations for gross margin at least directionally in 2019?
John Stauch: Yes, no, I'd say -- right, we talked about the segment income margin assumptions, and we wouldn't go beyond that and talk about the gross margin assumptions.
Joe Aiken: Okay, got it, thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from Walter Liptak with Seaport Global.
Walter Liptak: Hi, thanks, good morning and a good year, guys. I wanted to ask about, you're sticking with this price situation and it sounds like you've got most of the price costs covered for this year, how would things play out if inflation reignites, what would be the timing on price increases and did you learn anything last year that might help you with price in 2019?
John Stauch: Sure, I mean, we'll continue to monitor the inflationary environment, but we feel like what we've got reflected in our outlook is certainly based on what we see the landscape looks like and our pricing actions are in place. So we're going to remain nimble, but right now we think we've got the right assumptions built into our expectations.
Walter Liptak: Right, okay. Now, I wanted to ask, the pools business, if I recall, last year -- your pool installers in not jamming them with a price increase, you know, I wonder how is the price increase, how is it accepted so far? You said there was a little bit of pull-forward, but it predominantly -- this was something that you are going -- you expect to see flow through, you're getting pushed back on some of the price.
John Stauch: Now, the comments last year on the timing of the price increase was really related to the pool season and the hesitancy to do an early price increase that would have put a price increase in the middle of the pool season, that's disruptive to the dealers and installers, but there is a time price increase that coincides with the pool season is what we talked about and that you know -- if that doesn't, we don't get pushback from our distributor or dealer channel as a result of that, so there hasn't been any blowback because of that.
Walter Liptak: Okay, great. Okay, all right, thank you.
Operator: And there are no questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to our presenters for any closing remarks.
John Stauch:

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Pentair Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Lucas, please go ahead.
Jim Lucas: Thanks, Crystal and welcome to Pentair’s third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. We are glad you could join us today. I am Jim Lucas, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. And with me today is John Stauch, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Mark Borin, our Chief Financial Officer. On today’s call, we will provide details on our third quarter 2018 performance as well as our fourth quarter and full year 2018 outlook as outlined in this morning’s press release. Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company’s anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties such as the risks outlined in Pentair’s most recent 10-Q, Form 10-K and today’s press release. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results. Today’s webcast is accompanied by a presentation, which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Pentair’s website. We will reference these slides throughout our prepared remarks. Any references to non-GAAP financials are reconciled in the appendix of the presentation. We will be sure to reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. I would like to request that you limit your questions to one and a follow-up in order to ensure everyone an opportunity to ask their questions. I will now turn the call over to John.
John Stauch: Thank you, Jim and good morning everyone. Please turn to Slide #4 titled Executive Summary. We are pleased with our third quarter as we were able to deliver results in line or better than our forecast on all of our key metrics marked by 6% core sales growth, 10% adjusted EPS growth and over $100 million of free cash flow generated in the quarter and $265 million year-to-date. All three segments contributed to the top line performance with Aquatic Systems delivering a strong 12% core sales growth in the quarter. We also used our strong balance sheet and cash flow to buyback 100 million of shares in the quarter and have purchased 400 million to the first three quarters. For the full year, we raised our core sales growth expectation by a full point to be 4% to 5% and we are still expecting ROS expansion of approximately 50 basis points to 18%. We are also raising our adjusted EPS guidance to be approximately $2.33, which reflects the third quarter performance as well as the small benefit from share repurchases in the quarter. This marks the second consecutive quarter that we have raised our expectations driven in part by continued healthy end markets as well as continued execution across our portfolio. I would now like to turn the call over to Mark to discuss the third quarter results and update you on the details of our full year 2018 outlook before I provide an update on our key strategic growth initiatives.
Mark Borin: Thank you, John. Please turn to Slide 5 labeled Q3 ‘18 Pentair performance. As John mentioned, core sales grew 6%. All three segments contributed this quarter with particular strength in Aquatic Systems. We will provide more color on the performance of all three segments shortly. Segment income increased 1%, while ROS contracted 40 basis points to 17.1% in line with expectations as price increases implemented to offset inflation took effect late in the quarter. We will expand on the margin performance when discussing the individual segments. Adjusted EPS grew 10% to $0.54 per share, which was $0.02 ahead of our prior guidance. Our adjusted tax rate remained 18% and our share count came in at 175.7 million shares benefiting in part from the 150 million in shares we repurchased during the second quarter and an additional 100 million we repurchased during the third quarter. Free cash flow was strong in the quarter at $108 million and we have generated $265 million in free cash flow year-to-date, which is in line with normal seasonal patterns. Please turn to Slide 6 labeled Q3 ‘18 Pentair segment performance. This slide lays out the performance of our three segments. Aquatic Systems delivered a strongest performance of the year with 12% core sales growth in the quarter, income growth of 13% and ROS expansion of 60 basis points. We saw strong demand in the quarter, favorable mix and continued dealer gains. In addition, we implemented our annual price increase in September, while continuing to increase our growth investments in this important segment. We believe the outlook for Aquatic Systems remains very favorable and we continue to believe in the long-term outlook of our franchise business. Filtration Solutions returned to growth in the quarter, with core sales increasing 2%. We continue to see pockets of strength in our important North American residential and commercial markets. We saw particular strength in our niche industrial businesses, but just as important, our food and beverage business showed signs of stabilizing after first half declines. Segment income decreased and ROS contracted 70 basis points to 16%. We implemented price increases in September to help mitigate increased inflation due in part to tariffs implemented in July, but we do not expect to see the full benefits of the price increase until the fourth quarter. Flow Technologies reported its third consecutive quarter of core sales growth and it’s 5% core sales growth was its strongest performance of the year. We saw solid performance in our North American residential and irrigation business and our large pump business showed further signs of stabilization, but we would remind everyone that this is the smallest part of our Flow Technologies segment and tends to be longer cycle and therefore a bit lumpier than our other businesses in flow. Segment income was down 7% and ROS contracted 150 basis points to 15.4%. The margin performance was similarly impacted as Filtration Solutions due to the timing of inflationary pressures and the corresponding price realization. Please turn to Slide 7 labeled balance sheet and cash flow. This continues to be one of our favorite slides as free cash flow remains strong and we have significantly reduced our debt levels during the year. As we pointed out last quarter, our debt is now at a level not seen since 2010. Given the strength of our balance sheet, we believe we are well-positioned to invest in the business, look at attractive strategically aligned tuck-in or bolt-on acquisition targets and continue to return cash to shareholders. We have bought back 400 million in shares year-to-date and we would remind everyone that we have raised our dividend for 42 consecutive years. Please turn to Slide 8 labeled Q4 ‘18 Pentair outlook. We anticipate fourth quarter core sales to grow 4% to 5% with all three segments contributing. We expect Aquatic Systems be up 10% to 12%, Filtration Solutions up 1% to 2% and Flow Technologies to grow 2% to 3%. Segment income is anticipated to be up approximately 6%, while ROS is expected to expand roughly 30 basis points. Below the line, we expect the adjusted tax rate to be around 18%, net interest and other expense to be approximately $7 million and our share count to be around 176 million. Adjusted EPS is expected to be approximately $0.59 per share, which would be the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Please turn to Slide 9 labeled 2018 Pentair outlook. This slide is one we first introduced at our Investor Day in February and we wanted to provide an update as we enter the homestretch of 2018. Given our strong year-to-date performance, the expected overall sales number is slightly higher than our initial forecast for the year. All three of our businesses implemented price increases in September. Consistent with the second half outlook we discussed in our second quarter earnings call in July, the price implementation is essentially in line with our prior expectations and our full year outlook for inflation has not materially changed. The net result is that our full year segment income expectations have not changed and we will continue to expect to drive productivity in addition to price increases we have implemented. Please turn to Slide 10 labeled full year 2018 Pentair outlook. For the full year, we have raised our core sales growth forecast by a point and now expect core sales to increase 4% to 5%. We expect Aquatic Systems core sales to grow roughly 10%, Filtration Solutions to be up 1% to 2%, and Flow Technologies to increase 2% to 3%. Segment income is expected to be up around 8%, while ROS is expected to end the year around 18%, which would represent an increase of roughly 50 basis points. Below the line, we expect the full year adjusted tax rate to be around 18%, adjusted net interest and other expense to be roughly $30 million and shares to be around 178 million. For the full year, we now expect adjusted EPS to be around $2.33 per share and we continue to target free cash flow to approximate 100% of adjusted net income. I would like to turn the call back to John.
John Stauch: Thank you, Mark. Please turn to Slide #11 titled Pentair’s strategy summary. We have used this page consistently in our earnings presentations to remind everyone of our strategy and be the leading residential and commercial water treatment company and to share with you the areas where we are investing in growth. Our focused areas of strategy remain on advancing growth in pool and accelerating residential and commercial water treatment, which requires investment at the business and the enterprise level. Our approach to capital allocation remains disciplined and we remain committed to maintaining our investment grade rating, reinvesting in our most attractive core businesses, and paying competitive dividend yield. We also look at a balanced approach between M&A and intelligent buybacks with our M&A decisions being informed by overall valuations and the quality of assets available as well as our ability to integrate them successfully. Please turn to Slide 12 labeled focused strategies. As we prioritize our growth priorities, we believe this allows us the best opportunity to drive differentiated growth in what we believe is a very attractive water quality space. I would like to give you a quick update on our progress regarding our two most important focused strategies. The first strategy is advancing pool growth, one of our biggest opportunities around automation and connected pools and products. We continue to increase our new product introductions, inclusive of smart technologies and have launched two new automation systems. Our IntelliConnect is an entry-level automation system that connects only a few existing pool products and we have also launched our next generation of our more advanced IntelliConnect platform that provides the highest level of automation for our end consumers and pool dealers. Less than 10% of the 5 million installed in-ground pools today have some form of automation system and we believe this represents a continued runway of growth where we will continue to invest. Our second key growth initiative is accelerating residential and commercial water treatment. We have conducted several consumer surveys to better understand the market, but equally important, we are engaging consumers through digital marketing to build brand strength and drive demand through our dealer network. We are in the early innings of moving up the value chain from being a leading component supplier to introducing smart connected branded products and solutions. We have made several investments in China and Southeast Asia as we see a lot of opportunities in this large market. Please turn to Slide #13. This is the slide that we publicly introduced at the EPG Conference in May of this year. We wanted to remind everyone of our long-term goals. In the current inflationary environment where price has been easier to get and assuming this continues, we would not be surprised to see core sales growth trending toward the upper end of the range if not slightly better. We are currently expecting the pricing environment, coupled with productivity to generally offset inflation and we will provide more details on the impact to 2019 guidance when we release our fourth quarter earnings at the end of January, but we wanted to remind everyone that our long-term goals have not changed. I would now like to turn the call over to Crystal for Q&A after which I will have closing comments. Crystal, please open the line for questions. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
John Stauch: Good morning, Deane.
Deane Dray: Hey, start off with congratulations on that pricing power and pool and last quarter it was controversial at the time that you were one of the few companies to hold off on implementing price increases for this one segment, but it certainly came through. Could you give some color as to what that process was, how much price did you get, how much of it stuck, and what you think the underlying growth and pool was in the quarter?
John Stauch: Sure, Deane and thanks for the comments and agree that the pool business certainly has the ability to control their pricing decisions and had a strong result. Pricing was in line with expectations as we have discussed before. The price went in, in mid-September. So, in Q3 when we saw small impact of that for the pool business in the Q3 quarter, but we will see the full benefit of that in Q4 and it’s in line with our expectations overall and is part of the price that you see for the full year expectation on our full year walk. In terms of their growth split between price and core growth, I think most of the growth in Q3 coming from volume rather than price, only maybe 1 point to 2 points of growth coming from price and then as that grows, about double that in Q4.
Deane Dray: Got it. And then just could you clarify the outlook for this IntelliConnect product. This seems to us to be – have the potential to be one of these revolutionary products similar to the variable speed pump that you introduced. So today what's your expectation for growth in IntelliConnect, and do you have to retrofit pools in order to implement this system?
John Stauch: The answer to the last question is no. I mean, it is an automation system that obviously works off of WiFi or the Internet and then connects to the products to basically giving intelligent pool system, Deane. And yes, we do believe that – you're talking about 5 million installed pools and less than 10% of them today run on some type of automation capability and that automation capability provides two opportunities, one is for dealers to remotely monitor pools and manage the proper pool for – composites for people. But the other one is for the consumer themselves to interact with their pool more effectively, lighting, variable speed pumps as you mentioned, salt water pools, the chemistry. So, we see it as a revolutionary product for sure, and this one is an easier one that creates over-the-air software updates and really has a better graphic user interface capability. And its open architecture meaning it will work not only with Pentair products, but it will also work with our competitors’ products as well, which we think is also revolutionary.
Deane Dray: Good to hear. Thank you.
John Stauch: Thank you, Deane.
Operator: Your next question comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen.
Joe Giordano: Hey, guys, good morning.
John Stauch: Good morning
Mark Borin: Good morning.
Joe Giordano: So, if we look at the other non-pool businesses, how do you feel like you are with your price increases, do you think you are forward thinking enough or were they large enough to deal with your forward expectations for inflation, how do you see that kind of playing out over the next few quarters?
John Stauch: Yes. Yes, we do – so again similar response for the other two businesses. The price kicked in, in the back half of September and the realization is consistent with expectations and it's – we see that reading out as expected in Q4. We had a little bit of pull-in in Q3 ahead of the price increase, which we had anticipated. So that reduces a little bit of the price expectation for the full-year, but overall, on a run rate basis, it's consistent with our expectations. And our views on inflation, which price was put into offset or mitigate remain unchanged as well, so you can see the full-year expectation on inflation remains about $80 million.
Joe Giordano: And then as it relates to your China strategy, have you – have your discussions at least changed a little bit to consider what's going on trade wise and geopolitically there, and do you – is there any alterations that you need to make to how you deploy that strategy?
John Stauch: It's a great question. I mean, we do about $160 million in China and Southeast Asia overall from a revenue stream and most of that in our filtration businesses. We still are committed to our China strategy primarily because they advanced in the way that the market is evolving, I mean, the rate of pace, they're going to put 3,000 new Starbucks stores in, there is a competitor coffee chain called Luckin doing 1,000 stores this year, 2,000 next year. These are some enormous growth rates. We also have the context of – we’re working with the Internet there and the way that people buy off the Internet and looking at two to three-hour delivery windows to the product. So, I think it's an area that we're going to continue to participate in, because we’re learning and growing and establishing a lot of the tools and principles that I think ultimately are going to work themselves back into Europe and into North America as well.
Joe Giordano: And then last for me, it's still early days post-split, but maybe can you – John, can you just talk about maybe what are some of the biggest changes you've seen internally so far and maybe couple of examples something that's taking over a bit longer than you'd like to move forward in the direction you see?
John Stauch: Yes, I am very impatient, so everything takes longer, but I'm very proud of the way the teams leaning in. Obviously, a great result in the quarter as evidenced by dealing with a late announcement of a tariff impact and reacting to it the best we could and managing through those expectations and we’re getting back to consistency and predictability. But what we're most excited about is we're having discussions about winning at the product line level again. We have some 30 major product lines and that's where the way you win. You differentiate your product against the competition in the customers' eyes and we're having good discussions about how to utilize technology and innovation and business model innovation to really differentiate that customer experience and that’s going to take longer time, but that’s ultimately how we are going to get back to the core organic growth that I know we can achieve.
Joe Giordano: Thanks guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
Steve Tusa: Hey, guys. Good morning.
John Stauch: Good morning, Steve.
Mark Borin: Good morning, Steve.
Steve Tusa: Just on free cash flow, you guys I think are running slightly ahead of net income, I don’t know which net income you use whether it’s adjusted or GAAP or whatever year-to-date and I think fourth quarter is usually relatively strong, anything different about this year or am I just not getting the normal seasonality right?
John Stauch: You got it, right, Steve. I mean, we are still targeting adjusted net income, cash flow to be 100% of adjusted net income and obviously we will work through the normal seasonality patterns and there is nothing really to update at this time.
Steve Tusa: And anything unusual about the performance in the third quarter that stands out, that’s not sustainable on the cash front?
John Stauch: No.
Mark Borin: Third quarter was in line with expectations and we don’t see anything necessarily unusual in the fourth quarter as well.
Steve Tusa: Okay. I don’t know if anybody asked it yet, but tariffs, just kind of give us an update on how you are thinking about that? And maybe just give us an update on – or some color remind us about your kind of sourcing structure? I think you noticed anything from China is getting it marked up, so how are you guys thinking about it into 2019?
Mark Borin: Sure, Steve. And the overall story on tariffs and inflation in general is as I mentioned before is just the consistency with our previous expectations. So, as we look at the balance of the year, our inflation expectation remains at about $80 million, that includes all the tariffs that have been announced and implemented. So, it includes sort of the people talk about lists 1, 2 and 3 in the different sections that make that up. So that’s all reflected in our expectations, so really no change from what we talked about before as we have already touched on pricing and our expectations there. And we certainly are going to continue to evaluate the overall supply chain and look for opportunities to be able to make changes to reduce the impact of tariffs long-term as those things take a little bit longer obviously, but we are certainly looking at that. We have a factory in Suzhou and so we will evaluate what we do there and how our overall supply chain structure is organized.
Steve Tusa: Yes. I guess just more specifically, I mean there you are only getting hit by part of this year and then there is other list, who knows 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 coming through, what do you see as of today assuming some of these things come through just using a kind of simplified view of what you are sourcing from China and then sticking some sort of an increase in cost on that, what would you expect that headwind in 2019 to be that you could overcome with productivity or whatever else you do?
John Stauch: Yes. So, Steve just to reiterate, the 2018 – for 2018 reflects everything that we currently get out of China including direct sourcing. When we put the pricing forward on September 15 we assume that we would likely see another couple of points of inflation heading into 2019. That is probably at least a likely scenario given the fact that we are going to continue to see inflationary pressures come from all of these lists that happened. So I think right now we feel like we have got things well contained and we can only deal with what we know, Steve and if there is anything else that comes about, we reserve the right to go back with incremental price increases.
Steve Tusa: Okay. What – sorry one last question, what is that bucket of cost that you talked about either direct or indirect coming from China?
John Stauch: What do you mean, Steve?
Steve Tusa: What is the total cost of the stuff you are sourcing from over there, so maybe we can just do the math ourselves?
Mark Borin: Think of it as roughly $300 million both direct and indirect.
Steve Tusa: Great. That’s exactly what I am looking for. Alright, thanks a lot. Great color.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets.
Scott Graham: Yes, hi, good morning. I guess I just want to piggyback a little bit on Steve’s question here, because if we look in the third quarter, the waterfall, the inflation is a $24 million number and I know you guys indicated that it’s still in line with your expectations, but the most recent lists, the most recent 2 lists were post your second quarter earnings report and the 24 million does not seem to be yet fully loaded with inflation. So, could you give us an idea is there going to be need to go out with more pricing, let’s say in pool and have your price increases in the other two segments contemplated, what could be over $100 million number next year?
Mark Borin: As we – as John referenced before, I mean, our expectations haven’t changed and the forecast that we have put forth of approximately $80 million reflects all the tariffs that have been announced and implemented which is there is nothing new that’s out there. This is the list that you are referring to even though they hadn’t been implemented and effective prior to our last quarter’s guidance, there was enough information out there that we had some visibility to that. And as John said, we frankly don’t know what we don’t know and so we reserve the ability and the right to be able to go back and adjust and go back for more price if necessary, but the guidance that we have for the year stands on its own and remains unchanged from what we provided previously.
John Stauch: Just to add, Scott, as I said I mean we have put in price increases that not only reflected our 2018 expectations for inflation, but that inflation would continue. And so we are hopeful that we have got enough in there, if not we will adjust accordingly.
Scott Graham: Okay, great. And then maybe this is a quick follow-up to that, I know that the model has been so far as an independent to sort of do the price plus productivity will offset inflation, I am just wondering you have given your answers to the above your thinking on the price increases which you have answered affirmatively that they have contemplated more inflation. Can we get to where we are price cost neutral in the first half of next year, excluding productivity just fewer price cost?
John Stauch: I don’t think so, Scott. And I think we are counting on prices, the majority of it, but we also need productivity and keep in mind our sourcing teams are active every single day seeking alternative sourcing. So we even within the inflation numbers this year have favorable productivity and you see that in the column offsetting that, but I think we are going to need productivity and we are also going to need growth contributions, Scott, I think that’s just the environment we are in right now.
Scott Graham: Got it. And if I could just squeeze one more in if you don’t mind and thank you for that answer. I was very interested in your comments, John about the surveys understanding the market which you and I have discussed before, how you are engaging consumers more, the dealer network the whole thing. I was just wondering if you can give us maybe a couple of win examples, things that you are really excited about that the team actually was able to monetize over the last quarter?
John Stauch: Yes. I think first of all, we really 3 – go across the segments. I think pool really has a great dealer intimacy. And why I mentioned the dealer, it’s the actual dealer talking to the consumer and working with the consumer. And what we are learning is that, that consumer is becoming more and more educated and as they become more and more educated we are able to create more content, because as you put your pool in or you think about your retrofits to the pool you are very excited about all of the other products that you can bring to the table. So, we are clearly getting more content through to the aftermarket and I do think that that’s a result of learning that the consumer is important in helping to influence that and stay. In infiltration, what we are learning is as you would expect, it’s not a national or global issue it’s more local. Your city and where you live, your water quality varies and obviously I have shared this with you, New York City is not a problem for water. As you start to move into other particular regions, you have challenges and getting more specific around the challenges to each region allows us to have the right products to our dealer channel to solve those issues, so very excited about your growth there. And then flow, I think we are starting to realize that we have a good brand across to what we have major brands that we are very well respected and that we need to continue to work to get those products and make those available to the end customers and we have to work through various distribution channels to do that since there isn’t a large distributor, a large dealer that covers nationally. And in China and Southeast Asia, as I mentioned, people want to buy on the Internet. They want ready-now products. They want an experience center. And I do think all of those things we’re doing in China that we’ve learned from connecting with the consumer, we’ll work that way in the North American market as well. So, thanks for asking, Scott.
Scott Graham: Thanks a lot for that answer. Appreciate it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Baird.
Mike Halloran: Hey, good morning, guys.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Mike Halloran: So, on the food and beverage side, you’re starting to see some stabilization there. Maybe just dig a little bit more granularly into what you're seeing in the market, why the stabilization is occurring, and how you're thinking about that as we move into the fourth quarter next year?
Mark Borin: Yes, sure. As we’ve talked before as that business has experienced challenges and has been shrinking for quite a while, frankly, it’s gotten to a point where it's a smaller portion of the portfolio and it's really not something that that’s going to drive our overall performance. And so it's – feel like it’s sort of hit the bottom and we’re seeing some signs of life and decent order rates. And it's something frankly that hope to not have to continue talking about because it's just a small piece of the overall picture and we’re focused on – more importantly on our residential, commercial side of the business.
John Stauch: And Mike just to remind you the market is growing and we’re growing with the market, but we have a very high value membrane and we have products that are really helpful in the overall food and beverage processing. What we are no longer doing is building the systems and the skids around them and just assembling other people's products to go forward. So that’s what really drove the decline. And we feel confident that we have a product that other people combine, assemble and put into the process and that's really where we think we should be long-term. It’s also better margins for us and better predictability and consistency as our future revenue streams. So, it was all conscious and it was all an effort that we put in this year.
Mike Halloran: Makes sense. And then on the capital deployment side, obviously, been running the buybacks through pretty aggressively last few quarters, I know balance is what you are thinking about on a forward basis, but it takes time to build the funnel backup, how are you thinking about that M&A funnel and how are you thinking about balancing the two M&A verse buybacks, obviously dividends are a core part, but that's been pretty consistent?
John Stauch: Yes, I think our first goal is get back to predictable and consistent results and I'm pleased that we are making progress on that. I think we've got three quarters now where we're starting to build that consistency and we're starting to also understand strategically where our best businesses are and how those businesses are positioned and we're really aligned not only as a management team, but with our Board of where we'd like to make those acquisitions, the tuck-ins and cores like basically bolt-ons. And so, I do think we're starting to build a really robust funnel and I really – I’m hopeful that we'll be able to get some things done over the next year.
Mike Halloran: Great. Appreciate it. Thank you.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker with UBS.
Steven Winoker: Thanks. Good morning, all.
John Stauch: Hi, Steve.
Mark Borin: Good morning.
Steven Winoker: Hey, so just on the thoughts around holding, I think you still expect ROS to be about 50 basis points up, but why not more given the additional point of growth and particularly the concentration in Aquatics. I think I – if you can just talk through the puts and takes there a little bit that explain why there's not more ROS coming in?
Mark Borin: Sure. I mentioned it earlier. As we were coming through September, we did see some pull-in to beat the price increase, so we do have slightly less price benefiting the year than we had previously forecasted. I mean, and we're continuing to see sort of the ramp in our growth investments as we move through the balance of the year. So, when you think of those two things on balance, overall, that's where we've landed at maintaining our guidance on income.
Steven Winoker: How much do you think that took away from, if you were to quantify the impact that you would have otherwise had?
Mark Borin: Well, the price change was about $3 million, $2 million to $3 million, and the investment is probably couple of million dollars.
Steven Winoker: Okay, great. And just as you guys were thinking about that growth for the fourth quarter also coming off at 6 to 4 to 5, these are exceptional growth rates. But just any thoughts on slowing mostly comps other factors here?
Mark Borin: No, I mean, part of it is as I ventured it’s the price increase acceleration that we experienced in Q3. So Q3 was higher than expected driven maybe half of that increase was driven by the pull-in to be priced, and so we don't see that continuing into the fourth quarter.
Steven Winoker: And John…
John Stauch: You’re talking about a point of – we are going from 6% to 4% to 5% on the Q4. And right now, we don’t see as you ask – we don’t see markets slowing. I mean, we still feel good. I remind you Steve you know this, but in our residential commercial businesses, this is primarily an installed base that we serve. It isn’t a new housing start really phenomenon or anything. As a matter of fact we shared this before a lot of new housing starts are actually urban, which don’t utilize our water systems as much as they do out in the rural areas. So we really just believe there is a consumer pull on demand on the aftermarket channel and we see consistency so far on those outlooks.
Steven Winoker: Great. John, that’s actually leading to my follow-up, which was within that all of this great pool growth, more than three quarters or roughly the business is usually aftermarket, I suppose. So, maybe just anyway chance you can breakdown your thoughts around how much is coming from new installation versus the existing installed base on this growth and the new product introductions are connected that you mentioned?
John Stauch: Yes. I mean, we have seen – this is general rule of thumb for that business. If you take housing starts which it’s somewhere around 1.2 million housing starts and about 10% or 11% of those are generally point pool permits. And I think it’s just the way the demographics generally work out, so think about 120,000 to 130,000 new pools, which if you really think about what that’s up versus last year, it’s not ups very much, you would be talking out single digits. So, we continually work the dealers in the installed base to convince people that more larger systems and more capability in their pool is the way for them to reduce their energy costs both in LED lighting and also the efficiencies that they can get on the variable speed pump. And then as I mentioned in my comments giving them easier ways, like their iPhone and/or remote monitoring to actually manage their pool and that’s what’s driving a lot of the content and capability and so a really growing content on the pad fairly significantly and then taking more share through our dealer channel within that growing content. That’s been our [indiscernible].
Steven Winoker: And you said converting dealers as well right?
John Stauch: Correct. Absolutely, yes.
Steven Winoker: Any percentage or any numbers around that?
John Stauch: No.
Steven Winoker: Alright. Thanks a lot.
John Stauch: Thank you, Steve.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.
Nathan Jones: Good morning everyone.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Mark Borin: Good morning.
Nathan Jones: I would like to pickup the productivity side of the price cost productivity equation, you guys had $20 million of productivity improvements in the first half, dropped to 1 in the third quarter and I think the implication is about 5 in the fourth quarter. Can you talk about the things that have driven those gains down in the back half is there comp issues, timing of projects whatever color you can shed on that?
John Stauch: Yes. So, I mean I’d start with as Mark mentioned that we are ramping up the growth investments. In the beginning of the year, we are identifying where we should place our bets working on our strategies and making sure we are all aligned. And as we went through the year, we are starting to see our innovation centers per technology certainly, our digital marketing, our consumer insights and putting more spending in first of all and that’s really what you are seeing is generally offset in the productivity, Nathan.
Nathan Jones: Okay. So growth investments count against your productivity number?
John Stauch: Correct.
Nathan Jones: Underlying that has the productivity number improved declined, stayed about the same as we have gone through the year, if you excluded the growth investments?
John Stauch: It’s improving primarily because we started the year with significant inflationary pressures on the material side as we mentioned and then we have begun to work sourcing alternatives and opportunities which tend to take time and those have started to ramp up here as we head into the back half of the year.
Nathan Jones: If you think a little bit longer time as a percentage of revenue, what kind of number would you expect to be able to get out in terms of productivity every year, is it 1 point, 2 points if we exclude growth investments from the equation?
John Stauch: I mean, it’s a question that I don’t want to dance around. I mean, in a normal environment, we would we would seek for productivity less in inflation on a gross margin basis to drive 100 to 150 basis points of expansion and then we would look to offset with somewhere around 50 to 100 basis points of growth investment that’s a normalized model. Obviously, we are not in normal times. And so I think we are still thinking we can get continued margin expansion and still invest.
Nathan Jones: And then just want to follow-up on some of these revenue numbers. I think Mark you said about half of the organic growth rate in 3Q ‘18 you thought was pull-forward from 4Q ‘18?
John Stauch: No, that’s not true, but – 
Mark Borin: Yes, and I’ll start to clarify that. Half of the beat in the third quarter, so we were higher than expected by about $10 million, about half of that came from the pull-in [Technical Difficulty]
Nathan Jones: Got it. That makes sense.
Mark Borin: Yes.
Nathan Jones: Okay. Thanks very much.
Mark Borin: Clarifying question. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Lee: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe staying on the revenue topic here for a moment just, when you think about the pool business, I know this may be tough to quantify. But can you give us some sense of how much of the strength in Aquatics was just broader volume based versus how much was maybe driven by mix of new products and increased share that’s specific to you. Just trying to get a sense for maybe what the market's underlying growth is versus how much share expansion you guys are seeing right now?
John Stauch: I mean, we think we're taking somewhere in the 1% to 2% share range and the rest would represent the market growth that we think broadly others are experiencing as well.
Brian Lee: And then when you think about the new product introductions and sort of the vitality index, if you will, as you look into next year. Is that still the same range of target share outcomes you'd be hoping for or does that start to accelerate even further?
John Stauch: I mean, if you took kind of where we are, if you take double-digit growth, we think about half of that is coming from new content ads, that we're going out and creating more content on what we call the pad. So, what used to be a pump and a filter gets expanded into the automation, gets expanded to the lighting, gets expanded to a chlorinator, saltwater pool, those types of things, and we think that adds about half of the growth, and then as I mentioned, the rest is share.
Brian Lee: Okay, that’s helpful. And then maybe just last one from me, I will pass it on. The – I guess specific to China, some of your industrial peers have alluded to weaker volumes in various end-markets and the macro recently. Can you level set us a bit on your China exposure and then how you're comping there versus maybe some of the more cautious commentary that's been starting to pop up as of late?
John Stauch: Yes, I will start with the fact that we are not as big as some of those peers. I mean, keep in mind, as I mentioned, we're $160 million total in the China and Southeast Asia region. So, we're not anywhere – some of our competitors are two times our size and those comps get harder. I also think that we are definitely growing double-digit, but we're also working through changing channels over there in China as well and making sure we're controlling our own destiny. As I said, most of the consumers want to deal directly with the Internet and then they want to connect directly with the experience center and the company themselves. And so I think our comps are a little easier from where we're starting from, but I also very excited about what the teams doing over there and I really like how we're going about winning and just the innovation and the excitement that we have for our new products and new product introductions.
Brian Lee: Okay, fair enough. Thanks guys.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jeff Hammond: Hey, good morning, guys.
John Stauch: Good morning, Jeff.
Mark Borin: Good morning.
Jeff Hammond: Hey, just on the – it looks like your divestiture number was about 2%. Is that – were there discrete divestitures in there, is that just run-off of product lines that you're ramping down and how does that look kind of into 4Q and into ‘19?
Mark Borin: Yes, that really is – there’s no new discrete divestitures there, it’s the product line exits that we have talked about previously.
Jeff Hammond: Okay. And when do we – when are we done seeing those?
Mark Borin: It completes in Q4 and survive a little bit of that in the first half of the year, but then it will lap itself.
Jeff Hammond: Okay. And then what went on with the interest expense, it was a little bit lower and how should we run rate that going forward? Thanks.
John Stauch: Well, we gave you the Q4 number.
Mark Borin: Yes, I mean, we’re still thinking around $7 million, it’s become – frankly, it's a relatively small number given our overall debt levels, and so it can bounce around a little bit really mainly driven by how much interest income we had. So that's why it was a little bit lower in Q3.
Jeff Hammond: Okay, thanks, guys.
John Stauch: Thank you, Jeff.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Drab with William Blair.
John Stauch: Hey, Brian.
Mark Borin: Brian?
John Stauch: Brian? Brian, mute button.
Brian Drab: There we go. Alright.
John Stauch: Welcome back.
Mark Borin: Good morning.
Brian Drab: Yes. My kids were running around in the background. So I forgot I pressed that button. I just have one question at this point, the aquaculture and agriculture end-markets, I don’t believe we are mentioned on the call here at least not significantly, I joined a little bit late. But what percentage of revenue roughly do those account for today and are you seeing any growth off the bottom here in ag and just any update on aquaculture, which I think has been good growth market for you?
John Stauch: Yes. I mean, it’s those two things total somewhere around $150 million of total revenue, so not really a big piece of the overall Pentair and not really worth mentioning to be honest, but I think ultimately those are cyclical markets and they have been performing well lately.
Brian Drab: Okay. I will follow-up more later then. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Walter Liptak with Seaport Global.
Walter Liptak: Thanks for taking my question and good morning, guys.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Walter Liptak: I have a question about weather. We haven’t talked about that at all in this call, but there has been a couple of big storms and I wonder about any third quarter impact and if you are seeing any pipeline for renovation pools, especially in the fourth quarter?
John Stauch: No, I will say it’s just a really thank you to our team and I am sure a lot of companies had this as well, but we do have our pool businesses in Cary, North Carolina. And I can’t thank the team enough for how they stepped in and we have lost a few days of deliveries due to the hurricane, but they were able to recover all those shipments in Q3 and did a marvelous job just protecting the plant, protecting the assets, protecting the people and then also protecting the products out, but other than that, there is no meaningful amount of revenue one way or the other that we can track to weather.
Walter Liptak: Okay. And then in the fourth quarter, track pools that were damaged by flooding pumps filters, any of that replaced?
John Stauch: Not on a real-time basis, no, I mean we usually expect and do see a little uptick in the aftermarket repair business there and we will see that in the order rate as it comes through Q4, but not able to track this specific amount.
Walter Liptak: Okay, great. And then staying in aquatics and the price increase, I wonder if you could walk us through the pricing that you guys did and the competitive situation, do your competitors pickup pricing earlier in the year and so you are just playing catch up, how would – where is your supply chain I guess versus some of your competitors?
John Stauch: We did our price increase on cycle, which was in mid-September. Our competitors did do some targeted price increases earlier for various reasons, but we chose to continue to stick with our standard timeline. We implemented 5.5% price increase and that’s been consistent with what we have communicated previously and it’s our expectations have been consistent.
Walter Liptak: Okay. Are your competitors in the same kind of supply chain situation with you where tariffs impact them and they have to react?
John Stauch: Some of our competitors have similar supply chain, some of them don’t, I mean, everybody looks a little bit different than us, but as we have talked about, it’s not just the direct impact, it’s ultimately and maybe more importantly just seeing what the indirect impact ends up being as tariff start to impact the overall pricing not just from China suppliers, but others as well.
Walter Liptak: Okay, great. Alright, thanks for taking my questions.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Vertical Research.
Brett Linzey: Hi good morning all.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Brett Linzey: So just want to talk about some of the regional growth, I mean obviously, U.S. was strong mostly driven by pool, you talked a little bit about China. Could you just maybe walk around some of the major international markets you serve and then any concern or on the pace or tenor within your European business?
John Stauch: Yes, I mean, we just generally overall you have got it, North America have been relatively strong this year, China as I mentioned has been a growth area for us. We have selectively chosen to get out of lot of geographies, which is part of the product line exits that Mark has referenced in our divestiture line, geographies, where it’s not so much a geography call, we just didn’t have scale or didn’t have the appropriate presence in those areas to compete long-term. And then Europe has not been of a robust growth environment, it’s been relatively muted most of the year. And so we don’t see that picking up in the back half of the year, but we also don’t see it declining in the back half of the year.
Brett Linzey: Okay. And then maybe just back to growth investments, I think you had previously said this year your incremental investment was around $20 million, what have you spent year-to-date, how Q3 look and then as we look into 2019 you broaden out the China and Southeast Asia strategy, does that incremental number step up 2019 versus 2018?
John Stauch: Yes, I don’t know, if we are just certainly not going to give it in detail by quarter, but for the full year, we expect still to be in that range for 2018. And I would say as we think about going forward, maybe $5 million to $10 million incremental next year is the way we are thinking about it for primarily digital investment and also our R&D and innovation activities we have identified this year, but not a meaningful step up from where we are currently.
Brett Linzey: Okay, great. I appreciate the color.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your last question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.
Jason Carr: Hi, guys. This is Jason on for Julian. Just looking at the aquatic systems demand and taking into account that the 1% to 2% of share gain is roughly consistent with the color given on Q2 backing out the demand you saw as a result of pre-buy, does this imply given the tougher year-over-year comp in Q3 versus Q2 that there was sort of a end market demand acceleration here and then what was the cadence of that demand acceleration going to the quarter? Was it stronger in September etcetera?
Mark Borin: No, I don’t think there was anything unusual about the end-market demand in the quarter, it was strong in September, but that’s not unusual and some of that was driven by the price increase timing. And when you are seeing the guidance for Q4 we don’t see a significant slowdown as we look at the Q4 run-rate and expectation on growth in pool.
Jason Carr: Understood. And just going back to the pricing increases you did – there was sort of an acknowledgment that if there was further inflation sourcing in the pipeline there would be – there would have to be pricing increases put into net that out, sort of just on the pace of those increases, what would be the lag post the acknowledgment of further inflation, i.e., like 30 to 60 days or maybe a quarter in terms of how long it would take for those pricing increases to be effective?
Mark Borin: Sure. And then maybe to clarify we said that we will continue to use price as a lever, but we didn’t say that we would have to do that in light of inflation.
Jason Carr: Right, right, sorry.
Mark Borin: To lever in and it would take approximately 90 days to get that price fully implemented. That being said, it’s also about 90 days for us to see the impact of increases from our suppliers as well. So what was the news about Q3 if you recall was the timing of the tariff announcement and the increase of that coming pretty quickly and not having the time to react.
Jason Carr: Understood. Thank you.
Operator: And presenters, did you have any closing remarks?
John Stauch: Yes, I do. So, thank you everybody for joining us today. And I hope you agree that we delivered a solid third quarter and that we are demonstrating our ability to use agility and prioritization to meet our commitments. By building up a track record of meeting and exceeding commitments, we hope to earn the trust and right to pursue a compounding strategy that allows us not only achieve core growth in earnings, but to also utilize our strong cash flow and capital structure to pursue strategic targeted and accretive bolt-on and tuck-in acquisitions. Thank you for your continued interest. Crystal, you can conclude the call.
Operator: Thank you, sir. This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, good day and thank you for standing by. My name is Lee Wei and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter 2018 Pentair Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to our host, Mr. Jim Lucas, Senior Vice President Investor Relations and Treasurer. You may begin your conference.
Jim Lucas - Pentair Plc: Thanks, Lee Wei, and welcome to Pentair's second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. We're glad you can join us. I'm Jim Lucas, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. And with me today is John Stauch, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Borin, our Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, we will provide details on our second quarter 2018 performance as well as our third quarter and full-year 2018 outlook as outlined in this morning's press release. Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties such as the risks outlined in Pentair's most recent 10-Q, Form 10-K and today's press release. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today, and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results. Today's webcast is accompanied by a presentation, which can be found in the Investors Relations section of Pentair's website. We will reference these slides throughout our prepared remarks. Any references to non-GAAP financials are reconciled in the appendix of the presentation. We will be sure to reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. I would like to request that you limit your questions to one and a follow-up in order to ensure everyone an opportunity to ask their questions. I will now turn the call over to John.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Thank you, Jim. And good morning to everyone. Please turn to slide number 4 titled Executive Summary. Overall, we are pleased with our second quarter performance, which marks the first quarter we have reported since completing the separation of nVent. Despite a slow start to the quarter, we reported core sales growth of 3%, ROS expansion of 90 basis points to 21%, adjusted EPS grew 18% to $0.71 and we generated $364 million of free cash flow. Also in the quarter, we took some of our cash flow and bought back $150 million worth of stock or about 3.3 million shares. For the full year we have maintained our core sales growth expectation of 3% to 4%, we are still expecting ROS expansion of approximately 50 basis points to 18% and we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $2.31, reflecting the benefit of purchased shares as well as slightly better operating performance, offset by slightly worse FX impact. With half of the year now behind us, we feel more confident in our ability to deliver earnings that should be above the high-end of the guidance we provided at the beginning of the year. I would now like to turn the call over to Mark to discuss the second quarter results and update you on the details of our full-year 2018 outlook.
Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc: Thank you, John. Please turn to slide 5 labeled Q2 '18 Pentair Performance. As John mentioned, core sales grew 3%, with Aquatic Systems and Flow Technologies delivering growth and Filtration Solutions declining modestly. We will provide more color on the performance of all three segments shortly. Segment income increased 8%, while ROS expanded 90 basis points to 21%. Adjusted EPS grew 18% to $0.71 per share while our adjusted tax rate remained 18% and our share count came in at 178.6 million shares, benefiting in part from the $150 million in shares we repurchased during the quarter. Free cash flow was strong in the quarter at $364 million, which was in line with normal seasonal patterns. Please turn to slide 6 labeled Q2 '18 Pentair Segment Performance. This slide lays out the performance of our three segments with trends somewhat similar to what we saw in the first quarter. Aquatic Systems delivered robust 10% core sales growth in the quarter and income grew 7%, while ROS contracted 50 basis points. ROS was negatively impacted in the quarter by growth investments and inflation as the business elected not to implement any off-cycle price increases. We continue to have a favorable outlook for Aquatics and believe the business is well positioned entering the second half of the year. Filtration Solutions saw core sales decline 2% as strength in our North American residential and commercial businesses was offset by declines in our industrial and biogas product lines in the food and beverage business. Segment income for Filtration grew 7% and ROS expanded an impressive 140 basis points to 20%. This is due in part to the business mixing up as we continued to move away from lower margin project business and further remove complexity from the segment. Flow Technologies had 2% core sales growth, segment income growth of 10% and ROS expanded 130 basis points to 18.4%. North America remains strong, driven by improvement in our commercial pump business. We saw continued strength in our specialty business. And similar to Filtration Solutions, we saw improvement as we exited or walked away from lower margin business. Please turn to slide 7 labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. This is one of our favorite slides this quarter as free cash flow was a very positive story. And the balance sheet has further improved as we reduced our debt levels with the cash received as part of the nVent spinoff. In fact, our debt is now at a level not seen since 2010. Considering our free cash flow generation expected for the remainder of the year and our current debt levels, we believe we are well-positioned to invest in the business, look at attractive strategically aligned tuck-in or bolt-on acquisition targets and continue to return cash to shareholders. We have bought back $300 million in shares year-to-date, and we would remind everyone that we have raised our dividend for 42 consecutive years. Please turn to slide 8 labeled Q3 '18 Pentair Outlook. We anticipate third quarter core sales to grow 4% to 5% in Aquatic Systems up 8% to 9%, Filtration Solutions up 1% to 3% and Flow Technologies growing 2% to 3%. Segment income is anticipated to be flat while ROS is expected to decline roughly 50 basis points. This is due principally to higher inflation, including the impact of tariffs and the timing of price increases we are implementing in the third quarter but we do not expect to fully read out until the fourth quarter. Below the line, we expect the adjusted tax rate to be around 18%, net interest and other expense to be approximately $8.5 million, and our share count should be around 177 million. Adjusted EPS is expected to be approximately $0.52 per share. Please turn to slide 9 labeled Second Half 2018 Adjusted EPS Outlook. As mentioned on the previous slide, we are seeing increased inflation across the portfolio. And as a result, we are implementing price increases in all three segments during the third quarter. We have announced the price increases and we are currently implementing them, but we do not expect to see the full benefit of the increases until the fourth quarter. As a result, we expect to see more pressure on third quarter margins but benefits in the fourth quarter. In addition, second half earnings are expected to benefit from the shares we bought back in the second quarter. While there is some anticipated shift in earnings from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, we are still raising our outlook for the full-year. Please turn to slide 10 labeled 2018 Pentair Outlook. This slide is one we first introduced at our Investor Day in February, and we wanted to provide an update at the halfway point of the year. The overall sales number is in line with our initial forecast for the year while segment income has moved up but the walk to get to each of these numbers has changed. We continue to look for core sales growth of 3% to 4% for the year with price being a little more favorable. FX has gone from appearing to be a nice tailwind to being modestly positive for the year. The right hand section of this slide has seen a significant increase in our outlook for inflation and we are now looking at $20 million of incremental growth investments, which is down from our initial target of $25 million. We are not dialing back the investments but the timing of some of the investments for this year were slower in the first half and we wanted to update our full-year forecast to reflect this revised timing. Please turn to slide 11 labeled Full Year 2018 Pentair Outlook. As previously mentioned, our full-year core sales growth outlook remains 3% to 4%. We expect Aquatic Systems core sales to grow 8% to 9%, Filtration Solutions to be flat to up 1% and Flow Technologies to increase 2% to 3%. Segment income is expected to be up around 8% while ROS is expected to end the year around 18% which would represent an increase of roughly 50 basis points. Below the line we expect a full-year adjusted tax rate to be around 18%, adjusted net interest and other expense to be roughly $33 million and shares to be around 178.5 million. For the full-year we now expect adjusted EPS to be around $2.31 per share and we continue to target free cash flow to approximate 100% of adjusted net income. I would like to turn the call back to John.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Thank you, Mark. Please turn to slide number 12 titled Pentair Strategy Summary. This page is the same slide we showed you at our Investor Day and in the first quarter earnings discussion. The good news is nothing has changed. And all I'd like to do is remind you that we are focused on our desire to be a pure play water company, drive focused organic growth strategies and utilize our precious capital wisely to create incremental shareowner value. Regarding capital allocation, we remain committed to maintaining our investment grade rating, reinvesting in our most attractive core businesses and paying a competitive dividend yield. We will also look at a balanced approach between M&A and intelligent buybacks with our M&A decisions being informed by overall valuations and the quality of assets available, as well as our ability to integrate them successfully. Please turn to slide 13 labeled Focused Strategies. As we prioritize our growth opportunities, we believe this allows us the best opportunity to drive differentiated growth in what we believe is a very attractive water quality space. I'd like to give you a quick update on our progress regarding two of our most important focused strategies. The first strategy is advancing pool growth. During the second quarter, we launched a segmentation study to better understand the behaviors of pool consumers. We believe we made great progress in winning more dealers to allow for greater aftermarket penetration and we completed an in-depth study of how to accelerate our efforts in the expanding automation space and better penetrate the automated home platforms. Also during the quarter, we launched our next generation of automation called IntelliConnect. Our second key growth initiative is accelerating residential and commercial water treatment. In the second quarter, we kicked off a consumer segmentation study here as well to better understand the residential water needs of our end-consumers and made great progress driving dealer loyalty back to Pentair through our True Blue dealer initiative. We also have included our strategic roadmap of innovative product offerings and how to expand our service offerings in both residential and commercial water treatment. More to come in these two areas, both on the organic priorities and potential acquisitions as we continue to dial-in our clear priorities to differentiate ourselves to customers. I would now like to turn the call over Lee Wei for Q&A, after which I'll have a few closing remarks. Lee Wei, please open the line for questions. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you so much. And excuse me presenters, so we have our first question, comes from the line of Scott Graham from BMO. Your line is now open.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Hey, Scott. How are you doing?
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey, John. Good morning. Hey, Jim. So, I just really – I apologize for jumping on a couple minutes late, so I missed the early. I just want to maybe ask you a broader question. I know you've talked about and I heard you at the end here say two to three years of movement toward more of a sales model involving reaching deeper and this kind of thing. I was just wondering if you can kind of give us some gates on that, John, sort of like when do you expect to be where type thing. By the end of this year with your channel partners, what do you expect to have accomplished, by the end of next year, that kind of thing? Because obviously, there's a big opportunity here to connect more closely with customers than you have before, I know that that's what you want to do. And I'm just kind of hoping you can kind of give us how this lays out, maybe if you have any type of benchmarks, any type of metrics that you use internally to measure yourselves on this end of this year, end of next year kind of thing?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: All right. Thanks, Scott. Yeah. I mean, I just want to remind everybody we're 85 days in and I think the best way to express it is we're where we thought we'd be at this stage. I think we're really excited about our strategy. But more importantly, our commercial excellence process that we've rolled out and really utilizing the commercial excellence process to drive our prioritized growth. And so, as an example, making sure that we understand that we serve a traditional dealer channel, distribution and dealers, but we also have to influence the consumer. And so, this consumer segmentation work that we're doing is to inform us of what are the buying behaviors of the consumers that we service and how do they want to be served and then, helping our dealers run their businesses better so that they can take advantage of what those consumers want. I think in the pool business where we do roughly $900 million of revenue in pool and we have about $800 million of that in the U.S., we have a lot of scale, and we have a good offering, and we have a really good business model. We have to go through our next sets of businesses which for us would be our residential and commercial water filtration, which is just under $600 million and then, also our residential pump business which is just under $400 million and we have to have that same model, Scott. So I have high expectations for the team, clearly, but to answer your metric question, it's going to be accelerated organic growth and that's the one measurement we're trying to drive here and then, making sure that's profitable, and we're getting the same drop-throughs. So we've got other metrics. How are we doing on dealer conversions, how are we doing on turning leads into sales. The earlier indications suggest we're becoming more of a growth culture. But again, I just want to be balanced here, it's 85 days in. So it's hard to call victory on it, but I love the attitude. I love the way the team leaned in, and I am really appreciative of how they're doing it. The other thing I would tell you, Scott, is as we move to a growth culture, I was proud that the team worked the price angles the way they are. I mean, we saw some of our competition going off-cycle with price increases. We considered that. But we also thought that it would be better if we were to wait, reflect, and go on our normal cycles so that our dealers and our customers can prepare for those price increases, quote their jobs and not have to suffer the consequences of us going off-cycle. So it is hurting us here a little bit in Q3, but I'd say the long haul we think that that's going to help us out in Q4 and into next year and our customer is very appreciative of the way we responded with our price increases.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Right. And as just my quick follow up to that, one of the things that you and I talked about recently was that there's going to be a cost to this and I – certainly it's a welcome cost to get more sustainable organic on a go-forward basis, particularly given your markets are pretty positive. I guess my simple question is and I heard you say this, you want to keep the same drop-through. That's obviously a key point. So are you out there internally kind of telling the business units, hey, this is kind of if you want to spend this, you have to fund it with that? Or is that more of a corporate kind of funding?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yeah. I think the funding that we're working on is the focused priorities and the two that I took you through. And most of that is more what I call enterprise funding, meaning we all know what we're spending the money on and we have ability to measure it. We're willing to do some slightly lower margin revenue. I don't think we want to just be margin focused. But at the same time, we want to make sure that as we grow our revenue, we're not adding complexity and we're making sure that that growth leads to shareowner value. And that's critical to us. I mean, we are a public company. We're here for the benefit of share owners, and we have to serve our customers in a way that's good for all.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Got it. Thank you, John.
Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc: Thank you, Scott.
Operator: Thank you so much. And your next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano from Cowen. Your line is now open.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Morning, guys.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Hey, Joe. Good morning.
Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc: Morning.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, John. Maybe if you could take us through some of the more obvious like immediately accretive things that you've done to kind of drive margins in business and like particularly Flow, like margins there look pretty good considering where the growth was. So, what are some of the things that you were able to put through very quickly that are seeing like kind of early results?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yeah. I'll hit it quickly and then Mark can chime in as well, but in Filtration it's about mix. As you know, we've had some really interesting businesses and we still have those interesting businesses, and we love the technology of those businesses. But we're a lot more focused on where we actually make money and where we should be spending our time and energy. And I think you're seeing that in the benefit there. In Flow, to Flow's credit and I really appreciate all the hard work by the team. We've introduced the optimization effort, getting out of some product lines and getting out of some geographies that were not only not making money, but constraining resources and challenging the resources of the SBU. So by being focused on these core businesses, we've actually been able to really improve the mix in both of those two businesses. And I think you're seeing that in the margin expansion in the quarter.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: And is there anything that you'd call out kind of between the 3Q and 4Q split? I mean, generally, I think those quarters for you are fairly similar in terms of margin and it looks like maybe a bit more of an acceleration into 4Q. Is it just timing of initiatives that you're putting through? Or is there anything more specific you'd call out there?
Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc: Yeah. Really the key driver of the Q4 ramp is that's when price kicks in. So price comes in at the back half of the end of Q3 and then we see it fully implemented in Q4.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: So we've publicly announced our price increases here in the last week. Those go effective mid-September-ish. For most of our businesses, that's a normal cycle by the way. And that is what Mark said, we're not getting the benefit in Q3 but we expect to receive that benefit and then some in Q4.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: And then just last for me on the Aquatic side, I mean there was obviously some fear in the market given some comments made earlier by like POOLCORP. It seems like you're – not just the numbers that you put up but the guide, it seems like you've gotten through that. Does the channel seem pretty clear? And I know POOLCORP comments for the second half seem pretty robust. Like curious as to like what your view on the channel is there? And any maybe update on some of the newer technologies in that business on the automation side and how that's progressing there?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yeah. So yeah, we just had a slow start in April. I mean weather was not as we hoped it would be. And I think the team did a really good job responding and making sure we got all the shipments and all the demand serviced in the back half of the quarter. The outlook for pool is very, very strong. And I think we're reflecting that in our current guidance and demand continues to be almost full up in that business and things are progressing nicely. As far as the new products, yeah, we got a couple really good products that we're launching. We launched a new hybrid heater and we have another version of a heater that's got a high efficiency rating. So those are two products that we've been working on for some period of time. And we're really excited by IntelliConnect, which is a lower price point. And the purpose of that is to really make sure that automation gets more penetrated across pools. The penetration rate for automation across all the 5 million pools is less than 10% right now. And we really think by raising that penetration rate gives us the ability to really upgrade our products and capabilities. What's really cool about IntelliConnect is it connects to all of the other Pentair products in Filtration and pump and Flow, which gives you the ability to control those devices. But also, and I think this is the real breakthrough, it connects to all of the products in the industry if Pentair makes it or doesn't make it within pool. And we do think that that is what's necessary to really increase that penetration rate. And then it also gives us the ability to connect with the consumer and begin to think about their experiences with Pentair versus maybe their experiences with some of our competitors in the industry today. So we're very excited by that.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks, guys.
Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you so much. And your next question comes from the line of Mr. Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey, guys. Good morning.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Good, how about you?
Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc: Morning.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: On Filtration Solutions, what was the weakness in industrial? Can you give some color on that, the projects you said were down?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yeah, food and beverage. It's in the sustainable gas area where there's a merger that's taking place. It's not yet completed and those investments have substantially stalled. And it's also on the food and beverage space regarding beer and the de-investment in some of the global breweries that are out there. That's the weakness.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then just more specifically. I'm not sure, I might have missed this. But what is now kind of the guidance on price/cost for the year?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Meaning?
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Price/cost like material inflation versus pricing?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yes. So it's in the slide, Steve, I'll point it out to you. So full-year, we're getting $0.19 of price and our inflation is $0.35. It's on slide 9.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: And about two-thirds related to material and about a third of that being related to – no, I'm sorry what is it? A third to two-thirds?
Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc: Two-thirds of it is material and a third of it is labor.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And as far as the timing of these price increases, I mean, have you already kind of gone out with some of these early in the third quarter here or is it more kind of back-end loaded?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: I shared that too Steve. We went out with everything (00:24:03) so far, but they're not effective until mid-September, and that's why we're...
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Got it.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: ... getting (00:24:08) slightly in Q3 and then, we expect to have more of a benefit in Q4 related to those price increases.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Great.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Real quick, Steve. I shared this – I think it was important that we – we listen to the channel. We listen to our customers. And our customers were asking for non-off-cycle because they're out there with quotes, especially in the pool industry, you're quoting six to nine months ahead of time. We just didn't feel it was right for them to absorb that price without having a heads up that it was coming. So we feel that this is giving 60 days' notice. Is what's appreciated by the channel, and I'm proud of the team for bringing that forward and for us exercising these price increases in a way that everybody can get behind.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: I mean, is your competition not putting price through like – I mean, in HVAC, they didn't really seem to have that kind of problem of conditioning the channel. They went with kind of a mid-season – unusual mid-season price increase. Is there something going on in the industry that kind of drove that kind of behavior? I mean, it's just a little unusual to kind of ask your customers and then oblige when they say that they don't want a price increase.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yeah. I mean, they didn't say they didn't. The issue is, I mean, it's any job that was quoted – and I do know the industry you're referring to, that's more of a break and fix and other than the new construction jobs that they're working. But if you're installing a pool for instance and you quoted a customer, those price increases coughing (00:25:41) off-cycle are coming completely out of your pocket. You're not passing that along. If you have the ability to know that price increase is coming and even those significant price increases we're going forward with, you at least have the ability to know how to quote your next set of jobs and you're not losing on the job you originally have. So I don't know about the HVAC industry. We're not in it but for our industries we think we did it the appropriate way.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. So, just a different industry dynamic. All right. No problem. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you so much. And your next question comes from the line of Mr. Deane Dray from RBC. Your line is now open.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Good morning.
Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc: Good morning.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey, I'd like to start with Mark and get some perspective on the free cash flow this quarter which was significantly above expectations. I think part of it, the explanation is both we should be looking at this as a first half as opposed to a second quarter. And aren't we also now seeing the Pentair as a water pure play in the pool sort of the build of inventory in the first quarter and then that gets – comes through in the second quarter. I just want to make sure that's – we're just seeing the seasonality to this and is it a first half comparison is more appropriate. Thanks.
Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc: Sure. That's right. You kind of answered the question there. A couple things, one what we're seeing now is Pentair on its own with nVent in discontinued operations. And that includes the cash associated with the separation in discontinued operations. So what you see in our numbers is the continuing operations which is really reflective of the ongoing business. And as you said, the pool business really has that big seasonal cash influx in the second quarter at the end of the second quarter. So, on a year-to-date basis, we're at about $160 million. And then we see – to get to the 100% of net income which is about $410 million, that will be a little bit more ratable in the back half. Think of it as $125-ish million per quarter to round out the year. But yes, felt very good about – with the cash that came in in the quarter and where we are on a year-to-date basis.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it. And then just shifting back to the price increase and price/cost, just a couple clarifications. The first being wouldn't it make – first of all, I get why you're not – you didn't put the – go off cycle with pricing, and that makes sense to us. But the idea here is wouldn't you maybe get some pull forward as you had some dealers doing some pre-buy ahead of the price increase and wouldn't that benefit the tail end or benefit third quarter more? So, that question and then what's the impact of tariffs and how have you calibrated that?
Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc: Sure. So, maybe first just on the timing of the price increase. So, as John referenced, we announced it last week effective middle of September. And to clarify, the normal cycle of price increases is mid-September for the pool business. The other businesses are typically the beginning of the year. So, in fact, the timing of the increase in the Flow and Filtration side was accelerated for the very reasons that we talked about. And so, as we said, that will start to pick up at the end of September and then be fully in our Q4 numbers.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Tariffs?
Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc: Oh, and tariffs – sorry. Thank you. Tariffs are included in our number. And frankly, the reason why we're not breaking those out separately is we really think of tariffs as just a form of inflation. And when you look at the direct impact, that's not really the most significant piece. What we're really looking at is the indirect and the indirect-indirect, so trying to make assumptions around what do we think is going to be passed through to us, and really what are other suppliers that may not be impacted by China, how are they going to use that as an opportunity potentially to raise price to us. So, we factored all of that into our inflation assumptions for the back half of the year and for next year as we think about the price increase that we put in place here now. And we're going to stay agile and continue to look at things as they develop. And as I said, because this was off cycle in Flow and Filtration, if we need to re-evaluate further, we certainly have the ability to do that.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it. And then last question is we had the opportunity a couple weeks ago to meet with Pentair at Singapore Water Week and then in Shanghai to see your big commercial beverage customer. And just reflecting what your opportunities are in China and Asia-Pacific., John, under focused strategies, it looks like maybe it didn't fit on the page, but there was a third priority earlier in your outlook that talked about the China opportunity in Asia-Pacific broadly. So, if you can just bring us up to date on that. Appreciate it.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yeah. Still a very important priority, it's more longer term. As you know, Deane, it's $160 million in China, Southeast Asia today, and we think it can grow at a very significant rate. And as you probably saw and I really appreciated you spending the time out there, we got to control our own destiny, especially around the Internet and the fact that we have to think of MSRP or list price and then work back off of that and really understand Tmall and JD.com and make sure that we've got our capabilities and we're controlling our own destinies around that. So, in the near term, I would expect a little bit of disruption as we start to manage a lot of that product descriptions and how we want to demonstrate our products in the marketplace and control the consumer and the customer experience. But in the long run, we're very excited about our growth opportunities there and really are excited about the market and our ability to serve it. We do have the right products, I think we're well-positioned, especially around food service and I'm really proud of the way the team is leaning in and driving those results. Thanks for bringing that up.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. Appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you so much, Mr. Dray. Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Steven Winoker from UBS. Your line is now open.
Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks and good morning. And John, congrats on the first quarter as a standalone. That's great.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Thank you, Steve. A lot of work went into it as you know.
Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC: I do. I do. I just want to first hit on the capital deployment comment that you made in light of debt levels also coming down fairly quickly here. As you look at those priorities at this point and we look at the share repo et cetera, is that – should there be an expectation in the investment community that given the pipeline and given where you are in sort of building the standalone right now, that the repurchase could accelerate even further?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: No, Steve. I think first of all, we did. We did buyback some stock and I think we want to be agile with our capital allocation strategy. And if we see an opportunity or we feel that we're not – the value we think we could drive is not properly reflected the market. I think we're going to use our capital in that way. At the same time, I do think we have the ability to really build some great businesses here and we want to continue to build out those funnels and those pipelines of opportunities. And as those opportunities become more and more realistic, we want to be able to act upon them and then integrate them in a way that the shareowner benefits significantly from. So we're active. We're looking. We're encouraged by the direction of the funnel right now and the potential discussions that didn't seem likely six months ago and now we're starting to see more discussions happen as I think some of these owners of these properties looking forward and it might not feel as robust to them on a look-forward basis as it did just three months ago before there was maybe global supply chain challenges, to use a fancy word there. But I think the opportunity in front of us, Steve, is great. And I want to be flexible with our capital and use it in the shareowners' best interest.
Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Well, I was going to ask about Aquatics but given that answer, if you look at Filtration and Flow Control versus Aquatics on the M&A pipeline that's out there and given the levels of consolidation globally and all of that, I mean, should we expect activity on the Filtration side more, the Flow or how are you thinking about that?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: I think we should look at it as water filtration is our second biggest business next to pool and it's a business that's definitely worth investing in. I think some of the themes about getting closer to our consumer, meaning how do we connect through automation and how do we maybe connect through the services realm are a couple themes that we would think are likely to occur as we build out the M&A pipeline, Steve.
Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. And just one other question or clarification maybe for Mark is on that tariff answer that you gave, does that mean in the pricing increases that you've already taken that you are contemplating sort of the 301 tariffs but nothing further at this point? Because it was a little unclear to me sort of which part of the tariffs you were already kind of baked in that the current price announcement that you've talked about cover, versus some of the ones that are maybe, I don't want to use the word – that are still uncertain that are out there?
Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc: Yeah. So our price and our view of inflation overall is reflective of all of the tariff information that's currently out there, whether it's actually enacted or not. And frankly, the second or the third round or the most recent round that was announced a few weeks ago has very little impact to us. But we did take a look at that and feel that we have that covered, but again, very small dollars.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Steve, at some point, we'll be having tariffs on all of everything that we get out of China, right, there's very little left to tariff for.
Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. All right. Very helpful, guys. Good luck. Thanks.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you so much. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Lee from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just had one, most of mine have actually been covered. But on the guidance specifically, Mark, here, you're moving around the sales growth outlook for Aquatics and Filtration quite a bit here. And then you're also coming off a quarter where ROS beat by a pretty healthy margin. So wondering why there's no change here to the full-year ROS views across the board and by segment? And I guess curious, is that some conservatism for the back half given some moving pieces around price/cost and mix, but particularly for Aquatics given the better growth expectation here, was wondering how you're thinking about the ROS targets here through the back half of the year? Thanks.
Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc: Yeah. Sure. As I said in my remarks, the numbers themselves are pretty similar but the way we get to the numbers are quite a bit different. So it is some of the things that you mentioned. As we talked about Q3 with inflation kicking in and the impact of tariffs coming in, but price not yet being there. That's really the biggest driver of why, as you look at margins across the three businesses and overall, why they tend to not be expanding as much as you might otherwise think. And then we see that ramp and improve a little bit in Q4. And we're continuing to invest, so I talked about the fact that in the first half, the timing and the pace of our growth investment was a little bit lower than what we had originally planned. But we're still very committed to investing for growth. And in the back half of the year, we were maintaining the growth investments in those key parts of the business that we think we have the biggest opportunities.
Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: All right. Thanks a lot. That's all I had.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Thank you.
Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you so much, Mr. Lee. And your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones from Stifel. Your line is now open.
Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Morning, everyone.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Morning.
Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc: Good morning.
Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: John, you talked a little bit about exiting some low-margin revenue, I think, particularly in Filtration at the moment, but you've also talked about opportunities to do that in Flow. Can you guys comment just a little bit on what potentially the drag to your core sales growth numbers for fiscal 2018 are from voluntary exit of some of this revenue so we can get maybe a little bit of a better idea of what core sales growth really is?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yeah. That's all – just to be clear, all of that is being handled in the divestiture, right, so it's about...
Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc: About a point.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: About a point. About just shy of $40 million for the year.
Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So those – the Filtration targets of 0% to 1% and Flow 2% to 3% are actually independent of those exited product lines?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: That is correct.
Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Productivity goal for the year, I think is about $28 million. I know you guys had been disappointed in 2017 with productivity, though I think a lot of that resided in nVent. Is that a number that you can see accelerating as we go through 2019? Is it a number you're happy with? You think that can be improved? Or just any color you can give us on future productivity expectations?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Sure. One thing I'd remind you is that the productivity that's reflected, it's on page 10 of the presentation. That doesn't include the $20 million of growth investment, so it's really something closer to $50 million. But that said, we certainly think that there remains opportunities to get after further productivity. And as we've talked about before, that $20 million will then be embedded in the underlying numbers of the business. So it'll still be there for continued investment in the future but it won't be a year-over-year headwind.
Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Are there specific initiatives that you're looking at at the moment to improve productivity?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yeah, I mean, I think we're – and just to remind you, I mean, productivity is also – and think about OCOGS, right, or manufacturing efficiency. We've got higher freight cost going through which we're working on those elements as well. And I think that we feel that we have a path to accelerate our organic growth and we're going to get that leverage on top of the existing facilities. But if you look longer term, I mean automation is a theme, more intelligent factories is a theme, I mean we've got a lot of things we're working on, Nathan. But as far as large cost out initiatives or incremental restructuring, we'd like to say that that's generally behind us.
Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you so much. And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital. You may now ask your question.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Hey, Jeff.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey. Thanks, guys.
Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc: Good morning.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Just to be clear on the investment. So I think you were saying $25 million and now you're saying $20 million? So, it's pretty de minimis what the deferral is?
Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc: That's correct. Yeah.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then just on Filtration. I know you cited the industrial project weakness but it just seems like in a pretty good global demand environment, growth still seems to be problematic, anemic. So, what do you need to see to kind of start to see better growth within that business?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yeah. So, just to be clear, we have an industrial filtration business within Filtration Solutions as well. And that's doing really well, obviously with the recovery of oil and gas and a lot of the global manufacturing. It's specifically the piece exposed to the food and beverage which is beer, Jeff, and also our sustainable gas offerings that also go into that industry via a couple gas management companies that are in the process of a merger. So, that's where we're really seeing that headwind. And yeah, what do we need? We need to make sure that the residential and commercial portfolio, which is done well, continues to become a higher percentage of the revenue. It continues to grow at a rate greater than it's currently growing today. So, it's the focus within the portfolio and I think the focus is help margins. You're not yet seeing that on the core growth in Filtration. We understand that and we got to get that going.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And anything in food and beverage that would indicate that starts to get better or are these gas management companies indicating that they would be picking back up into 2019?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Only in the sense that if you think about where those projects are in the whole scheme of things, you're looking at about $30 million, $40 million right now, right? So, as a percentage of the overall portfolio it's come down substantially. But it's not necessarily – I mean you take the worst case scenario of that and you'll see it's not that much of a headwind going forward.
Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc: So, the headwinds that we saw on the first half of the year we don't anticipate continuing in the back half of the year mainly because of the comps and because as John said, the business has shrunk to a point that it's a lot smaller, so.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then just back on Aquatic I don't know if I missed this, did you see any pre-buy impact or just maybe talk about sell-in versus sell-through?
Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc: No, no change in the normal buying habits and process. No increase in any kind of early buy or timing of orders. So, a pretty normal process in the sell-through, sell-through was strong.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Thank you, Jeff.
Operator: Thank you so much, Mr. Hammond. And your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Your line is now open.
Ronnie Weiss - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. This is Ronnie Weiss on for Julian. Good morning.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Hey, Ronnie. Good morning.
Ronnie Weiss - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I know you don't want to get into 2019 guidance yet, but back on the growth initiatives but...
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Definitely not.
Ronnie Weiss - Barclays Capital, Inc.: ...back on the growth initiatives, as I think about them being pushed out, should we think about these growth initiatives being a multiyear initiative? And given the volume is a little lighter than initially expected, could we see acceleration into that into next year or 2018 is the peak of what you guys are going to be putting into that?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: No. I mean, we set out to spend around $25 million and we knew that it would be tough to spend it all wisely given the fact that we ratably didn't get there in Q1. So, what we're doing is really reflecting where we think the full-year spend will likely be. We're running these ideas and we're a lean company which is a process rich, but we also want to be a growth culture which is much more innovative. But innovative ideas still have to run through a standard process and you have to test these ideas and we're doing that and to – before we launch a brand new product for instance, we'd like to have consumer feedback on it. That takes time. And so, we're gathering that consumer information and deciding if consumers actually want what we think they want. And once we have that, we move on to the next phase and move on to the next phase. So, yeah, do we expect to ramp this a little bit next year? Probably, as far as investment. But as Mark said, we've ramped $20 million incremental this year. If you put it on a scale next year, maybe it's $5-ish million incremental, maybe it's $10 million. So, you're still going to have a ratable impact that's positive next year as part of the year-over-year investment there. So, I'm not worried about it.
Ronnie Weiss - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Understood. And then, you guys mentioned some mix benefit for Filtration. I'm just wondering if you could quantify how much of a margin uplift that was for the quarter and kind of how much it should be for the year.
Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc: Yeah. Benefit is on the income side about a point, point and a half.
Ronnie Weiss - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks, guys.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you so much. And your next question comes from the line of Brian Drab from William Blair. Your line is now open.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Thank you. Most of my questions have been answered but I just wanted to get clarification on the pricing. I know there has been a lot of questions on pricing. But in terms of the three business segments, which price increases are going through on cycle versus off cycle, and when is the normal cycle for those price increases to go through? I know, Mark, you mentioned some were accelerated. Can you just clarify that?
Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc: Sure. And so, the Aquatic Systems business is – always follows the pool season, which is September to September. So, those price increases are normally in the September timeframe. It's the other two businesses that for the most part within the business the normal timeframe would be the beginning of the year. So, early January would be the normal timeframe. So, those two with the announcement here in July with an effective target of mid-September have been accelerated.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: And just to clarify my point there, we're hopeful we're going forward with one, that reflects what we need in 2019 as well, and we're doing that in mid-September, as Mark said. And so, that's hopeful that this stays as the pricing necessary and that those businesses can get on with that expectation in their forecast and our customers can react to that in the appropriate way.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. And then just a last quick one is on slide 7, 2018 forecast D&A of $183 million. I think I just need to think about this more, but $21 million in D&A in the second quarter. How do we get to $183 million for the year? I assume that has to do everything with the split but...?
Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc: I'd say good catch. Wrong number. We'll update it. It's $90-ish million for the full year.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yeah. Yeah.
Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc: Yes.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you so much. And your last question comes from the line of Walter Liptak from Seaport Global. Your line is now open.
Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask – we've talked a lot about Aquatics but I wanted to ask about market share gains. It sounds like with a more focused strategy that you may be gaining market share. This 9.5% growth is pretty good. I wonder if you could help us understand what was market growth, what was market share gains.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: I mean, we're estimating that we call it incremental penetration or differentiated growth is probably somewhere around 1.5 to 2 points and the rest would reflect the general volume and the price that we're getting.
Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Okay. Good. Right. And so there was some price in there. Can you split that out volume versus price?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: I think it was – oh we don't do that. No, just price is just about under a point.
Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Okay. Great. And then in the restructuring charges, it looks like you're done with the charges now year-to-date. And I wonder if you can help us to understand what the restructuring charges were for. Is that part of the productivity benefits that you're already receiving or is that going to show up in the back half? You talked a little bit about productivity already, I wonder if this is part of that productivity that you're talking about?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Sure. The restructuring is really the – it's the end of the program that we started last year and into this year associated with the separation of the businesses and optimizing the portfolio as we were standing up the standalone water business. A lot of that relates to some of the business exits and the product line exits that we've talked about. So those are underway and certainly, we would expect we'll drive further productivity as we move into 2019.
Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you so much, ladies and gentlemen. Presenters, there are no further questions at this time. You may continue.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Thank you. So thank you for joining us today, and I hope you agree that we delivered a solid second quarter, and we're demonstrating our ability to use agility and prioritization to meet our commitments. By building up a track record of meeting and exceeding commitments, we hope to earn the trust and right to pursue a compounding strategy that allows us to not only achieve core growth in earnings but to also utilize our strong cash flow and capital structure to pursue strategic, targeted and accretive acquisitions. Thank you for your continued interest. And Lee Wei, you can conclude the call.
Operator: Thank you so much, presenters. And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.

Randy Hogan: Thanks, Jim. And good morning, everyone. We’re very pleased to report that Pentair started 2018 on a very positive note with solid core sales growth in both of our reported segments, Water and Electrical, and also strong segment income and adjusted EPS growth. The next two slides are standard presentations reported results in the balance sheet. But given the expected imminent separation of the Water and Electrical businesses, we wanted to concentrate on this particular call on a new Pentair where the water business excluding electrical. Before I turn the call over to John and Mark to discuss the first quarter water results in the outlook for the remainder of 2018 for the new Pentair, I wanted to provide an update on the planned separation of electrical for nVent. As you may have seen earlier this week, nVent began to trade on a when issued basis. nVent has its management team and board in place and there will be a separate call following this one to discuss the results and outlook as Jim just said. This is the last earnings call for Pentair as it is constructed today. It's also my last earnings call. For over half a century Pentair has gone through many changes and the results have been stronger company with successful long-term track record. While our history has been around transformation and create shareholder value, we're excited for Pentair’s next chapter, as we create two industry leading, pure-play companies in Water and Electrical. I believe the excellent performance in the first quarter demonstrate the quality of both these businesses. For the consolidated company overall sales grew 7% and were up 4% on a core basis. Segment income of $211 million represented 13% growth and adjusted EPS of $0.88 per share was up 35% versus the comparable period a year ago and was a full nickel [ph] above the high end of our first quarter guidance. Thus, both companies have a strong foundation from which to build. And I feel confident that both companies have strong leadership in place to drive more shareholder value and they focus on their respective strategies. It's been my honor and privilege to lead Pentair for the last 17 years and I feel that Pentair and nVent will continue to be successful under John and Beth’s leadership. I'll turn the call over to John, who will focus on first quarter Water segment performance and the outlook for the full year for the new Pentair.
John Stauch: Thank you, Randy. Not only for your 17 years or 68 quarters of distinguished leadership as CEO, but also thank you for the opportunity to lead the new Pentair. Please turn to slide number eight, titled New Pentair Executive Summary. As a reminder, Mark and I will be discussing the results, outlook and strategies for the new Pentair or the Water business, excluding Electrical. We reported core sales growth of 4% with all three of our businesses contributing. Return on sales showed solid expansion of 180 basis points to 16%. For the full year for the new Pentair, we have narrowed our guidance to core sales growth of 3% to 4%, ROS expansion of approximately 50 basis points to 18% and adjusted EPS is now expected to be $2.25 to $2.30 as our strong start to the year gives us confidence to raise the lower end of the range. I would now like to turn the call over to Mark to discuss the first quarter results and update you on our full year 2018 outlook.
Mark Borin: Thank you, John. Please turn to slide nine, labelled Q1 ‘18 New Pentair Performance. Core sales grew 4% with Aquatic Systems leading the way with 8% percent growth Filtration Solutions core sales increased 4% and Flow Technologies core sales grew 2%. Segment income was up 21%. And as John mentioned previously, return on sales expanded to 180 [ph] basis points to 16%. Please turn to slide 10, labelled Q1 ‘18 New Pentair Business Performance. We wanted to give some additional color on how all three of our business has performed in the quarter. We expect that these three businesses will be our reporting segments after the separation. Aquatic Systems despite a tough year-over-year comparison delivered 8% sales growth, driven by strong demand for existing and new products in addition to continued dealer gains Filtration Solutions saw 9% overall sales growth and core sales grew 4%. The strength within the core residential and commercial offerings, as well as China, but equally important we saw stabilization in our industrial businesses. Segment income grew dramatically and ROS expanded significantly as we improved in many of our cost actions last year to remove complexity in the business are reading through. Flow Technologies grew its top line 5% with core sales up 2%. This marked the second consecutive quarter of core growth for Flow Technologies. Segment income grew 17% and ROS expanded over 150 basis points to 16.1%. Specialty sales, principally precision spray enjoyed strong growth in the quarter. We also saw continued gains in North America and further stabilization in our long cycle backlog. Please turn to slide 11, labelled 2018 New Pentair Outlook. Given the solid start to the year, we wanted to update the revenue and segment income walks that we provided in our Investor Day in February. We raised our core growth outlook for the year to a range of 3% to 4% which moves the bottom end of the range up a point. FX is providing a little bit more of a tailwind than we originally anticipated, but we are also exiting a few countries and product lines, as you can see on the left hand side of the slide. Our expectations for segment income in ROS have also improved following the strong start to the year. We are seeing some more inflation headwinds, but the better top line growth and productivity give us confidence in healthy ROS expansion even as we make the previously mentioned $25 million of incremental growth investments this year. Please turn to Slide 12, labelled Q2 ‘18 New Pentair Outlook. We anticipate second quarter core sales to grow 3% to 4%, with Aquatic Systems up 7% to 8%, Filtration Solutions up 1% to 2% and Flow Technologies growing 2% to 3%. Segment income is anticipated to be up approximately 5% and ROS relatively flat as the aforementioned growth investments accelerate. Below the line, we expect the tax rate to be around 18%, adjusted net interest and other expense to be approximately $8 million and our share count should be around 181 million. Adjusted EPS is expected to be $0.67 to $0.69 per share. In addition we see free cash flow improved sequentially and be in line with historical seasonal trends. Please turn to slide 13, labelled Full Year 2018 New Pentair Outlook. As mentioned previously, we now expect full year core sales to grow 3% to 4%, while our outlook for Filtration Solutions is unchanged at 2% to 4%, we have tightened the range on Aquatic Systems and now expect 5% to 6% core sales growth and Flow Technologies to grow 1% to 2%. Segment income is expected to be up around 8%, while ROS is expected to end the year around 18% percent, which would represent an increase of roughly 50 basis points. Below the lines, full year tax rate will be around 18%. Net interest and other expense to be around $33 million, and shares will be around 181 million. For the full year, we expect adjusted EPS to be $2.25 to $2.30 per share. And we continue to target free cash flow to approximate 100% of adjusted net income. I would like to turn the call back to John for more on the new Pentair strategy.
John Stauch: Thank you, Mark. Please turn to slide number 14, titled The New Pentair Strategy Summary. This is slide that we introduced at our Investor Day in February that was designed to frame our vision for the new Pentair and prioritize our path to achieving our vision. As you can see on the left hand side of the page, we want to be the leading Residential & Commercial water treatment company. While we are organized around three businesses that we expect to be our reporting segments after the planned separation, roughly 80% of our sales of the Residential & Commercial verticals. From a geographical standpoint, we are more weighted toward the U.S. today, but we see opportunities in other parts of the world, particularly China and Southeast Asia. The middle section of the page starts with who we plan to be, a pure-play water company with healthy profitability and strong cash flow, and with annual sales of approximately $3 billion. The next areas are focused strategies, which I'll expand on in the next slide, but want to spend a moment discussing. Historically we have sometimes been distracted by doing too many things and trying to be everything to everybody. We believe focus is the key to driving long-term sustainable and predictable growth. While all of our businesses have a purpose, we have identified three key areas to focus on, advanced pool growth, accelerate residential & commercial filtration and expand in China & Southeast Asia. We intend to accelerate investments and efforts in both digital transformation and technology innovation, focused on the end consumer to accelerate these three prioritized growth strategies. Our foundation of win right values and our Pentair integrated management system gives us the tools to successfully and continuously deliver for our customers and our shareholders. The right hand side is an abbreviated look at our long-term value proposition, that starts with serving markets that are growing and focusing on driving differentiated growth and ultimately looking for tuck-in and bolt-on M&A to augment the organic opportunities. Regarding capital allocation, we remain committed to maintaining our investment grade rating, reinvesting in our most attractive core businesses that pay a competitive dividend yield. We will also look at a balanced approach between M&A and intelligent buy backs with our M&A decisions being informed by overall valuations and the quality of assets available, as well as our ability to integrate them successfully. Please turn to slide 15, labelled Focused Strategies. This is an important slide and one that I wanted to spend a moment on because this is how we plan to drive differentiated growth and hopefully be a top tier growth performer. We spent a lot of time looking at our portfolio over the past nine to 12 months and identifying the most attractive opportunities for growth and that is how we arrived at these three focused strategies. The first area is to advance pool growth. Our Aquatic Systems business has a great track record of high single digit core growth. And while the business has been successful, we believe that some incremental investments can make their growth rate even better. The two areas that we have identified are expanding our aftermarket product offering and increasing our position in a fast growing automation space. There are roughly 5 million in ground pools in the U.S. and the aftermarket and upgrade market continues to make up nearly 80% to 85% of all pool product equipment sold and used by pool owners. There is significant opportunity remaining to grow both base content and upgrades. Over a decade ago, we revolutionized pool pumps by introducing variable speed technology. A decade later, variable speed pumps still are only 20% penetrated, leaving ample room for continued growth. In addition, there are many other energy efficient products in areas like, lighting, heating and cleaning that we believe have significant runway for growth. Our investments will include technology upgrades, digital marketing campaigns, incremental sales resources and dealer tools, as well as working on value propositions and alternative channel support. Our second focused growth strategy is to accelerate residential & commercial filtration. We are a leader in residential water treatment components today and we have an opportunity to capitalize on increased water quality awareness globally, both in homes and restaurants, where we are developing innovative products and engaging consumers. We see opportunities to enhance dealer loyalty similar to what we have done successfully in our pool business. The majority of water treatment dealers are not affiliated by brand and we see an opportunity to drive higher demand of our products through a loyal dealer network. As we build out our value proposition for dealers and consumers, we believe we can generate the same type of loyalty that we have achieved in the pool business. Investments in this focused growth area will include branding, refresh value propositions, selling tools for our partners and technology advances that utilize smart capabilities. The final focused growth strategy is to expand China and Southeast Asia. While water quality is an issue globally, we have purposefully focused on China, as we have a strong presence to build from and our brand is well known. We see opportunities in both the residential and the commercial space. For consumers in China our biggest opportunity is building out our portfolio and creating products that consumers in China are demanding. On the commercial side, we have a strong presence with our global customers that have expanded to China and we have also developed many new customers through entry level food service offerings. As we increase our local manufacturing, we see opportunities to further expand our customer base outside of the Tier 1 cities and into Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, as well as expanding rapidly in the Southeast Asia. As we prioritize our growth opportunities, we believe this allows us the best opportunity to drive differentiated growth in what we believe is a very attractive water quality space. I would now like to turn the call over to Angie for Q&A, after which I will have a few closing remarks. Angie, please open the line for questions. Thank you.
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
Steve Tusa: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Randy Hogan: Morning, Steve.
Steve Tusa: Congrats on getting through the - getting to this point of the spin. Just on the free cash, you know anything in there that was related to the separation? I mean, it was - you know, it's usually - first quarter is usually weak, but it was definitely a little weaker than I was expecting?
John Stauch: Yes, Steve. Certainly there is some in there in the first quarter related to separation and then you know, comparing to last year, we were down a little bit, but really when you look at it historically around down $150 million - is a little bit more of the norm. So last year was a little bit better than normal this year, is a little bit more in line with historical levels. And you know, we're not seeing any major concern through the remainder of the year with respect to hitting the target of 100% of adjusted net income.
Steve Tusa: How much in there was from the spend from - I notice you know, working capital is particularly weak, what was in there from the spend exactly. Can you quantify that?
John Stauch: Yes. $20 million, $30 million probably now and then there'll be more of that, that will have additional separation related cash outflows in the second quarter as well.
Steve Tusa: How much?
John Stauch: Another $20 million to $30 million.
Steve Tusa: Okay. On the Ops, on price costs, you talked about a little more inflationary pressure. Can you maybe talk about what you're doing to perhaps offset that and you know, how the channel is saving [ph]
John Stauch: We've got a strong funnel of material productivity actions that the team's been building and there's a high level of confidence that through the remainder of the year, through the productivity actions we'll be able to offset that increased inflation. So we still view productivity and price offsetting inflation…
Steve Tusa: Okay. And then one…
John Stauch: If you look at water quality real quickly, on the full year you'll notice that inflation is slightly higher than when we gave our guidance in February. And also though embedded in there productivity is a little better and then just assuming the productivity column and we might have a little contingency as we work through the rest of the year.
Steve Tusa: And then John, I think you guys bought back some stock in the quarter, was that you know, how do we think about the next kind of nine months as far as your capital allocation priorities. And then also interest is a little bit higher and anything going on there in that, that's it?
John Stauch: Yeah. So we bought 150 back in the quarter and we think that was prudent. And you know, as we look forward I mean, as we mentioned, first of all we want to drive the cash and we do think we're a strong cash generator and then we want to continue to work on organic growth and maintain investment grade. And then really choosing wisely between you know, incrementally more buybacks or doing tuck-in acquisitions and that's how we think we can drive value and our capital is precious and we want to use it wisely.
Randy Hogan: And Steve, on the on the interest question, we did see - for the full year we've increased the estimate for interest expense, think of that is higher interest rates. The timing of when we'll use or be able to use the dividend back from nVent in the separation to pay down our existing debt and then its really just you know, the imprecision in our original estimate as we were trying to balance all the moving pieces as we were heading into separation.
Steve Tusa: Great. Thanks a lot guys.
Randy Hogan: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jeff Hammond: Hey, good morning, guys.
Randy Hogan: Morning, Jeff.
Jeff Hammond: So just on capital allocation, can you one, just talk - I mean, you mentioned investment grade, but what you think the right leverage profile is for the company and how fast you think you get there through bolt-on M&A and buy backs? And just on the M&A the pipeline, can you just talk about how you’ve been building the funnel, where the opportunities lie and kind of how those align with what you talked about, John on the focused strategies? Thanks.
John Stauch: Yeah. I mean, it is long-term, I mean you know, 2 to 2.5 times leverage is you know, probably the appropriate place to be, but we're no rush to get there. We’ll be slightly under levered. And I think we want to continue to focus on organic growth capabilities and preserve and manage our potential funnel focused on areas that have historically organically grown, which you know for us is our Aquatic Systems business. And you know just continue to add value where we can. So I think - you know, I think for modeling purposes that's a good place to be, but I wouldn't certainly think we feel any urgency to get immediately up to that level. Right now I think we're really encouraged by the work we're doing to build the growth culture internally. These three strategic priorities have really got the focus of the organization and we're getting good tack and execution plans are below them and I think we're all excited about the opportunity that we can drive an organic growth.
Jeff Hammond: Okay. And then just back on price cost, can you just talk about any - you know, what price actions you've taken, what you've announced, maybe across the different businesses to kind of get to that one point of price for the year? Thanks.
Randy Hogan: Jeff. I mean, the price actions that we've taken so far this year, nothing out of the ordinary. So it would be our normal activities that we would do heading into the season and I mean, have not done anything unusual that those actions have been taken and really nothing planned incrementally going forward. I mean, just to the inflation that you see there is a combination of wage inflation and also material inflation and you know, wage inflation was a little larger this year and the material inflation you know, we're working on to offset that with productivity as Mark mentioned earlier and you know, right now we're not overly concerned about it as we look forward.
Jeff Hammond: Great. Thanks, guys.
Randy Hogan: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets.
Scott Graham: Good morning, all.
Randy Hogan: Hey, Scott.
Scott Graham: So what does price cost, if we look at it plus one and then minus two point for the first quarter. What are those numbers look like based on today's commodity prices? Because I assume you know your labor inflation. What are those numbers look like on an exit rate basis in ’18?
Randy Hogan: I think you know, we mentioned this that the total full year ‘18 is out there, but it is a $58 million, I think…
John Stauch: The inflation for the year…
Randy Hogan: Inflation for the year and think of that is - roughly half of that is related to labor and the other half of it roughly material and that's what we think and that includes the current work and what we're seeing in all the commodity prices Scott.
Scott Graham: Right. And I do see that, I guess I was just sort of wondering we had a pretty heavy dose of steel inflation in the second half of the first quarter. And I know you want to do your best here to kind of make sure that everything looks square versus what you've talked about previously. But I guess I was just assuming that price would be a little bit better than that on a full year basis or certainly as we exit the year end, it sounds like you're not saying that?
Randy Hogan: That's true on price. And the steel side you know, really when you look at our overall purchase steel is not that significant of a component of our overall spend. And so the steel inflation that you know, maybe you've seen on the other side of the business, we haven't seen that impact us in the same way.
Scott Graham: Got you. Fair enough. The other question I had is about you know, tariffs, obviously a lot going on both in the headlines and being executed to U.S. and China or maybe I should say U.S. versus China, even Russia a little bit here. Did you talk about - you know, have you analyzed how this could affect your business going forward?
Randy Hogan: We have looked at it and we’ve really looked at it really in the two components, so the initial announcement focused on steel and aluminum. And as I mentioned earlier that that has a very limited impact on us for the year, so not even something that is worth mentioning. Kind of the second round, the more recent round of announced tariffs. The team has been diligently working to evaluate what that looks like for us. As I'm sure you know there's a host of product codes that have been announced are being impacted, but at the same time you know, this is – it’s evolving every day and there's a lot of ongoing review and comment that's coming in. So it's really too early to be able to tell you know, what that's going to look like and how that's going to impact us. But rest assured that the team is on top of it and looking closely to understand what the implications are, as we get closer to a timeline where it's finalized and it's more clear what it may or may not look like when it's actually put in place and we'll be able to talk a little bit more specifically about how we think that might impact us.
Scott Graham: Understood. Thank you and nice quarter, amid a lot of moving parts in the quarter. Thanks.
Randy Hogan: Thank you. Appreciate that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Randy Hogan: Morning, Deane.
Deane Dray: Hey, to just start off, Randy congrats. I remember the first transformational move you made way back when you pivoted Pentair out of the woodworking tools business and into water. So the company and you have come a long way.
Randy Hogan: Thank you.
Deane Dray: And then a question for John, and we saw the slide on your Investor Day, on page 15, the new Pentair Focused Strategies and look it makes a lot of sense to us to have you go down the path of your biggest strengths in Commercial & Residential and you said 80% of the business already are in those focus areas, but it still begs the question about that other 20%. And I'm not sure, you may not be in a position to disclose exactly how you're going to approach this. But just share with us your thinking, what's on the table here, because you had some really strong brand and they are valued and maybe a lot of people interested in them, but maybe you want to keep them in some sort of a run-off for a no-core segment. But just what's the thinking there in terms of how that value might get unlocked?
John Stauch: And so half of that - half of that you could classify as more industrial facing opportunities, which is our food and beverage and our ex [ph] flow membranes play in there, Deane, and they're very important not only to our short term value creation, but also into our long-term value creation and coming back into the residential, commercial markets. Because I think you know that technology starts with the applications of the municipal side and the industrial side and then usually get scaled and gets then some traction in the commercial and residential, so very key. The other half of that would be our municipal products, primarily our pumps. And again you know, technology and the partnerships we have with different municipalities and the APCs help create some value and translate in the rest of the business. So right now it's really more about, they’re important businesses and they need to continue to grow and continue to drive cash. But the incremental investment will be geared to the 80%. That's what our messaging is both externally and internally. And I think it's resonating.
Deane Dray: Got it. And. Just to clarify, would those be in separate segments or separate business lines that we might have some clarity as to how they're doing?
John Stauch: They're in Flow Technologies and they'll also be in the segment called Filtration Solutions. And we'll be sharing that on an annual basis kind of what are you know, percentages of revenue are and sure as you ask us we'll be able to tell you how those market segments are doing.
Deane Dray: Got it. And then a question on Aquatics. This is an important quarter for you always because there is elements, at times where there's an early buy. You highlighted new products. What kind of expectation are you looking for contribution from new products and is there anything baked in for all the rebuilding and replacement from the hurricane damage in Texas and Florida. Is any of that included in your assumptions?
John Stauch: Yes, that's included and you know, all in, we are having new product introductions this year like we usually do. It's all of that is included in the expectations for the year Deane. And you know, as you mentioned, Q2 is a very important quarter, right now all indications are it's going to be another great season and we're going to participate in that.
Deane Dray: Was there any early buy that was a factor in the first quarter or is that comparable to last year?
John Stauch: Nothing unusual from an early buy perspective in the first quarter.
Deane Dray: Excellent. Thank you.
Randy Hogan: Thank you, Deane.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Baird.
Mike Halloran: Morning, everyone.
Randy Hogan: Good morning, Mike.
Mike Halloran: So just on the filtration and the flow tech side, two questions for both actually. So one, top line was pretty healthy on both sides. You know, obviously just got the color on what that looked like last year with the backdated information you guys gave us. But maybe talk a little bit about what the sustainability of those healthy trends look like, anything that you thought was unique to the quarter? Because we're certainly encouraging to see the revenue start coming through there?
John Stauch: Sure. Really I think the story in both places is stabilization, as I as I talked about a little bit. So both businesses continue to focus on the things that will improve and reduce some of the variability and stabilize both topline and bottom line, removing and reducing the complexity in the businesses and focusing on the areas where we can profitably grow. So we're cautiously optimistic that in both cases we're going to see that those trends continue and see the return to topline growth and see improve profitability.
Mike Halloran: So that the second question for both is just on the profitability side, very healthy year-over-year gains in both segment. The expectations for the year seem pretty healthy as well. Any way you can parse out what directionally what's internally driven, what’s price cost, what volume related just to help understand what the sustainability looks like and then also understand what the drivers are, specifically…
John Stauch: Yeah. As Mark mentioned, there's a big mix benefit here. I mean, when we - when we go after the large projects in filtration which have been a nuisance to you guys, as well as us, they don't bring any real value to the bottom line. So by not growing those areas we actually do get a mix pick up like. The second one inflow, I mean, the reducing of the complexity as well, I mean, we had a lot of under scaled product lines globally and by exiting those and you know, optimizing the portfolio we're seeing the benefit of what the residential, commercial drop-throughs are. So I think it's a focused portfolio on both around the things that we really honestly think we can differentiate against competition and differentiate our consumer’s eyes. And then we're benefiting from that growth.
Mike Halloran: Make sense. And then last one here, just making sure I understand the impact from the divested businesses that you guys talked about or the product launch shutdowns. What's the segment income impact? I'm guessing relatively negligible otherwise you would have pointed it out, but just curious and how that flows through?
Randy Hogan: That's right. The segment income impact is small, so it really did reference back to what John just said, it's part of a focused optimization strategy to really exit the things that are - that are unprofitable and we don't believe we can be successful and so that's why we didn't call it out separately.
Mike Halloran: Make sense. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Congratulations.
Randy Hogan: Thank you, Mike.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker with UBS.
Steven Winoker: Thanks. Good morning. Congrats on the separation guys.
Randy Hogan: Thanks. We’re getting there. 
Steven Winoker: You're always there. So listen, just first on flow tech, why 1% to 2% on the guide given you had the uptick to 2% I mean, maybe it's just so close. I shouldn't worry about it. But is this any kind of deceleration though for the rest of the year. I looked at the comp, I don’t think that really explained it, just little color for that, just conservatism?
Randy Hogan: Yeah, there's no there's no messaging there, its no - there's no deceleration. It's just as I said earlier cautiously optimistic and you know, trying to stay, not get too far out over our skis and we'll see how the rest of the year plays out before we call it a success.
Steven Winoker: And you mentioned long cycle backlog improving, a little color there would be helpful?
Randy Hogan: The point there is that after years of kind of bouncing around and declining, it's stabilized, we're seeing a relatively strong order rates and the backlog stabilizing as we look forward.
Steven Winoker: Okay. And restructuring $6 million in the quarter I think, but no more for the rest of the year. I wasn't sure if that was total anyway, but just maybe a little perspective you know, given kind of what you're seeing, given the separation all these other things going on that you think there's no more restructuring for the rest of the year or is this just kind of you know, a little color there would be helpful?
Randy Hogan: Sure. So think of the restructuring is all being tied into the optimisations and some of those the product lines of business exits that John referenced earlier. And so while we didn't necessarily indicate that we've guided to any more restructuring in Q2, I do anticipate there will be some in Q2. But what we're really focused on - and that restructuring again it's associated with the separation and the activities around setting up the two separate businesses to be successful going forward. So I see some more in Q2 but then after that we can expect that to taper off and not anticipating anything in the second half of the year.
Steven Winoker: Okay. And John, one for you on Aquatics, you know, another great quarter in terms of growth here from the business, but if you – you know, a lot of other businesses who have focused tended to kind of under-invest in various pieces and finally find these great opportunities when they start investing again. Your point around focus here in advancing growth in aftermarket and automation, I mean, were there as great as it's been in terms of performance as much as this kind of contributed to helping the other businesses when they've had troubles for recent years. Have there been areas where you would have liked to have seen more dollars flow that are kind of pent up and now you're getting to do that. Or is this just a case of normal course of focusing growth?
John Stauch: Well, I think, first of all the former, right. I mean, we have our best business that often is - unfortunately became the cash cow for funding some of those non-prioritized areas of business that we’re talking about. So is allowing them to invest where they think the opportunities are. On the automation side, we are - we have a great product on the high end of the market, but not everybody can afford the high end automation products. So it's about serving the mid-market and the entry level of automation and we think we've got a great product there, that's going to be introduced in the short run. And then also making sure we got a high efficiency heater, which we just launched this year. So both the technology and a new product introduction, as you know those things need to be nurtured in the early quarters of launch and we also think that we have to build our brand at the consumer level, we're really well-known at the dealer level. And we like to market ourselves direct to the consumer to make sure we're taking advantage of all the different aftermarket opportunities that we would have.
Steven Winoker: Okay, great. I’ll let it go. Thanks.
Randy Hogan: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.
Nathan Jones: Good morning, everyone.
Randy Hogan: Morning, Nathan.
Nathan Jones: The question on operating leverage and so I'm looking at slide nine here, you got $24 million of volume growth and then $20 million of income growth from growth price acquisitions. So if I knock [ph] the $5 million of price out, there you've got $58 million on $24 million of volume or incrementals that are in the low 60s. Is that the right way to think about it? Just on volume growth how much did mix impact that and how should we be thinking about that kind of incremental over the longer term?
John Stauch: I think the long-term incremental is closer to 45 days and all in. And I remind you guys that you know, we had a tough project challenge last year and we call that out last year and that was a help this year. But beyond that you know, 45-ish to 50 that's our drop-throughs. And then how do we invest wisely goes into the productivity bucket.
Nathan Jones: Okay. That's helpful. Then on the product line exits business divestitures. How much of that is - I'm just getting out of these businesses - I can actually sell this for some cash. Is there going to be much of cash flow back to you from here or is this just exiting markets and can you give us any detail on what kind of marketing products –product launch that you're going to be exiting?
John Stauch: Sure. It's really the focus is getting out of product lines or markets that are underperforming. So I wouldn't anticipate that there's any significant cash that comes in. We're certainly not giving the businesses away by any means. But you know, given the nature of the businesses and the size it's not it's not something that we're seen as a big uptick in cash. For us it's small geographies that we don't feel that we can - that we've got the scale to be able to be competitive, so exiting businesses in Brazil in Russia in South Africa, places like that and then small product line, product line in Australia, a few other smaller product lines, things that we wouldn't have talked about before. But think of them as distractions that you know, pulled resources away from the focus on what are the priorities in the areas that we think we can really double down on and do better. And so the intent was to get those behind us all again as part of this process of separating and standing up to new businesses and creating a water business that we feel can be successful going forward. So - and those things are all underway and we anticipate that they'll be completed over the course of the next couple of quarters.
Nathan Jones: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Drab with William Blair.
Brian Drab: Hi. Good morning. Brian Drab from William Blair. Two questions. One, basically the same question one for the Aquatic segment and then same question for Filtration. The growth in Aquatic obviously off to a very strong start, you're forecasting you know, its bit about 8% growth again 7.5% growth for the second quarter within 5.5 for the year. So you know, it implies a deceleration from 8% growth in the first half to about 3% in the second half. So I wonder if you could talk about why that would be?
John Stauch: No real reason. I mean, if we continue trends it will be better, but we’ve got to see how Q2 comes out and then we'll adjust accordingly as the year unfolds.
Brian Drab: Okay. So sort of a similar mentality to what you're forecasting for the flow tech, it seems like the theme here is that there is some conservatism in the in the second half guide?
John Stauch: Well more we have to see to make a determination.
Brian Drab: Okay. And then on the filtration side you know, just doing that same exercise looking at what you know first quarter results, second quarter guide, here you’re going from 4% growth down to 1.5 and then you know, if you take the full year guide into account then it reaccelerates back to you know 3 plus in the second half of the year. You know what's happening in the second quarter. And then you know, what drives that rebound in the second half of the year? Thanks.
John Stauch: Right now it's just year-over-year comparisons in Q2, Q3 and Q4. We generally took the Q1 upside and moved it the year and we haven't adjusted anything yet in Q2, Q3 and Q4 until we see how the seasonality unfolds in Q2.
Brian Drab: Okay. John, than you very much.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.
Ronnie Weiss: Hey. Good morning, guys, Its Ronnie Weiss on for Julian.
Randy Hogan: Hi, Ronnie.
Ronnie Weiss: Of the $25 million of growth investment, how much of that came in Q1 and then can you walk through how that trends through the year and what the payback timing on that investment spend looks like as we go forward here?
John Stauch: Yeah, if you were to put it linear by quarter, we spent a couple million less than that linearization in Q1 and it ramps up as we head into Q3 and Q4.
Ronnie Weiss: Okay, great. And then going back to the inflation point, I was wondering if you could quantify or bucket out you know, what came from raw mats, what came from labor inflation, maybe there were some great inflation there as well. And you know, how those three buckets look for the year?
Randy Hogan: Think about it by half - half of that inflation is labor, half is material. No real significant change in freight. And then think of that consistently throughout the year.
Ronnie Weiss: Okay. That’s all I had. Thanks, guys.
Randy Hogan: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Barry with Susquehanna.
Robert Barry: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Randy Hogan: Hey, Robert.
John Stauch: Morning.
Robert Barry: Just curious another take on the tariff question about what you're seeing in the ag end market any impacts there from kind of uncertainty around tariffs?
John Stauch: Yes, so as Mark mentioned, I mean, there's tariff one which is steel aluminum, is really nominal impact to us for the year and that's focused into this forecast or factoring in this forecast. As far as the next round of tariffs as Mark mentioned, we're grinding through all the different codes and the products and you know, trying to explore what the impact to us would be and the actions would be and we're not prepared to share anything on that at this moment.
Randy Hogan: I think, the thinking of it from a market perspective, we have a global ag business, so if the market moves from one place to the to the other the business can pick that up, regardless of whether it's here or in other geographies.
Robert Barry: Got it. You also had called out precision spray. Can you just remind us how big that business is and what in particular caused it to outperform this quarter?
Randy Hogan: We've got about a $100 million of revenue annually in which we create precisions spray. We have an OEM relationship where we've been really driving our nozzles onto the OEM side and then we also are getting good aftermarket lift in that business. So it's a share and creating new products and those new products create value to the farmers.
Robert Barry: Got it. And then just finally the divestitures, is that having a material impact on one mix in helping the ROS this year or will it?
Randy Hogan: As John talked about that, that's part of the reason why we've mixed up is because we’ve exited through divestitures of product line exit, so some of the lower - lower performing parts of the business.
Robert Barry: The 10 basis point change since the Analyst Day is that…
Randy Hogan: Basically think of really no income impact on the revenue that is highlighted there.
Robert Barry: Got it. Got it. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Walter Liptak with Seaport Global.
Walter Liptak: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Congratulations, guys.
Randy Hogan: Thanks.
Walter Liptak: I want to ask about, you know, on the growth strategies slide 15, should we think about you know you've got more in - more focused programs in filtrations, I mean, you've got more spending on new products going on there are these you know, somehow weighted by segment?
Randy Hogan: I think in the filtration side take that as a global business and a global opportunity, so yes there is more innovation and technology required there. There's also today we don't go to the consumer with our brand. So there's some brand investment required. So I think you're thinking about it correctly.
Walter Liptak: Okay, great. And then if you can just refreshes on timing of when you think you'll get benefits from the incremental spending and how will that look in terms of growth rates?
Randy Hogan: I think, we’ll start to get benefits here in the second half. But I mean, will - it will be generally rounding error as you think about differentiated growth and we hope to build over time to getting a predictable and consistent incremental 1% to 2% of differentiated growth over the long haul from these three activities.
Walter Liptak: Okay, great. And then just a couple of kind of housekeeping things. What's your expectation for R&D spend this year and corporate expense?
John Stauch: $55 million for corporate and roughly 3% of sales for R&D.
Walter Liptak: Got it. Thank you.
John Stauch: Thank you. Randy Hogan Okay. Thank you for joining us today and I hope you have heard our excitement for the new Pentair that is expected to be completed by April 30th. As a pure-play water company we believe we'll be well positioned to benefit from strong secular trends. We are driven by the Pentair integrated management system and we have a proven and capable management team in place. One of the things we like most about our portfolio of businesses is our large and installed base. This allows us an opportunity to drive differentiated offerings for our customers across all of our businesses. Finally, we have a strong capital structure. Our free cash flow generation is robust. We plan to continue to be disciplined with our precious capital. Thank you for your continued interest. Angie you can conclude the call.
Operator: Certainly. Thank you for participating in today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Jim Lucas, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasury you may begin your call.
James Lucas: Thanks, Karenna, and welcome to Pentair's fourth quarter 2017 earnings call. We're glad you could join us. I'm Jim Lucas, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasury. And with me today is Randy Hogan, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Stauch, our Chief Financial Officer.

Randy Hogan: Thanks, Jim. I’d like to thank everyone for joining us today. 2017 was an exciting year for Pentair’s who saw organic growth return, strong margin expansion, robust cash flow as usual and the announcement of plan to separate our Water and Electric businesses into two publicly traded companies. We had two goals in 2017, first, to deliver on our 2017 commitments, and second, to prepare to stand up two independent companies. We accomplished both and believe the momentum we have exiting 2017 will continue into 2018. Our top line continue to gain momentum, driven by improving end markets and also by growth investments in both of our businesses. We saw very strong margin expansion in the fourth quarter and for the full year. I'll discuss the specifics around this in just a moment. We’re also introducing our 2018 outlook today, which is approximately $4 per share for the full company, expecting double-digit EPS growth once again. The $4 per share represents approximately $2.25 per share from Water and roughly $1.75 per share from Electrical for the full year. John will discuss the outlook in more detail later in the call. We remain on track to spin our Electrical business in the second quarter and are targeting April 30th for completion of the spin. 2017 was the year that's our predictability return to Pentair and we believe that both Water and Electrical are well positioned as we approach our separation into two focused growth companies. Now let’s turn to slide 5 for discussion of our full year 2017 results. In 2017 we saw adjusted core sales increased 2%, which excludes the impact in 2016 of three large jobs in our Electrical business and one large job in Water’s that did not repeat. We saw the growth rate increase throughout the year, particularly within Electrical, as industrial end markets continue to recover. Segment income increased 7% for the year and return on sales expanded an impressive 100 basis points to 18.2%. We achieved these results due to the cost actions we took in 2017 read through and positive leverage from sales hit the bottom line, all while still making growth investments in the business. Adjusted EPS grew 16% and our free cash flow was over $600 million. This was a 100% of adjusted net income when excluding a one-time tax payment. Overall we were very pleased with our results in 2017 and we’re optimistic that this path of improvement is sustainable. Now let’s turn to slide 6 for discussion of our fourth quarter 2017 results. Our fourth quarter results showed strength across almost all financial metrics. Adjusted core sales grew 4% in the quarter with Water up 3% and Electrical growing 5%. Segment income increased 11% and return on sales expanded 80 basis points to 18%. Although material inflation remains a headwind, we continue to drive productivity and pricing actions to help offset the impact. Adjusted EPS grew 19% and met our guidance of $0.93. Free cash flow was over $200 million in the quarter. So we ended the year on a positive note indeed. Let's turn to slide 7 for a look at Water's performance in Q4. Our Water segment delivered adjusted core sales growth of 3% and 6% growth overall. Segment income grew 15% and return on sales expanded 160 basis points to 19.2%. Our Water business delivered margin expansion of over 100 basis points every quarter in 2017 due to strong productivity and improved product mix. We don't expect this rate of margin expansion to continue, but we believe the cost structure is right and mix should remain favorable. Filtration solution saw core sales declined 2%. It remains a tale of two stories, our residential and commercial filtration sales which represents nearly two thirds of the business remains strong, especially in food service. These are higher margin businesses and are a contributing factor to the positive mix comment made earlier. The smaller process business continued to be hampered by low global diesel activity and muted spending in the beverage industry. Although we've been disappointed with the top line performance of that part of filtration solutions in 2017, we expect the business to face easier comps in 2018 and we believe the higher margin residential and commercial business is well positioned to keep growing as we continue to invest in this very attractive space. Flow technology saw the top line grow for the first time all year, as core sales were up 4%. We saw broad based strength across this business for the first time in quite some time, with agriculture, residential and commercial all up. Our smaller engineered pump business saw some short cycle recovery and the longer cycle backlog continues to improve, which you believe foretells improvements in 2018 and 2019. Aquatic systems ended the year on another strong note with core sales up 5% in the quarter and delivering 7% growth for the full year. We saw normal early buy activity and overall demand remained strong, as we continue to gain ground from advanced product adoption and ongoing dealer gains amidst to market ops – optimism. Now let’s move to slide 8 for a look at Electrical’s performance in Q4. Adjusted core sales grew 5% in the quarter and were up 7% overall. Segment income grew 6% and margins were down modestly, as price and productivity were not enough to offset inflation. We expect material inflation to continue, there's a roadmap to productivity accelerating in 2018, while price headwinds moderate. Enclosures core sales grew 8% in the quarter and the strength was broad based. The uncharacteristic productivity shortfalls are isolated to Enclosures. Recent plant closures and a distribution center relocation resulted in some near term delivery challenges compounded by very strong demand. We see this demand remaining strong and expect the issues that impacted productivity in 2017 to abate in the first half of 2018. With the stability of these capacity investments and a strong outlook, we believe Enclosures is poised to stabilize margins and grow income in 2018. Core sales declined 3% in thermal, but this was due solely to the top line headwind in the three large energy jobs last year in Canada that we outlined at the outset of the year and I mentioned earlier. Excluding these large jobs, thermal grew once again on both the small project and product side of the business with particularly strong sales in the industrial MRO business. Even more positive is that the business dramatically improved its margins in 2017. As a result of its realigned cost structure and better overall mix from higher margin product sales, making this an even more attractive business for Electrical. Electrical & Fastening Solutions saw core sales increased 7%, as commercial remained strong and infrastructure showed growth for the first time all year. More important price cost within EFS has gotten back to a more favorable position than we saw at the beginning of the year. Now please turn to slide 9 for an update on our planned separation. Before turning the call over to John to discuss the financial outlook in more detail, I wanted to provide an update on our planned separation. We made tremendous progress preparing to stand up two companies in 2018. The nVent Form 10 has been filed and the review process is ongoing. The leadership teams for both Pentair and nVent are now complete and the new teams are coming together well. Enterprise separation activities, such as finance, treasury and IT are all on or ahead of schedule. As we prepare for the separation we expect that both capital structures determined by the end of the first quarter. We're looking forward to sharing our excitement for the prospects of both companies at the Investor Day as we're hosting in New York on February 13. There are both management teams will present their strategies and discuss their futures in more detail. We remain excited for Pentair's next chapter as we create two industry leading pure play companies in Water and Electrical. We strongly believe that both companies are well-positioned for long-term growth and value creation with the scale and strength to control their own destinies. The increased focus of both companies should help to raise the execution even further and drive higher differentiated growth. We believe that our performance in 2017 has demonstrated our ability to better forecast our business and execute against our commitments. Both companies can become appreciated for the jewels that I believe they are. I will now turn the call over to John.
John Stauch: Thank you, Randy. Please turn to slide number 10, titled balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the year with our balance sheet in the best position in over two years. Our ending debt balance was $1.4 billion, which does not include just over $100 million of cash on hand at the end of the year. Our free cash flow into the year was over $600 million and represented 94% of adjusted net income. However, when excluding a one-time tax settlement payment from a prior year in 2017 free cash flow once again equalled adjusted net income. Our ROIC continued to improve and ended the year at 11.6%. Please turn to slide 11 titled 2018 outlook. Today we are introducing our 2018 adjusted EPS outlook for all of Pentair of approximately $4 per share, comprised of core sales growth of 2% to 4% and margin expansion of roughly 20 basis points. Embedded in our guidance is corporate expense of %100 million. Interest expense of $50 million and an effective tax rate of 18%. While we recorded a fourth quarter charge of roughly $85 [ph] million related to US tax reform, actually a gain of $85 million related to US tax reform. We believe the expanded - the expected 18% go forward tax rate to be an improvement over our current 20% tax rate and sustainable. The share count for 2018 is expected to be 183 million shares, inclusive of a completed share buybacks and before any incremental repurchases. While we have not yet finalized the capital structure of both companies heading into the separation, we continue to target investment grade metrics for both companies and our interest expense forecast reflects this target. We are also introducing 2018 adjusted EPS guidance for Water or RemainCo of $2.20 to $2.30 per share, on core sales growth of 2% to 4% percent. While we continue to make growth investments, we believe return on sales should expand approximately 40 basis points. I would remind you this follows a 140 basis points expansion in 2017. Corporate expense for Pentair RemainCo should approximate $55 million and interest expense is expected to be around $20 million. For Pentair Electrical or nVent, we are introducing 2018 adjusted EPS guidance of a $1.70 to $1.80 per share, based on core sales growth of 2% to 4%, flat return on sales, corporate expense of $45 million and interest expense of $30 million. Both companies will have more details on their 2018 outlook at the upcoming investor days on February 13 in New York City. While 2017 was a year of many changes for Pentair, both businesses have seen improving fundamentals and improving growth rates. As a reminder, the key rationale of the separation was to create two focused growth companies, which would require some dedicated growth investments in 2018, which should result in improved top line growth, EPS expansion and robust cash flow to be allocated in a disciplined manner to create share owner value. Please turn to slide 12 titled seasonality present in both businesses. We wanted to remind everyone that both businesses, particularly Water do experience some seasonality during the year. The past two years have seen similar trends that we would expect to continue. We thought this would be a useful reminder as you think about the quarterly distribution of sales and income for both businesses. Please turn to slide 13 titled Q1 2018 outlook. We are targeting that the first quarter should represent the last time we will report earnings as one company. With Q1 as a launch point for both companies, we are estimating core sales growth to 3% in both businesses for the first quarter. Segment income is expected to increase about 6% and return on sales is anticipated to be flat at 15.5%. Also we are expecting a tax rate of 18%. Net interest of around $13 million and shares to be roughly 183 million. Overall adjusted EPS is expected to be up over 20%. We exited 2017 continuing to build top line momentum, and while we continue to make growth investments in both Electrical and Water, Electrical’s also correcting its productivity issues and dealing with significant inflation challenges. We believe both businesses are positioned to deliver strong overall results, while preparing to stand up as two well positioned industry leading companies. I would now like to turn the call over to Karenna, after which Randy will have a few closing remarks. Karenna? Please open the line for questions.
Operator: Okay. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Steve Tusa: Good morning.
Randy Hogan: Good morning.
John Stauch: Morning, Steve.
Steve Tusa: So first of all just on kind of the top line trajectory in ’18, you know, your growth this quarter was okay, but not great in the context of the economy. I mean, I think 2% to 4% seems you know, reasonably conservative. Is there anything you know maybe in the Electrical business that you'd want to point out that you know could potentially be an upside surprise you know into next year, whether it's Enclosures or anything else?. Maybe just talk about the profile of some of the sub-segments as you set up in the next year, especially in Electrical?
Randy Hogan: Yeah, I think - I think that our outlook is realistic, but there's more upside than downside. I mean, we have - a lot of people calling synchronous growth. First time I've seen in 30 years. The markets are good for gaining momentum in Electrical, specifically we've got some the disappointing execution in Enclosures that we have. We've got that stabilized, it’s not productive yet, but now it's stabilized. I would hope that we could gain even more share and get back our rightful share that maybe we lost a little bit of it in Enclosures…
Steve Tusa: So how fast - so how fast do you think the Enclosures market is growing?
Randy Hogan: I don't have that number right in front of me, but I'd say…
John Stauch: High singles.
Randy Hogan: Yeah.
Steve Tusa: Okay. So you think that it's possible to kind of - if that trend line slows maybe a tad next year you think it's possible to kind of work your way into that. You know something above mid single digits at some point here in the near term as those issues get remedied?
Randy Hogan: For Enclosures, yes, yes.
Steve Tusa: Okay. And what exactly are the issues again?
Randy Hogan: You know, we had a number of plant moves – just a consolidation of a distribution center that we started in 2016, it took a little longer to get them done. And then the market took off and that's just the additional demand just basically overwhelmed the moves. They weren’t stable. So we're getting to the end of that, that's why the first quarter outlook is what it is.
Steve Tusa: Okay. And then just on the margin side of Electrical, you guys give you know, pretty good bridges as far as you know price inflation, et cetera. Can you just give us a little bit of color on how we get to the you know, margin you're guiding to for next year with regards to Electrical and if you are not kind of prepared to do that maybe just a little bit of color on what you're assuming on kind of the you know the price cost side there?
Randy Hogan: Let me give you an overview and then Beth will go into it in more detail on the 13th, I think it's fair for her to let her do that. But basically we were very cautious on price while we were having these delivery challenges because of the operational faux pas. And so price – price is still going to be a headwind in the first part. And we're not counting on productivity in the first you know, five months or so, four months of the year…
Steve Tusa: And inflation - and inflation?
Randy Hogan: Kind of run rate continues…
Steve Tusa: For Electrical?
Randy Hogan: In the fourth quarter we didn't get any productivity.
Steve Tusa: Okay. And then one last question, your ForEx up 1% what rate is that based on?
John Stauch: Roughly a $1.20, the euro. You know, obviously lots of currencies, Steve, but that’s the main one.
Steve Tusa: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot guys.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Randy Hogan: Morning, Deane.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Deane Dray: Hey, maybe start with John, if you could give us some insight into the puts and takes in tax reform, you can count us among the people that were pleasantly surprised to see you actually benefiting more than what we expected. So on top of this whole separation, you also had to flow through tax reform. But just give us a sense of how it turned out that it's as favorable as it is.
John Stauch: Yeah. So I mean, I think when the legislation emerged we thought we'd - just like you did probably thought we'd have a slight headwind and a couple of things went favorable for us. One is there's less of a border adjustment tax impact on us, you know, US manufacturing tax than originally assumed and then also we were able to carry forward our deferred tax assets related to debt and debt restructuring for an infinite period of time which allows us to utilize those in the future. Those are the two main changes.
Deane Dray: Got it. And then going back to the Water discussion in Randy's prepared remarks, and I'm not sure if Randy answered this or John, but the idea of the mix being more favorable on residential and especially on foodservice's side remained strong, and Randy said where you look to invest in this business going forward. So what are the kinds of opportunities for investing? Is this internal growth or are these acquisitions?
Randy Hogan: Well, I think you know we'll talk about this definitely in length on the 13th. But first and foremost, we have lot of organic growth opportunities. I mean, one of the reasons we want to separate both these companies is they both have the ability to focus on organic growth. Organic growth is you know - delivering that growth muscle for us is key and what that means is we're going to focus on where we're really good, which is residential, commercial water treatment. That is our strong position globally and we want to continue to invest in that area and maybe deemphasize a little of the other pieces of portfolio.
Deane Dray: That's helpful. And just last question for me. Is there any news or development on the hurricane impact, the rebuild especially on the Aquatic side?
Randy Hogan: No, I mean, we continue to see the order rates continue in that area both in - definitely Florida and the Houston area. So you know, as both the states continue to rebuild outside of that hurricane damage that they suffered.
John Stauch: The optimism - I mentioned this in the prepared remarks, the optimism in this business is as high as I've ever seen it. Its - growth is really, really solid there.
Deane Dray: Great. Thank you. See you on the 13th.
Randy Hogan: Exactly.
Operator: Your next question is from Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Jeff Hammond: Hey. Good morning, guys.
Randy Hogan: Good morning, Jeff.
Jeff Hammond: Just on - back to Electrical margins being flat you know in the guide, outside of this Enclosures issue it sounds like it'll be you know cleared up by 1Q. What are the other kind of headwinds to not getting you know more leverage out of Electrical?
John Stauch: I want to see more yields from price, right. And you know I'm taking a bunker attitude here, you know, which is don't shoot until you see the whites of their eyes. In other words, let's see some delivery here. This is a business that just delivers. So it's - I expect to be an anomaly what we're seeing now.
Jeff Hammond: Okay. And then on Thermal, I mean, it looks like the - you know the big projects you're lapping, kind of the big project com, you know, we're at $65 oil, it sounds like after markets been better. Can you just maybe carve out where you think the outlook is for that business into ’18?
Randy Hogan: A shout-out to the Thermal team. They did an incredible job this year. You know, if you look at their overall and the top line coming down those was big projects. They not only right sized cost structure, but actually made investments, they made investments against driving MRO and driving product sales only much higher margins than the products that were coming down. So we saw a nice increase in margins in that business and frankly with a little bit of mojo behind capital spending in energy that's going to bode well for the smaller projects and the product sales and our investments we made in MRO. I expect another dazzling year for Thermal.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Mike Halloran from Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Randy Hogan: Hey, Mike.
Mike Halloran: So on kind of a comparable question though you guys have been answering on the Electrical side, maybe similar puts and takes on the Water side for the margins into next year, just how you're looking at the price cost curve and also how you're looking at productivity? And then for the cumulative company also some thoughts on the restructuring side how much benefit for both Electrical and Water you're assuming in numbers for next year?
John Stauch: Yes. So Mike, you know, on the Water side, we had a strong productivity year in 2017. But you know, we have to get back to investing in organic growth. So for 2018 we've got some $25 million of incremental investments in primarily sales, marketing and innovation technology into the outlook for 2018. And we want to get back to investing to control our destiny as far as the future and begun to build an organic growth muscle. So we're excited about the opportunity to you know focus on where we think we're strong, which is residential, commercial, water treatment and then starting to invest in the longer term growth trajectory. So other than that, price cost for us is not as big an issue as it is in Electrical you know, we deal with the trades channel and usually have the ability to take the price and cost and mitigate them through our channel. So we're a little bit blessed in that regard. And then Randy, do you want to add to the Electrical.
Randy Hogan: Well, I just did on the margin side, I think I’ve...
Mike Halloran: Yeah. No, no I was comfortable on the Electrical side. Was there any restructuring benefits for either the two pieces into next year?
John Stauch: Oh, yes, significant. I mean, both groups have taken the opportunity to optimize their portfolio and both sides are looking at you know some tailwind associated with 2017 restructuring.
Randy Hogan: And kudos to John and Beth both as they - built the structures as you recall when we first said we're going to separate, we thought we might have a $20 million headwind in the corporate cost and we actually came out with a neutral, no headwind. A lot of good work too.
Mike Halloran: And any willingness to give a dollar number on those or too early and just want to leave it up to the individual companies over time?
Randy Hogan: Too early.
Mike Halloran: That’s fair. And then on the engineered pump side, first positive commentary in a while there, maybe just some thoughts on what you're seeing in the market and sustainability of what could be an early turn toward something more positive?
Randy Hogan: Yeah, the market is definitely recovering and has been recovering throughout 2017. And we have built the order backlog for the breaking fix side of primarily municipal. So I think we – we’re now moving from what used to be a headwind to let's say a slight tailwind.
Mike Halloran: Sounds good. Thanks for the time.
Randy Hogan: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Scott Graham from BMO. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Scott Graham: Morning, Randy and John, Beth.
Randy Hogan: Morning, Scott.
Scott Graham: Couple questions for you. You know, where we were talking in 2017 about what felt like about a 1%, maybe 1% to 2% headwind to sales from businesses that were sort of - let's just call it being run off so to speak. Could you tell us kind of what that is in Water and if there's any in Electrical as we stand today still happening?
John Stauch: Yeah. So what we are referring to is you know, we shipped some projects in 2016 that had a headwind you know, and we looked at those as being somewhere around a point of headwind on the Water side. And then you know, larger impact in the Electrical side, primarily all in Thermal, which was the large jobs that had completed in 2016 that had no revenue in ‘17. That's all behind us now. And as we look forward we no longer have those challenges and each of the businesses will produce the organic growth or the core growth that - that will be just reflective of no longer having those year-over-year challenges.
Scott Graham: Right. I guess, John I was referring to and what I thought and may - correct me if I'm wrong, that you were even in some of like the lower margin Water businesses, residential, maybe you were walking away from some customers there, did I have that wrong?
John Stauch: No. I mean, it was more about more geography prioritization. You know, we as two smaller focused companies can't afford to be in every geography in the world. And you know, it gets very difficult to have a small scale and compete in Russia or a small scale and compete in Brazil and so both sides we’re looking at optimizing those opportunities. But those will be some surrounding headwinds next year, Scott as we look to move the revenue that we have to a distribution or an alternative channel, but we removed the costs – associated [ph] structure, being cost structure of being local there.
Scott Graham: Got you. Last question from me.
John Stauch: Okay.
Scott Graham: You know, as these companies take their - you know, each independent paths, have you - I know that there's a lot of work going on behind the scenes in terms of what you want to be and all that and the separation mechanics themselves. But if you thought about M&A pipelines. I know you mentioned John where you kind of want to be just now, but have you started to identify some things on the Water side and on the Electrical side. Is there one of the three platforms you maybe want to develop a little bit further?
John Stauch: So I'll handle the Water side. I mean, clearly you know, disciplined capital allocation is important for both sides. And I think in the near term we think we have a significant amount of organic growth opportunities and I'd like to see our businesses demonstrate the organic growth that that they have and then tuck in behind it the M&A. So yes, we're identifying them. I think you know, where we have strong organic growth and they probably have a readiness and an ability to move sooner. But I really want to see the discipline around that steady consistent organic growth and then putting the fuel behind them as a bolt on. Randy, if you want to answer the Electrical…
Randy Hogan: Yeah. In Electrical you know, there's quite a few parts of the business, if you look at all three of what will be the segment, they are actually all three very attractive from a profitability standpoint and they all have opportunities on the M&A. But I would say 2018 as a prove it year from an operation standpoint and a continuation year from driving the organic growth that we're really building great momentum on. At the same time there have been and there will be opportunities I think to do little plug and play acquisitions, particularly in the EFS side, Electrical Fastening Solution side and maybe some Thermal too. But again, I think Beth could talk more about that on the 13th.
Scott Graham: Got it. Thank you.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from John Walsh from Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
John Walsh: Hi. Good morning.
John Stauch: Good morning.
John Walsh: So one question about the Q1 top line guide, in prior slides you'd called out you know, a days comparability issue on a on a year-over-year basis, we obviously lived through some of that in 2017. I think the last update I saw Q1 ‘18 actually has one less selling days from your prior slide. Is that still the case or how should we think about that?
Randy Hogan: Yeah, I would say it's a rounding error. I mean, a day is not all that meaningful and that's reflected in what we have in the core guide for Q1.
John Walsh: Okay. And then you know, clearly good cash conversion execution here. You know I like or applaud that you do it on the adjusted net income. As we think about next year, you know, in working capital I mean, clearly as you execute on that it does get harder to keep getting gains out of that line. You know any particular cash items you have visibility into next year that give you know, confidence in that 100% conversion on the adjusted net income, whether it's on the inventory line or payables or anything like that?
Randy Hogan: Yeah, the first thing I'd like to state, maybe it's clear already, is both Water and Electrical have and will convert at 100% level. So the capability is on both sides. There's a seasonality in Water that John talked about that's important, but for the year both will deliver. I believe that Electrical it does because of the distribution - short term distribution challenges that I just talked about will have some inventory opportunities, as well as we've really only begun to think - make - scratch the surface on EFS opportunity on inventory.
John Stauch: Yeah, I think the biggest tailwind opportunity for both companies as we go forward is to read – the reducing of the separation related costs and the severance and restructuring costs. I mean, on the gross cash rate both companies will start to you know get into more of a stabilized mode and no longer have these large restructuring actions that have hurt us on the cash flow side.
John Walsh: All right. Thank you.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Nathan Jones from Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Nathan Jones: Morning, everyone.
John Stauch: Morning, Nathan.
Randy Hogan: Morning, Nathan.
Nathan Jones: John, on the Water side, you talked about focusing on the areas where you're seeing good growth, where you're having strong positions and maybe deemphasizing some of the other businesses. Given the opportunity you have with the split, is -- have you given a thought and consideration to perhaps disposing of some of those assets using that capital to bolster the businesses where you have better and stronger positions?
John Stauch: Yeah. I don't know if we're there yet. I think it's really about the fact that it's prioritization. And you know, we've been - we have a lot of great growth opportunities across all of Water, but we have to focus our energy and focus our actions - our actions. And so you know, it's about not chasing the large jobs that are one and done. It's about focusing on the aftermarket. The annuities, the stability of our customer base and that's really what it's about at this point Nathan.
Nathan Jones: And then I know you guys said you're looking at investment-grade balance sheet for both companies. But judging by the interest expense line that you have there, Electrical is going to get more of the debt on what is a somewhat smaller company. Does that indicate that you guys believe that the Water business has more opportunities for M&A?
John Stauch: Obviously that that reflects roughly what we think will do. As you recall you know, now that we've retired all - retired the debt with the proceeds from Valves & Controls, while money is fungible, the debt that remains is really around EFS. So I just think by rights it sort of an Electrical debt, which is the guiding principle. I think there are more opportunities on both sides, but Waters is been on the sidelines for first because of Valves & Controls and secondly because of the EFS acquisition for a while. So those are the guiding principles that I gave the team to use as they put this together, still have to finalize things though.
Nathan Jones: Okay, fair enough. And then the $25 million of incremental investments, I think that was related to Water. Can you quantify what incremental investments are related to Electrical? And then maybe talk about some of the major initiatives, some of the major investments that you're making to drive growth here in the future?
John Stauch: Yeah, about 50 basis points on the Electrical side. You know, and again I mean, those are to further off the automation, get the delivery and quality issues and also to be creating the one event opportunities across the portfolio for some of the key initiatives that they have, like rail and data centers. So I mean I think each of these companies feel that the incremental investment in 2018 is really going to create a sustained and more predictable organic growth in ’19, ‘20 and beyond. And so obviously if it doesn't materialize that's an opportunity, but it would be disappointing if we weren't able to invest that in the future growth.
Nathan Jones: Is that a number that you think is a run rate number? This $25 million in Water, 50 basis points in Electrical, is this a step-up for 1 year that will step down again? Or a step-up to a level that you would imagine sustaining as we go forward investing in growth opportunities?
John Stauch: We'd like to sustain it.
Randy Hogan: I think we need to build the business model to be able to sustain that, so we keep it going. John made a good point earlier about these large projects that are won and done. And I mentioned earlier about Thermal, as redirecting and restructuring their cost to go after smaller sustainable MRO and product that's really an opportunity in Water as well, which as John said that those investments should sustain, those investments should give us more reliable organic growth.
Nathan Jones: Excellent. Thanks very much for the color.
Randy Hogan: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Josh Pokrzywinski: That was closer, John.
John Stauch: Hello, Mr. Pokrzywinski.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Yeah, I thought it was closer. We're again improving, hopefully another 10 years and we'll be all the way there. So John just to follow up on something you said about you know, emphasizing versus deemphasizing points within Water. Does deemphasizing you know, could that mean outright sales of businesses? And you can kind of ring fence you know, maybe not the exact lines of business, I don't want to spoil the fun for the Analyst Day. But you know the rough size of businesses that could be in that deemphasization [ph] you know bucket?
John Stauch: Josh, let me take - let me take it and of course, probably will come up again on the 13th [ph] But you know, the fact is that, we have always focused on capital allocation, if look at all the things we did, I mean, we just - we sold the pipe business right after we bought Tyco. We ended up making different calls and selling valves. You know we have trimmed and pruned the business, as well as replanted it. And so that sort of I think almost in the DNA of the business to think that way. And I would expect both businesses to continue to do that.
Randy Hogan: Yeah, Josh, I mean to put it into context, 85% of what we do falls into one bucket in Water called residential commercial water treatment. I want to focuses to be there. We've moved to more of an enterprise model where we have the ability to look at marketing across the enterprise you know, in innovation across the enterprise and we want the extra energy to be focused on where we think we can differentiate against the competition and differentiate on behalf of the customer. One of the big areas that we have to invest in is digital marketing to pull the consumer through our professional channel and that's going to be done first on the residential commercial side. The technology is transferable, I mean when we take a look at what we have and what we do in Industrial Filtration that technology is useful in residential commercial, it hasn't been used that way in the past. And so it’s more about a redirection as we go forward than it is necessarily an asset sale.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Got you. So when you think about that - the 15% that doesn't fall into the core, we shouldn't you know think about Pentair long-term is maybe parting ways with those as we add in other things that are closer to the core. That's not necessarily in the agenda?
Randy Hogan: That's correct.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Okay. That was all. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Brian Drab from William Blair. Please go ahead. You line is open.
Brian Drab: Morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Randy Hogan: Morning.
Brian Drab: So back to Water if I could just for a second, you mentioned that the pace of margin improvement in Water shouldn't continue, but you are guiding up 40 Bps for ’18 and this is really good operating margin in Water in the back half of the year here and really for the whole year. I guess my question is just can we continue to track up above 20% and as I look back at the old reporting structure, you know Water quality was of course sustain margins above 20, but flow and filtration was well below that. And I'm just wondering if you know combined what is the longer term trajectory for this combined business?
John Stauch: Yeah, what Randy meant was even though we delivered a 140 year-on-year this year and we're up 100 every single quarter, we did not make those future investments in the growth that we're doing in 2018. So if you add back that $25 million of incremental growth I shared with you it suggests that these margins continue to expand before that growth. And I would just look at it that way. The other thing we did and you know we used a playbook that's been proven in the PIMS for some period of time and we did a lot of product rationalization, SKU rationalization and reprioritizing some of the lower margin product and really didn't suffer all that much in the top line - significantly expand margins. So I mean, there's a ton of opportunity still remaining in these businesses from an operational standpoint, but we want to invest in future growth.
Brian Drab: Okay. But we shouldn't think about 19.6 or wherever we are as a ceiling in 2019, 2020 we can continue to move up?
John Stauch: No, and our peer group demonstrates that too. I mean, if you take a look at some of the older water peers they have really nice margins as well.
Brian Drab: Yes, for sure. And then if I could just a couple of questions on Thermal. Are you starting to see demand specifically in the in the petro-chem market. You know, there's talk of - a lot of talk of a second wave of investment there in over the next few years, could that be a tailwind for you?
John Stauch: Yeah, we are we're seeing a pretty broad base. As we mentioned before, particularly now with the tax law change, I expect - I would expect the investments in petro-chem on the chem side, right, on the plastic and monomer side is going to be quite substantial here with low cost natural gas in North America. The whole industry should be here. So with the tax law change you know, I think it could be - we could have a sustain capital spending even at this oil price level, that would be pretty exciting.
Brian Drab: All right. Okay. Thanks. And then just one last quick one. You mentioned MRO again is picking up steam in Thermal and in the Americas. And can you kind of break that down into what…
John Stauch: It’s also in Europe, its everywhere.
Brian Drab: Okay.
John Stauch: Now if you want to go back and just look at the energy side, you know, now they're back $65. You're back to more normalized maintenance level and this is a business and has a wonderful MRO flow. And our focus now on our investment as we took down the elephant hunting, forgive me - forgive the metaphor, but of the large projects we invested in the things out to more aggressively focus on getting that after marketing and serving it and we're enjoying that. So I expect it to continue.
Brian Drab: Okay. So my question is going to be, just thank you for that. But my question is going to be within the Americas are you seeing the same kind of momentum in Canada versus the US and kind of broad based across end markets or are there any specific pockets of strength?
John Stauch: As I mentioned it is broad based. So it is Europe. It has come back from Canada, it has – it is strong in North America.
Brian Drab: Great. Thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Joe Ritchie: Good morning, guys.
John Stauch: Hi, Joe.
Joe Ritchie: Hey, maybe I'm going back to Electrical for a second and your commentary earlier around price cost. So if I kind of take a look at 2017 it looks like you've been running last few quarters about $10 or $11 million price cost negative last few quarters and it sounds like that's going to continue now at least through next four or five months. On top of that you've got strategic investments call it $2 to $3 million a quarter in Electrical. What I'm trying to do is I'm trying to bridge to flat margins. Is there any expectation then as we get into the back half of the year that price costs reverses or are there other things that are coming through on your bridge to get to a flat margin guidance for ’18?
John Stauch: Yeah, I mean the productivity – the stabilization then leads to positive productivity and you know that's more in the third and fourth quarter as opposed certainly not first quarter a little bit the second that I think about it.
Joe Ritchie: Okay. So is there an expectation also from a pricing standpoint and I guess my understanding was that and I could be wrong here with that typically you guys put price increases through at the end of the year, early part of the year and so I'm just wondering whether there's an opportunity for you to get additional pricing as the year progresses?
John Stauch: Let me say this carefully, but I hope there is an opportunity. You know, we haven't broken that process. But this business, I mentioned it's an anomaly and most in the Enclosures business for this kind of performance. So controlling your destiny means controlling what you can. So there's been a price increase but do we count on that or we count on the productivity that we own and we drive, you kind of what you can - would you own and drive that's what controlling our own destiny means. If the price really read through that would be good. But we want to deliver on our commitments in any case.
Joe Ritchie: Got it. And maybe then just kind of following on what you can control, which is partly the cost angle. Do you guys plan to typically hedge any of your commodity costs or are we just kind of going to roll through because we've seen a little bit of an increase here in copper and steel and just wondering like you know, whether we should – what kind of headwind we should be expecting from that?
John Stauch: What our process is you know, we're not commodities traders. So what we'd like to do is we would like to lock in our price so that we can have good operating plans and predictability in our business. So we typically are locked out about 6 months on those commodities and copper is one of them.
Joe Ritchie: Got it. Okay, guys thanks very much.
John Stauch: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Steven Winoker from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: This is actually Chris on behalf of Steve. Can I just - can we just go back to the price cost and productivity kind of topic. You know, you guys said that you control your own destiny with regard to productivity. Are you seeing customers being more reluctant to accept price. Is that kind of something that you know you're seeing with their customer base right now?
Randy Hogan: Well, again, talking about Enclosures, it’s really hard to actively set price when you can’t get deliver, right. And so we've got stable and we'll see whether they accept it.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay.
John Stauch: But I mean, people are seeing inflation, so any material inflation that typically in that business has led us to be able to achieve some price.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And then you know, I know you said you're not - did the elephant hunting is a thing of the past, but in terms of just project activity in general, I mean, are you - is there more activity or is there anything you guys are seeing there or is the growth going to continue to be kind of more shorter cycle in nature more MRO kind of mix there…
John Stauch: In this kind of a robust economy there will be - there will be larger projects, but we want projects to come to us and we want to own other parts of the business. And so it's a different - we certainly will accept them as they come. But we're not going to have the major effort that we had in the past and the cost structure associated with that.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And again just one more, on Electrical & Fastening, I know there was year-over-year comp, but you know the strong sequential acceleration there. Is there anything more to that and how should we kind of expect that to flow through ’18?
John Stauch: Well, the CADDY business, the CADDY brand product line which is largely commercial is seeing – it saw some variable growth in EFS, but CADDY was pretty solid, it was it was really solid in the fourth quarter and then the industrial - the infrastructure business was - really came back and I think again in this economy with what's happening, I would expect infrastructure to continue with some strength.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thanks a lot.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions on the phone at this time. And turn the call back over to presenters.
Randy Hogan: Thanks for your questions and your attention. Just to wrap things up, we remain on track for the separation to be completed by April 30th. But this still remains work to be done. Both businesses are well positioned entering the New Year with improving top line fundamentals. We expect both companies have strong balance sheets upon launch. We report to updating you further on February 13th with Pentair and nVent presenting their strategies and we hope you share our excitement for the future of both companies. Again thanks for your continued interest and operator you can conclude the call. Thanks.
Operator: This concludes today's call. You mean now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Kim, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Pentair's Q3 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Jim Lucas, you may begin your conference.
James Lucas: Thanks, Kim, and welcome to Pentair's third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. We're glad you could join us. I'm Jim Lucas, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasury. And with me today is Randy Hogan, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Stauch, our Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, we will provide details on our third quarter 2017 performance as well as our fourth quarter and full-year 2017 outlook, as outlined in this morning's press release. Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the Company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as the risks outlined in Pentair's most recent 10-Q and today's press release. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today and the Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results. Today's webcast is accompanied by a presentation which can be found in the Investors section of Pentair's website. We will reference these slides throughout our prepared remarks. Any references to non-GAAP financials are reconciled in the appendix of the presentation. We will be sure to reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. I would like to request that you limit your questions to one and a follow-up in order to ensure everyone an opportunity to ask their questions. I will now turn the call over to Randy.
Randy Hogan: Thanks Jim. I'm starting on Page 4 of the deck. Our third quarter results met or exceeded virtually all of our expectations entering the quarter and represented another positive step on delivering our 2017 commitments. I will discuss the quarter in more detail in a moment, but we saw adjusted core sales grow; strong margin expansion, and adjusted EPS increase over 20%. We remain on track to separate our Water and Electrical businesses next year and both teams are making good progress in preparing for next year's separation. We are raising our full-year adjusted EPS estimate to approximately $3.53 per share reflecting the solid third quarter performance and our expectations for another solid quarter to end the year. We should exit 2017 with improved topline momentum and we expect to benefit in 2018 from carryover on our cost out initiatives this year as well as benefit from lower interest expense that we did not recognize for all of 2017 as a result of the April closing of our sale of Valves & Controls. As we stated last quarter, we have two goals this year. Deliver on our 2017 commitments and prepared to stand up two companies in 2018. We believe that our third quarter performance and improved full-year 2017 outlook are positive steps towards meeting those commitments. And the activity is underway on the separation are right on track with our expectations. Now I'll turn to Slide 5 for discussion of our third quarter results in a little more detail. As mentioned, the third quarter performance was in line or better on nearly all metrics. Adjusted core sales grew 1% in the quarter with Water up 1% and Electrical growing 2%. Segment income increased 7% and return on sales expanded to 100 basis points to 18.9%. Although material inflation remains a headwind, we continue to drive productivity and pricing actions to help mitigate the impact. Our corporate expense was a little lower than anticipated. This helped to offset slightly higher than expected interest expense. Adjusted EPS grew 22% and $0.95 exceeded the high-end of our guidance. Free cash flow is nearly $200 million in the quarter and we continue to target free cash flow approximating adjusted net income for the full-year. Let's turn to Slide 6 for a look at Water's performance in Q3. Our Water segment delivered adjusted core sales growth of 1% and 3% growth overall. Segment income grew 10% and return on sales expanded to 120 basis points. This was the third consecutive quarter that Water margins have expanded in excess of 100 basis points, which reflected continued strong productivity and improved mix. Our Filtration & Process business saw core sales declined 4%, but once again we saw a dichotomy between the vertical served by the business. We continue to see strength in Residential and Commercial and especially in Food Service. These are two higher margin businesses and contributed to the improved margin performance in the quarter. The smaller process business continued to be hampered by minimal global desal activity and muted spending in the beverage industry. Although, we have been disappointed with the topline performance of Filtration & Process year-to-date, we are approaching easier comps as we exit the year. Flow Technologies saw core sales declined 2%, which is an improvement from the 4% decline we saw last quarter. While we've seen a recovery in agriculture, softness in our smaller infrastructure pump sales has hamstrung the topline performance year-to-date. We have seen orders and backlog improving in this longer cycle business, but we expect it will take until next year before we see any topline recovery in infrastructure sales. In the meantime, Residential, Commercial, and Agriculture remain healthy and we expect the comparisons to continue to improve exiting the year. The Aquatic Systems saw a very strong end to the pool season with third quarter core sales growing 9%, which is slightly faster than the year-to-date growth of 7%. Similar to the quarter-to-quarter volatility we experienced in the first half, we did not expect the strong third quarter growth rates to repeat in the fourth quarter, but likely a blended second half growth rate to approximately what we experienced in the first half. While the impact of hurricanes Harvey and Irma in two of the largest pool markets in the U.S. has not fully played out in our results. We believe that any near-term disruption has not and we will not materially impact our full-year's results. Now let's move to Slide 7 for a look at Electrical's performance in Q3. Adjusted core sales grew 2% as we continue to see strengthening in our short cycle Industrial businesses. Segment income grew 2% and return on sales expanded to 50 basis points as improved mix was not enough to offset continued price cost headwinds. While material inflation has been a significant headwind in Electrical throughout the year and more specifically in Enclosures and Electrical & Fastening Solutions, we continue to drive productivity and pricing actions to help mitigate the impact. Enclosures core sales grew 2% in the quarter and improved sequentially. Strength continued in the Industrial business with broad-based sales growth across all regions. Within infrastructure, the smaller Electronics businesses following lap it is tough comparisons and grew backlog this quarter and we believe it is poised to return to growth. Core sales declined 11% in Thermal, but this was due solely to the topline headwinds of three large energy jobs last year in Canada that we've outlined at the outset of this year. Excluding these large jobs, Thermal grew nicely. Thanks to its focus on both the small project and product side of the business. It was particularly strong sales in the Industrial MRO business. It's worth noting that the business has dramatically improved its margins this year, as realigned as cost structure and benefited from better overall mix of higher margin product sales. After growth in the first quarter followed by a decline in the second quarter, core sales for Electrical & Fastening Solutions were flat. The Commercial business remained strong as we expand into prefabricated solutions and the Industrial business stabilized. Infrastructure sales were mixed with continued declines in our engineered construction product line offset by strength in rail. Now please turn to Slide 8, for an update on our planned separation. Before turning the call over to John to discuss the financial outlook in more detail, I wanted to first provide an update on the Separation announcement we made in May. As a reminder, our Board has approved a plan to spin-off our Electrical business, which remains on track to be completed in the second quarter of 2018. Shortly after we issued our earnings release this morning, we issued a second press release announcing the name of our spined calling it nVent. We previously announced that Beth Wozniak, who will be the CEO. We also announced today that we've hired a CFO for the business, Stacy McMahan, who was coming to us after two successful stands as the public company CFO. The other key dates outlined in the slide include our expectation that the nVent Form-10 will be filed before the end of the month and then we anticipate hosting separate Pentair and nVent investor meetings on February 13 of next year. As stated previously, we're expecting the separation to be completed in the second quarter of next year. We remain excited for Pentair's next chapters. We create two industry leading pure play companies in Water and Electrical. We strongly believe that both companies are well-positioned for long-term growth and value creation with the scale and strength to control their own destinies. The increased focus of both companies should help to raise the execution even further and drive higher differentiated growth. We believe that our performance throughout 2017 as demonstrated our ability to better forecast our business and execute against our commitments. Both companies can now become appreciated for the jewels they are. I'll now turn the call over to John.
John Stauch: Thank you, Randy. Please turn to Slide number 9, titled balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the third quarter to balance sheet in the solid position. Our ending debt balance is $1.5 billion, which does not include just over $100 million of cash on hand at the end of quarter. Our free cash flow generation remains strong and was just under $200 million for the quarter and $375 million year-to-date. With a slow start to the year, due to tough comparisons, but we continue to make good progress on cash flow and remain on track to generate free cash flow equal to adjusted net income for the full-year. Our ROIC continued to improve and we ended the quarter at 11.5%. Please turn to Slide 10, title Q4 2017 Pentair outlook. We are introducing fourth quarter adjusted EPS guidance of approximately $0.93 per share, which is almost a 20% increase year-over-year. We expect the adjusted core sales to grow approximately 2% and both segments are expected to grow at this rate. This marks increased momentum from the growth rates last quarter and we believe better represents the growth trajectory of both businesses, which still have not fully recovered. We anticipate segment income to increase just over 10% and return on sales to increase roughly 80 basis points and likely exceed 18%. We expect the tax rate to be 20%, net interest expense of $14 million and the share count to be around $184 million. Free cash flow should end the year strong once again. Please turn to Slide 11, label full-year 2017 Pentair outlook. We continue to expect adjusted core sales to grow 2% for the year with both segments close to that growth rate. We have seen continued improvement in our base business as we projected for the year and many of the tough comparisons we face throughout 2017 should finally be behind us as we exit the year. We expect segment income to increase roughly 7%, return on sales to expand north of 80 basis points to 18% or better, and adjusted EPS to be up over 15% for the full-year. We continue to target free cash flow to be 100% of adjusted net income. As I stated previously, we expect seasonal fourth quarter free cash flow strength. As we exit 2017, both of our businesses are not only demonstrating strengthening topline trends, but we continue to have some carryover of cost savings and lower interest expense in the 2018. We have one more quarter to deliver for 2017, but we feel better about the momentum we are building exiting the year. I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for Q&A, after which Randy will have a few closing remarks. Please open the line for questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Jeffrey Hammond: Good morning, guys.
John Stauch: Hey, Jeff.
Randy Hogan: Good morning, Jeff.
Jeffrey Hammond: Hey, so you mentioned building momentum into 2018, can you just talk about some of the more challenged businesses organically flow Filtration, Thermal and kind of how orders and funnels are shaping up that would support growth into 2018?
Randy Hogan: Let me talk about Thermal and I'll let - you can talk about processes. So Thermal is really is - I think it's a real bright spot in performance. You just can't see it because of the oil sand projects, which aren't occurring this year. The business has totally repositioned itself, redeployed just focused on the smaller projects, which are frankly more profitable and they're numerous, and on the product sales, and on the servicing the installed base. So we're very active in building the balance sheet - I mean building the backlog, and as we mentioned in the script, margins are up despite the decline in revenue overall, so I am really pleased with Thermal's progress, I think you'll see next year and I'm not going to put out a specific forecast. But I expect to see growth from that next year from the work they're doing in Thermal.
John Stauch: And Jeff on the Water side, we've been hampered by the fact that we had a fairly depleted backlog in our infrastructure pumps and we've been building that backlog. And on a quarterly basis those businesses, the infrastructure pumps are getting better sequentially, and therefore, the year-over-year impact is less. On the Process side and in Filtration, we did have some projects last year as we called it out and once again if you look at the business on the quarterly rate, Q2 versus Q3, Q3 versus Q4, the business is improving and the year-over-year comparisons are easing. And so the business overall is getting healthier and the year-over-year comparisons are easier and that's why we think the organic growth rate begins to accelerate as we head into next year.
Jeffrey Hammond: Okay, great. And then John, just as you kind of develop the Water long-term strategy in your early observations around cultivating organic growth, capital deployment, M&A pipeline? Thanks.
John Stauch: Yes. We'll be talking more in detail on that certainly in our analyst meeting in February, but we do think we - both part of the reason for the spin is so that both companies can look at their own capital allocation strategies. I think both are going to focus on bolt-on M&A and using the capital in discipline way primarily because both have great organic growth opportunities.
Jeffrey Hammond: Thanks guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Stephen Tusa: Hey guys. Good morning.
John Stauch: Good morning, Steve.
Stephen Tusa: What was the pure kind of price cost headwind for the quarter and maybe if you could just talk about updating that on the bridge for the year?
John Stauch: Yes. So Steve just to clarify, inflation for Pentair is running about 2% of cost and that's been pretty steady throughout the year. So when we talk about price cost, the inflation came out of the gate pretty strong, but has been right around that level. It's been the pricing that's been challenged primarily on the Electrical side, the ability to gain the price that we expected as we end the year. It hit what we think is a low point in Q3 and we believe that we're going to start to see increased pricing in Q4 and throughout 2018. On the Water side, we've been right around 50 basis points of price throughout the year, Steve, so we've been able to recover some of that and that's why it's been really isolated to an Electrical explanation.
Stephen Tusa: Got it. And then when we think about the kind of the calendar event here, at what stage will you be able to kind of opine a bit more on the capital allocation priorities of the new companies, and how you see deploying the balance sheet?
Randy Hogan: Well, we want to go through the full strategy in detail with both Beth and John, and that's what we're talking about the February 13th session that we're planning; I guess we're announcing today that we want to do that, so that we can really describe the companies in their own right. But both have top of comparison margins, both have really strong cash flow. And one of the reasons we're splitting the Company as we were fighting the oil and gas downturn in Valves & Controls, these businesses - these businesses weren't funded the way they need to be. And I think this year is beginning to show that that focus is going to make a difference and it's going to make any bigger difference when they're separate because they're - we intend them to deploy that cash flow both in M&A, but also to be consistent with Pentair's legacy of dividends and having a sound balance sheet. And that's what's guiding us right now.
Stephen Tusa: Okay. Great.
John Stauch: Steve, I would just add to that. I think as we've discussed, certainly, we've started to talk about. I think both companies are going to think about simplifying their portfolios, focusing their portfolios, and I think you're going to see capital allocation going to where each company's swindling is identified and making sure that that's clear externally and internally and then our customers understand why they're coming to us to buy our products and we're giving them more what they need.
Stephen Tusa: So just to be clear, I think you had said Water pricing was consistent, but I think it was up more like 1% in the first half, so this is somewhat of a deceleration. What drove that deceleration again?
John Stauch: Yes. That's just where we are in the year-over-year basis, Steve, and that's a fair observation, but we have a seasonal type of pricing plan and that starts generally now as we look at some of our businesses. And so it's really - you'll see that start to get better as we head into 2018.
Stephen Tusa: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.
Randy Hogan: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran from Baird. Your line is open.
Michael Halloran: Hi. Good morning, guys.
Randy Hogan: Good morning.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Michael Halloran: So just trends in the quarter, did those shape up as you expected. I know you highlighted a little improvement, looks like on a segment basis, the underlying expectations for the year are down a little bit I think a point for each. So just curious how the trajectory to the quarter went and how went relative to your expectations?
John Stauch: I mean obviously the revenue number externally hit the expectations. So we did have in the slides last quarter, we had some foreign exchange benefit and what we called core. When you take a look at the absolute numbers of both Electrical and Water both achieved their expectations for the quarter and both are on their expectations for the full-year for a revenue standpoint. So things are trending exactly as expected. Despite having to navigate as Randy mentioned the hurricanes and two relatively important states, so I think we feel good about where we are both and in Q3 and heading into Q4.
Michael Halloran: Then maybe just an update, okay, I'll just add some large project type. Could you just remind me to what extent your large projects are in the fourth quarter? And then I'm assuming there are no large projects going to be assume, so we should get clean organic numbers next year?
Randy Hogan: That is absolutely the goal.
John Stauch: Yes. In Electrical for Q4, the headwind on that for Q4 would be around $8 million.
Michael Halloran: All right. Great. Appreciated guys.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Randy Hogan: Good morning.
Deane Dray: Maybe you can circle back on Filtration & Process and some of the end market color. Desal is always lumpy. Maybe give us a sense of what the visibility you have on some projects over the near term. And then on food and beverage, they've been CapEx or hesitant to spend on CapEx. Is that still the trend? Is there any sense that there might be some share loss there?
Randy Hogan: No, I mean in both of those instances Deane, we have a total forecast booking in diesel of zero in 2017 from a standpoint of major projects. Last year we had roughly $20 million of revenue into a diesel projects. So it's just that there's not a lot going on there. If you look at the industrial wastewater side of membranes that's up double-digit and continuing to improve significantly throughout the year. So we're doing well on what we call the core revenue opportunities and we're not counting on these projects and we don't want to be a project-oriented business. On a food and beverage side, it's just the capital investment is very lumpy right now, due to some consolidation in the space and we're continuing to improve again sequentially throughout the year. It just the year-over-year headwinds reflect, strength in those projects last year.
Deane Dray: Great, and then just as a follow-up, can you highlight some of the dynamics this quarter across the geographies and then specifically what do you seeing in China, especially on the Residential side?
Randy Hogan: Yes, so Residential and Commercial for China is primarily - there's a little bit in Thermal as well in Electrical. But we're up in the high-teens, year-over-year basis, so performing well. I still we think we have opportunities there that we need to capture by being a little bit more local in the way we go to market. Europe is actually up slightly and so it's hanging in there, despite our forecast of that being more challenged. It's actually done better and obviously the United States is strong here as we finish the year.
Deane Dray: Was that China high-teens - was that overall company?
Randy Hogan: Yes.
Deane Dray: Great, thank you.
Randy Hogan: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Walsh from Vertical Research. Your line is open.
John Walsh: Hi, good morning.
Randy Hogan: Hey, John.
John Walsh: Hey, so not meaning to nit-pick on this number, but as we think about the Q4 free cash flow bridge, I mean normal seasonality at least in my model gets you pretty close to 100 and I don't know if it's just the squiggle or are there any other items on a year-over-year basis either timing of cash tax or anything like that to be aware of or is it all normal seasonality that drives that lift in Q4?
Randy Hogan: No, it's what it is. I mean if - you said, do we think we're slam dunking a 100% this year, no. I mean there's probably some margin of error to that and that margin of error would be driven by the fact that both sides are also looking at how we optimize the portfolios and what restructuring we're doing and the number that we're giving you includes the restructuring headwinds or restructuring cash headwinds as well. So we want to knew both we want to delivered the strong free cash flow, which we think comes from working capital, but we also want to set both companies up for a really successful spend.
John Stauch: One of the capabilities that we've built in Pentair has been a focus on cash flow and managing for cash, because cash is what the bills and we have a solid track record and we have in sent people. It's part of the incentives. So I'm quite confident in our cash flow forecast.
John Walsh: Gotcha, and then as my second question, as we're starting to get the filings here, should we think that the portfolios are pretty static? I mean I think there were some comments probably within both portfolios maybe more so in Water that there could be some pruning at some point maybe in term of product lines where you might not have full scale relative to other competitors, but I guess you kind of address the addition earlier in the call, but what about on the subtraction side and are they pretty set now going into the separation of that?
Randy Hogan: Well, John mentioned earlier that we're taking the opportunity to really look at the whole portfolio and simplifying streamlining and prioritizing, and by prioritizing I mean what are we going to double down in nVest and that's going to leave things on the other end of the spectrum. And so we'll take a look at those and we'd like to do that earlier rather than later in this process. So that we can have the new companies are focused on growth. So I would say we're not done with that, but it is a priority to accomplish.
John Walsh: All right. Thank you.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Scott Graham: Hey. Good morning.
John Stauch: Hey, Scott.
Scott Graham: I was just hoping you could help us maybe it's my understanding of how some things are presented here. So when we look at the slides on Pages 6 and 7 for the acquisition large jobs piece. I guess I would have thought that that would have only been one number whereas you kind of have a different number representing the bar versus the 2016 large jobs and those numbers, and maybe you can just sort of help us understand how those numbers tie into your Page 14?
John Stauch: Sure. I mean, I think first of all, I mean I think we've given the data there, but let me just make sure it's clear. When you think about these large jobs and just as a reminder, these are jobs that we shipped in 2016 that have no shipments in them for 2017, right. So everything is behind us, we have not been producing on these large jobs, but it is a year-over-year headwind and that's why 2018 is so longer an issue. But those large jobs roughly in Q3 were $31 million as we highlight. And if you break that down, it's about $25 million-ish in Electrical and the remainder is in Water.
Scott Graham: Yes. I get that and as you were talking, John, I think I actually just answered my question because I think on Page 14, we're supposed to take the large jobs and the acquisition divestiture columns and add them together.
John Stauch: Right.
Scott Graham: Right, that's kind of where this is, okay. I apologize for that. Lack of confusion. Now on the press release, you say core sales declined 1% and that's an absolute number. Is there - you also had fewer days this quarter right?
John Stauch: That's correct. We have one less day.
Scott Graham: Okay. So what was that impact for [indiscernible], so your organic sales really didn't decline 1% apples-to-apples excluding the large job impact, but apples-to-apples on the days to days, you were essentially flat?
John Stauch: That's correct.
Scott Graham: Okay, great. Thank you. John, I know this is really kind of up your alley that the margin expansion has been excellent this year. Could you tell us kind of what the 100 plus basis points of improvement this quarter was sort of cost savings wise from - and maybe just sort of give us some buckets. I understand price cost might have been a little bit negative, but maybe give us a little bit on what the restructuring savings were verses sort of pure productivity?
John Stauch: Yes. So if you take a look at where we are on a cost out basis, we've hinted strongly and we had that slide before that we're on a run rate greater than $100 million. And so when you think about where we are here in Q3, we're getting a full quarter benefit of that. And so a lot of cost out here Scott and all relative to the fact that when we sold Valves & Controls, we needed to resize the organizations for what is now a $5 billion company and both of them are also focusing on a $3 billion and $2 billion company. So there has been a lot of effort and work and the change have really done a really nice job getting after the cost side. So significant productivity there and thinking of that is at least $25 million in the quarter.
Scott Graham: And that's exactly what I was looking for. Thank you. And the last question simply is as the quarter progressed, could you kind of tell us how the order rates progressed in each segments?
John Stauch: Sure. I'll give you directionally where they are, but we thought we would see strengthening Electrical orders and throughout the year and we have been seeing that pretty steady Q2, Q3. And it actually improved in Q3 even versus Q2 on a daily order rate basis. So we're seeing recovery, I mean some of that's probably related to some of the oil and gas recovery we're seeing down setting.
Randy Hogan: I think more stabilizing…
John Stauch: Stabilizing and then I think that continues to be a driver as well as Industrial volumes, Scott. On the Water side, really had healthy residential commercial throughout the year and I think people have thought that that would slow. We have not seen slowing in that space. And we're seeing recovering on the industrial wastewater side and also the Industrial investments. So right now I think exiting Q3 and Q4, things are strengthening pretty much across the board.
Scott Graham: Great. Thanks a lot.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Steven Winoker from UBS Research. Your line is open.
Randy Hogan: Welcome back Steve.
Steven Winoker: Hey. Thanks guys. Appreciate that. Good to be back. Listen, just a question, Randy, on following up your comments around under investment in the business given the Valves & Controls pressure over time. I know you meant capital allocation, but from a sales and marketing and R&D standpoint, can you maybe comment on kind of where those were taken to and the question of normalization in those investment areas across the business to kind of where we stand now versus under those pressure times?
Randy Hogan: Well, I can't give a specific number, but I think the focus, certainly my focus on the crisis we're having on Valves & Controls because of energy, reduced the amount of focus we had on driving organic growth. And so some of the sales and marketing investments that were still made just didn't payoff. They didn't payoff. And that's part of the simplification and redirection we want to make right now in both Water and in Electrical. So there were investments going on. Now we are also holding those businesses accountable to make their numbers. So they probably didn't put all the investment than they would have wanted to. If we had the kind of performance we've had over most of my 17 years, which is pointing at the bleachers and then hitting it towards that. I wouldn't point to any specific thing that was in both Water and Electrical and it was one of the things that we considered as a board that told us that we - these businesses are going to perform even better separate than they will together.
Steven Winoker: Have you brought back those investment levels though or the effectiveness, I mean you're mentioning things around payoff on what you guys are investing?
Randy Hogan: One of our objectives and John just talked about; we've taken more than $100 million in cost out. But what we've taken out is structure. As we've collapsed, we've collapsed segment and corporate into - there's only two corporates now. We are actually investing in marketing. We've put in Chief Growth Officers. We put it in Water. We're putting one in Electrical. We've high graded our assignments in marketing and we're investing in a number of places. One of the reasons in fact in Water that we're doing well in Residential Filtration is we've been investing in sales resources there for probably last two years I'd say. So I'd say we've begun, but there's more to do.
Steven Winoker: Okay. And just a reminder, John, if you could. I know the things are going to move around obviously a lot. But just remind us about the difference in free cash flow conversion characteristics between the two if not stand up companies the two divisions at this point?
John Stauch: Yes. Right now, Steve, I'd say each are going to be roughly around that 100% of adjusted net income, which as you know adds back amortization. So they're both strong cash flow generators. The only difference is the seasonality and Water will have a more of a dip in Q1 as we have our Residential loads and we collect those in Q2. And Electrical is lot more linear in its producing of its cash flow throughout the year, but on an annual basis, both are strong cash flow generators and both about 100%.
Steven Winoker: Okay. I'll leave it with two questions. Thanks guys.
Randy Hogan: Steve, welcome back.
Steven Winoker: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Robert Barry from Susquehanna. Your line is open.
Michael DeLalio: Good morning. This is Mike DeLalio on for Rob.
Randy Hogan: Hi, Mike.
Michael DeLalio: Hey. Anything notable holding back the Enclosures business with industrial macro data so strong, we have expected growth to be a little better there?
Randy Hogan: I think it's a business that generally lags by about six months. So that's why we've been confident it would build. And the other piece of it is there's two parts of Enclosures, part of it is Electronics, and part of it is Industrial. So the Industrial growth is about what you think it would be which are more than twice the overall Enclosures, but we do have the drag of some large telecom projects. I don't want to use that very well pressure and telecom business that has nothing growing this year.
Michael DeLalio: Okay that makes sense. And can you remind us of your U.S. non-res exposure and what the outlook there? We've had some concerns non-res market growth has starting to slow?
John Stauch: U.S. loans…
Randy Hogan: Yes, I mean I would contend that we're seeing slowing, but we're still seeing mid single-digit type of projections versus coming down from a high single-digit. So it's still what we would call a relatively strong opportunity, and so I think - yes we are seeing a little bit slowing, but it's still around mid single-digits.
Michael DeLalio: Okay, thank you.
Randy Hogan: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Nathan Jones from Stifel. Your line is open.
Nathan Jones: Good morning, everyone.
Randy Hogan: Good morning.
Nathan Jones: If I could just go back to the Filtration & Process, Flow Tech, and Thermal Management, the businesses that have been down this year, some of that's large projects. It sounded like Randy; you think Thermal's going to grow next year. The two Water businesses look to be flattening out potentially growing. Do you think you've got the cost structure for those businesses appropriate for the level of revenue? Is there more cost cutting that needs to be done, if you're expecting growth is that the cost that need to be added back just where you think you are with the cost structure in those businesses?
Randy Hogan: On the Thermal side, one of the big reasons we've had margin expansion as we have adjusted the cost structure and at the same time we invested a new products. We increased our R&D activities in Thermal, and we redeployed sales coverage from the really large projects in the oil and gas business to focus more on Industrial MRO. And so I think that's already well-positioned and we're in the process of doing that and in Water. I think virtually all the costs are out. And there are investments to be made, but there in our plan, there in our forecasts.
Nathan Jones: And then just one question on - it's on the Slide 7; the productivity bucket on segment income for Electrical was it zero this quarter versus $12 million last quarter? Can you just talk a little bit about why there wasn't any visible productivity improvement this quarter timing, whatever the case maybe?
John Stauch: Yes, I would say it's primarily timing.
Randy Hogan: But there was some productivity issues because the Hurricanes too.
John Stauch: So expedited shipping things and timing.
Nathan Jones: Okay, so that's something that you would expect to reaccelerate in the fourth quarter?
Randy Hogan: Absolutely.
John Stauch: Yes.
Nathan Jones: All right, thanks very much.
Randy Hogan: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Brian Drab from William Blair. Your line is open.
Brian Drab: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.
Randy Hogan: Hey, Brian.
Brian Drab: I just wanted to get a little more detail on the Thermal business, you talk about more small projects in that business and just wondering if you could elaborate on which end markets and regions you're seeing the strongest demand from and are you seeing the MRO business turning back on in the Energy business with some of the larger customers there?
Randy Hogan: Yes, I mean like - really we're seeing strength everywhere. I wouldn't call it any particular market geographically as stronger. Our focus on Industrial and the application of Thermal Management technologies is more than just oil and gas or you chemicals and then some other process industries. I think our increased focus there may be helping us. And then when we talk about products, we're really talking about MRO. These are product - these are installations that need to be serviced and we return to - I think a more normal level of maintenance spending in the oil and gas industry and I think that's been a - I think that that's stability is giving rise to some predictable and attractive business opportunities.
Brian Drab: Is there a chance you're going to see this business really step up over the next few years for some of these petrochem projects ramping?
Randy Hogan: Well, we have a right to play in those and we are competing for them. And so I expect that that will be a positive market benefit for us and again I don't want to front run Beth with our forecast.
Brian Drab: Understood, and then can you just - and then you said that hurricane damage is really immaterial, but in the fourth quarter when you see some tailwind related to - I don't know damage to refineries in Texas or Enclosures business in general or the pool business even?
Randy Hogan: Even pools, yes.
John Stauch: Yes.
Brian Drab: Is that a just yes? No, we're not - does that mean we're certain those to the extent of that tailwind and it's not material though you're saying, is that…?
John Stauch: No.
Randy Hogan: We view it as - it's hard to say it's something like that investors and net positive to be over time.
Brian Drab: Okay, understood. Thanks.
Randy Hogan: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Joseph Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
John Stauch: Hey, Joe.
Joseph Ritchie: Hey. Maybe just sticking on Thermal for second, for the fourth quarter - what's the drag from the large projects in 4Q and to the extent that you can maybe just quantify quoting activity X that's clearly the large projects in 3Q. I'm just trying to get a sense for how healthy things are?
John Stauch: Yes. So Q4 is about $8 million of 2016 shipments that are still in the year-over-year comparisons. So significantly down from the 25-ish that we had in Q3. So the year-over-year headwinds are dissipating. And as far as quoting activity in Thermal, it's accelerating and backlog building is accelerating.
Joseph Ritchie: Okay. Fair enough. I also noted that restructuring looks like you've kind of gotten through all your restructuring actions for the year de minimis in 4Q. How should we be thinking about that next year for the two separate entities? Is there any color on that at this point?
John Stauch: Yes. So we don't really forecast what we don't know, but I think both businesses will be looking at opportunities to prioritize their portfolios and to simplify the portfolio as we head into next year. And I think over Q4 and Q1 there could still be a little bit left in the tank.
Joseph Ritchie: Okay. Got it. Maybe one last one, John, you mentioned earlier on the pricing side being a little bit more difficult to get pricing on the Electrical side of the business. Are you guys - is there some type of a lag that we should expect? I mean is there a possibility for a tailwind for that business next year or is it just that the markets right now across that that piece of the portfolio are pretty competitive and we just shouldn't expect much from a pricing standpoint moving forward?
John Stauch: No, I think what they are a seasonal price increases that go on standard cycles and it's really hard to get the off cycle through. I think there's a natural cycle that gets followed and I think we're expecting that price next year is better than it was this year, but you got to be moving with the system. And I think it was hard to move incrementally against that system throughout the year.
Randy Hogan: Well and when the market was not growing, it's harder to get pricing and we priced to a different expectation for these businesses and earlier in another…
Joseph Ritchie: Okay. Got it. Thanks guys.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions. I'll now turn the call back to Randy Hogan for closing comments.
Randy Hogan: Okay, great. Just in sum, we believe our third quarter was another positive step towards demonstrating the return to predictable and improving performance in our business since we divested Valves & Controls. Both Water and Electrical are building momentum as you heard in our comments and questions as we exit 2017. We remain confident in our ability to deliver double-digit EPS growth for the year. And as we highlighted earlier in the call, we're making great progress in standing up Pentair and nVent to be both successful and thrive after separation next year. Thank you for your continued interest and operator you can conclude the call.

Jim Lucas: Thanks, Hope, and welcome to Pentair’s second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. We’re glad you could join us. I’m Jim Lucas, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with me today is Randy Hogan, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Stauch, our Chief Financial Officer. On today’s call, we will provide details on our second quarter 2017 performance as well as our third quarter and full year 2017 outlook, as outlined in this morning’s release. Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company’s anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as the risks outlined in Pentair’s most recent 10-Q and today’s release. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results. Today’s webcast is accompanied by a presentation which can be found in the Investors section of Pentair’s website. We will reference these slides throughout our prepared remarks. Any references to non-GAAP financials are reconciled in the appendix of the presentation. We will be sure to reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. I would like to request that you limit your questions to one and a follow-up in order to ensure everyone an opportunity to ask their questions. I will now turn the call over to Randy.
Randy Hogan: Thanks Jim. We’re pleased that our second quarter performance came in slightly out of our expectations. Sales were in line with guidance, while segment income and adjusted EPS slightly exceeded the high end of our range. We completed the sale of our Valves & Controls business during the second quarter and with the proceeds had significantly improved our balance sheet. Later in the call John will discuss the balance sheet in more detail and the impact of the Valves & Controls sales closing somewhat later than our initial timeline. We’ve tightened our full year adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $3.50 per share, which is the midpoint of our prior guidance. We experienced higher than planned interest expense in the first half due to the delay in the Valves & Controls close. And we’ve also seen our share count increase modestly. Offsetting these two headwinds was our better first half operating performance. Performance that we believe is carrying momentum into the second half of the year. Also factored into our tightened guidance is the fact that we will incur some incremental redundant corporate costs in the second half, as we prepared to spin-off our Electrical business next year. With an improving top line, continued margin expansion and a stronger balance sheet, we believe the prospects are bright for both our Water and Electrical businesses exiting 2017. Now let’s turn to Slide 5 for a discussion of our second quarter 2017 results. As mentioned, the second quarter performance was in line with our top line expectations and a little better from an income and adjusted EPS standpoint. Adjusted core sales declined 1% in the quarter, but we’re up 1% for the first half. This is important to mention, because the pool season heated up in March this year as opposed to April a year ago, resulting in a tough comparison in the second quarter. Segment income grew 6% and operating margins expanded an impressive 170 basis points with both segments delivering margin expansion greater than 100 basis points and corporate expense coming in a little more favorable than we’d anticipated. We’re pleased with our strong margin expansion, which we were able to deliver despite worse material inflation and price recovery than planned. Adjusted EPS grew 14% to $1, which exceeded the high end of our guidance by $0.01 despite incurring a slightly higher interest expense and share count during the quarter. Free cash flow of $289 million during the quarter was in line with normal seasonality following the cash usage reported in the first quarter. Now let’s turn to Slide 6 for a look at Water performance in Q2. Our Water segment delivered an adjusted core sales decline of 1%. Segment income grew 5% and return on sales expanded a very healthy 120 basis points. Our Filtration & Process business saw a core sales decline 3%, and strength in our residential and food service businesses were offset by ongoing softness in global diesel and muted spending in the beer industry. Food service was the bright spot in the quarter growing high single digits on strength in the convenience and grocery store channels. Floor technology saw a core sales declined 4% as we continue to proven lower margin product lines and focus on driving margin and cash flow improvement. We saw our Residential and Irrigation business grow in the quarter, but this was not enough to offset continued weakness in our engineered pump businesses serving industrial and infrastructure. We saw orders improved for those large pumps for the second consecutive quarter indicating that we’ve reached the bottom in this business. But we’re not expecting the top line to benefit from those improved orders until 2018. Finally, our Precision Spray business which largely serves agriculture bodes another quarter of healthy growth. Following a very strong first quarter Aquatic & Environmental Systems saw a core sales grow 1%, which yielded our first half core sales growth of 7%, in line with the growth rate seen in the past several years in the business and what we expect to continue. As a reminder, the pool business can be impacted by timing of the season, which is what we believe happened this year between the first and second quarter. We continue to look for Aquatic & Environmental Systems to deliver another strong year of growth in 2017. Now let’s move to Slide 7, for a look at Electrical performance in Q2. Adjusted core sales grew 1% in Electrical as the strength we saw in the first quarter carried over into the second quarter. Segment income grew 1% and return on sales expanded a robust 140 basis points due to improved mix and ramping productivity. Within Electrical Enclosures declined 1% and remained a tale of two verticals. Our Industrial business grew mid single digits for the second consecutive quarter and we believe this represents momentum that will carry over into the second half. Offsetting this strength with continued softness at our smaller telecom business, which continue to match the strength within the Industrial business. Core sales in Thermal declined to 12%, as a reminder our Thermal business is facing a nearly $100 million top line headwind in 2017 as three large jobs from 2016 were completed. Excluding these large jobs, which we’ve called out before, we saw Thermal grow on both the projects and product side of the business. The focus continues to be on aligning the business to a smaller order size world and the underlying improvement in the second quarter gives us increased confidence that the business should exit 2017 in a strong position. Our Electrical & Fastening Solutions business saw a core sales decline following 7% growth in the first quarter. The Commercial business remained strong with the quarterly volatility stemming from the smaller infrastructure related business. As we mentioned last quarter, this piece of Electrical has faced a fair amount of material inflation to start the year and we’ve continued to take select price actions to help mitigate some of those higher inflation. We expect the Commercial business to continue to grow in the back half and we’ll look at areas to help reduce the quarterly infrastructure volatility experienced in the past few quarters. Please turn to Slide 8, for an update on our planned separation. Before turning the call over to John to discuss the financial outlook in more detail, I wanted to provide an update on the separation now what we’ve made in May. As a reminder our Board has approved a plan to spin-off our Electrical business, which we expect to be completed in the second quarter of 2018. We’ve organized a dedicated project management office that is currently driving some 20 different work streams. We’ve made the decision on the organizational structure of the direct reports to the future CEO’s of both companies and the next level work is underway. We expect to have an initial Form-10 filing during the fourth quarter. Finally, we should have further updates on the capital structure of both companies by early 2018. Our second quarter performance was another step towards regularly delivering our forecast of the business. The second quarter performance also highlights, why we believe the long-term prospects of both businesses are attractive. We’re excited for Pentair’s next chapters; we create two industry leading pure play companies, one in Water and one in Electrical. We strongly believe that both companies are well positioned for long-term growth and value creation with the scale and strength to control their own destinies. The increased focus of both companies should help to raise the execution even further and drive higher differentiated growth. Both companies can become appreciated for the jewels that they are. I’ll now turn the call over to John.
John Stauch: Thank you, Randy. Please turn to Slide number 9, title Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. We ended the second quarter with a dramatically improved balance sheet after using the proceeds from our sale of Valves & Controls to retire a significant portion of our debt. Our ending debt balance was $1.7 billion, which was does not include nearly $200 million of cash on hand at the end of the quarter. We had a strong free cash flow quarter in line with seasonal trends. But our first half performance trailed the comparable period last year due primarily to a couple of higher tax payments in 2017. We continue to target free cash flow equal to adjusted net income for the full year. Our ROIC continue to improve and we ended the quarter at 11.1%. Please turn to the Slide 10, title 2017 Cost Out Update. We provided this slide last quarter as an update on our cost out actions, which are now completed. We are now on track to realize over $80 million of net cost benefits in 2017, which is up slightly from the target we presented last quarter. We remain on track to exit the fourth quarter benefits yielding greater than $100 million of net cost out in 2018. The reorganization activities that we began right after we announced the sale of Valves & Controls are now behind us. And we must now move forward with setting up the organization structures with two independent companies. Please turn to Slide 11, label 2017 Guidance Update. Slide 11 is an update of what we’ve presented last quarter when our strong first quarter operational beat offset higher interest expense due to the delayed closing of the Valves & Controls sale. While we’ve successfully closed the transaction in the second quarter and subsequently retired a significant amount of debt. The tender process was completed later in the quarter resulting in slightly higher than anticipated interest expense in the second quarter. This was offset by better than expected operating performance. We also have seen our share count increase as the stock has appreciated this year. While the higher than expected interest expense in the first half was offset by higher operating performance, we have one other factor influencing our decision to update the full year guidance to approximately $3.50 per share from a range that included $3.50 as the midpoint of that range. As we are preparing to stand up two companies to be publicly traded, we will incur some overlapping costs in the second half, as we prepare for the spin-off Electrical in the second quarter next year. I would remind you however, that our goal remains to have two public companies with minimal incremental corporate costs. Please turn to Slide 12, labeled Q3 2017 Pentair Outlook. We are introducing third quarter adjusted EPS guidance of $0.91 to $0.93 per share, which is an 18% increase at the midpoint of the range. We expect the adjusted core sales to grow approximately 4% for the third quarter with both segments expected increase at that rate. We anticipate segment income increasing approximately 5% and return on sales to increase roughly 70 basis points and approaching 19%. The tax rate is expected to be 20%, net interest expense of $13 million, and the share count should be around $184 million. Free cash flow is expected to continue to improve in line with historical seasonal patterns. Please turn to Slide 13, labeled Full Year 2017 Pentair Outlook. While we did see some shifting of top line growth from Q1 to Q2, we’ve seen improvement continue in our short cycle Industrial businesses and our Residential and Commercial businesses have remained healthy. As a result, we expect full year adjusted core sales to be up 2% versus our prior forecast to flat. We expect segment income to increase 6%, ROS to expand roughly 100 basis points around 18% and adjusted EPS to grow approximately 15%. We continue to target free cash flow to be 100% of adjusted net income. I would now like to turn the call over to Hope for Q&A. After which Randy will have a few closing remarks. Hope, please open the line for questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
Steve Tusa: Hey guys, good morning. So Slide 20 talks about you’re shipping days dynamics maybe I’m not sure if you call this out explicitly in the first quarter. But how much do you think it impacted kind of Q2 and maybe quantify how much it will be in kind of Q3, saying it normalizes in the fourth quarter?
John Stauch: Yes. It’s somewhere between 1% and 2% impact, Steve.
Steve Tusa: Okay. So that’s kind of contemplated obviously in the third quarter guide?
John Stauch: Yes. It is.
Randy Hogan: Yes.
Steve Tusa: Okay. Got it. And then can you just quantify the higher costs in the second half? I mean, I guess from an operating perspective relative to what you were expecting. Did you actually kind of tweak up that operating performance in the second half? What are the sources of that?
John Stauch: Yes. I think, as you take a look at the second half obviously we have some benefits from foreign exchange, it’s dropping through it called low double digit benefits. And then we have the stronger organic growth, which is offset slightly by the material and more difficult pricing environment. And then operating wise we would have expected to deliver a little bit more income, but we’re planning to – have to transition to the two corporate structures and bringing on those costs. And then certainly getting back to hopefully a minimal incremental cost as we spend, Steve, but we have to balance all that, while delivering 2017 and standing up two successful public companies in 2018.
Steve Tusa: Right. Okay. And then just on this price cost stuff. Can you maybe just give us some color and quantify what you were expecting at the beginning of the year? And then where you are now and what kind of price for that kind of enterprise are you looking at?
Randy Hogan: Yes. I’m just overall, Steve, I mean for both Water and Electrical, I’d say that we’re looking at somewhere between $15 million and $20 million headwind for the full year. Some of that realized in Q1 and Q2 and then Q3 and Q4 related to little less benefit from pricing, and a little stronger impact from inflation on the sources side, both of them together.
Steve Tusa: Okay. And then just on the pricing side. For the enterprise, what do you expect for the year?
John Stauch: Just under a point.
Steve Tusa: Positive price.
John Stauch: Correct.
Steve Tusa: Okay. Great thanks.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jeff Hammond: Hey, good morning guys.
Randy Hogan: Good morning, Jeff.
Jeff Hammond: Just back on price cost, can you just talk about what’s driving maybe a little more challenging environment on the pricing side. Are there certain businesses where you’re struggling to get price or is it just a timing issue?
Randy Hogan: Yes, Jeff. I mean, I think we started the year anticipating the fact that as inflation rises both of our businesses Water and Electrical have historically been able to take advantage of those situations and raise price in the industry and have that price accepted and therefore mitigate most all of the material inflation. I think we were concerned about one issue this year, which was we’ve never had that experience with a stronger U.S. dollar. And we’re seeing the fact that most of the channels that we participate are fighting on price and therefore asking us to absorb and become more productive in serving them. And that’s the way it’s playing out. The good news is there’s a lot more growth and I think we’re all experienced in that growth and we’re able to offset that impact. But it’s generally across the board, Jeff.
Jeff Hammond: Okay. And can you talk about what your plans are for your second half free cash flow. And as you get closer to the spin how you’re thinking about leverage within the two companies? Thanks.
Randy Hogan: Yes, Jeff we haven’t – we’re thinking about that. But we’re not in a position to share that yet. We’re running different scenarios and planning for what the capital structure to be at both companies, but we don’t have any information yet.
Jeff Hammond: Okay. Thanks guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning everyone.
Randy Hogan: Hey, Deane.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Deane Dray: Maybe start with Aquatic. You called out the tough comp in the second quarter. We know weather is the big factor there. And the first half looks like you’re on track. Or anything else other than weather that contributed and was a factor in the second quarter for Aquatic?
Randy Hogan: When you look at, we had such a strong quarter last year and the season started late, it didn’t start until mid-April. And this year it started early. So we had a great March. And that really explains all the difference. When we look at the sell-through in the channel and we look at the activity in the end market, we think that business is every bit as strong as it has been, hence my comments about it. The 7% growth in the first half is more representative of the kind of growth we expect in the industry. So it’s really just timing.
Deane Dray: Got it. You also called out a pipeline of new product introductions. Maybe some color there and would any be launched this season? And would they move the needle this season?
Randy Hogan: They’ll be introduced this season, but they won’t move the needle this season. We continue to be the innovator in the industry. So we’re not going to give up that mantle.
Deane Dray: Got it. And then over on Electrical. Maybe if you can expand on the infrastructure volatility. What do you actually seeing is this shorter cycle?
Randy Hogan: It’s really rail related, I mean, if you take a look at commercial and what I would call more traditional industrial is just fine. But the infrastructure, there was an anticipation that we would be spending on roads and bridges. Now here in Minnesota, looks like you what we are, but broadly in the rest of the country, it doesn’t picked-up as much. And then rail spending is off. And that’s for our EFS business, that’s the biggest part of the infrastructure.
Deane Dray: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets.
Scott Graham: Hey, good morning.
Randy Hogan: Hey Scott.
Scott Graham: I’m just wondering if you guys can give us a little bit more on the third quarter sales improvement that you’re talking about. Maybe just kind of give us something on the business lines, which you think are going to be the bigger contributors?
John Stauch: Yes. I think just to mention this, this dynamic between Q1 and Q2 that Randy mentioned is roughly $20 million of revenue in pool that shifted amongst the two quarters. And so, when you take a look at Q3 and where we’re shooting for the core organic growth rate, I mean, it’s not – that one item generally explains it and then a little bit easier comparisons in some of our businesses like Enclosures and Electrical and then ultimately water technologies in Water. So it’s really about keeping the same general shipment rate that we saw in Q2 and then just the comparison year-over-year in Q3.
Scott Graham: Okay. And then further on that John within Water I know that you guys are – let’s just say, quietly deemphasizing some of the businesses there. Was there a half a point or a point drag or nothing discernible?
John Stauch: Yes. I’d say somewhere around a half a point is a fair estimate. And I mean, Randy has asked both Beth and I to look at the types of things that maybe we could have done $5 billion company that might not make sense in $3 billion and $2 billion company. So we’re both actively looking at our infrastructures and support primarily in fast growth region…
Randy Hogan: And the initiatives.
John Stauch: And initiatives, and we’re trying to make sure that those projects are eliminated and also that we’re addressing how to serve each of the regions that we serve in a more effective way.
Scott Graham: Got you. Last question is on the incremental separation cost, you’re talking about within the guidance. We can see that roll through corporate or is that going to be within the volumes?
John Stauch: Actually most of that will roll through what we have in the Electrical business, Scott.
Scott Graham: Very good. Thanks.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.
Ronnie Weiss: Hey, guys. Ronnie Weiss on for Julian.
Randy Hogan: Hey, good morning.
Ronnie Weiss: Good morning. On the free cash flow big, big cash inflow from the working capital as sales ramp in Q3 and Q4. Do you guys kind of assume the same kind of benefit going through? And just talk a little bit about the improvements being made there.
Randy Hogan: We’re seeing normal seasonality, we see that because particularly Water is so seasonal. The cash flows are following the normal pattern with a negative cash flow in the first quarter a big pickup in the second quarter and then continue to building in the third and fourth. I wouldn’t expect the pattern to be any different.
Ronnie Weiss: Got it. And then just on the margins for Q3, guided up 70 basis points, a lot stronger in Q2. Is all of that contributed to some of the stronger material cost headwinds you’re seeing? Or is there some mix issue in there as well. Just talk a little bit about that.
Randy Hogan: Yes. There’s a little bit of mix issue, I mean, it is not the strongest pool quarter. Our Aquatic’s businesses got a pretty good margin. So that’s the only mix issue and the rest is just Q2 performance carryover to Q3.
Ronnie Weiss: Got it. Thanks.
Randy Hogan: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Walsh with Vertical Research.
John Walsh: Hi, good morning.
Randy Hogan: Hey, John.
John Stauch: Good morning.
John Walsh: Just wanted to know, if we get a little finer point on the full-year Electrical margin. So we’re now at 22%, you talked about a couple of different items impacting that. Just want to know if we can deconstruct those buckets, it looks like there’s some overlapping costs that sit there, we had the commodity discussion. Maybe there’s some mix impact as well. But maybe if you can talk about it from that 23% to the 22% in that kind of walk.
Randy Hogan: Where is the 23 come in front of you? Okay, let’s go. So, I mean, it really is just one item. And it’s the fact that we are now projecting for the rest of the year what we believe the realized price and the realized material inflation will be and that is the only difference between the two forecasts.
John Walsh: Okay. And then just kind of one point of clarification for the models, is the large project impact for the next quarter is $27 million. Is that’s the right ballpark number we should be using?
Randy Hogan: You’re talking about for the – in Electrical?
John Walsh: Yes. For the entire, I guess, it’s primarily Electrical for the entire company. Can you walk back through the adjusted core?
John Stauch: Yes. For Q3 that’s right.
John Walsh: Okay.
John Stauch: And then slightly less than $10 million in Q4.
John Walsh: All right, great. Thank you, appreciate it.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Wolfe Research.
Randy Hogan: Hello, Mr. Pokrzywinski.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Good morning. John, can you just talk about some of the seasonality in – I suspect it’s Thermal in the fourth quarter or just the uptick in the Electrical growth in the fourth quarter. I get the comp as easier but it still seems like there’s a lot of push out in especially some of these larger energy projects. Can you talk about maybe the 3Q to 4Q walk there and maybe the seasonality of margins that gets attached as well?
John Stauch: Yes, I’ll start it and I’ll have Randy as we color. But I mean, one of the things we’re finally realizing and we saw it happen in Q2 is refining and moving into positive territory on the MRO and the aftermarket and small projects on the Thermal side. So we’ve seen a really good uptick in our Thermal revenue in the heat-tracing side especially related to the downstream maintenance that we’ve anticipated for some period of time. So that’s a big positive and then as we move into Q3 and Q4 that is the season that Thermal certainly benefits from the industry and the anticipation, the cold weather…
Randy Hogan: Yes, both commercial and industrial. Particularly as winter cools-off I guess, winter heats up is rather its better term. That’s really Thermal’s biggest season. And the nice thing is the smaller projects and the products MRO it’s a better mix of business. So, I’m pretty please right now with the progress we’re making in Thermal. So each side, Water seasonal business is obviously the pool. And on the Electrical side the business that really experiences the seasonality of Thermal. And then everything else is steady state throughout the year.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Got you. So this is just a small project MRO phenomenon, there is really – there’s nothing else do you guys have anticipated in the backlog.
Randy Hogan: No, no.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Okay. And then just one more from me, square away some of the – maybe put a finer point on the corporate headwinds or I guess costs headwinds related to this spend versus where we’re coming out on currency versus where we’re coming out on inflation. I know the walk that you guys gave in the deck, had some higher level comments but it seems like everything I just mentioned be more of a second half dynamic that can really get bridged out per se.
Randy Hogan: So Josh, if you want us to square away – are you an old Navy guy? Square away, it’s pretty good. Anyhow, so as we set up the – we’re really standing up to companies, we have an open CFO job, we have two open CHRO jobs, we want to get these jobs hired, we want to get – so there’s going to be some overlapping as people come and go. But those all go to the P&L. And those are just a couple of examples. But as John said, our objective is to minimize any leakage if you will at the corporate cost level in another words we minimize any additions once we’re on a separate run rate in the two companies.
Josh Pokrzywinski: So I guess maybe from a high level, should we think about currency and inflation is being a push then?
John Stauch: Yes, a couple of things. I mean, keep in mind we’re raising our income $10 million and that’s going to cover shares in the back half of the year. If you think about it, we have some benefit from foreign exchange as I mentioned, that’s low double digits. Call that roughly $10 million, we have some operational benefits and revenue benefits. And then we’re offsetting the combination of the slightly higher material cost and the incremental transition cost of the corporate side. Josh, that’s the positive $10 million in the outlook. So I don’t want to quantify it because we don’t know it, right? But we have to manage it while delivering 2017 and also stand up both public companies in 2018.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Understood. Thanks for the color.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.
Joe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning guys.
Randy Hogan: Good morning.
Joe Ritchie: Maybe just kind of stand on inflation for a second, kind of the emerging themes we’ve been hearing about this quarter is raising steel costs and the inability for a lot of the companies that we cover to pass on those costs. You guys are talking about a little bit more inflation, in the back half of the year. Maybe just touch on that topic and how much of your business is impacted by steel?
John Stauch: Yes, we buy roughly a couple of hundred million dollars of steel, the end markets that utilize the steel, probably somewhere around, $1.5 billion, Randy. So, I mean, material is not the highest cost of our – I mean it’s the highest costs, but it’s not the huge percentage of the revenue. But it’s a phenomenon, that usually when inflation comes, we can pass it along. And I think this year, as we said earlier and I made this comment, we’d never dealt with the stronger dollar before and there are competitors on at Europe, who have a better cost position then they did have a year before. And so you’re hearing these things about price transparency and the Internet and everything else, like that. I don’t think our products are really installed in that way or affected by it. But I do ultimately think that we’ve got a cost conscious end-user. And that challenges being pushed on our channel and we are being expected to absorb the majority of the costs this year. And it’s reflected in our guidance and I think that as we go forward, we’ll look at the opportunities to adjust that appropriately as we ahead into 2018.
Joe Ritchie: Got it, okay. That’s fair. I guess maybe, my one follow-on question, I don’t think we’ve touched on it yet, is really on the Enclosures business. So you called out, good industrial strength, within the quarter, core growth is still down slightly. And you mentioned that you had telecom headwinds are going to alleviate, as comps get easier, after 2Q. So can you just maybe talk about the trajectory, from here, when you expect this business to drive the positive organic growth?
Randy Hogan: Yes, we expect a better second half for sure. Actually on the telecom side, we had some big projects there, that are just they haven’t reloaded yet and we’re hopefully it will. But they haven’t. So that’s why it was negative in the second quarter. I think in the third and fourth quarter that will be – that it will still be a drag. But it won’t be as bad. And Industrial, despite the more challenging price environment, the volume is good. And that’s a really profitable business for us on the Industrial side. But many of you know is our Hoffman brand, so, that’s the big driver, Hoffman doing better. So we’ll have – we expect to have low single digit core growth in Q3.
Joe Ritchie: Got it. And just a follow-up, real quickly on that, on the pricing side do you expect the pricing to get better in this business as well, in the second half?
Randy Hogan: No, we think that the pricing dynamic in Q2 continues to move forward into Q3 and Q4.
Joe Ritchie: Okay, great, thank guys.
Randy Hogan: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Drab with William Blair.
Brian Drab: Hi good morning, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to, step back to the Thermal business for a second. And you said Thermal MRO was picking up, can you comment specifically on whether you’re seeing that in a particular end-market, oil and gas versus power-gen or general industrial?
Randy Hogan: It’s really – what’s happened in capital spending, across those, it’s normalized, right. In oil and gas, there was a huge decline and basically it was a rough justice. They cut everything and now they are on capital level, so they returned finally to normal. So it’s actually oil and gas and industrial, it’s chemicals, it’s really across the board. Now CapEx is better in petrochemical, the petrochemical side and in some of the other industrial side. So we talk about Hoffman being up in industrial – general industrial.
Brian Drab: Okay, okay thanks. And then, on the petrochemical side or in any other end-market, and in any other geography, are you starting to see any large projects in the pipeline?
Randy Hogan: No and it really hasn’t been our focus, as I mentioned, we do really well, when large projects happen. And so we’re not focused on those, and we’ll do well when they come back. Our focus is making sure, we are getting more than our lion share in the smaller projects and I’m really pleased with the progress that we’re making on that. And that’s really around the world.
Brian Drab: Okay. And then I did want to ask, because you made the comment that you are doing some work to realign the Thermal business, is that world of small orders, can you comment more specifically on what is being done to drive that realignment? 
Randy Hogan: Well, I mean it was a reduction in force and redeployment areas, where business from where there isn’t?
Brian Drab: Okay, got it. And just one last, very broad question as you step back and look at these two separate operating companies and kind of the world that where in today for example for Thermal, it’s a very challenging operating environment. But what do you think; the long-term growth rate is for each of these businesses, at this point across all the cycle?
Randy Hogan: Right now, we’ve got some really great work, defining the strategies in each of water and electrical. And when that whole strategy work is done, we will tell you exactly, what we think the growth rates, that we believe we’ll achieve these two separate companies will be. But I’m not going to pre-suppose that, I’ll let John.
John Stauch: Hey, Brian, I just want to clarify one thing, the Thermal environment is actually improving, significantly for us. I mean we have these large projects year-over-year, which we’re calling out. But inside of the actual Thermal business, we’re seeing substantial margin increase. And we’re getting back to record, and in fact, we’ve cleared what we call record highs of margins at this period of business that we’ve experienced before. Again part of that is the focus that Randy shared with you. But if you take those projects out, we’re growing nicely and we’re expanding margin significantly.
Brian Drab: Yes. Thanks for that clarification John. I guess I was just referring to the large projects, kind of not being in the picture, anymore. Thank you, got it.
Randy Hogan: We’re looking forward to talking about.
Brian Drab: Right got it. Thank you.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.
Nathan Jones: Good morning everyone.
Randy Hogan: Good morning, Nathan.
John Stauch: Good morning, Nathan.
Nathan Jones: A couple of questions on the Water business, you talked about softness in the pump business there. Can you talk about what you’re seeing in terms of end market demand in municipal water market, whether you think you are performing in line with the market, better or worse?
John Stauch: Well, I think the market is definitely improving, we’re seeing the backlog begin to build. The break and fix is certainly being invested in and I think we expect to get back to core revenue growth there, as Randy mentioned, towards the tail end of this year and definitely into 2018. Are we performing with the end market? I would say, no. I think there is an opportunity here, for us to commit to where we think, we should be and play consistently in those spaces. And I think we’ve been chasing the opportunities around the world and we need to get back to our core netting and be better at what we do. And I think that’s huge opportunity for this business.
Nathan Jones: Maybe you could talk a little bit more about what you need to change there in order to get back in line with the market, maybe where you are playing that you shouldn’t be, where you should be focused?
John Stauch: When you are everywhere, you don’t seem to have focus. What Randy is been challenging, the team on and which I am going to take the [indiscernible] and continue to drive with focus, focus, focus. I think this is a business that’s good at, North American infrastructure. And we are good at global fire and that’s where we need to spend our time and energy on the engineered side in those two areas and continue to be good at those two things.
Nathan Jones: That’s helpful and then just a question on the new products pipeline. You talked about that continuing to grow. Can you maybe give us a little more color on what kind of things are in the pipeline? When they are expected to come to market, maybe what kind of impact that could have?
John Stauch: Yes, I think most of – just to give you some color and I don’t want to get to ahead of ourselves here, but a lot of the products that Randy mentioned are related to home automation certainly and the way that we can play within that space and provide the types of things that our end consumers are looking for, utilizing that capability. We’ve always been the leader in pool innovation and we’ve got some exciting new product lines coming out, to take advantage of those home automation themes and that the way that people want to continue to use their backyard and benefit from that experience. So I think we’ll start to roll that out, certainly around our Analyst Day and limit to our expectations. And I think we’ve got some exciting things in the pipeline.
Nathan Jones: All right. Thanks very much.
Randy Hogan: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Barry with Susquehanna.
Robert Barry: Hey guys, good morning.
Randy Hogan: Good morning.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Robert Barry: So I wanted to clarify the update, the P&L segment income now up 6%, so was that the net impact of better core growth offset partially by the weaker price cost, and that’s a net $10 million improvement, is that?
Randy Hogan: Yes.
Robert Barry: How to summarize it?
Randy Hogan: Yes.
Robert Barry: Got you. And then just a follow-up on the working capital question, I mean bottom line is working capital, a source or use of cash this year on continuing ops?
Randy Hogan: It’s a slight use.
Robert Barry: Okay. And then, just to clarify the interest, you talked about higher interest expense. I think the outlook for interest is the same at $85 million?
Randy Hogan: That’s rounding Rob, it was a little higher in the first half, as we talked about, but it’s rounding.
Robert Barry: Got you, okay. Thanks guys.
Randy Hogan: Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions, at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Randy Hogan for any closing remarks.
Randy Hogan: Thanks, Hope. 2017 has been another eventful year for Pentair, as we’ve successfully divested our Valves & Controls business. Significantly strengthen our balance sheet, with those proceeds. Delivered our first half commitments and announce that we’re separating our Water and Electrical businesses into two standalone companies. We remain confident in our ability to drive double digit adjusted EPS growth for the year, as our focus remains on delivering the second half of 2017, against our commitments while standing up, two public companies. Thank you for your continued interest in Pentair and we’ll talk to you soon. Bye.

Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Thanks, Jim. First quarter of 2017 was a solid start to the year, as both of our segments came in ahead of their commitments. Our adjusted core sales increased 3%. We saw margins expand 50 basis points, and adjusted EPS grew 7% and exceeded the high-end of our previous guidance. The sale of our Valves & Controls business to Emerson is in the final stages of regulatory review and we expect the deal to close in the coming days. We're pleased with the progress we're making on our productivity actions, including our previously disclosed cost actions. We have seen some additional material inflation, so many of our businesses are exploring additional price and productivity actions to help mitigate this higher than planned material inflation. We're maintaining our full-year adjusted EPS forecast of $3.45 to $3.55, reflecting the first quarter beat and the delayed closing of the Valves & Controls sale. While the first quarter was better than expected, we want to watch the all-important second quarter to see if these trends continue. Now, let's turn to slide 5 for a discussion of our first quarter 2017 results. Our first quarter sales results came in better than our forecast, as both Water and Electrical delivered solid low-single-digit adjusted core sales growth. Segment income grew 3%, yet the usual leverage did not drop through. We believe this is solely a timing issue. First, our cost out actions are still ramping, so we did not get the full benefit of those actions during the quarter. Second, as mentioned, a few of our businesses have experienced higher material inflation. There is a one to two quarter lag we experience before additional price increases offset any inflation. Return on sales expanded 50 basis points to 15.5% and adjusted EPS grew 7%. All below the line items were in line with our forecast, including our 20% tax rate and our share count. First quarter free cash flow was a usage, in line with normal seasonal patterns, and we again expect full year free cash flow to equal adjusted net income. Overall, the first quarter was a good start to the year, but one quarter does not make a trend. As we enter our seasonally strong second quarter, order trends remain solid and we're monitoring progress throughout the quarter before revisiting our full year expectations. Now, let's turn to slide 6 for a look at Water performance in Q1. Our Water segment delivered adjusted core sales growth of 4%. Segment income grew 15% and return on sales expanded 180 basis points to 17%. Within our Filtration & Process business, core sales were flat. Our Residential & Commercial business showed solid mid-single-digit growth, as we saw the negative trends of the back half of 2016 reverse course. In particular, China experienced strong double-digit growth as both residential and commercial filtration returned to growth. Within our Process Filtration businesses, results remain mixed. We've seen some capital beginning to flow again in the beer sector following the pause in 2016 as the industry went through a round of consolidations. We've faced some tough comparisons within industrial and infrastructure but we continue to see nice gains in our growing Biogas business, which we further strengthened earlier this year with the acquisition of Union Engineering. Flow Technologies saw core sales decline 3% as we continue to focus on reducing complexity to drive margin and cash flow improvement. Our Residential and Irrigation Pump businesses experienced nice gains, but we saw continued headwinds within our commercial, industrial and infrastructure sales. In our Precision Spray business that largely serves agriculture, we saw another quarter of growth. Aquatic & Environmental Systems had a great quarter, with 13% core sales growth. This was driven by yet another double-digit quarter of growth from our Aquatics business. We do not believe that this strong a growth rate is the norm, but we do expect growth to continue on the heels of industry strength, continued dealer wins, and strong new product innovations. Now, let's move to slide 7 for a look at Electrical performance in Q1. Electrical performed better than expected as we saw several long challenged industries return to growth. The segment overall grew adjusted core sales 3%, segment income declined 8% and margins contracted 90 basis points to 20.6%. The margin contraction was due in part to a challenging year-over-year comparison and also some higher than anticipated material inflation. Our Enclosures business grew core sales 1% in the quarter. Our Industrial business increased mid-single-digits and experienced growth for the first time in nine quarters. The smaller Telecom business experienced a mid-single-digit decline, but we anticipate only one more tough year-over-year comparison in the second quarter before comps get easier in the back half of the year for Telecom. Core sales in our Thermal business declined 17% as a result of the three large jobs in 2016 not repeating. We are encouraged however to see MRO growth for the first time in two years. This does not mean that there is a recovery in the short cycle but it is a positive sign to see growth in this profitable part of the business. We continue to be focused on sizing the business to a smaller order size world and Thermal is making progress in building that order funnel, with activity in the smaller jobs that are out there to be secured. Our Electrical & Fastening Solutions business had a strong quarter with 7% core sales growth. We saw continued strength in our Commercial business and saw some signs of improvement in the electrical grounding product line. This business experienced a fair amount of material inflation in the quarter and we're looking at additional price increases to help mitigate the higher inflation. After a challenging second half of 2016, we're encouraged to see signs that the worst may be over for our Electrical segment. And although order trends remained solid to start April, we'd like to see another quarter or two of improvement before declaring that we're in a new world. Now, let's turn to slide 8. Before turning the call over to John to discuss the financial outlook in more detail, I wanted to provide a status update on the pending sale of our Valves & Controls business to Emerson. We have only two more regulatory approvals to receive and have an expectation that both should be arriving in the coming days. As a reminder, following the closure of the transaction, we plan to use the proceeds to retire debt, at which point we'll have a fair amount of balance sheet capacity again. As this balance sheet optionality returns, we will be disciplined in our capital allocation strategy. I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our second quarter and updated full year 2017 outlook. John?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Thank you, Randy. Please turn to slide number 9 labeled balance sheet and cash flow. Our free cash flow for Q1 was a usage of $112 million, consistent with expectations, and reflects our seasonal Q1 cash usage. This was higher than 2016, mainly due to timing of previous year tax payments and a working capital build in our Aquatic & Environmental Systems business, reflecting their strength at the beginning of the pool season. We tend to collect that cash in Q2 consistent with our business model. Our debt balance ended Q1 at $4.53 billion, reflecting the slight delay of collecting the expected proceeds from the V&C sale. ROIC ended Q1 at 10.6%. Please turn to slide 10 titled, expected impact of V&C delay. Slide 10 attempts to make three points. The first point is the $0.04 of operational beat in Q1 covers the $0.04 impact expected in Q2 for the delay of the receipt of the V&C proceeds and, therefore, not been able to restructure the debt in line with previous expectations. Point two is that we have not updated our Q2 through Q4 performance versus previous expectations and we will do so after we see the results from Q2 operations. This means we are still holding our full year guidance at $3.45 to $3.55 or a midpoint of $3.50 for the full year. And the third point is that while we had a slight delay in our debt restructuring for 2017, we want to remind you that this means we will see a four-month benefit in 2018 where we carry higher interest in the comparable period in 2017 or about $0.15 of incremental benefits in 2018 results. Please turn to slide 11 labeled cost out update. Due to the sale of V&C, we quickly got after our organizational structure and streamlined into two reporting segments and a leaner Pentair enterprise support organization. We did this to produce more standard business structures with clearer functional expectations, designed to serve our customers better at a lower cost structure. We are pleased to update that we are more than 95% complete against the previously stated cost out expectations and expect that all actions will be fully implemented by the end of Q2. These efforts results in over $75 million of net cost benefits realized in 2017 with an exit rate in Q4 that yields $100 million of net cost out heading into 2018. These costs include labor, manufacturing and operational overhead reductions designed to make us more consistent, predictable and higher performing. They do not include the net impact of material and inflation and are before the previously communicated headwinds related to higher expected employee bonuses and compensation adjustments in 2017 versus 2016 results. This is a great progress and it's good to put the reorganization behind us and allow us to focus on driving organic growth and leaner manufacturing and shared service support. Please turn to slide 12 labeled Q2 2017 Pentair outlook. As previously shared, we have kept Q2 operationally in line with previous expectations and only adjusted our Q2 EPS for the higher debt levels expected for the delay in our debt restructuring efforts. While we experienced much higher volume performance in Q1, we have not yet reflected that in Q2 results. We feel it's prudent to see how our important seasonally stronger second quarter plays out before declaring that revenue and operating results will be higher for the year. While we expect some of the Q1 sales momentum to continue, we're also monitoring increasingly higher material inflation and our ability to offset that inflation through a material negotiations or incremental pricing actions. Overall, for Q2, we expect that our adjusted core sales to be roughly flat, segment income to be up roughly 4%, ROS to expand nearly 150 basis points to around 20% and adjusted EPS to be up 14% reflecting a 20% tax rate and slightly better interest and a share count of around 183 million shares. Please turn to slide 13 labeled full year 2017 Pentair outlook. For the full year, we expect our overall adjusted core sales to be up slightly. We expect segment income to be up 5%, ROS to expand greater than 100 basis points to around 18%, and adjusted EPS to grow approximately 15% to around $3.50 at the midpoint. We expect cash flow to be 100% of adjusted net income. As previously mentioned, we will update our full year outlook after we see how Q2 growth and operational performance plays out. We have the V&C cash in hand and have a better view of our capital allocation decisions for 2017. I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for Q&A, after which, Randy will have a few closing remarks. Beth, please open the line for questions. Thank you.
Jim Lucas - Pentair Plc: Hello, Beth? We're ready for Q&A. Beth?
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Steve Tusa, JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey, guys. Good Morning.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Good morning, Steve.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Hey, Steve. How are you?
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good. So, just on the kind of core trends through the rest of the year. Just remind us of in the second quarter what the large jobs headwind is.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yeah. So, it's consistent with what we previously shared, Steve. I mean, there's no incremental impact on the year-over-year basis versus what we guided to earlier. So, we said it would be roughly $33 million and that's what we're counting on.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: For the second quarter?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: For the second quarter, correct.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Got it. So that doesn't really – it actually gets a little bit better relative to the first quarter?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yeah. And the other thing that happens there, too, Steve, is the profitability gets a little bit better as we go through the year. Meaning the year-over-year profit impact isn't as bad because in Q1 last year we had a lot of product sales on that project in thermal and those bring higher margins. So, the margin pressures ease as we go through the year as well.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And so when you guys had given your guidance in the fourth quarter, you would've shown a seasonality chart on EPS that was about 30% in the second quarter. I think my math gets to me to like $1.05 just using 30%. It doesn't seem like anything is getting worse. Maybe there's a little bit of price/cost or something like that. But adjusted for the timing of Valves & Controls is – what's kind of the difference between that? What changed between kind of that implied number and your kind of $0.97 to whatever it is, $0.99 today, or is that just conservatism?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Well, I mean I think – I don't know if I can reconcile with a $1.05, but I think clearly, if we saw the volume continue at the 3% to 4% level that we saw in Q1, continue in Q2, we would expect that to produce incremental drop-throughs associated with it. At the same time, we did have a little bit more material inflation in Q1. It wasn't significantly meaningful to the Q1 results, but we're starting to watch some of the inflation on some of the key components like copper, et cetera, start to rise. And as you probably saw from some of the distributor releases, the ability to get priced right now in the end markets isn't necessarily consistent in all markets. And that's what we're watching, is what happens to that end price and the material inflation squeeze and how does it affect us throughout the quarter, Steve.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And just to remind us, is there anything else in the second half of the year that stands out that should be getting worse? It seems that with such a tough end to last year, the comps should get, I mean, just like materially easier even excluding the large projects?
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: I'd say generally no. Nothing we expect to get worse. As I said, we'll update our full year guidance after we see second quarter because it is so important to us.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then one last question just on the capital allocation now that we're – hopefully, we're towards the end of the tunnel on this Valves process. Just remind us again what kind of the aim is with the proceeds. I think your guys had said – it was John. You had said in March that there'd be kind of a split between debt reduction, maybe a little bit of buyback, some acquisitions. Maybe just your latest thinking on how you kind of chop up the proceeds into those three buckets?
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Well, I think that still holds. We certainly will take a lot of debt off the table, but we have acquisitions. We've continued to fill the funnel on acquisitions. To the extent the prices are too high then we'll put money to work on stock buyback. But we have work to do to decide on that split, and we will be disciplined. We want to get back to creating the shareholder value we did in the first part of this.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Sorry, one more question for you. Randy, you've had a really nice run. The stock has done really well under your leadership. Where are you on succession planning here?
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Well, look, it's direct, right. One of the most important things boards do is to ensure proper succession. And I think we have a robust plan and we have one that we're comfortable with. So, when there's something to announce, I'm sure the board will.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray, RBC. Your line is open.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Hey, Deane.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Good morning, Deane.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey. So much for the one question, one follow-up, but I got – let me start off on the...
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: The script for the prepared remarks early, Deane. That's what we get.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it. Maybe start with Aquatic, up 13%. Randy, I think, your comment was you weren't expecting quite to see this amount of strength. You called out dealer wins. You called out some new product introductions. But how would you parse out that 13% upside between those or other factors?
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: I think the market – I do think the market is strong. I think everyone is experienced. And I think we had an earlier year. I think a lot of – what we might have seen in April last year, we might have seen a lot of that in March, that's – March and April, you can see things swing back and forth. But, by and large, we've got some exciting new products in controls and in heating and lighting coming out. And we continue to gain new dealers. So, the playbook keeps working.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it. And was weather at all a factor? February was fairly warm in the Northeast. Did that trigger any particular pull-in from maybe what you'd have seen in the second quarter?
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Well, I think, right now, the industry is really optimistic. And they clearly were laying inventory in in the quarter, because they're expecting a good year. And I think weather probably helped that some.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it. And then, over on Electrical, Hoffman ending its drought of growth after nine quarters. Which end markets were driving the uptick? Was it just easy comps? And can you comment on orders?
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Yeah. When you take a look at the core Hoffman, it's really general industrial. Energy stabilized. They're part of energy, but it's just general industrial across the whole product range. And, again, I think, optimism played a role and distributors getting back to more normal stocking levels. But I don't think it was a pure stock up. I think it was selling through as well. And so, we exited with an order rate that was still sound and consistent with the first quarter.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Did you put a number on the order rate?
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Mid-single-digits.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it. Thank you.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Thank you, Deane.
Operator: Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell, Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities: Hi. Good morning.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Good morning, Julian.
Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities: Just my first question is around the price of raw material topic which you mentioned a couple of times. Maybe just give us some historical context about how large that impact had been, say, six years ago, the last time input costs were a big factor. And how you look at the ability to get pricing in the context of what your competitors are doing.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yeah. So, overall, I mean, we got about 1% price in Q1 and that's generally in line with what we expect to get. But what's more important is the predictability of the raw materials earlier than the pricing model works, right. So you go out with price increases and then you've got to figure out what's going to happen to materials. The materials are rising at a fairly quick rate. Steel, nickel, copper, those are our three main inputs to our material view. And it's just a matter of can we go out with another round of material – or pricing increases. Now, I think we were planning on about $50 million (23:02) of favorability from material as we – material and inflation as we headed into the year. And I think now, we're taking a look at maybe is that flattish. So given the upside in the revenue and also the acceleration of the cost out, we feel we're fine. But before we declare victory, we like to see it through Q2.
Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities: Understood. Thank you. And then if we look at the Electrical & Fastening business, you had a very nice kind of snapback, it looked like, in the first quarter versus what happened late 2016. Maybe give us some sense of how the cadence of that business moved through Q1 and how you look at things today in terms of the visibility there, because that business has been so volatile.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Yeah. The fourth quarter certainly was – it was not expected. And I do believe, looking back on it in hindsight, I think a lot of distributors were just – with the uncertainty around a number of things in our economy, they just didn't stock up, whereas that optimism returns and it returns pretty quickly. We saw as early as January that we have returned to a more normal state. And 7% growth is better than any quarter growth last year. So, we have some really differentiated products there and that helped with productivity in construction – in commercial construction. And I think we're getting good uptake on those products.
Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities: Thank you. And then just a last quick boring one. The adjustment to the GAAP earnings guidance – is that just due to those stock comp type issues and the restructuring that you'd mentioned?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: The main one we have is amortization. So, we show that to you both on operating income and then what we call EBITDA which puts the amortization back in. That's the main one.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: The cash earnings.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: And then, occasionally, we have restructuring that flows through that as well, Julian.
Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities: Okay. So, the change from before on the GAAP side is the restructuring?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Correct.
Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities: Okay. Thank you.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran, Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.
Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Good morning, guys.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Hey, Mike.
Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: So, on the cost out update, obviously, good execution so far in what you've laid out. What's the next step for you guys? Obviously, the two pieces are – it's now two segments and historically there's been some pieces within each segment you've been focused on. Is it more the same in driving the improvement in those pieces? Is there some other program that you guys are contemplating, maybe just thoughts on the next step from here?
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Well, we really – the going into two segments was – as John said, it was to allow us and give us leverage to take the cost out and more than the stranded cost of the exit of Valves & Controls. And it let us really to streamline and simplify a lot. And so now we still have the same priorities we have on the Electrical side, some very attractive high profitability businesses that all have opportunities to grow. We want to get the organic growth and then we can augment that with bolt-ons. And then particularly in the Filtration area and the Aquatics area of Water, same thing. And we really have been more on the sidelines on a lot of that acquisition because of where we were with Valves & Controls in our debt levels. So, we'll be disciplined. We're not going to rush to the trough but we're excited to get back to growth because we want to show you. We know we can and we want to show you we will.
Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: On that acquisition side, maybe just talk about the quality of the funnel out there. Obviously, you had to start rebuilding it a little bit or at least to some extent after the V&C sale. What's it look like today? How full is it? I know you said it was filling up from a multiple perspective. Are you shut out at this point? Are there enough attractive things out there?
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Well, shut out, we have – when we say disciplined, we don't believe in doing a deal just because it's quote strategic. We have to be able to make financial sense. And so on the Water side, things are pricey. On the Electrical side not so much. But we can be creative. We still have our ownerships, our European structure that's helpful. So, we still have some bullets in the gun or we're putting bullets back in the gun.
Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Appreciate the time, guys. Thanks.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Thank you, Mike.
Operator: Your next question comes from Scott Graham, BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey. Good morning. Nice quarter.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Good morning, Scott.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): So, could you give us a little bit more end-market detail on Flow as well as – Flow Technologies that is, as well as the Electrical & Fastening? You gave us the pluses in Flow. Can you give us the larger minuses, obviously, ag and then on the Electrical & Fastening side sort of the puts and takes there as well?
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: No. Actually ag was up in Flow for us, both in the Spray side and Irrigation side. It's really the larger pumps. That's the industrial pumps, fire protection, and the break and fix municipal that are the slow pieces both in Europe and the U.S.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yeah. And that's slightly down is the way I would answer that, Scott. Obviously, Residential & Commercial is doing well. I think it's doing well everywhere but what we would call rural pump, rural submersible. We're seeing much more urban development and we're seeing that to the Water Filtration business. We're seeing that to our food service offerings. So Residential & Commercial, as Randy mentioned, even Electrical, CADDY very strong which is in the EFS business that we have. Municipal, it's okay. I mean I think everybody expected a big push in the infrastructure. We're not seeing headwinds there but we're not seeing the tailwinds of growth either. And then industrial, through what Randy mentioned in our Hoffman order take up mid to high-single-digits on orders, which we haven't seen growth in that space in a while. So that was nice to see, the recovery. So, overall, I would say food and beverage continues to get better. We had the large headwinds last year as we saw the mergers take place and some of the capital be delayed but that's returned. So, overall, right now, the verticals are moving forward in a very positive way and our only caution is that we have a lot of work to do this year. And one quarter behind us is good, but we have to now deliver on the commitments for the next three and that's what we're working on.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Good progression. The other question I have for you was essentially on pricing and obviously there's a couple questions here on price/cost and you guys called it out. I'm a little curious about that because steel prices really start to rise last summer and then kind of reaccelerated several months back. And copper/nickel for sure have been more recent inflation issues. But you have market-leading businesses across most of portfolio. A lot of your business is shorter cycle. Is there any reason why you're not out with price increases maybe more broadly already?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yes, Scott. I mean real quick and I'll let Randy answer. I mean, I think, first of all, we have good discipline around locking material. We don't like to gamble or play the hedge bets here, right. So we go out and we lock our material in a disciplined way. What we're up against a little bit though and we shared this before is euro. And, certainly, the stronger dollar allows for potentially European-based competitors into the market and they're getting the benefits of their weaker currency. And that's a dynamic we haven't seen in the last several years. So it came about last year and we're monitoring that. Now, where we think we have the opportunity to raise price, we will, but at the same time, we're not going to lose share. And we're going to manage the sourcing end of the material inflation as well.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: And I would just add. One of the marks of an attractive business to us is – and it's a true tell, is do you have any kind of pricing leverage in your industry. If you do, then you probably have some differentiation. If you don't, they you probably don't. And it's a simple test that we use. And so yes, we in all of our businesses have pricing capability. What we want to do is make sure that we don't get out of whack with market share. And so we're trying to be more nuanced about it because we haven't grown enough.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Understood Thanks a lot.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: All right. Thanks, Scott.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks, guys. Since we've abandoned the one question, one follow-up, I've got five questions here.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Well, we've got three answers for you.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just kidding. Only four questions. So, John, you mentioned the municipals soft, not getting worse, not getting better. But if you look at the (32:57) data, it does feel like water/wastewater is significantly weaker since the election. I know it's not that big for you guys, but is that one reason why you're a little bit more cautious perhaps than perhaps 1Q would suggest or is that too small to really move the needle?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yeah, too small to really move the needle, Nigel. I just think that we're not counting on any huge tailwind there from any reinvestments in the government, et cetera. We never have. Even when we've seen the big programs being invested on, we've not yet – we never really saw the realization of those investments. So, it's not a big enough of matter, Nigel.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, Randy, you alluded that there was some channel rebuilds in driving that Electrical plus 7% performance. Is that based on just sort of conversations with the customers or is it based on POS data? I'm wondering was inventory a factor elsewhere across the portfolio?
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Yeah. I think we need to do a better job of getting real sell-through from a lot of distributor – in all of our businesses. But from the indications we have, it is selling through. But I think – there was a real sense of – real surge of optimism, frankly, after the election, if you look at the timing of it. It didn't really hit in December. It was certainly when people got back from Christmas. You just saw business start to flow again. And some of that was restocking but most of it we believe was flowing through. Distributors are much more effective at keeping their stocks low and counting on manufacturers to deliver quickly to refill. And that's across the board. That's in every industry.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's great. And then just finally, we've shut a box around this already but on the refi post V&C close, John, can you maybe just gives us any additional color in terms of gross proceeds that you're planning to pay down debt with and any kind of breakage fees that you would expect on the refis?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yeah. So, we'll be approaching somewhere around $3 billion in net proceeds, is what we think we'll be bringing in. And, obviously, our breakage will be minimal, so let's say less than a $100 million. And so we've got a lot of cash to work with on the refinancing and we'll run out of – in some cases with our cash generation this year what we're saying is we'll run out of debt to actually pay down. And so that forces us to...
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: So high quality problems.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: So high quality problem but that's where the M&A and the buyback discussion start to come in because we wouldn't want to be sitting on cash and not putting it to work. But we have to do it in a disciplined way and we have to monitor the right acquisitions or is it time to go out and buy back a little bit of stock.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Let's be clear. Your guidance doesn't assume any buybacks?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: That's correct.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks, guys.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie, Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Good morning, Joe.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Hey, Joe.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. So just a quick question. Look, your sales number was better than we expected this quarter. But this thought process around giving an adjusted core sales number, are you guys trying to signal that the large project business is basically going to de minimis or what is kind of like the thought process behind giving that number?
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: I've told our businesses, no more. There's no more of this – this is the last time.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: These are three large oil sand projects that were won and it really represents the end of the reset in the energy market. And they completed in 2016 and this year we have a headwind. But really what we're trying to do is give you both, right. So, we're giving you the volume, the price, and then we're sharing with you what those jobs are. And what we want to do is make sure that we take a look at what we're going to be exiting from an organic growth rate and what we should expect in these businesses as we go forward into 2018.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And then I may have missed it earlier, but the impact from large projects for the rest of the year, clearly it was a big impact in Q1, but what's the impact for Q2 to Q4?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yeah. As we said, Q2 was around $33 million, which is $30 million in Electrical. And then we're about $27 million in Q3 and we're $10 million in Q4. And all of that was listed in the Q4 earnings where we gave the guidance for 2017.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Cool. Thanks, no, that's helpful. And then I guess just a couple quick ones. The Electrical margins got off to a little bit of a slower start than we expected. I know there's been a lot of discussion here on price/cost. But you have that ramping back up to 23% for the full year. And so, maybe talk a little bit about some of the puts this quarter and then where you really start to see a pick-up in Q2 through Q4?
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: It's the ramp of the cost and it's in the first quarter. And it was really – John mentioned it earlier, the big projects we just talked about. It was shipping all products and so the margins on that were very high, in Q1. And then the margins fell off in Q2, Q3, and Q4. So that was really the two – that was the pressures in the Electrical side and we expect them to get better. So we expect the margins to look better going forward.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. So you just have easier comps as you kind of head through the year and – okay.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Yeah.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That seems to make sense.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: And the cost out will read out.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And the cost out. Okay. And then I guess maybe just lastly, you touched on V&C, but maybe just a real quick update on untangling those assets and your confidence on being able to close by month end?
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: I have great confidence. I'm really grateful of the Pentair team and the Emerson people who've worked on it too. I'm grateful. I'm proud of the work they did. We've been ready to close this for a while, so – both sides. So I have high confidence that we can close when they tell us we can close.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. But is it – I mean, are you guys still planning to close this week or is this something that can push out a little bit further into May, June?
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: In the coming days; we're waiting for two – we're waiting for Mexico and the United States and we feel good about them, but we can't close until we get the official word.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got you. Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jeff Hammond, KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, guys.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Hey, Jeff.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Just on the Electrical 2Q guide. I just want to get a better sense of kind of where the caution still lies. Just, it sounds like the order rates in Hoffman are better, MROs picking up in Thermal, and it seems like ERICO, 1Q is maybe the better trend versus 4Q. So, what gives you the most pause?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Just execution, Jeff. I mean I think – we want to see – we haven't grown at the mid-single-digit rate, as Randy mentioned, in a couple years. And when that happens, you've got to get your delivery and your execution done. We were moving a factory and we still are moving a factory. And we've received significant volume into that factory. And so, we delayed it from Q1 into Q2 and we're in the process of closing that factory, exiting it. And so, we're managing a lot of things simultaneously. That's all it is, Jeff.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. But there is no indication that there's any delivery issues or...
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: No.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: No.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then, just on the Water guide for 2Q, does that reflect any kind of timing or pull forward that you think might have happened in the 1Q results?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yeah. It does. I mean, I think we usually know the pool season. But we can't always time it by the precision of the month. And so, we did have a strong Q1 and, therefore, we think it will be a slightly less strong Q2, still strong, but a little less strong, as we see how that sell-through gets managed and that inventory gets managed by distributors.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Walsh, Vertical Research. Your line is open.
John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Hi. Good morning.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Good morning, John.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Good morning.
John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC: A lot of ground covered, so just kind of two quick cleanup ones from me. In terms of the $21 million of restructuring, does that all have at least a 1 for 1 payback, and maybe you can characterize what those actions are?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yeah. That $21 million is reflecting what we're talking about as the $75 million. So, it's better than 1 to 1, and that's the cost efforts – or that's the restructuring actions that are leading to the net cost out that we're referring to.
John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Got you. Understood. And then as we think about the ability for additional capital allocation maybe kind of level set us what the number of capacity you have is? I mean if you go back – you used to talk about running the business 3 time levered. Is that still right? Is it closer to 2? How should we think about that just to kind of level set us all on what the actual capacity you're thinking about?
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: I think about 2.5 is the steady state. We can go above 3 occasionally, but 2.5, 3 at the top.
John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC: All right. Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones from Stifel. Your line is open.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Good morning, Nathan.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: You guys took the organic sales number up a point. Can you maybe split that out between the impact of raw material inflation and assumed price increases and volume increases?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: I don't know if I understand it. I mean you said...
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Price and volume.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Price and volume. Okay. I mean, all we did was take the Q1 number and we let it ride through the year. We kept Q2, Q3, and Q4 exactly the same, adjusting only for the debt in V&C. So, I think, I would answer your question it was all volume.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. So, in your guidance for the rest of the year for the top-line, there's no impact from assumed price increases in response to these raw material increases?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: No, there is none.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And then, on the 4Q call, you guys had guided to $39 million of large project headwinds and that shook out at $49 million. Can you reconcile those two numbers?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yeah. There's an incremental $10 million related to project accruals that we took in Q1 that were anticipated project settlement cost that we had related to those projects last year. So, it took down the revenue number in Q1 by approximately $10 million.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: All right. That's all I had. Thank you. I'll stick to my two questions.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Thank you.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brian Drab, William Blair. Your line is open.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to ask on the raw materials again. I don't know, John, if you could give us any sort of sense or how cost breaks down in terms of raws, overhead, labor? And then within the materials, how big a percentage is steel versus copper? And the main thing that I am still just trying to figure out is how do you deal with 50%-ish increase in steel and these other raws and only increase – have to increase price 1 to 2 points to stay flat in terms of that headwind or tailwind that you mentioned that went from 15 to flat on raws?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yeah. So real quick, I think we don't want to overdo this. I think our material is 38% of sales, right, roughly for Pentair. And our largest commodity purchase is around $200 million and most of the other clients we're talking to is about $100 million, $150 million on an annual basis. So, the big increases are also mitigated by the locks that we talked about earlier, but the timing of when we lock versus the timing when we price is sometimes disconnected. So, we're identifying maybe $10 million to $12 million material risks in the back half of the year. And if the volumes continue, we feel like we've got enough to offset that right now, even if we didn't get incremental price increases. But we're monitoring all this as we go through the year and we're listening to the same earnings call as you are. And we're hearing that price isn't easy to come by in the end markets. And that's why we're not as confident that we can just push through another price increase. So that's what we're managing. And right now I just want to clarify. We have not adjusted Q2, Q3 and Q4. And we're admitting that there might be some upside volume but we're also sharing with you that there could be some upside material risk – or downside material risk.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Okay. Got it. And then, I think I just missed this earlier but did you talk about pre-buy activity in the Aquatics business first quarter 2017 versus first quarter 2016 and maybe what the difference in incentives were between those period?
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: There was really no difference, actually. The higher growth was really just normal business. It wasn't early buy.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Product going though.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Which is – yeah, just standard order, which is a bullish sign on us in a bullish business.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: All right. Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Robert Barry from Susquehanna. Your line is open.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Good morning.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Good morning.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Would you mind giving us some color on how you expect each of these sub-segments to track this year within Water and within Electrical?
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Well, we talk about the segments, is that what you're asking about?
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Like the general outlook for growth in Enclosures versus Thermal versus Electrical and Filtration versus Flow versus Aquatic?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yeah. I think that's a little more granular than we'd want to go to at this point for a forecast. I mean, what I said was what we gave on the – whatever we gave for guidance in Q4, into Q1 the only thing that's changed is Q1 performance and we haven't assumed any updates to the forecast of any of these throughout the year. And that's why we're waiting, is to see how Q2 comes out and then we would update all this information.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Got you. And the $15 million of favorability on price or cost – was that – that went to flat. Is that a net number, price net of cost?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: That's material source net of inflation.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Got you. And then just to – yeah, I'm sorry.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: $15 million was assumed and what I'm saying is a worst-case scenario would be close to flat.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay. So, flat is not in the outlook?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Flat is not currently in this outlook, no.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: I see. And then just finally, earlier, John, I think you'd made a comment that it's kind of easier or harder to get price in some places than others, I guess just depending on that end market dynamics. And where are the areas that are a little more challenging to get price now?
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Basically fast growth markets is always a challenge. That's the most challenging place. And, as John said, we're dollar-denominated in most – to the most part and so the dollar is strong, so any place where we're competing with the euro-based competitors.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Got you. Thank you.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Steve Tusa, JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi, guys.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Didn't we hear from you? Hey, Steve.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah. Yeah. Just with Deane taking a shot at me, I just wanted to clarify that you guys didn't feel about sort of like some other companies do. So it was a very trend intro. And the fact that I'm getting a follow-up here means that we could end the call 10 minutes early but I just wanted to clarify something. On the proceeds, you had said $3 billion or something like that. Is there any change in the amount of net proceeds you're going to pull in here or is it still the same? I think you had initially said $2.6 billion, maybe just rounding.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Hi, Steve. You're listening. It was originally $2.7 billion. We are approaching closer to the $3 billion mark. We believe the taxes are going to be a little bit more favorable to us than originally estimated. And then we also have timings of the accruals and the working capital and the cash performance of the business.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. I'll leave the small talk – the rest of small talks for offline with Jim. Thanks a lot, guys.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: This ends the Q&A session of the call. And we'll now turn it back over to Randy Hogan for final comments.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: All right. Thank you. Thanks all for your interest and all the questions. As we communicated last quarter, 2017 is a transition year for Pentair. And we believe that our first quarter performance is a solid start. We're days away from the expected closing of our sales of Valves & Controls and look forward to regaining a stronger balance sheet. Of course we're going to remain disciplined in our capital allocation strategies. When we have more on that, we will announce it. We're even more confident in our ability to drive double-digit EPS growth for full year 2017. And we continue to position the company for continued long-term success. Thanks again for your interest in Pentair.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Matthew, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Pentair's Q4 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there'll be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Jim Lucas, Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Planning, you may begin your conference.
Jim Lucas - Pentair Plc: Thanks, Matthew, and welcome to Pentair's fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call. We're glad you can join us. I'm Jim Lucas, Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Planning. And with me today is Randy Hogan, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Stauch, our Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, we will provide details on our fourth quarter 2016 performance as well as our first quarter and full-year 2017 outlook as outlined in this morning's release. Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as the risks outlined in Pentair's most recent 10-K and today's release. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today, and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results. Today's webcast is accompanied by a presentation, which can be found in the Investors section on Pentair's website. We will reference these slides throughout our prepared remarks. Any references to non-GAAP financials are reconciled in the appendix of the presentation. We will be sure to reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. I would like to request that you limit your questions to one and a follow-up in order to ensure everyone an opportunity to ask their questions. I will now turn the call over to Randy.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Thanks, Jim. 2016 was a historic year for Pentair as we marked our 50th anniversary as a company. The year was memorable for many other reasons but, unfortunately, the challenges with the energy and industrial markets made from memories that we're looking forward to putting in the rear-view mirror. We were disappointed to have to lower our fourth quarter guidance, but we delivered against to revise expectations. When looking at 2016 on a full year basis, we did have some good memories to point to. Including ERICO, sales grew 6%. Segment income was up 11% and adjusted EPS grew 8%. And we had a very good free cash flow year with 109% conversion of adjusted net income. Now on a core basis, sales were down 1% and segment income was up slightly, which was in line with results from other industrials. Water Quality Systems was the strong performer for us once again. We have improvements to make in Flow & Filtration Solutions and Technical Solutions and those improvements are underway. As we change the structure to be simpler and more streamlined post-Valve & Controls, we're moving from three segments to two. We're combining the former Water Quality Systems and Flow & Filtration Solutions into one Water segment as this will allow us to better execute our Water strategy and lead to more predictable long-term growth. As an update, we believe the sales of our Valve & Controls business remains on-track for close in early 2017. We continue to make good progress on aligning our cost structure with the reality of a slower growth world, as well as repositioning the company with the divesture of Valves & Controls. Finally, we're introducing formal 2017 adjusted EPS guidance of $3.45 to $3.55, which represents 15% growth at the midpoint of the range. This guidance assumes the sale of Valves & Controls closes by the end of the first quarter of 2017. John will walk through the guidance in more detail later in the call. Now, let's turn to slide 5 for a discussion of our full year 2016 results. For 2016, total sales grew 6% with core sales declining 1%. As I mentioned previously, segment income grew 11% and operating margins expanded 80 basis points. Adjusted EPS grew 8%. We're most pleased with our robust cash flow performance after being somewhat disappointed on this important metric last year. In 2016, we generated free cash flow from continuing operations of $609 million which represented 109% conversion to adjusted net income. Total free cash flow including discontinued operations was $770 million. Overall, despite the top-line challenges in 2016, we were pleased with our income, margin, and cash flow performance during this year of change. Now, let's turn to slide 6 for details on Pentair's Q4 2016 performance. As we foreshadowed in October, we knew the fourth quarter would have its share of challenges. As expected, we saw many distributors on our short cycle business take a pause on ordering in the quarter, particularly in October. We saw trend start to stabilize in December and order rates, overall, improved as we exited the quarter. Core sales for the fourth quarter were down 7%. We had 6 percentage point impact from 4 fewer selling days. We knew this was going to occur so it's important to point out that we do not see the fourth quarter growth rates as a trend because of this impact. We make good progress during the quarter in executing our cost-out initiatives and we expect them to begin reading out as the new year unfolds. Now, let's turn to slide 7 for a look at Water Quality Systems performance in Q4. Water Quality Systems reported core sales growth of 2% or up 8% when excluding the impact of fewer selling days. Aquatic & Environmental Systems led the way with nearly double-digit core sales growth on the same basis. The Aquatics business delivered growth against a very tough comparison and continues to make good progress in adding new dealers and introducing a steady stream of new products. The Water Filtration business was down modestly when excluding the impact of fewer selling days. The residential side of Water Filtration was focused on reducing complexity during the year with a renewed focus on its go-to-market strategy to improve growth which was somewhat muted for the full year. On the foodservice side of the business, we saw a broad-based pause globally in new installations particularly internationally. We were, however, encouraged to see an improvement in orders in the fourth quarter. Now, let's move to slide 8 for a look at Flow & Filtration Solutions performance in Q4. With Flow & Filtration Solutions, we've been focused on reducing complexity and driving margin improvement. We made some progress in 2016 and we see some signs of stabilization improvement in areas like agriculture and North America infrastructure. For the Water Technologies business, fourth quarter core sales excluding the impact of fewer selling days, declined 7%. The business faced a number of challenges in the quarter as commercial and international orders slowed along with continued declines in irrigation. This was further exacerbated at the end of the year as distributors slowed their orders. Core sales for Fluid Solutions grew in the quarter, adjusting for the fewer selling days. The precision spray business grew for the second consecutive quarter in a soft agriculture market. This business has consistently demonstrated its ability to deliver differentiated growth through geographic expansion and expanding its customer base. On the beverage side of the business, we saw strong orders in both beer membrane filtration and biogas. Finally, Process Filtration once again faced a challenging comparison and core sales were down, in line with expectations. But encouragingly, we saw orders increased for the second consecutive quarter. Now, let's turn to slide 9 to discuss how Technical Solutions performed in the fourth quarter. Technical Solutions is the remaining segment with the broadest exposure to energy and industrial and, not surprisingly, faced a number of challenges in 2016. For the fourth quarter, our Enclosures core sales were down modestly, excluding the impact from the fewer selling days as we saw a number of telecom order deferrals. But we were encouraged with further improvements of the daily order rate in short cycle North American industrial orders. Thermal Management faced two challenges in the fourth quarter: the end of three large jobs from the Canadian oil sands; and for the third consecutive year, deferrals and short cycle MRO sales. In Engineered Fastening Solutions, which represents our 2015 ERICO acquisition, the impact of the fewer selling days and a slow start to the quarter was felt in the short cycle distribution side of the business. On the commercial side of the business, we saw our distributors pause activity in October. But orders returned to more normalized levels in December and exited the year on a positive note. On the infrastructure side of the business, we continue to see several jobs deferred, but signs are pointing to potential improvement in 2017. Now, let's turn to slide 10 to discuss the purpose of our organizational change. With the pending sale of Valves & Controls, we looked at the organization holistically to address stranded costs and simplification as we continue our journey to become a more predictable organization or combining our two Water businesses into one Water segment. Our Technical Solutions business is being renamed to the more appropriate – Electrical segment. PIMS has been the cornerstone of how we do business for over 15 years and will continue to be the common thread that links the entire organization. As we move from three segments to two and from eight strategic business groups to six, we expect to be able to streamline our cost structure. Finally, we believe a leaner, more nimble organizational structure will help us deliver, develop our talent pipeline better. There will be more line of sight to growth opportunities and clarity on investment priorities. Now, let's turn to slide 11 to look at the streamline segment overview. This slide provides a snapshot of our two segments and six strategic business groups. In the appendix of today's document, we have included the past eight quarters' historical data as well as description of each business to help you understand the combined Water segment as well as the renamed Electrical segment. As you can see, we have two sizable businesses with strong returns. Our Water segment generated $2.8 billion of sales in 2016 with a return of sales of 18%. We're one of the largest players in water, and we expect combining what was previously two businesses will help improve collaboration and focus our water strategy more clearly. We have three businesses in Water with scale. First, the nearly $1 billion Filtration & Process business that we believe is well positioned in residential, commercial, and industrial applications. Second, Flow Technologies, also nearly $1 billion in size where we have a broad pump portfolio positioned in agriculture, infrastructure, and residential and commercial applications. Finally, we have a very successful $900 million Aquatic & Environmental Systems business that continues to fire on all cylinders. Our Electrical segment is just over $2 billion and is one of the most profitable businesses in its space with a return on sales of 21%. All three businesses are well-positioned. Our $900 million Enclosures business is a leader in the North American electrical distribution channel and also has a good electronics business serving global markets. Our $700 million Thermal Management business is a world leader in electric heat-tracing with strong offering in industrial, energy, and residential and commercial applications. Finally, we believe our $500 million Electrical & Fastening Solutions business, which most of you know as our ERICO acquisition, is very well positioned in commercial, industrial, and infrastructure applications. These two segments are already nicely profitable and focused on prioritizing the best opportunities to grow more consistently. Now, let's turn to slide 12 to discuss how we plan to improve Pentair's performance longer term. Pentair has gone through a variety of changes throughout its 50 years and we believe the Pentair that is entering 2017 is well-positioned to optimize opportunities across the organization and get back to creating shareholder value. Pentair has done a lot of things right through the years with some years more successful than others. As we simplify and streamline the organization, we're recommitting to drive the right priorities, focusing on right opportunities to make Pentair grow again. As we move from three to two segments, we believe it will allow us to deploy expertise to drive performance more effectively and lead with our PIMS processes in lean, growth, and talent. The smaller senior management team including both segment leaders will all be driven to optimize Pentair's performance, not just individual businesses or segments. We're functionalizing G&A to optimize efficiency across the enterprise and further improve costs. One thing you may have noticed is the new name and a new role within the senior leadership team. John Jacko has joined us as our new Chief Marketing Officer. While Pentair has made good progress through the years with lean as the cornerstone of PIMS, our track record on growth has been spotty at best. Some of our businesses, such as Aquatics have built a predictable model of growth and we need to ensure that same discipline across the entire enterprise. We've identified commercial excellence as a breakthrough process and John Jacko brings the richness, the capability, and experience that will help us strengthen these competencies. This includes richer insights into our markets and better growth strategies. It also includes product line management, sales deployment, sales compensation and, maybe most importantly, marketing. We believe adding a senior growth leader coupled with two aligned segment presidents will allow us to further improve our growth outcomes. As a focused team, we'll work more effectively to optimize our performance, drive more consistency and deliver on our commitments. I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our first quarter and full year 2017 outlook.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Thank you, Randy. Please turn to slide number 13 titled full year 2017 Pentair outlook. As Randy mentioned, for the full year 2017, we're expecting overall Pentair EPS to be around $3.45 to $3.55 on an adjusted basis. This guidance assumes the sale of Valves & Controls closes by the end of the first quarter of 2017. We expect to achieve this guidance on core revenue of down 3% and margin expansion of 120 basis points, driven by simplifying the organization and the resulting cost-out from those efforts. Please turn to slide 14 labeled 2017 forecasted revenue. Slide 14 walks our revenue from the reported $4.89 billion of revenue in 2016 to our expected revenue of approximately $4.7 billion, inclusive of the large jobs and foreign exchange headwinds. Starting on the left, we expect volume, inclusive of one dairy job in Water and three large oil sands jobs in Electrical, to impact revenue by about four points. Excluding the impact of the large jobs, we are expecting volume to be down around two points. We're anticipating one point of favorable pricing and about one point from tuck-in acquisitions already completed. These two acquisitions consist of a small tuck-in to our Electrical & Fastening Solutions strategic business group and a biogas recovery acquisition in the Filtration & Process SBG. So, excluding the impact of year-over-year currency, we expect revenue to be down around 2%. Inclusive of another $75 million of revenue headwind at around $1.05 to the euro, we expect overall reported 2017 revenue to be down around 3% versus 2016. Please turn to slide 15 labeled 2017 forecasted segment income. On slide 15, we're walking 2016 reported segment income to expected 2017 segment income. Starting with 2016, we expect about $20 million of total headwind of the net of volume growth, $8 million from the acquisitions, price and large jobs. We expect $135 million of gross cost-out from both material and labor and we expect to generate $60 million in net benefit after the impact of about 2% of inflation in material and wages. This drives about a 5% segment income growth year-over-year versus 2016. After the impact of about $10 million of FX, we are at $870 million of segment income at the midpoint, which is up about 4% year-over-year on a reported basis. Please turn to slide 16 labeled 2017 forecasted adjusted EPS walk. Slide 16 walks EPS from 2016 to 2017. Starting from the left, you see there is about $0.15 of headwind from the large jobs and FX and about $0.30 or 10% expansion from net cost-out and growth in price. Another 10% or about $0.30 comes from the expected closure of Valves & Controls by the end of the first quarter and the resulting three quarters of interest benefit from paying down the debt or about $0.09 to $0.10 per quarter. This takes us to our $0.50 at the midpoint or up about 15% versus the $3.05 in 2016. Please turn to slide 17 labeled anticipated 2017 sales and income seasonality. Slide 17 shows the expected 2017 seasonality of our revenue, segment income, and EPS versus 2016. You could see that revenue and segment income are in line with contribution percentages in 2016. The only difference is EPS, which is skewed by the interest benefit in Q2 through Q4 and no contribution of this interest savings in Q1. Excluding the interest, operational EPS would be in line with 2016. Please turn to slide 18 labeled Q1 2017 Pentair outlook. Slide 18 shows you our expected earnings per share estimates for Q1 of about $0.61, which is flat with the comparable period one year ago. You could see that we expect core sales to be down around 4 points or down 1 point excluding the impact of large jobs. We expect ROS expansion of 20 basis points, driven by the headwinds from the large jobs and the fact that we have yet to receive the full run rate benefits of the cost takeout which we are expecting in Q2 through Q4. Overall, adjusted EPS for Q1 is anticipated to be flat year-over-year. We're expecting our tax rate should be 20%, which is consistent with 2016. We expect net interest expense of $35 million as we will not yet have any debt pay-down benefit. Finally, we expect shares to be a little higher at 184 million, which does not yet reflect any benefit of the approximately $100 million in buyback that we anticipate to benefit us in Q2 through Q4. As a reminder, cash flow in Q1 is usually a usage, given our normal seasonality of cash flows. Please turn to slide 19 labeled balance sheet and cash flow. My final slide shares with you our current balance sheet and cash flow performance. As Randy mentioned, we had another strong year of cash flow at $609 million or 109% of adjusted net income for our continuing operations businesses. You could see our debt levels before our anticipated net proceeds from our Valves & Controls divestiture. We expect to use the proceeds to immediately reduce our debt levels. I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for Q&A after which, Randy will have a few closing remarks. Matthew, please open the line for questions. Thank you.
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi, guys. Good morning.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Hey, Steve.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Can you just walk through the $135 million in productivity savings for next year? It's a pretty significant bump-up. What's the visibility around that?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yeah. So, good visibility, first of all, Steve. I mean, the simplification of the organization is driving tremendous amount of opportunity to take incremental cost out. But if you think about it, we're going to – we're expecting to get $59 million or $60 million of material productivity against an inflation number of $45 million, $46 million. So, we're starting to be squeezed a little bit on the benefit and material productivity versus inflation. But we expect our net cost-out actions from the people cost minus any delta on inflation and/or compensation to yield us close to $45 million on a net basis.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. That makes sense. And then on just the interest expense, the run rate exiting the year is definitely lower than what we were expecting. Are you guys – is the refi of the debt kind of in line with what you guys had talked about previously? Or is there more debt pay-down? Anything changed on that front?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yeah. It's just that as we collected cash in the quarter, we trickled down the debt a little bit, Steve. And so, we expect to be maybe slightly lower in Q1, and then we'll see the significant benefits in Q2, Q3, and Q4.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC. Your line is open.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Good morning, Deane.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Good morning.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Maybe just start with the 4Q kind of tone of business. One of the things you talked about heading into the quarter was don't expect any sort of normal seasonality, no budget flush, and kind of see more of the same deferrals of MRO and so forth. And so, how did it play out from a broad level in terms of what you would typically see in a 4Q?
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Yeah. Across the number of the businesses, as I mentioned in the prepared script, October was soft. And then, we saw a return to more normal levels except in a couple of different segments where, basically, distributors weren't remotely close to getting rebates, so they were particularly slow. The deferral in Thermal is not surprising given the – well, people are optimistic about energy. That has not really improved the spending, particularly in the larger companies. But I'd say that rates are stable and we're not assuming a bounce-back in our forecast in 2017 until we see something. So, that's how – I guess that's – (23:14)?
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. And then, in the change to the core revenue outlook, previously, minus 2% to positive 2%. You're now at minus 3%. You discussed, at a high level, the impact of the jobs. So, maybe just kind of next layer of detail, how did this play out in the quarter? Have you ring-fenced this in terms of its impact with regard to being at the lower – below the low end of the core revenues?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yeah. I mean, just to cut through it, I think our core revenue, if you exclude the projects, is down about 0.6%. Let's round it to down 1%. That's generally where we were this year. And so, what Randy is saying is we don't see an improvement off of the run rates that we're at. I think we're as optimistic as anyone that we'll start to see some improvement in the industrial spending and also some return to normal spending on the downstream MRO activities. But right now, our forecast does not assume any of that.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Yeah. We've been head-faked on it before. We're not going to (24:21) again.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: And just last question for me conceptually going to one segment in Water. You've got these SBGs. So, it's Filtration and Flow and Aquatics, but each of them has such a different growth potential, different end markets, different technologies. Will we still get line of sight and clarity into the SBGs on a go-forward basis? Will you have margin targets within them? Just kind of give us some color there, please?
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Yeah, of course, we will. And what we see is more coherent strategy, particularly on much, much better coordination on the technology side between, say, the Residential Filtration all the way through to the process industry. I mean, these are technologies that can be applied and much more seamlessly and we can flow resources to the best growth opportunities. So, yeah, we will have separate targets. And for example in Water Technologies, it's still a margin. We can improve margin there. That's the focus there. And on the Filtration side, it's driving growth like we already have good margins, we want to drive growth like we're getting in Aquatics.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Your line is open.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks, and good morning, guys.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Good morning.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Hey, Steve.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey. Can we just start – I guess I'm about to lose visibility of Flow & Filtration margins with the re-segmentation. So, where do you see yourselves in terms of the margin improvement initiatives that are going on? I could obviously see what happened in the quarter, but it doesn't really probably tell the full story given with 5% productivity versus price and all that. Maybe just in price, can you talk about that a little bit?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yeah. I think one of the things that we wanted to do in Water is we want to make sure that we can rise up and invest appropriately across the entire water space. And when you subdivide into segments, you lose that ability to generate the cash and deploy the cash back to the best growth opportunities. And there are good growth opportunities in the old Flow & Filtration space. At the same time, there is margin needs and the need to get the complexity out of it, as Randy said, the pump side of the business where there has been significant competition globally in that space. So, when we take a look at these margins – and when we get to Analyst Day, we'll certainly give you guys direction in where we are. But the real opportunity here is to say how do we disproportionally invest in the longer term. So, these are all high margin businesses with Aquatics being the highest margin and Flow being the lowest margin. But I think, ultimately, we think that they're all – got 20%-plus margin potential, Steve. On the pricing side, we're getting a little bit more price and we expect to because of commodity inflation that we're seeing. And so, where we have the distribution-related businesses, we're seeing that work its way into somewhere around the 1% range. And then where we're in projects, where we're against global competition because of the challenges of the currency, we're not getting any price. And we're obviously taking a look at those jobs and making sure that we understand the currency impact in competing on that basis.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And on the reorganization, you talked about simplification and cost-out as being one of the benefits of this. But I didn't see any kind of restructuring built into the 2017 plan on that front. Maybe some idea of how you're thinking about that?
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Well, a lot of the costs we're taking out – we have operating people at corporate in three segments. It's basically that the cost and the productivity that John talked about earlier, that's the real benefit of it. And we're taking out structure which we believe is going to improve our focus and our ability to execute.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yeah and...
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Without restructuring...
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: (28:36) of total restructuring cost is the estimate and that would have been spanned over the last Q3, Q4 and into Q1 of 2017.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Perfect. And just lastly on ERICO. That was, I think, really I hope to stabilize portfolio. Here's a quarter where it was down 4% excluding days impact on Engineered Fastening. Maybe – and I know you talked about some of the dynamics there, but was this surprising to you or how do you think about the dynamics of that segment?
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: They surely saw an acute softness in October and it recovered. But we don't know whether we saw that in three separate businesses that were unrelated to each other. So, we think it was more channel softness that then firmed up again and there's more optimism now. So, yeah, we didn't expect – and we're back to where we thought we'd be.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Thank you. Just a question. There's a lot of talk throughout the release of the large jobs impact and you also mentioned the sort of merits of predictable growth in your prepared remarks. So, could we assume that there has been – or there's a potential change in focus underway, away from bidding on a lot of large jobs activity? And maybe give us some sense, overall, under your definition of large jobs, how much of that $4.9 billion sales base last year came from them.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yeah. So, good question. I think when you take a look at the roughly $90 million to $100 million of job impact that we're expecting in Technical Solutions, which is now Electrical, that's all in Thermal. And in fact, we were actually up slightly in 2016 revenue versus 2015, and 2015 and 2014 were flat. So, we've run historically roughly this $100 million to $125 million through the pipeline of always having larger jobs. With what has happened in the global oil and gas investment space, that landscape is clearly changing, and I'll let Randy talk to that.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Yeah. I mean, we're excited to win those jobs even as the energy markets turn down. They had a longer tail now. And now that they've gone down, there just aren't a lot of those large projects in hostile environment. It's basically cold environments, it's where the thermal big projects are. And there aren't as many developments there. So, we're not focused there. We're focused on making sure we get all of the MRO in Thermal we can and focusing on that more profitable. That was one of the challenges on our margins in Technical Solutions, those project margins versus MRO. And we are more focused on driving the MRO.
Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it. Thank you.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: So, while the top line gets affected by the lack of projects, we don't think the bottom line is as affected.
Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Understood. Thank you. And then my follow-up would be around just the margin opportunities on the sort of two new segmentation bases. Should we assume, I guess, the Water margins expand in 2017 at a much faster rate than Electrical just because there's less of a large jobs impact? And maybe talk a little bit about sort of medium term margin expansion across the two segments on the new bases.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Well, actually, Electrical, we expect margins to snap back. They took a – they went backwards in 2016 versus where they've been. So, (32:32).
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Well, yeah, I mean, we're looking at the same general margin expansions of both the businesses of low hundreds of basis points expansion. I think we get there in two different ways. I mean, we have a little bit more growth contribution in the Water side. And in the Electrical side, we have the benefit, as Randy mentioned, between not having the margin squeeze of the projects and we also have a fair amount of cost take-out planned relative to the volume rightsizing. I mean, as we go forward, I mean, clearly, the biggest margin opportunity is going to be in the Water side, certainly in the focused areas that Randy mentioned earlier. And we're going to see the growth contribution in the Electrical as the markets begin to recover, generate some substantial drop-through as they're higher margin businesses already.
Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan from UBS. Your line is open.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Good morning, guys.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Hey, Shannon.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Hey. So, just on the marketing hire, can you give a little more color on sort of why now and why create that new role now? I mean, the growth challenge has sort of been something that persisted for a while. So, why make the move now and what do you expect it to deliver?
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Well, we've actually been working on the move for a while, trying to find the right person who had experience and capability in marketing and had actually done it in industrial. So, John has worked in a number of companies including Honeywell and Kennametal and his track record is very, very helpful. So, he's going to work with our two Presidents, Beth and Karl, and me, to make sure that we have deployed people in the right place and that we are driving stronger execution on the marketing programs of the company.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. And then, John, on the decisions around what to do with the proceeds from Valves & Controls, looks like you're pretty much mostly delevering a little bit of buyback. Can you just talk about the thought process of why you chose that route and then thoughts around relevering and ideal leverage ratio?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yeah. I think first of all, just introducing some modest buyback is important to us. I mean, taking care of the creep and also just making sure that we're consistently doing that on a basis. So, we're talking about $100 million, it's a modest amount. And as far as paying the debt down, we expect that we'll bring the debt levels down. We have strong cash flow generation that can fund bolt-on acquisitions. And if we need to borrow a little bit more, we got plenty of capacity to borrow under all of our current capacity lines to fund the bolt-on or tuck-in acquisition path that we expect to embark upon.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Robert Baird. Your line is open.
Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey. Good morning, guys.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Good morning.
Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): So, on the productivity side, just back to that $135 million. Could you just bucket out where that's coming from kind of highlighting what portion of that is stranded cost, and where the opportunity set, how that looks like? And the other piece is, obviously, from the other comments, Flow & Filtration remained the focus, but just a little more granularity.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yeah. Good question, Mike. I mean, I think we are focused on the stranded cost in the beginning. But we're really looking at is enterprise-wide reduction. So, how do we get best optimal finance cost across the entire organization? How do we get the best HR cost across the organization? So, what we've done is taken a look, as Randy mentioned, and functionalized the G&A aspects to the corporate executives and we've driven about a 10% expectation reduction off of those. And happy to say that we've made good progress against those, and embarrassed to say it was easy. But, I think we were doing a lot of costs to support the Valves & Controls organization, the global nature. And post-Valves & Controls, we have a much simpler organization to support. So, there's a huge opportunity there. Other things, we're moving 52 selling teams to 6. Obviously, some big opportunity from a structure standpoint there. So, we didn't have, at the SBG level, the selling organization. Those exist today. And so, a ton of opportunities especially after – in the non-scaled regions in the fast growth areas, same with marketing, same with technology, same with all of those structures. So, that gives you a little bit of an insight to, as Randy mentioned, the simplification of the organization structure. But more importantly, the accountability of the organization structure and the ability for us to have visibility to who's performing, who's not, and then how to partner with them to achieve it.
Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks. That's helpful. And then just a clarification from earlier. It sounds like you guys are saying no fundamental improvement from current run rate assumed in the 2017 guidance. Do I have that right? In other words, pretty normal sequential pattern assumed through here. Is that the thought process?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yes.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: If you look at the waterfall that John showed, you don't see a lot of lift from growth and that's where we'd expect higher execution in sales and any recovery of market would read out.
Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Appreciate the time, guys. Take care.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Walsh with Vertical Research. Your line is open.
John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Hi. Good morning.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Good morning.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Good morning.
John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC: So, I guess just going back to earlier question Deane asked around the Q3 framework. I mean, clearly, you would have had visibility into the projects back then. We're hearing from other companies kind of leveraged in the industrial world that things are getting better. It does sound like things obviously got better for you through the quarter. But are there any other kind of comments on why we're no longer looking at towards the high end of that or what would have to change to kind of get back to that framework?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: I think in our original thought process, in the framework, we did see and expect a little uptick in some of the core markets. And in this particular guidance range, we're assuming that those don't occur. Now, we're hopeful like everybody else that they will. But right now, in this guidance framework, we're not assuming that they do.
John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay. And then, I guess, a question about the new segmentation. I guess thinking about it from a structural tax inefficiency way, is there any inefficiency from actually splitting Water and Electrical from a tax perspective?
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: I don't know.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: I don't know.
John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay. All right. Well, thank you for the color.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey. Good morning. Two questions, one on organic sales, the little bit of lower guidance that you're putting out here today. Is that – I know you've just indicated that you're no longer expecting an uptick. But is part of the reduction maybe that you put pen to paper on these projects and said really kind of crystallize that for you in realizing that those are going to be non-repeats? Because that's a minus 2% for you? Is that part of it as well?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Scott, I mean, candidly, I will share with you that a big piece of what we're trying to figure out on a longer-term basis is the impact of a stronger dollar globally and the global competition and how that affects our growth views. And then there's a lot of global change that has occurred in the last three months, a new presidential administration, there's some emerging tax strategies there but none of that has been identified, none of that has been decided. So, what is the impact on that going to be to industrial investment? And also what's going to happen in Europe and are there going to counterviews (40:53) to any decisions that our administration makes. So, we see a lot of uncertainty, from an investment standpoint, in the first half of the year that I don't think we have the ability to call. So, what we're forecasting is what happened in Q4 continue to exist until there is some type of change.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): John, that's a really good answer – thank you – particularly the FX, which I wish more companies would call out. The other thing that I wanted to ask was about the impact of the organic decline vis-à-vis the $20 million worth of – in the waterfall. Is the $20 million enough? Or is there so much pricing or is the pricing component here enough where the minus $20 million kind of works? I mean, obviously, you're assuming that that's what works. But I guess with just a minus 3-ish organic, the minus $20 million looks like it could be a little bit deeper.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yeah. So, the projects themselves didn't yield very much return, right? So, they're usually quoted on a more of a gross margin rate that's normally equal to a segment income or operating margin rate. And we did have some overruns in some of those jobs that forced those down as we took you through in Q3 and Q4. So, the price is a big factor as you got about 1% price increase helps that drop-through quite a bit.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. That's great. Thanks a lot.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Good color so far. So it seems that from your comments that channel distributor ordering activity is weak in the first half of the quarter, a little bit of – maybe some channel clearance. Just the inference would be that December was stronger and, therefore, given that's – I think you said, John, down 0.6% core sales ex large projects, ex days. So, therefore, that metric, would that be a positive number in December? Just thinking about the exit rate as we exit the year.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: You're talking about December of 2016?
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: December 2015. So, just thinking about once we cleared out the channel impact, would we be back to growth in December?
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Yes, a little bit, yes.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Okay. That's clear. But you're assuming that the run rate is for the quarter, not December?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: No. I think we got to take a look at the quarter itself as the run rate and we're carrying that...
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: 4 days.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: ...lesser days, yes.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, just back to the cost reductions. Obviously, it's a big part of the bridge. How much of that, just to be clear, how much of that target is driven by the formation of the Water segment sort of gone from two to one in that segmentation?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yeah. I would say we think that there is an opportunity somewhere in the $15 million to $20 million range regarding that.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Okay. And then, just finally on the debt reduction, just to be clear, so the vast, vast majority of the proceed is being used to take down debt. Obviously, that includes some of the higher cost debt. Any sense yet on the breakage costs of doing that?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: No. But clearly, as the interest rate rises, it does make the costs lower for Pentair. So, obviously, looking at that every day, but we have not given guidance on what that impact is yet.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just one more, if I may. On the large projects, is the bulk of that washed through by the second half of the year?
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: I think so.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yeah. There is about – I'd say through Q3, the bulk of it is work-through, Q3.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. Great. Thanks, guys.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Or around Q4 (44:52). Yeah. That's on page 14.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Marketing [Markets]. Your line is open.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning, guys.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Hey, Jeff.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Hey, Jeff.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Just with – you mentioned the presidential change and some of the moving pieces, can you just talk about border adjustments, tariffs, and how you're manufacturing footprint kind of aligns with that? Are you – in your Mexico footprint – and how some changes there might impact your thinking?
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: It's all speculation now. We're keenly watching and listening. We have plants all over the world. So, we're cautious and prepared to react whichever way it goes.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then just real quick, I don't know if I missed it, did you give a corporate expense number for the year?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: We did not but we should assume that it's right around $100 million.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Your line is open.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Hello, Nathan.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: John, could you just be a little bit more precise to what the total anticipated debt reduction is post the closure of the V&C deal?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: That's roughly around $2.6 billion.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. So, pretty much all of it is going in there. I think you had talked before about planning to deploy a good chunk of that capital into either M&A or share repurchase. Can you talk about the decision over changing of that decision and to focus more on debt reduction now?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: I think we always intended to, A, reduce the debt. And then, B, was to re-establish a more normal recurring buyback which is what I said was $100 million. And then we believe we're going to have a rich pipeline of opportunities which we call tuck-in or bolt-ons, which tend to be the smaller, much more strategic and highly-accretive opportunities.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: And we'll lever up to do the ones that are prudent and create shareholder value. But we don't want the money sitting around on our balance sheet. We're waiting on that.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Fair enough. And then I think in response to Steve's first question, you talked about $45 million of cost out in 2017. When we talked about this a few months ago, that number was a fair bit higher. Is that number a fair bit higher on a run-rate basis, and it takes some time to work up to get that $45 million? And what's kind of the run rate that you would assume for simplification/cost-out of the organization post the divestiture of the Valves & Controls business?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yeah. Just a couple of clarifications, we showed $60 million of net productivity. So, think of that as $15 million of net material and $45 million of net labor. And we do have labor inflation globally and that's the difference between the numbers we previously talked about, and these are net numbers versus gross numbers. And the other was gross, right.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then just on the project in cold areas, if the U.S. government now looking like they're going to go ahead and approve Keystone and Dakota Access, what kind of opportunity would that be for you guys?
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: I think eventually, it probably will help the oil sands be more competitive, eventually when completed.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Is there any numbers you could frame around that?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Could not.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: It would be speculative at this point...
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: All right. Okay. Thanks, guys.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Just on the re-consolidating of Water, you split it at one point after the Valves & Controls acquisition. So, I'm just wondering what the idea was in previously splitting that, that didn't hold or maybe that was always an interim structure for a specified goal.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Chris, we did it then so we could have a focused leadership over the different parts. We were more complex when we picked up three businesses, when we did Flow Control. And we just felt like it would get more focused leadership that way. What we've found as we simplified, right, and selling Valves, a (50:01) big a piece of the business, as we looked at simplifying the organization – I think we said it was like $27 million of stranded costs, we said there's really more we can do and there's ways we can streamline. And also as we looked at growth and we looked at where resources were in Water, we really felt that we want to remove the barriers, organizational barriers so that we could flow – John mentioned earlier all the different sales forces. We're overstaffed in some sales forces, understaffed in others. We need to be able to make the organization more facile in moving those investments around. So, that essentially is the new thought.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. That makes sense. Was there any notion at any point that Flow & Filtration was under any kind of strategic review?
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: No.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Got it.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: We've made progress on margins there and some of our best growth talent was on the other side. So, we've made it easier to move folks.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Sounds good.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Okay. Thank you very much, and thanks for all of your questions and your attention over the last hour. We believe our move to two segments better positions us for more predictable long-term organic growth while also improving the cost structure of the organization post Valves & Controls. We look forward to completing the sale of Valves & Controls by the end of this quarter, at which point, we'll be able to significantly strengthen our balance sheet. We will see an improvement in EPS from lower interest expense. But just as important, we'll be able to get back to our disciplined capital allocation strategy focused on bolt-on acquisitions and stock buyback. Thank you for your continued interest in Pentair. Good day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call, You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Scott and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Pentair Q3 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Jim Lucas, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.
Jim Lucas - Pentair Plc: Thanks, Scott, and welcome to Pentair's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. We're glad you can join us. I'm Jim Lucas, Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Planning. With me today is Randy Hogan, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Stauch, our Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, we will provide details on our third quarter 2016 performance as well as our fourth quarter and full-year 2016 outlook, as outlined in this morning's release. Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as the risks outlined in Pentair's most recent 10-K and today's release. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today, and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results. Today's webcast is accompanied by a presentation which can be found in the Investors section of Pentair's website. We will reference these slides throughout our prepared remarks. Any references to non-GAAP financials are reconciled in the appendix of the presentation. We will be sure to reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. I would like to request that you limit your questions to one and a follow-up in order to ensure everyone an opportunity to ask their questions. I will now turn the call over to Randy.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Thanks, Jim, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll be starting on slide 4. We delivered third quarter results that operationally met the high end of our forecast and were slightly above our guidance as a result of anticipated separation costs that did not materialize. While two of our three segments did not deliver core sales growth as a result of continued slow industrial spending, the margin performance overall is a testament to our strong discipline around cost management. We announced in August that we reached an agreement to sell our Valves & Controls business to Emerson. This transaction is on track to close at the end of this year or early next year, subject to regulatory approvals. We're not expecting any recovery in industrial capital or maintenance spending at the end of the year in contrast to the typical year-end lift. Given this muted top line outlook predominantly on industrial-facing businesses, we're lower our fourth quarter outlook. We do not believe the fourth quarter is indicative of a trend, and we expect at some point maintenance spending will return in a more meaningful way. And longer cycle projects, particularly in food and beverage and infrastructure, are also likely to break loose. As we look ahead to 2017, we believe we are positioned to deliver strong EPS expansion despite this ongoing slower growth environment. I'll discuss this in more detail later in the call. Now let's turn to slide five for discussion of our Q3 2016 results. Third quarter core sales decline 2% as we saw further slowdown in capital spending throughout the quarter and ongoing referrals deferrals in maintenance spending. Water Quality Systems was our only segment to deliver core growth as the pool business once again finished the season in a strong position. We reached the one-year anniversary of the ERICO acquisition and the performance has met all of our expectation. Segment income grew 15% and return on sales expanded 110 basis points to 17.9%. Water Quality Systems delivered over 300 basis points of margin expansion. And despite the core sales decline in Flow & Filtration Solutions, income and margins were down only modestly as the segment delivered on better internal execution. Adjusted EPS grew 11% to $0.78 per share and exceeded our forecast of $0.70 to $0.75 per share as our core operating results met our income forecast while we did not incur the one-time separation costs we were expecting below the segment income line. Free cash flow continued to be bright spot, up over $150 million year-to-date compared to last year, and our conversion to adjusted net income remains just north of 100%. Now, let's turn to slide six for more detail on Pentair's Q3 2016 performance. Once again the residential and commercial vertical was a bright spot, driven in large part by our strong North American pool performance. While ERICO's performance was not captured in the core, its commercial sales also remain strong. After a good second quarter, we did see overall infrastructure sales decline modestly in the third quarter. We continue to see strength in engineered pump orders and backlog but our process filtration business faces difficult second half comparisons as large projects in the comparable period last year are not repeating. Food and beverage declined with delays in a number of larger beverage projects being the largest factor this quarter. While we've greatly reduced our exposure and energy, our remaining sales for this vertical remain under pressure. Industrial was down in the quarter due in part to ongoing deferrals in short cycle MRO spending and a global capital spending freeze that shows no sign of thawing. The right-hand side of the page shows that price and productivity continue to more than offset inflation as we continue to control costs across the enterprise. ERICO's contribution also helped drive the strong margin performance in the quarter. Now let's turn to slide seven for a look at Water Quality Systems performance in Q3. Water Quality Systems delivered core growth of 2%. These results were below our expectations as within our water filtration business we saw foodservice and commercial market softness in North America and Western Europe, as well as shifts in timing of key account program installation. We also experienced a moderation in growth rates in the fast growth regions as our distributors closely managed inventory levels due to slower growth in China. The North American pool market ended its season on a strong note. We continue to view this market favorably longer-term. We also believe our water filtration business has good long-term prospects and expect growth to return in 2017 as new product rollouts and key account program installations, particularly in foodservice, return to growth at a normal level. Segment income grew an impressive 15% and return on sales expanded 240 basis points to 21.2%. Robust operating leverage was once again the largest contributor to this strong margin performance, with the strong growth in the pool business contributing positively in the quarter. Now let's move to slide eight for a look at Flow & Filtration Solutions performance in Q3. Flow & Filtration Solutions saw core sales decline 6%. While we anticipated sales to contract in the quarter, water technologies and fluid solutions were down more than expected, as we saw softening demand in short cycle pump sales and weaker capital spending and beverage. Water technologies core sales declined 3% as distributors managed inventory levels tightly and we saw continued declines in irrigation sales, albeit at a moderated pace. We experienced a dramatic slowdown in fast growth regions, particularly in the Middle East and Latin America as sell-through was soft in the quarter and, as a result, distributors are not restocking. In contrast, Western Europe was a bright spot, up double digits in the quarter with good momentum. We continue to see an improvement in infrastructure bid activity, which points to a stronger 2017. Fluid solutions core sales declined 1%, which is slightly better than the 3% decline we saw last quarter. Sales in agriculture grew modestly in the quarter and, importantly, we expect this momentum to continue. Our biogas and beer membrane filtration businesses remain strong, offset partially by our beverage business seeing a number of large project delays globally and softer component sell-through. Core sales in process filtration declined 22%, largely in line with expectations, with the key drivers being project timing within infrastructure as well as declines in oil and gas and industrial filtration. Segment income and return on sales declined modestly as the impact of lower volumes were not fully offset by the continued strong productivity and pricing seen for the past several quarters. We remain vigilant on improving the cost structure to offset the impact of lower volumes. Looking ahead, we expect food and beverage to rebound with agriculture turning positive, along with growth in biogas and beer membrane filtration. As we continue to reduce the complexity in the business and drive better execution in projects, we believe we have a long runway for margin improvement. Now let's turn to slide nine to discuss how Technical Solutions performed in the third quarter. Technical Solutions reported 26% sales growth for the quarter, consisting of 1% core sales decline and a 27% positive contributions from ERICO. Core sales in enclosures declined 1% as industrial sales continue to bounce along the bottom, diminishing chances of any order rate growth acceleration for the remainder of 2016. Thermal management core sales declined 5% as downstream energy MRO product sales are not showing any signs of recovery. Our industrial heat tracing business continues to win small projects, but our project growth was challenged as large Canadian projects are nearing completion. While the results of ERICO are captured as acquisition contribution, the business performed in line with our expectations at the completion of the one-year deal anniversary. The majority of ERICO's sales are into commercial vertical, which continued to deliver growth in the quarter, although the rate of growth is moderating. Segment income grew 18% as return on sales contracted 140 basis points to 22%. Margin contraction was isolated to our thermal management business, as the sales of projects versus higher-margin MRO product sales negatively impacted mix and we face the productivity issues at the end of the large Canadian projects. ERICO has performed as we had anticipated, and enclosures continues to stabilize. The performance of these two businesses was not enough in the quarter to offset the margin impact from thermal management. We're not expecting downstream MRO spending to rebound for the remainder of the year. We also expect the Canadian project margins to pressure thermal margins in Q4, as we substantially complete them before the end of the year. This will undoubtedly have an impact on fourth quarter margins for Technical Solutions. With ERICO and enclosures performing as expected and thermal completing the large Canadian projects, we still believe Technical Solutions remains well positioned longer term. I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2016 outlook and then I'll have a few closing remarks about how we're looking at the world entering 2017.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Thank you, Randy. Please turn to slide number 10, titled Q4 2016 Pentair outlook. For the fourth quarter, ERICO is now captured in the core results, so core sales and total sales are currently equal to each other. For the fourth quarter, we expect overall sales to decline approximately 6%, as we expect MRO trends in energy and customer capital spending in all verticals to worsen as we head into the end of the year. Motivation for customers to push our projects and commitments shows no signs of stopping by the end of the year. On a core basis, we expect Water Quality Systems to grow approximately 2%, while we expect Flow & Filtration Solutions to decline approximately 9%, primarily related to project spending in the food and beverage vertical. Technical Solutions is expected to decline approximately 10%, due in large part to the completion of previously mentioned large Canadian projects and mid-teens declines in year-over-year MRO spending within energy. We expect segment income to be down approximately 10%, and return on sales to decline roughly 70 basis points to 17%. Below the operating line, we continue to expect the tax rate to remain around 21.5%, net interest and other to approximate $35 million, and shares outstanding to be around 184 million, about flat with Q3 ending levels. We expect free cash flow to end the year on a strong note, greater than continuing operations net income of $550 million and nearly $780 million inclusive of Valves & Controls. Please turn to slide 11, labeled full year 2016 Pentair outlook. As Randy mentioned at the beginning of the call, we've taken our full-year adjusted EPS outlook for continuing operations down to approximately $3 for 2016. For the full year, we expect core sales to decline 1%. Water Quality Systems full-year core sales are anticipated to be up approximately 4%. We now expect Flow & Filtration Solutions core sales decline of 4% and Technical Solutions core sales to be down 2% for the full year. We expect segment income to grow roughly 11% and return on sales to expand approximately 70 basis points to 17.1%. Our revised forecast factors in slightly better operating performance from Water Quality Systems, while Technical Solutions and Flow & Filtration Solutions are expected to have margins impacted by negative mix related to unfavorable market conditions. The pressure on higher-margin short cycle sales has been felt most acutely within Technical Solutions. We anticipate full-year corporate cost to be just under $110 million, net interest and other roughly $141 million, and the share count to be roughly 183 million. Adjusted EPS is expected to grow approximately 6%. Finally, we remain on track to generate free cash flow in excess of adjusted net income for the full year. Please turn to slide 12, labeled balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the third quarter with $4.4 billion net debt inclusive of cash on hand. This continues to improve as we used our strong cash flows in the quarter to reduce our debt levels. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow has increased over $150 million versus the first nine months last year. We continue to expect to deliver free cash flow greater than adjusted net income for the full year. Our ROIC ended the quarter at 10.6%. When the sale of Valves & Controls closes, we expect our balance sheet will look dramatically different for the better, with lower debt levels and balance sheet capacity available for tuck-ins or incremental buybacks. I'll now turn the call back over to Randy for some closing comments and preliminary thoughts around 2017.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: I'll wrap up beginning on slide 13. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, the sale of Valves & Controls remains on track to close at the end of this year or early next year, subject to the regulatory approvals. With the closing and the Valves & Controls separation, we expect the infusion of cash to alter our balance sheet dramatically for the better. As we discussed in August, we know what debt we will retire, mostly within our bank line. We're also exploring other options to restructure our debt, substantially reduce interest expense on our higher cost fixed rate long-term debt. We also continue to build our bolt-on acquisition funnel for businesses that have earned the right to grow, primarily within Water Quality Systems. We're doing what we can to control our destiny and while we still see some pockets of growth within residential and commercial and infrastructure, the uncertainty around any type of recovery within industrial gives us pause. So we're taking a closer look at our cost structure and adjusting it accordingly. Now, let's move to slide 14 for a look at segment positioning. Water Quality Systems has been a bright spot within the Pentair portfolio for several years, and while we've seen the growth rate moderate some, we continue to believe in the long-term prospects of this high-performing segment. With strong residential demand, dealer intimacy and a steady stream of new products, our outlook for the aquatics business remains strong. Within water filtration, we continue to believe we will benefit from increased awareness around water quality globally, and our investments in a more focused sales effort in North America and Europe are already paying early dividends. Foodservice has been a relatively consistent growth business for us longer term. We continue to believe there are many avenues for growth, including traditional restaurant sales as well as edging on into adjacent products and connected solutions. We believe Flow & Filtration Solutions remains the biggest opportunity for improvement within the Pentair portfolio. Our number one priority is reducing the complexity of the business, accelerating cost-out action and focusing on the most attractive growth prospects. We continue to see momentum around biogas and beer membrane filtration. It is encouraging that agriculture seems to have bottomed. So, we believe we're building some momentum exiting this year after a tough couple of years. As I discussed previously, we are seeing improved orders in backlog and infrastructure, which is a longer cycle part of the business, and is positioning for a return to growth. Finally, we're placing an increased focus on building our aftermarket service capabilities to leverage our installed base. Flow & Filtration Solutions has a number of opportunities and our principal focus is to prioritize which opportunities drive first and build momentum to restore growth and raise margins. We believe Technical Solutions has an attractive position in profitable areas of the electrical industry. We expect the 2016 headwinds will begin to dissipate as industrial order rates are near trough levels, hints of inflation returning are on the horizon, large projects in Canada are complete, and deferred MRO spending cannot continue forever. While we expect the strong growth in commercial to moderate, growth is likely to continue, progressively right-sizing the cost structure with the slower growth environment. This is the piece of our portfolio where we still have energy exposure. And while oil prices appear to have stabilized, we'll watch closely for signs of improving thermal MRO spending. While we still expect some near-term headwinds in parts of our portfolio, we still believe there are many avenues for growth longer-term. Now let's move to slide 15 for a look at the framework for 2017. Given the portfolio change and attendant P&L and balance sheet improvements we're undergoing, we think it's important to provide some framework for thinking about our prospects for next year. As we discussed throughout the call, we expect the slow growth world we are all facing today to continue, and we do not expect a meaningful recovery in 2017. Therefore, it's prudent to focus on having our cost structure aligned with this reality, the result of which should be margin expansion from all three segments next year. Upon the closing of the Valves & Controls sale, we expect to have an opportunity to restructure our debt, which will reduce interest expense. Also, we expect to have the financial flexibility to explore other opportunities to allocate capital in a disciplined manner. By focusing on cost, simplifying the business and improving the capital structure, we expect to be able to deliver EPS growth in excess of 15% next year with minimal top-line help while still positioning the company for the longer term. Thanks. And operator, can you please open the line for questions.
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan from UBS. Your line is open.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Good morning, guys.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Good morning, Shannon.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Good morning, Shannon.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Hey, so, just on kind of the 4Q caution, I mean, is there anything in October that's making you think we've seen yet another like down or you just, is this lack of inflection, concerns around election – maybe just a little more color on what keeps you cautious on 4Q? And I know you're more optimistic beyond 4Q.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yeah, Shannon. It's John here. I think what, if you take a look at Q3, we started out really strong and we ended okay, but we certainly didn't see acceleration towards the end of Q3. And what we're seeing is continued project slippage, where these are projects that we've either won, but the start dates on the projects continue to move to the right. And given where we are right now, with all the uncertainty you mentioned, we just don't think our customers are going to rush to conclude them between now and the end of the year. The other main issue is we've been hoping that MRO would recover throughout this year and that's on the operational side, primarily in energy, and we're not hopeful now at this point that that's going to recover for the end of the year as our customers manage cash to the end of the balance sheets. So, those are the main issues.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Yeah. We almost always see an uptick in the industrial spending in the fourth quarter and what we're saying is, we're not counting on that this time, with these deferrals.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. And then just, in terms of all segments improving margins next year, the one that's been a little bit tougher has been Flow & Filtration, maybe just an update on how you think they're progressing operationally? I know volumes were a little tougher this quarter, but what – do you have confidence that segment can improve margins next year?
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Yeah. If we had hit the forecast of down 2% instead of down 6%, we would have expanded margin. I think we're making a lot of progress on simplifying the product line and on driving productivity. It's a business that frankly didn't get as much attention as we focused on Valves & Controls and now we're getting back to it. So I think there's lots of opportunities and things like agriculture coming back, the crop spray business and some of the other businesses that are some of the more profitable businesses, those stabilizing and even getting a little bit of growth is going to help in the mix.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker from Bernstein. Your line is open.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, all.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Morning, Steve.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Just first a quick question on ERICO. So I know it's not in core growth. What would that have contributed to core growth? What was just the ERICO core growth for that business?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: 1% to 2%, Steve.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And just on Water Quality Systems, this was one of your strongest businesses that could do no wrong historically and clearly you had a forecast for 8% at least in terms of guidance, came in at just 2%. You talked about a couple of those dynamics, but maybe also for John, I mean where was the forecasting error here and in terms of that business that's supposed to be so much more stable.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: I'll hit your last part first and then I'll have Randy. We had three key businesses in Water Quality. We have our aquatic and environmental systems, which is primarily the pool business. The pool business continues to be very strong and we continue to hit all of our forecasts relative to that business. Where the softness came in the quarter, which also relates to the way we're thinking about Q4 was in the foodservice business, which has been up, high single-digits throughout the year and had moderated back to flat in Q3. And then also we had the water purification business which also was strong most of the year and took a little bit of pause in Q3. So that's where the misses came, Steve.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Yeah. I'd just add, on the foodservice side, we've been growing at high teens rate in Asia, and while we're still growing there that took a step down to high single-digit growth rate, which was one change. And then we've seen some, I would call, variability in some of the deployments in some of the chains as restaurant growth has slowed down. So we expect those deployments to continue, or get positive again, as we launch a new range of products, which I referenced in my comments, but that won't happen in the quarter.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And Randy, in terms of how you're thinking about M&A. You early on talked about those businesses that have – I guess, have earned the right to capital deployment soon – shortly after Valves & Controls closes. Maybe a little more guidance on how you're thinking about bolt-on, just any kind of size range or just a little bit of sense for investors of what we might expect early next year?
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Well, we're going to be disciplined, I mean, we're getting out from under the overhang of a lot of the debt and we take our lessons from that, okay. But the place that we have the most opportunity. We are one of the leading players in water. We expanded that with the Tyco merger into the broader flow space and I think we want to get narrowly focused again in what I'll call the water side of the flow space. So, that's why I mentioned Water Quality. There are some that are sort of in between Water Quality and FFS, which is really, I mean, both of them together are our water business. And so, we want to continue to build that leading position and, so around water quality and availability. We like the food and beverage business, although we want to be careful about the heavy capital side of that versus things with annuity, which is why we like the membrane, the beer filtration, and also biogas, which is I think a nice growth business. So, it will be in areas that expand our reach and deepen our expertise in water – way to think about it.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran from Robert Baird. Your line is open.
Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird: Hey. Morning, guys.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Morning, Mike.
Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird: So, first on 2017 thought process, obviously, no meaningful improvement embedded in those numbers. Yet I got the sense from some of your commentary more specifically on the divisions that there was some expectation that fourth quarter doesn't represent the right run rate. So, maybe help kind of reconcile those two right there and then what areas should start getting maybe a slightly better in the next year and which ones you're more worried about?
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Let me start with Technical Solutions. We mentioned thermal. As the thermal business saw the decline in the energy business, we got aggressive in going after projects to replace the product. Those have proven to be more challenging from a profitability standpoint and those are coming to an end. And so, we'll immediately mix up, if you will, on the profit side. On the growth side, we expect more normalized. We're assuming in the fourth quarter this muted impact on the usual bump in sales we would see in industrial. We don't think – we're hopeful that after the fourth quarter, we'll return to a more normal level, which won't be the negative impact we see in the industrial market for the fourth quarter. John, if you want to add anything?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: No. I agree with that.
Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird: So, you're basically saying beyond that, though, it's a pretty steady run rate from the fourth quarter other than the maintenance side reverting back to normal?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yeah. If you take a look at the full year, core growth was down 1% for full year, that had a lot of choppiness in it. We started the year with almost double-digit declines in industrial. We've worked a way back to flattish numbers as we close out the year. So sequentially things have stabilized. What we're really saying is these larger projects that were out there for the Q4 cycle are going to be pushed or deferred into next year or may be deferred permanently. And we don't see me environment that's reflected in Q4 in the pause and concern of our overall customer base being the same cause of concern that we see as we enter 2017. Now, we said negative 2% to plus 2% next year so that's clearly not a robust growth environment, but it's flattish and then we have the operating income cost structure changes that we're driving as an organization to drive margin improvement.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: And I would add as – and that's the framework. We're planning on a minus 2% to plus 2% top line, which means to drive the performance that we know we can drive, we need to focus on simplifying. We're already working on simplifying the cost structure with the removal of Valves & Controls. We're going to do more than that, as a result of that outlook. If we get more upside, we will be in a position to serve (26:22) on the volume side.
Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird: Makes sense. And then, second one on the stranded cost side, maybe just an update there on how that's going? And then, just with the margin levers in the next year, some sort of thought process on how much is discretionary oriented versus something more permanent?
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Well, we're looking beyond just the stranded cost and we're looking at how do we simply the cost structure and, in a lean sense, how do we really take out waste and variability in the course of that simplification. I'm confident that we will get to a run rate at the beginning of the year that takes that overhang away or more.
Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird: Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Just follow on to Randy's point, real quickly. I mean, we had a focus to integrate and standardize a lot of the Valves & Controls activities, because that's where the biggest opportunities were for improvements. And so we repositioned a lot of our cost structure savings towards Valves & Controls. Now we're going to bring back the focus to reintegrating ourselves, if you will, to our Pentair standards on the rest of the portfolio, and we believe we can accelerate a lot of those cost-out actions in simplifying the company as Randy mentioned.
Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird: Thanks, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi, guys. Good morning. Hey, how do you get so – you got the 5% operating profit increase, I guess 15% EPS growth. Just remind us kind of how you bridge that, I'm not sure if you mentioned early in the call and if you did then I guess I'll take it offline, but just a little more of a precise bridge on how you get there?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yeah. We didn't, Steve, I mean, but I think the element we're now working to right now is we believe there is opportunity in the debt structure of the company. And we do think for relatively inexpensive investment, we can get a fair amount of interest out by putting our capital position or our debt position more in line with where we want it to be on a permanent basis. And there would clearly be significant interest savings associated with that, Steve.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. So that's a refi or that's, I mean, because your interest rate, I think your average interest rate is pretty low already, right, or is there...
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Right. We're carrying gross debt fairly high without taking out fixed debt structure and we think there's an opportunity to take out some of the fixed debt structure in a productive way and therefore it's incrementally better than what we had mentioned before. And we think we then have a capital and a debt structure that mirrors where we think we can be longer term as a growth oriented company.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: I got it. So it's a kind of combination of use of the proceeds effectively and then a little bit of a different structure in the underlying.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Correct.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: In what's leftover.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Correct, but no (29:07) buybacks or --
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: The 15% plus, think about it as one half on the capital side focused on debt, and one half on the performance side.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then in Technical, what's going on in the core enclosures business? And is that decline in the fourth quarter, is that all thermal related? Is that just a tough comp on thermal because it doesn't seem like the enclosures business would have that kind of a drop-off from flat given the short cycle nature.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: The profit impact is almost 80% thermal and usually in the enclosures business, that's the place where we would see a fourth quarter uptick and we're assuming we won't.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. So that's within enclosures, though, like the kind of short cycle CapEx, the box business, is that stable down in that negative 10%? What is that kind of trending?
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Bumping along the bottom...
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: It's stable, Steve, from Q3 sequential. The overall...
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. So, but down year-over-year, because you may have had a good fourth quarter last year, or something like that?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Slightly down year-over-year, but not 1% to 2% down.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. I think that's it. Thanks a lot, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Ronnie Weiss - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey, good morning, guys. It's Ronnie Weiss on for Julian.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Morning.
Ronnie Weiss - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Can you just talk a little bit about the pricing dynamics in each of the segments, still holding up decently well and how that kind of looks into 2017?
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: As you can see overall, pricing is – it's not moving a lot in either direction. We actually think with rates go up and inflation goes up a little bit, it'll give us some more pricing leverage. I mentioned in the script that in the thermal projects, that's been tougher on the project side. But we've seen the impact of that. Now, we're being more selective about going after them because we don't want to get low-profit projects anymore. Rather just get the products of it. So I'd say there's really no dramatic change in the pricing environment in any of the businesses.
Ronnie Weiss - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. And then kind of on the accelerated alignment of the cost structure going into 2017, can you frame some of those numbers? Is the 50 basis points all productivity, is that 2% benefit that you guys had in Q3, is that the right number to think about into 2017, or does it step back up as you maybe see some more opportunity?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yeah. I don't think we're ready to give our final number yet. I think the number that you mentioned, about 2% of sales, is certainly in the ballpark of where we're targeting as we head into next year. And obviously, being more selective at where we apply that cost out to where we think the economic conditions will not as robust as other places of the portfolio. But overall, you're in the ballpark.
Ronnie Weiss - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, good morning, guys.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Good morning.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Hey, Joe.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, so, I was trying to follow the answer to Steve's question earlier on the fourth quarter in Technical Solutions. You guys have that stepping down organically 10%, so what exactly is driving that in the fourth quarter?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: It's primarily all of our thermal business related to energy, MRO...
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: MRO.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: And energy projects.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: And a couple of points on enclosures.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. So, enclosures are going to be down, I think, low single-digits and thermal and the heat tracing business could be down more than double-digits in the fourth quarter?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yeah, keep in mind that that's a year-over-year comparison, so last year we had projects roll through. So it's a comparison against the projects. If you actually look at it sequentially from Q3 to Q4, it's just down slightly on the top line.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Okay. That makes sense. And then the second question is just around the ERICO business. I think you guys mentioned earlier that the annual run rate was about $507 million for this year. And then, I think the numbers that you gave us at the Analyst Day were closer like $530 million, $540 million. So what's happened in that business throughout the year and also maybe some commentary on recent trends there as well?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yeah. I don't know where the $507 million came from, we think it's $530 million for the year, slightly better than $530 million for the year. So...
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Got it. So, basically that business is flat right now?
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Slightly up.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Slightly up. Yeah.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Right in line with the plan.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. All right. Great. I'll get back in queue. Thank you.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi, good morning.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Good morning.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): I was hoping to get underneath some of the inflation numbers here. Where exactly are you guys seeing inflation emerge?
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Steel, starting to see some pickup in steel related pricing, as a material buy. We're also seeing some uptick in some of the commodity prices for mining related commodities, Scott.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): All right.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: We also have wage inflation, labor inflation.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Are there price increases set for the fourth quarter, given the steel situation or have they already occurred?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yeah, as Randy said, we have modest increase as planned and they have already or will already have been in place this early quarter.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): All right. And then I have one other more holistic question for you guys. This is the same portfolio as we kind of left off pre-Valves in 2012. And with of course the addition of ERICO, yet we seem to be talking a heck of a lot more about project business today than I really ever recalled in the older portfolio. What has happened to your businesses and the dynamics of the market where so much of your business now seems to be more project oriented? And if there's any way of quantifying how much of your businesses now project oriented now, versus what it was then, I guess sort of the last question within that would be, how does that affect your cost down plans for next year, project orientation makes that a little bit harder or otherwise?
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Yeah. Let me – there are – it's not wrong. We do have more products – as we move from products to solutions, they tend to be larger, more complex and we call those projects and then of course the thermal business. We saw the thermal business and about half of that is projects, a little bit more than that because of the MRO, the product sales has been impacted. So we expect that the solutions sales can still give us the same amount of margins. We need to get better at predicting when they're going to shift. We need to make sure that we're getting the same margins we're getting as we move the products to solutions and that's all underway. So strategically it's where we were going anyway because it's where customers want us to become. So there are projects in both Technical Solutions and in FSS.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yeah and the total would be roughly just under 8% of sales – would be our total project revenue for 2016.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: But a lot of the variability. That's why we need to get better at predicting.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Right.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): And would you say that is maybe double or more what it was pre-Valves & Controls?
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Probably, yes.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): All right and does that affect how you pull cost out next year?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: It doesn't because the way we look at it is most of that is variable spend, right. So we flex it up and flex it down and so we look at that and as we referenced cost out targets, it's those targets plus what needs to go away related to the project.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): I got you. All right, very good. Thanks a lot.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones from Stifel. Your line is open.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Morning, everyone.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Morning.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Hey, Nathan.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I'd just like to follow up, John, on the point you just made about increasing prices in the fourth quarter. Can you maybe give us an idea of historically how much of that pricing sticks and given that we're in a pretty weak demand environment at the moment, if you think that pricing increase will be more or less sticky than it historically has been?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: We think that the price increases that we put forward which are more modest price increases will all generally stick. There's only one area of our particular portfolio right now that's unusual versus prior trends and I'd call it the strengthening dollar, right. So...
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Right.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: We're in a situation where Europe and you heard it in Randy's commentary, Europe's doing relatively okay. So there are imports coming from Europe that are realizing lower cost basis. Now we have European business as well that we're benefiting from that. But overall, I think we put in a net price increase, modest less than 100 basis points for the total company, next year that we think we can realize.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. Next question, you talked about I think this call and last call about industrial order rates being at trough levels. But your guidance on that end market there has taken a step down this quarter. Can you reconcile those? Have the order rates taken a step down and now you think they're at trough levels and what gives you confidence that maybe there's not another step down to come from here?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yeah. Actually it's flat. I mean, the thing is in my 20 years or 30 years in industrial, I'd say 19 out of the 20, there's been an uptick in the fourth quarter and we're saying is that doesn't happen. So we're flat essentially in the third quarter and fourth quarter, and compared to last year, that's down a couple points.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: But what gives you confidence that that improves going into 2017? I mean, on a year-over-year basis, we've taken a fairly significant downtick in the fourth quarter, even if it's flat sequentially?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Well, ISM actually went positive in September, that's only one month. We'll see what it does in October. It's usually a precursor of recovery and...
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: But, Nathan, just to be clear, I think our framework, not guidance, but our framework for next year doesn't assume it does, and I think that's what we hope you took away. That, yes, we think Q4 is an anomaly, but if you take a look at the overall core growth for the company at negative 1% and moving to that general framework next year, I don't think we're counting on a big recovery next year. We think it's a slower economic growth environment and we're going to double down on the simplicity of the company, work on the debt restructuring and disciplined capital allocation to drive the value.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's fair. Thanks very much.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Hope we're wrong, but I don't...
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hopefully not wrong in the wrong direction. Hopefully wrong in the right direction.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: There you go. There you go.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Walsh from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.
John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Hi, good morning.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Morning.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Morning.
John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC: I didn't see it on the slide, but just wanted to talk about free cash flow conversion to the adjusted net income for the next year and what some of the levers are you have to pull to keep the conversion rate really strong, whether it's CapEx or working capital or any other items to be aware of on the cash side.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: We think on a go-forward basis, we're still targeting to achieve greater than 100%. While we've lost some of the working capital opportunity in Valves & Controls, we still have plenty of working capital opportunity in FFS, and we also believe we have a less severance environment, right. So, our cash flow captures our severance outflows as well, and there were a fair amount of those in the Valves & Controls business that as we move away from Valves & Controls no longer are headwinds to the company. So we still think 100% or greater than 100% of net income is our targeted cash flow conversion.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Which is what we did before the Tyco merger on a regular basis, so...
John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Yeah. And then just wondering if you can give us an update on the valuations that you're seeing out there on the deal front, kind of seller and buyer expectations are getting tighter and if it's kind of still a – I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it seemed like it was kind of evenly split between preference for share repo and M&A when you did the Valves & Controls call?
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Yeah, when we did that, we said we're going to have this firepower. We are about shareholder value and we will as a board look at the opportunities of how we deploy that. Our bias is to grow the business and grow the company, but we're not going to do it with non-strategic acquisitions. So if we can't find them at the right price, and it's hard to generalize as to pricing, but there's a lot of people looking at deals, so usually that causes prices to go up. But we have been disciplined, and we will continue to be disciplined as we look at it. And we're not rushing to put the capital to work. We want it to be informed by a good strategy, and the board is totally aligned on that.
John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC: All right. Thank you.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, guys. Just another one on M&A. I think, Randy, your comments were much more focused on Water ,and I think you've talked in the past about both Tech Solutions and Water having the right to grow, so kind of what informs that bias? Is it what's available out there or how you're thinking about the businesses strategically or the end markets? Maybe just a little more color there.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Well, Technical Solutions has to get back to earning again. I'm not happy with the forecast that we got on the thermal side. So we want to support high execution. So there are opportunities in Technical Solutions. It's a great business. I mean, as I mentioned in the script, we have great positions in the electrical industry and there are ways to build upon those, but we need to get the cost structure in that business right. We need to get the execution back to where I know it can be, and then I'll let them come up to the front of the line again.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then, John, just back on the debt restructuring. So this ability to restructure some of the debt -- that is built into the guide? Is that the right way to think about it?
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: The framework.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yes. We haven't given guidance yet.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Into the framework, yes. Okay. So you're putting that in and are you paying down more – within that framework, are you paying down more debt or you're just getting a more favorable rate based on a restructuring?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: We will be paying down more debt. I don't what yet, we're still exploring it, but given our original views, we quickly after the Valves & Controls hadn't had time to look at it.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Right.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: We're now looking at it and we're seeing that for a very good return, we can invest a little bit of money and get a longer term savings. So we're looking at exploring those options and when we give our guidance, we'll be able to fully share that. But right now we're anticipating it's better than we previously said.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, guys.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Pokrzywinski from Buckingham Research Group. Your line is open.
Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hi, good morning, guys.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Hey, Josh.
Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Yeah. Just to follow up on I think Steve's earlier question on ERICO. I guess I'm still struggling a little bit with the plug there. I'm looking at the slides from when you guys initially did the deal, $570 million in 2015, $595 million in 2016 forecasted revenue. And it still seems like even with some margin error or maybe some reporting differences, we're still talking about a number in the low $500 million range, whether it's $507 million or $530 million. What am I missing in that bridge?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yeah. So, thanks for bringing it up. Those original numbers were gross sales.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Gross sales.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: They're not net sales. And on a net sales basis, we're closer to the $530 million this year and that is roughly a 1 to 2 percentage point growth over where it was on a full year basis last year. It is made up of – roughly half of that is CADDY, which is a commercially exposed business, and then half of it is more related to infrastructure and also rail and utilities. So the big difference in those original slides to what we published later was gross to net deductions.
Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Got you. And the just to circle back on Flow & Filtration, clearly you guys have a lot of initiatives going on there all at once and the market certainly not helping you out, but what should we expect to see first when you're starting to get traction there? Is it organic growth stabilizing, is it margin improvement, is it a little bit of everything? Because I think you guys have been focused on this for at least the last year and clearly at a high level things are still probably disappointing to you, but I'm trying to figure out what would be the green shoots from your perspective that you'd want people to look at and say, hey, we're starting to get some traction here?
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Yeah. I would say margins and, Josh, go back two or three years, we were making some good – FFS was, if you will, in the legacy venture side, it was the lowest performing margins and our goal was to get it to 15% or more. I still think we can get them there and we get close at some point. And so you'll see it in our margins first and then growth. So right now we actually have, as I said, some of our innovations like biogas and membrane filtration of beer, even though general the food and beverage industry isn't growing, these applications are and we're doing well in them. So we are getting good progress in a number of growth areas, it's just not enough to offset some of the areas that aren't growing. So margins first, growth second.
Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: To be fair, though, Randy, the 15% target, that was inclusive of AMR (47:10), right, the way you guys used to report it, or is that wrong?
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: I'd say, yeah. In addition though (47:18)
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: The margins in Flow & Filtration should approach what they are in Water Quality. I mean these are some high technical specs. I mean, I don't think we'll get our core pump business that high, but the filtration side of this business and the technology side of the business has a lot more potential than 15%.
Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Got you. All right. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Barry from Susquehanna. Your line is open.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Hey, guys, good morning.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Good morning.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: So the talk about the large beverage projects being pushed out, is that beer and is that related to M&A or just maybe a little more color on what's happening there?
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: It's basically the valving in all beverage, it's dairy, it's beer, but the biggest ones for us in beer.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yes, and there is a capital pause happening, as you mentioned, that's driving some of that delay.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Related to M&A activity, I know you've talked about that before.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Yes.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: And so when you talk about the beverage projects, should we think about that bucket of revenue, is that about $350 million of sales that's kind of...
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: No.
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: $250-ish million.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Yes.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: $250 million. Got you. Okay. And maybe just to put a finer point on some of the earlier questions about the framework for next year. I mean what should we plug in our models for 2017 for interest expense and corporate?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: Not there yet. We have to get through and figure out where we end and then we'll give guidance at the appropriate time. We just wanted to provide the framework so that people can understand how we're thinking about it.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: I mean the corporate sounded like maybe it would go back to the 90 (48:47) that it was the pre the V&C sale or maybe even a little lower. Is that kind of ballpark?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: I think that would be the low end of the range.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Got you. And then maybe just finally in Tech Solutions, you talked about some of the productivity issues with the big projects. I mean in the quarter and maybe year-to-date how much of a drag on the margin has the thermal project productivity issue been?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: 300 basis points.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay. So when we're looking year-over-year, that's like a 3 point headwind that's just going away?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: That's correct.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: For the segment?
John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc: That's correct.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Got you. Okay. Thank you.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters.
Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc: Thank you very much. And I'm sure it will be on replay. Thank you. Bye.

Randall Hogan: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I’m starting on page 4. We are pleased with our second quarter results which came in at the high end of our expectations. The top line was consistent with our forecast and income and margins were slightly better than our expectations driven by strong execution and continued benefit from our cost-out actions. Integration of ERICO is meeting our expectations, we remain on track to meet or exceed the $10 million in synergies we targeted. Free cash flow was once again a positive story and we’re very pleased with our performance here. For the first half of the year we’ve generated $304 million in free cash which is over a $150 million better than what we delivered in the first half of last year. We’re updating our full year adjusted EPS outlook to a range of $4.05 to $4.20 which is bringing a nickel off the top end of the range. Valves & Controls have started to become more predictable, we’re seeing the negative impact of sales mix in both Flow & Filtration Solutions and Technical Solutions. Now I’ll turn to slide 5 for discussion of our Q2 2016 results. Second quarter core sales declined 1% which is slightly better than our previously communicated expectations. Water Quality Systems delivered solid growth once again against the tough comparison, our Flow & Filtration Solutions felt the impact of continued difficult agriculture markets. The declined Valves & Controls sales moderated and Technical Solutions was flat compared to our expectation with a slight decline in the quarter. ERICO contributed positively with sales in-line with our expectations. Segment increased 7% and return on sales expanded 30 basis points to 16.8%. Water quality systems saw 200 basis point expansion and Valves & Controls slightly beated second quarter income and margin commitments which were big steps up from the first quarter. Adjusted EPS grew 3% to $1.11 per share and was at the high end of our guidance of a dollar rate to an $11. As I mentioned previously free cash flow was very strong in the quarter. Now let’s turn to slide 6 for more detail on Pentair’s Q2. Our sales performance was mix by vertical with strong growth in residential and commercial and infrastructure. We saw signs of stabilization industrial with a rate of decline continue to moderate and energy did not get worse. Food & Beverage was down in the quarter due to ongoing declines in agriculture who we believe our beverage business remains healthy. Our largest vertical residential and commercial saw 2% sales growth with strength in residential and water quality systems and ongoing strength in commercial in both Flow & Filtration Solutions and technical Solutions. Well, ERICO’s performance is not captured in core results yet, we would point out that commercial markets remain solid for it too. Infrastructure was positive once again led by continued growth in both North American Municipal Pumps and improved project activity in Process Filtration globally. We’ve been looking for Flow & Filtration Solutions to see infrastructure growth this year which has played out as expected and we’re encouraged that biding activity remains healthy as well. The rate of decline within Industrial moderated further and we believe that this our largest vertical appears to have found a bottom. There we’re not looking for a second half rebound comparisons even in the second half and should reported results. Food & Beverage declined for the second consecutive quarter as Flow and Filtration Solutions continued to feel the impact of agriculture the decline to the double digit rate for us. Energy declined at a low double digit rate for the second consecutive quarter, but we expect energy sales to find a bottom in the second half based on the bottoming and sequential orders we’ve experienced. As you can see on the right hand side of the page, productivity remains strong and more than offset inflation. ERICO contributed strength to the bottom line and strong underlying performance in synergies. Now let’s turn to slide 7 for a look at water quality systems performance in Q2. Water quality systems delivered another strong quarter with 3% core sales growth. Although growth rate declined sequentially with the tough comparison as the second quarter last reflected slightly different timing in the North American cool season then what we’re experiencing this year. Although timing is different, we believe the North American cool season remains very healthy. Water filtration grew sales 1% as both our residential filtration business and our food service business faced tough comps. Segment income grew an impressive 11% and return on sales expanded 200 basis points to 24.7%. Robust operating leverage was the key contributor to margin expansion in the quarter. Timing of growth investments may mute the rate of margin expansion in the second half but we anticipate the prospects remain strong for water quality systems. Now let’s move to slide 8 for a look at Flow & Filtration Solutions. Flow & Filtration saw core sales decline 1%. We had anticipated the segment to return to growth in the second quarter and rather infrastructure growth came through as expected, but food and beverage performance was negatively impacted by very challenging agriculture sales. Water Technologies core sales declined 3% at strength in residential and commercial and infrastructure pump shipments were more than offset by double digit declines in irrigation pump shipments. This is very similar to what we saw last quarter in this business. We expect both the residential and commercial and infrastructure businesses to see continued growth, irrigation headwinds will likely persist, this comparisons remain challenging given the drought conditions in the west that helped our sales last year. Core sales in Fluid Solutions declined 3%, well beverage returned to growth in the quarter and experienced strong orders growth as well. The precision spray presence was negatively impacted by the beleaguered agriculture markets. Process filtrations up core sales growth of 10% as we continue to see momentum build from our focus on industrial water reuse solution and return to growth in infrastructure with some desalination investments. This business has some lumpiness given the timing of projects that we believe we continue to gain momentum from our focus on industrial water reuse. Segment income and return on sales contracted modestly this negative mix weight on the segments results. We believe this is just a pause in the margin improvement journey in the Flow & Filtration Solutions and there is still a long runway ahead for further margin growth. Now let’s turn to slide 9 to discuss our Technical Solutions performed in the second quarter. Technical Solutions reported 32% sales growth for the quarter consisting a flat core sales growth and 1% headwind from FX and a 34% positive contribution from ERICO. Core sales in Enclosures declined 5% or encouraged by the stabilization in the daily order rate which reinforces our view to easier comparisons in the back half of the year. Thermal Management delivered core sales growth of 7% helped in part by two projects in Canada that we previously discussed that are reaching completion. We’ve talked this year about our Industrial Heat Tracing business continuing to win small projects and unfortunately we’re seeing no sign of downstream MRO spending growth return yet. All the results of ERICO are captured as acquisition contribution, the business performed in-line with our expectations. As a reminder over 75% of ERICO’s sales are into commercial end markets which remained very healthy in the quarter. We remain on track to deliver over $10 million in synergies for the year on top of the base business profitability which is performing as expected. Segment income grew 30%, the return on sales contracted 60 basis to 20.6%. The margin contraction was isolated to our Thermal Management business as the growth we mentioned in projects versus higher margin MRO product sales negatively impacted mix. ERICO has performed as we had anticipated, Enclosures are seeing signs of stabilization. The performance of these two SPGs was not enough in the quarter to offset the impact of the negative mix experienced in Thermal Management on the ROS. We’re not expecting downstream MRO spending to rebound in the second and we expect this will undoubtedly have an impact on third quarter margins for Technical Solutions. So with ERICO and Enclosures performing as expected Technical Solutions remain well positioned long term. Now let’s move to slide 10 to discuss the Valves & Controls performance in Q2. For the second consecutive quarter Valves & Controls met or beat its forecast for both sales and margins. Even more the heavy lifting we’ve done to right size the cost structure of the business read out in the nice gain and margin sequentially. And orders appear to have stabilized. Valves & Controls reported a 13% decline in revenue with core sales down 11% and a 2% headwind from FX. Backlog was down 7% sequentially, which includes negative FX translation. Core orders were down 27% year-over-year against the tough comparison, but as stated we did see a flattening of orders sequentially. Core sales were down 6% in aftermarket and down 17% in projects. In line with our expectation, the aftermarket business remained weak as OpEx continue to be constrained along with CapEx at many customers. We believe the order funnel overall is beginning to strengthen, which reinforces our view that orders will bottom in the second quarter and will begin to expand near double digit rates sequentially starting in the third quarter. The right half of the page shows second quarter segment income and return on sales, which both met our forecast. Return on sales of 10.1% was slightly ahead of our forecast and up significantly from the first quarter as our cost-out benefit registered in line with our previously communicated expectations. The Valves & Controls team has done a courageous job in realigning the business to reflect the significant energy industry reset. It executed in the cost side while aligning the business with the opportunities exists today and over the next several years. We continue to believe that Valves & Controls is well positioned for an eventual recovery in its end markets beginning in 2017 and will continue to enjoy rising margins sequentially even before that. Now, let's move to slide 11 for look at Valves & Controls backlog. Much of the backlog decline we saw has come as a result of progress we're making in reducing our past dues. Last year we booked roughly 100 million in orders from projects greater than $5 million. However, we have not booked even one order greater than $5 million during the first half of 2016. Yet orders of bottoming out sequentially and as our customers sort out the spending plans, we expect to see a return of some larger projects. So we believe that the second quarter marks the bottom for orders and we're expecting orders to improve in the second half of the year from the depressed first half levels. For the past three quarters, the business has improved its forecasting capabilities and with aftermarket orders now approximating 55% of orders that should improve the margin mix. We're encouraged with Valves & Controls meeting or beating its forecast on sales, orders and income for the second consecutive quarter. There has been tremendous progress made on right sizing the cost structure of the business and better alignment between sales and operations has improved forecasting and execution ability of the segment. We believe the order funnel will continue to strengthen and while the top line will not show it right away orders bottoming and margins improving show brighter days ahead. With that, I will turn the call over to John.
John Stauch: Thank you Andy, please turn to Slide number 12, titled balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the second quarter with $4.6 billion of net debt inclusive of cash on hand. This was an improvement from where we ended the year as we used our strong cash flows in the quarter to reduce our debt levels. As Randy mentioned earlier, free cash flow increased over 150 million during the first half of the year versus the comparable period last year. We continue to expect to deliver free cash flow greater than adjusted net income for the full-year. Our ROIC ended the quarter at 9.6%. Our forecast for capital expenditures remains a 150 million as continue to invest in businesses that have earned the right to grow and drive standardization and productivity across the enterprise. We remain focused on generating strong cash flow and further debt reduction. Please turn to Slide 13, labeled Q3, 2016 Pentair outlook. For the third quarter, we expect core sales be flat and total sales to increase 7% inclusive of FX head wins and a positive contribution from ERICO. As a reminder, we closed on the purchase of ERICO just before the end of Q3 last year. And starting in Q4, ERICO will be included in the core. On a core basis, we expect water quality systems to grow approximately 8%, while flow & filtration solutions is expected to see core sales decline approximately 1%. Technical solutions is expected to be flat on a core basis and valves & controls is anticipated to see core sales decline 6%. We expect segment income to increase approximately 11% and return on sales to expand roughly 60 basis points to 16.7%. Below the operating line, we continue to expect the tax rate to remain around 20.5%, net interest in other to approximate $35 million and shares outstanding to be around a 183 million. We expect free cash flow to continue to be strong during the quarter. Please turn to Slide 14, labeled full year 2016 Pentair outlook. As Randy at the beginning of the call, we have taken a nickel off of the top end of our range and our full year adjusted EPS outlook is now $4.05 to $4.20. For the full year, we expect core sales decline 1%, water quality systems full year core sales are anticipated to be up approximately 6%, which is slightly better than our prior forecast. We now expect flow & filtration solutions to see a core sales decline of 1% versus our prior forecast of modest growth for the full year. Technical solutions core sales expected to be flat for the full year, which is slightly better than our prior forecast. Finally, valves & controls expected to see core sales decline of approximately 9%. We expect segment income to grow roughly 8% and return on sales to expand approximately 70 basis points to 16.3%. our revised forecast factors in slightly better operating performance from water quality systems and valves & controls, or technical solutions and flow & filtration solutions are expected to see margins impacted by negative mix related to unfavorable market conditions. We anticipate full year corporate cost to be just under 90 million, net interest in other are roughly a 140 million and the share count to be roughly a 183 million. Adjusted EPS is expected to grow approximately 5% at the mid-point of the range. Finally, we remain on track to generate free cash flow in excess of adjusted net income for the full year. Emily, can you please open the line for questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan from UBS. Your line is open.
Shannon O'Callaghan: Good morning, guys.
Randall Hogan: Good morning, Shannon.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Shannon O'Callaghan: So, I guess maybe just start with current assessment of strategic views on valves & controls and given news items and also does the fact that executing so much better impact your view of set. How do you think about that currently?
Randall Hogan: Well, I'm not going to comment about speculation, if we have anything to say, we would have said it. But I'm really pleased with the progress. There is a lot of doubters, there is doubters in a lot of places about how well our actions would read out. And I think this was a proved quarter. And to go from the margins we had in the first quarter, the second quarter, and see the bottoming of orders, I'd say valves is a like has a like clear future today than it had in the first quarter.
John Stauch: Yes, and I would add. This is a great business in the difficult market condition and 2014, we're nearly 17% margins and roughly 400 million in segment income. And what we feel like is a trough year, we're still going to be 11.5% ROS. We're slugging through it, I mean, obviously seeing some sequentially bottom of the orders is a good sign and seeing the order funnels start to become a more robust time in Q3 and Q4 give us excitement that we can feel like we can start contributing more and more as we go forward in valves & controls.
Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay. And then, maybe just within valves & controls but even technical and more broadly some things you're saying are bottoming. You talked about I think within valve's essential double-digit order increased sequentially in 3Q. But then there is other things like downstream you said you assume, you're not expecting any recovery. I guess, where do you expect sequential recovery and where do you think market is still going to remain depressed?
Randall Hogan: This is just a weird time. I mean, there's such a mix geographically and between verticals in terms of the growing and not growing and I think that reflects the greater uncertainly in the world. We feel really good about industrial and commercial, we feel like infrastructure is coming back with some momentum, as I mention the orders not only a sales op but orders act, order activity has remained up. And while the agriculture continued muted spending in agriculture, mutes our Food & Beverage like. We feel really good about food service a beverage overall. So, we think a lot about what individuals are spending money on, is good, residential, commercial, food and beverage and even in industrial. The fact that we're getting to the point where we're seeing flattened daily order rates and industrial tells us that we're, that's why we are seeing the bottom there. We just don’t expect it to increase a lot in the second half yet.
Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay, great. Thanks guys.
Randall Hogan: Thanks, Shannon.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray from RBC. Your line is open.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Randall Hogan: Good morning.
Deane Dray: Hey Randy, I was hoping you could expand on a comment you made in your opening remarks regarding that negative sales mix. I think you addressed it pretty clearly, you're on the Valves & Controls business. But I'd be interested in hearing where else you're seeing a negative mix as it relates to customers in this environment instead of buying such and such, they're opting for either a cheaper replacement. But how does it translate into your customer behavior into a negative mix this quarter?
Randall Hogan: Yes. Thanks Deane for asking that, so I can clarify. It's not the mix, the mix we're seeing is not mix between a customer saying buying a lower margin, lower performing product for the same application. It's specifically in flow and filtration, our Ag business has higher margins than our residential and commercial business. And so when Ag goes down and residential goes up, we get a negative mix. So, it isn’t product substitution in application, it's just a mix of what's growing and what isn’t. And in the Thermal business and technical solutions, again products MRO has high margins, project doesn't. So, we actually expected MRO to come back, maybe that was Pollyannaish, probably was but it didn’t, and therefore all the projects that we were happy about winning kind of overwhelmed margins for Thermal.
Deane Dray: And just to clarify, when you say in your reference Ag, this is irrigation pumps that you primarily exposed?
Randall Hogan: There is two pieces in there, both in inflow and filtration that we're talking about that have seen big negatives. One is irrigation and year-over-year it held up pretty well last year because we have pretty high share where there were droughts and then was a lot of activity drilling new wells because of the drought. We don’t have that impact this year. And the second is in crop spray, where we had we've actually been listening to the graveyard a little bit because we've been not declining the shaft as the market, and this is largely OEMs and distribution where we sell these precision spray systems that are used in agriculture as well. And that market remains depressed.
Deane Dray: Thank you. And then on as unrelated topic. We had the opportunity last month to see Pentair as attractive new business in China for residential water treatment. So, this is a brand new market for us to see. And estimates reported like 20% to 30% growth annually and you all have being recognized as one of the leaders in this business, are basically mini RO systems for home appliances that are being bought by the rising middle class who just can't drink the water without boiling it. So, I haven’t seen you talk about this opportunity before but we saw everyone's talking about it. Maybe you can talk about what the opportunity is, how it fits, what the ramp is and what kind of contribution you should expect?
Randall Hogan: Yes. I probably should talk about it more, stop fighting fires. What's really interesting is there is much more awareness about the importance of safe clean water among the middle class and the developing world than there is in the US and Europe. Now, for sad reasons, there is increasing awareness in the US. We say a bump in the US because of the concern about drinking water in cities and schools and we could see that in our orders. And we are the largest provider of equipment for residential water treatment and filtration in the world. That business has been growing nicely. The little bit in China, we do have a nice exposure there, it has been lumpy because a lot of ours goes through distribution and it's been as credit has been harder to get there. Some of our distributors have had to slow down. But if you take a look at it over the last few years, it has been growing very substantially. And I move that business to Karl Frykman and his WQS team a couple of years ago because we were the largest player in that business but we weren’t the best performing in that business. And we made huge progress under Karl's leadership in taking that order, filtration, that part. It did water filtration, water filtration is made up of that residential and commercial and the foodservice piece, the Everpure brand, if you will. And a lot of the margin expansion you saw in WQS is actually because of the momentum we're gaining there. And we'll talk more about it.
Deane Dray: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Steve Winoker from Bernstein. Your line is open.
Steven Winoker: Thanks and good morning folks.
Randall Hogan: Good morning.
Steven Winoker: And can maybe talk a little bit through the progress Bess is making in flow & filtration and kind of I mean it's still early days in many ways. But just talk about where you are in that task and how the quarter as you sort of look forward where you think this could head at least to over the next four quarters?
Randall Hogan: Yes. I think Bess' progress is good. I mean, no one was more disciplined, it was not getting growth in the second quarter than she will. And I think we need to get more traction and she believes we need to get more traction on the things we're investing in the grow. We shouldn’t be surprised by what happened in irrigation. We need to be more intimate and close with the customer. And we need to keep driving on the areas that are working, like the shift to industrial water and capture as much of the infrastructure and rest as soon as possible. We still believe that there is probably more growth opportunities in the offerings that she leads and the markets that she served and any other business we have. There's no reason FFS shouldn’t be able grow and perform just like WQS.
Steven Winoker: And what are the biggest ones that jump out of you in that, beside sort of the in Chinese water, when we all saw over the last year?
Randall Hogan: Yes. Well, I mean, the infrastructure globally, there's a return to investments particularly in the [indiscernible] Moses and other water filtration on the municipal and the commercial scale. We have leading positions in advanced technologies for water we use, methane capture, CO2 capture for food & beverage and we're having promising early results, we need to flood this own and get more advanced in those businesses. And also, just in terms of our membrane technology. I think there is too narrow of focus of where we're applying our technologies and we need to be planful about it but the opportunities for us to be if you well Pentair inside, on membranes in a lot of applications which we are component supplier to high value applications.
Steven Winoker: Okay and Randy if I could just come back at that Valves & Controls answer you gave earlier, I guess something come out little bit differently which is considering how you are thinking about Valves & Controls from kind of day one in terms of strategic fit with the rest of the portfolio and the opportunity, I mean to what extend is for getting price and everything else here, to what extend is the strategic fit of that segment important to how Pentair grows going forward in your mind and then the importance to the other segments or from some other perspective that would suggest that it's really still going to be worth more to you than somebody else.
Randall Hogan: Well, I see a good runway ahead for performance improvement there and what are we good at. We are good at performance improvement. So I think we have really turned the corner in the business. I am not going to strategy right here but it gives us great scale and it has great scale. I mean it's a large player in a large fragmented business and we speculated before on what needs to happen in industry we are not going to speculate anymore right now.
Steven Winoker: Alright, that's helpful. I got it. Thanks very much. I will pass it on.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Steve Tusa: Hi guys.
Randall Hogan: Hi Steve.
Steve Tusa: Thanks for the color on Chinese water business, I appreciate that. The tech product segment, the margins were cut there and you talked about mix is there any how do you look kind of price cost dynamics there and how much deal do you guys buy on an annual basis?
Randall Hogan: How many deals we buy in? A lot, I mean there is couple hundred million dollars Steve but I think we take a look at the technical solutions margins. It's really simply that there was expectation that we would see the MRO in the aftermarket product side which is a very, very high margin product line kind of basically not gravity and it was going to where they were planning on to be flat to up and it's down double-digits in Q2 and so we are seeing a margin squeeze between that products fall off and it was an expectation that that would rally in the second half and we have taken away that expectation to second half now and the anticipation that we are not going to see any recovery in the aftermarket side. We deferred that aftermarket. We covered it to 2017 and so that product decline of double-digit is really impacting the squeeze in the margins for technical solutions.
Steve Tusa: Okay. Got it. It's ritually the thermal stuff, I mean what are you seeing in the chain in technical I mean Wesco reported today pretty weak volume number and all these distributors and Rockwell talked about push outs in their business. So what are you seeing in the - you talked about the stabilization but -for Enclosures, for the core Enclosures business?
Randall Hogan: Yes, for the core Enclosures we did see, we have seen stabilization in our daily order rate and it's interesting there is quite a mix of what we are learning from what distributors are saying and clearly ones that are deeply industrial facing are facing more challenges than one more balanced are skewed towards commercial and we do serve multiple market. So maybe that's why we are seeing the flat.
Steve Tusa: Okay and then one last question just on Valves, does the order I know like things bottom sequentially but I mean historically I think seasonally Q2 kind of an average single business in the world is better than first quarter so not sure what that tells us I think you said double-digit increase sequentially in the third quarter, something that the order comp year-to-date probably? Sorry.
Randall Hogan: Double digit.
Steve Tusa: Yes, double-digit. Okay. So that kind of brings the year-to-date probably year-over-year to down still down double-digit does that change the complexion of how you are feeling about 2017 or does this sequence to the sequential dynamics now kind of like really make feel maybe little worse in 2Q but better in 3Q make you feel like you are still on track for that kind of flat EBITD type of hope for 2Q for 2017.
John Stauch: Yes Steve, I think what we feel is that we have got a fairly high past two backlogs that we are still working on from standpoint of on time delivery roughly 70% not great by any standard I mean not horrible in the industry but not great by Pentair standard. So we are working at past two backlogs that's helping revenue. When you take a look at the orders and what Randy mentioned not getting any large orders it means that our conversion ratio is going to be higher. So we feel like as we head into 2017 even ending the year with lower orders in 2016, we think our conversion ratio is going to get back to historical norms which is around 51% of orders that are booked in the year and shipped in that year. That trough last year around 43% so I think we feel like we are starting to get that mix up as we mentioned with more aftermarket standard and so we feel like right now 2017 is an up year versus 2016 for me from the income side for sure. And orders will continue to rally in 2017 from this point the way we are looking at.
Randall Hogan: Exactly and the other thing I would add is that we have really fixed funnel, we are looking at has been cleansed, high quality.
Steve Tusa: Pretty attractive for any buyer out there. Thanks a lot guys.
Randall Hogan: Thank you, Steve.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Joe Ritchie: Hi, thanks. Good morning guys. I am going to ask Steve's questions slightly differently. And so, if you look at your expectation for double-digit sequential order growth that would imply that your orders for the second half of the year were down call it like roughly mid single-digits. Comps would kind of get you to down mid tens and so there is underlying improvement embedded in that number and I am just wondering like did the things get much better, is the quarter progress and what’s given you the confidence in the underlying improvement in the order number in the second half of the year?
John Stauch: Yes, I hit on this in Analyst Day last year and then we have had several sessions with the business since. But we have a fairly sizable project contribution as we worked our way through the 2014 and 2015 timeframe and as Randy mentioned not having a single order greater than $5 million over the last several quarters means that we have got a rich backlog or rich funnel of shorter cycle orders, higher margins. So I think where we are is that we do believe we are going to start to see some projects and we are working on those on the funnel and those will be contribution but if you look at the order rates and the order levels absence of those large project orders is actually a pretty good contribution and so when you think about that as a base and that base moving fairly stable, any orders on top of that gives you great excitement that we are going to start to see a ramp from here.
Joe Ritchie: Got it. Okay but is there like any specific end markets that are driving these improvements?
John Stauch: Yes, we are starting to see the downstream investment again. The OpEx has been turned off for some period of time. We are starting to see a fair amount of aftermarket consolidation. So our customer spending with the scale providers which gives us great excitement of being the largest valves supplier in our space that we are going to see a lot more aftermarket consolidation and that's a big growth opportunity for us. And then, we also are back in the game in the Middle East and we are starting to see order contribute to the Middle East where we have been out of that game for some time.
Joe Ritchie: Okay, alright. Maybe one follow-up and it looks done a really nice job on the tech solution side, I guess the question I have is you saw a little bit margin degradation this quarter on flat growth. Your expectation for the back half of the year is for growth to be down from margins to flatten and actually improve versus 2Q and so maybe just kind of talk through some of the puts and takes there on the tech solutions margin from the second half?
John Stauch: Yes, we are finishing a job in Q2 that was a six bit job in thermal and we had some overrun on the labor side on that project. So that job is ending early Q3 and so with that behind us we are back to more of a normal project margins and normal product margins so it was one large job that we worked through last year and we have the final labor runs going through Q2 and early Q3 and then it's behind us.
Joe Ritchie: And what was that impact John?
John Stauch: It was a project order and it was fixed hourly or fixed fee and we over ran the labor to install it and complete the job. And so it ended in Q2 and Q3 so it's finishing up here in July and then we are going to see those orders or see that margin get better from here.
Joe Ritchie: Okay I have a follow-up on impact later. Thank you guys. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran from Robert Baird. Your line is open.
Mike Halloran: Hey good morning everyone. So, a couple full filtration questions. First on the water reuse side obviously you got some lumpiness in your process filtration piece in general. Maybe you could just talk about in the underlying momentum there what the core trends from the industry look like and then how your positioning is and how are you doing on a relative basis?
John Stauch: Just the process filtration piece?
Mike Halloran: Yes, and I have a second one on the hag side.
Randall Hogan: Yes, I think that we have a lot of capability and we have not fully achieved ignition in the marketplace. Infrastructure we have pretty good reach globally to basically the components that go in the large projects and we do pretty well there. Our hit rate when we compete for industrial is pretty good. We need to get more FX on that. And similarly I think that there is a vast opportunity for us to sell membrane bundles and not just modules and systems. So I think we are early days in terms of all the growth opportunities of the process filtration have.
Mike Halloran: And then, on the hag side obviously some challenging comps year-over-year some challenging trend industry wise, talk about the sequential trends are you seeing any signs of stability in industry relative to what a normal sequential would look and what’s the thought process going forward?
Randall Hogan: You are talking about full filtration in total? Well, given the lack of good predictability that we have going in the second quarter I will be less confident in answering we expect to see some improvements in crops rate coming and but irrigation I think is going to be we are - this is irrigation season. So the fact that it wasn't up now it means it won’t be up in the third quarter. It tracks pretty closely with farm income unless you have an issue like we have with the drought.
Mike Halloran: Right but I guess I am more asking stability emerging at on that side for you guys with all the headwinds there or do you think that there is still more swing ahead?
Randall Hogan: Not worsening, not bettering no. I would say. 
Mike Halloran: Great. Thanks guys. 
Randall Hogan: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Nigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning gents. Hey so $20 million of steel purchases you called out is that just for TSO, was that Pentair wide?
Randall Hogan: Pentair wide
Nigel Coe: Okay that's what I thought. I just wanted to clarify on that point. So on BNC margins can you maybe just help just to from 2Q to 15% do we still have a FIFO tailwinds into the second half-of-the-year or is the gap between low doubles to mid tens is that primarily cost saves at this point?
Randall Hogan: This is small little tailwind from the variances associated with last year productivity working its way through Q1 and Q2 but most of it is the momentum of the incremental cost saves on the operational side and also some momentum around material savings working its way through the shipments.
Nigel Coe: Okay and I guess the fact is that there is no price and degradation in the margin bridge, its board line shocking I think we were all expecting that to be price and headwind this year is that because the price in the markets is, we just haven't seen price cuts because the end market conditions are so awful? Or is it just primarily a function of Pentair walking away from low price projects maybe a bit of a mix issue as well. Maybe any kind of color on pricing would be helpful?
John Stauch: Yes Nigel, just to be clear and thank you for asking the question our price that shows up in the Valves & Controls chart is a like product to like product. Sub-standard product and it's an aftermarket usually and it's a like for like. We are seeing as we have talked about over the last several quarters the project margin headwind that works its way into the growth and the FX bar on the right as far as segment income so we are seeing that project mix and project pricing work its way through that and that is stabilized but it's still on the year-over-year basis pretty large as you can see there.
Nigel Coe: Okay and then quick clarification FFS, the three point delta the true down on the full year, is that a little -- issues or is there something there?
John Stauch: That's pretty much just the hag issues.
Nigel Coe: Okay, great that's good. Thanks a lot.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones from Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Your line is open.
Nathan Jones: Good morning everyone.
Randall Hogan: Morning Nathan.
Nathan Jones: Just a follow-up on Nigel’s question there we have heard company talking about demand is so lousy and some of those oil and gas kind of markets that there is no point in telling price. Would you expect that there could be any increased pricing competition as orders do rebound as spokes to compete for that volume?
Randall Hogan: Yes, I mean I don't know if it gets worse from here, Nathan but I don't think we are planning on getting too much better from here on those projects. I think I personally believe that a lot of that reset in pricing was the foreign exchange resets since a lot of these valve producers are outside United States and the euro going down major products more affordable and I think the big EPC is taking advantage of that and so I think it's stabilizing now as most people have taken up the capacity but I don't think it's going to recover to the levels that it used to be at either.
Nathan Jones: So you wouldn't expect to say in the back half of the yea order rates improve any additional pricing pressure as people compete for that volumes.
Randall Hogan: We don't think so, no.
Nathan Jones: Okay. Then my other question on water quality solutions you talked about growth investments in the second half can you give us some more color on what those growth investments are and maybe what the impact on margins is in the back half-of-the-year and if there is continuing investments or disgrace investments?
Randall Hogan: Yes. Before I get into the specific investment so what we meant was that we had such a nice increase in margins I just don't think people should expect it to be that good and we gave you some insights on what we expect the margins to be. The investments are basically in two. One is product innovation and the other one is in channel in geography investments and sales coverage. So maybe it's 50 bips a quarter in the investment increase and one is it's a business that as the conversation about China and the conversation we talked earlier about pool business it really is a business that is yielding the innovation so product innovation pays and then as I mentioned we are applying some of the pool playbook to water purification to get more eminent and closer to the customer and those are the geography and channel investments we are making.
Nathan Jones: So it sounds like continuing investment that you grade the rewards on the top line?
Randall Hogan: Right, right.
Nathan Jones: Thank you. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Hammond from KeyBanc, your line is open.
Jeffrey Hammond: Hey good morning guys.
Randall Hogan: Good morning.
Jeffrey Hammond: Not to beat this too hard, but the I am just trying to - get a better sense of where you are seeing this sequential improvement visibility that 10% improvement what sub verticals and is it your customers telling your or actually in order rates or --
Randall Hogan: You are talking about valves?
Jeffrey Hammond: Yes.
John Stauch: Yes okay. Great. Yes, listen we are - we have had a fairly sizable frontline for a period of time and I think as Randy mentioned we scrubbed it. We have discounted the larger projects from the expectations that those were closed this year, but what we did when we reorganized the sales force is put a lot more energy and effort in the aftermarket side and one of the things we bring to the table to a lot of the larger customers is the ability to service a vast majority of valves and the way that we are servicing those right now is on an aggregated buy basis from those customers and then also working inside their factory to their plants to be able to benefit from that. So that's the big piece of it. The second one is that there has been some Pentair demand on the downstream side especially the MRO downstream and as we always said we don't think that that could be deferred forever and we’re starting to see that start to come in. So, we are not declaring victory yet I think we are saying is that we believe the Q2 represents the bottom of the orders and we are starting to see the increase from here. A double-digit increase of the Q2 is still a modest level of orders that we - versus what we are used to but at least the sign that we are going to see that downstream investments start to come back.
Jeffrey Hammond: Okay helpful and then just free cash flow came in a lot better how are you thinking about upside the free cash flow for the year?
John Stauch: Right now we are committed to the 100% of that income and we are tracking as we said $150 million better than last year but we are focused on this and obviously getting our debt paid down.
Randall Hogan: We are not only $150 million ahead of last year we are ahead of where we thought be this. 
John Stauch: Yes, but Jeff I think we got to see another quarter too before we obviously - we will too have it but anyway we need to see another quarter before we are going to declare that there is upside to that number.
Jeffrey Hammond: Okay thanks guys. 
Randall Hogan: Thank you. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Scott Graham: Hey good morning. I have a question on water quality system first not Valves & Controls. You are looking for a nice bump up in organic in the third quarter and we are just hoping you can give us little color around that?
Randall Hogan: Yes, there is a couple of factors. One is the Europe comp in water purification in the second quarter was tough so we didn't show growth there. We think that it gets better. And then and we talked about the pool timing. And the pool marketing you can look at comp, there is few comps you can look at. The pool market is really quite strong and we think that more that will read out too. You will see that more because of the timing comp, the timing won’t mess up the comp.
John Stauch: Yes, the weather can have an impact on the timing of the pool season Scott and last year there was a very, very strong Q2 and we are now back to more of a normal trend on a year-over-year basis in Q3 and as we shared I mean our product and environmental system business has been growing yearly double digit now for four five years in a row so we feel really good about the visibility to the summer and feel very good about the growth rate for Q3.
Scott Graham: Yes, makes sense. Thank you. The other question I had was simply on the shrinkage of the footprint in the past you have given us some metrics of improvement that where it was whether it was facility or people or otherwise anything you are willing to share this quarter?
John Stauch: No. I mean we have few more factories in the works to reduce. So we are just under 100 total factories to Pentair and we expect to have reduced it by around five or six by the beginning of the year to the end of the year so we are modestly addressing it where we feel we have excess capacity due to the end markets that we are serving but we are not aggressively reducing the factory at this time.
Scott Graham: Alright, very good, thank you.
Randall Hogan: Thank you. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Joshua Pokrzywinski from The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. Your line is open.
Joshua Pokrzywinski: Hi good morning guys. I have heard all at this point. I will put them on the roster with the rest of them.
Randall Hogan: Joshua Pokrzywinski go ahead. 
Joshua Pokrzywinski: Yes, just to come back to tech product side, I understand there is some mix issues that you are talking about in thermal but we have heard a lot of companies call out particularly price cost obviously it's a steel intensive business. I would have imagined a bit more support from price cost in this quarter particularly on the Enclosure side and maybe a bit more turnaround headwind in the second half and I guess all the questions or responses around tech product seems to be focusing more on thermal than on Enclosures or ERICO so just trying to dimension out within I guess Hoffman or maybe ERICO specifically how you see mix evolving there, how you see some of the margin read out particularly it retain price cost?
Randall Hogan: Yes, we have done really well on the price costs on both ERICO and Enclosure so we did single out the thermal business Josh primarily because that is not really steel related it's more of the heat tracing cable versus the labor and the integration cost to bring that project to there so when we take on the projects and we are doing the design the engineering and the install and then we’re bringing the cable along we are going to have a compression of margins when the product side is down. And as we mentioned the aftermarket MRO sometimes goes to distribution or go direct to the end site and again installed and that's the part that's been down double-digit. So we are up significantly in the project side. We are down in the product side and we’re experiencing an overall mix issue even though we are up in the revenue.
Joshua Pokrzywinski: But just to be clear on Enclosures and ERICO, no change increase, decrease in the margins versus 1Q for the full year outlook?
Randall Hogan: No change and we have probably experiencing a little bit modest headwind on Q3 and Q4 and I save a couple million dollars in the rising cost of the steel, but not anything significant.
Joshua Pokrzywinski: Got you and then just shifting gears to water quality. I think I know you mentioned the easy comp in Europe is that a low mix dynamic where you wouldn't see lot of pool through profitability on that I guess having just said there is a late start to the pool season maybe that's still over in the third quarter you got the strong volume quarter coming. I would imagine that margin would look little bit better than what you showed or what you are showing in guidance?
Randall Hogan: Well, water purification in Europe pool isn't that big in Europe but the water purification side is and margins there are bad. Is there little mix…
John Stauch: I think there is, Randy mentioned, there is the desire to do significant growth investment and this is a business that absolutely deserves to do these growth investments and we factor them in at the business, spending them. The likelihood that they would actually spend them would be low.
Joshua Pokrzywinski: Got you but there is no blue bird in the second quarter apart from just good mix - okay.
Randall Hogan: No. not at all.
Joshua Pokrzywinski: Got you, alright, thanks guys.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer & Co. Your line is open.
Christopher Glynn: Thanks good morning. Hey so the tech solutions trends overall shown a little revenue upside but some negative mix on the thermal side. With the intuition be for 2017 to have some favorable mix versions on margin and little bit of net organic pressure or you kind of see thermal more likely to compound the growth?
John Stauch: Early to call that but I think your intuition are about right. 
Randall Hogan: Yes, I would certainly start with that. William started that.
John Stauch: I think your intuition we are doing now is correct. 
Christopher Glynn: Okay and then just comment on how to size the corporate line in the second half?
Randall Hogan: Yes, I think you should look at around $43ish million divided equally between Q3 and Q4.
Christopher Glynn: Great, that's all I got. Thanks. 
Randall Hogan: Thank you. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Robert Barry from Susquehanna International Group, your line is open.
Robert Barry: Hey guys, good morning, so I wanted to clarify in Valves the improvement you expect in the second half, is that on the aftermarket?
John Stauch: Yes, we've got a little bit more short cycle, product shipments and also getting up with past two backlog, so we see that we're expecting to get a slightly higher standard margins we move that through the shipments, and we also as we mentioned that we took in a fair amount of deferred variances from last year, which I think we spent more than we should have on the labor side and we had a belief that off in the first couple of quarters this year, so we have a little tailwind associated with that.
Robert Barry: Got you, and I think in an answer to an earlier question you alluded to some of the deferred maintenance starting to show up, is that refinery maintenance you're seeing come through it?
Randall Hogan: I don't think refinery, we're seeing more of the petrochem spending come through, which has been actively being bit, one thing that seems pretty clear is that now that the rapid decline in capital spending has happened, our customers are really sorted out normally who is working on it, who has stored and formed it, which projects are going to go forward with and we execute a little projects, we talk a lot of our big projects as the thing is that they move a needle a lot, but our average project size is $100 million, so those are small outage turnarounds just maintenance related activities and so I think we’re going to get into a more normalized albeit lower level of how they’re deployed.
Robert Barry: That’s good to hear. Just lastly you’ve been making a lot of changes to the sales organization in Valves, at this point are all of these changes kind of net, net helping or hurting the order growth?
Randall Hogan: I think the structure itself is the right structure I think when you make this level of change where you have project oriented sales people trying to call in the aftermarket you’re going to find areas where that’s the wrong skill set and I think that’s where we’re going to have to continue to migrate the sales force to the right skill set overtime and to say we’re optimized to the moment I would say is not accurate and I think we think the structure is right and what we now need to do is get the processes, the support for the structure operating fully and then we think we can benefit going forward. Has that hurt us, probably here and there but not dramatically.
Robert Barry: Great, thank you.

Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We were pleased with our first quarter result, beating the expectation set at the beginning of the year. The top line was consistent with expectations, and we saw a strong execution in all businesses led by three segments delivering over 100 basis points of margin expansion each. We recently announced a new leader for our Valves & Controls segment. We're all glad to have Dennis Cassidy join us most recently from AlixPartners. I appreciate John Stauch leaning in and leading Valves & Controls the past few quarters; and Valves & Controls business delivered first quarter results in line with our guidance. Integration of ERICO is meeting our expectations, and we believe we're on track to meet or exceed the $10 million in synergies we targeted. Free cash flow, while a seasonally usage during the quarter, was much better than the comparable period last year. Given the strong start to free cash flow this year, we feel good about our ability to deliver approximately $750 million in free cash this year. We're maintaining our 2016 full-year adjusted EPS outlook of $4.05 to $4.25 per share. Execution for cash and earnings remain our key focus in the first quarter given the good start to the year. Now, let's turn to slide 5 for a discussion of our Q1 2016 results in more detail. First quarter core sales grew 1%, which is an improvement from the declines we saw the past couple of quarters. Three over four segments met or beat their top-line commitments with Flow & Filtration Solutions being negatively impacted by timing of beverage shipments. ERICO contributed positively with sales in line with our expectations. Segment income increased 5% and return on sales contracted 20 basis points to 13.3%. Three segments delivered margin expansion greater than 100 basis points, and Valves & Controls met its first quarter income and margin commitments. Adjusted EPS was flat at $0.76 per share and was ahead of our guidance of $0.70 to $0.72 per share. As I mentioned previously, free cash flow started much better this year with a small usage in the quarter, and it was over a $100 million improvement year-over-year. Now, let's turn to slide 6 for more details on Pentair's Q1 2016 performance. Our sales performance by vertical was mixed with strong growth in Residential & Commercial and in Infrastructure, which helped partially offset continued sluggishness in Energy. We saw some signs of stabilization in our Industrial businesses. And while Food & Beverage was down in the quarter, we continue to believe this vertical will deliver full year growth, as shipments in our Beverage business can be choppy. Our largest vertical, Residential & Commercial, saw 11% sales growth to start the year led by double-digit growth in Water Quality Systems and Technical Solutions and solid growth in Flow & Filtration Solutions. Infrastructure did turn positive on strength in both North American Municipal Pumps and improved project activity in our Process Filtration business globally. The rate of decline within Industrial moderated for the quarter, and we're encouraged by what we believe are signs of stabilization in this, our second largest vertical. Food & Beverage started the year slowly, impacting our Flow & Filtration Solution results, that is principally the result of timing around Beverage shipments I mentioned and ongoing weakness in Irrigation. It's no surprise that Energy remains weak. And while we expected this vertical to continue to be down this year, we believe our non-Energy businesses are positioned to more than compensate for this weakness. Energy now represents just over 20% of our sales and an even smaller percentage of our profits. We continue to believe the remaining 80% of our portfolio is well positioned particularly, within Residential & Commercial and Food & Beverage verticals. As you can see on the right-hand side of the page, productivity remains strong and more than offset inflation. Price was a modest positive in the quarter, and ERICO contributed strength to the bottom line on strong underlying performance and synergies. Now, let's turn to slide seven for a review of our segment and major platform structure. We want to remind everyone of the alignment of our businesses which we introduced at our Investor Day last November. Underneath, are four segments, we've grouped activities into 10 strategic business groups or SBGs to better prioritize our resource allocation across the company. We'll discuss the SBG performance within each segment. For a more detailed look at each SBG, please refer to our presentation on our website from the 2015 Investor Day. Our Water business is split between two segments, with Flow & Filtration Solutions focused around a solutions approach and Water Quality Systems business, aligned by product distribution. Technical Solutions has three well-positioned electrical businesses. And we've realigned our Valves & Controls business around two key selling motions: aftermarket and projects. The key distinction in all of these SBGs is that we can differentiate any investments more clearly between them. Now, let's turn to slide eight for a look at Water Quality Systems performance in Q1. Water Quality Systems delivered another strong quarter with 9% core sales growth. The Aquatic & Environmental Systems business grew 13% organically as the North American pool season got off to a strong start and aquaculture continued to grow nicely. Water Filtration grew core sales 5% with particular strength continuing in our residential filtration business. Segment income grew an impressive 19% and return on sales expanded 170 basis points to 18.6%. Robust operating leverage was a key contributor in margin expansion in the quarter even as we increased our growth investments to maintain the strong momentum that Water Quality Systems has delivered the past several years. Now, let's move to slide nine for a look at Flow & Filtration Solutions performance in Q1. Flow & Filtration saw revenue decline 4%, with core sales down 2% and negative FX translation of another 2%. We had anticipated the segment's return to growth in the first quarter and while the infrastructure growth was as expected, the Food & Beverage performance was negatively impacted by the timing of those beverage shipments. We were encouraged with double-digit order growth in beverage still. But given the current state of consolidation in the beer industry in particular, choppiness in sales is expected to be a trend quarter-to-quarter in the near term. Water Technologies saw core sales declined 1% as strength in Residential & Commercial and infrastructure pump shipments were more than offset by double-digit declines in irrigation pump shipments. We believe the strength in Residential & Commercial will continue into the seasonally strong second quarter and the longer cycle Infrastructure business will continue to grow based on a solid backlog and a strong quote funnel. Core sales in Fluid Solutions declined 5% due to the previously mentioned delays in Beverage shipments but our precision spray business grew in the quarter. Process Filtration had good core sales growth of 4% as we continue to see momentum build from our focus on industrial water reuse solutions and some improvement in infrastructure which includes a couple of desalination projects. Segment income grew 9% and return on sales expanded 130 basis points to 11.7%. This was the fourth consecutive quarter of margin expansion as our execution has improved within the segment. Still, we believe there's a long runway ahead for further margin improvement particularly when the top line returns to growth. Now, let's turn to slide 10 to discuss how Technical Solutions performed in Q1. Technical Solutions reported 33% sales growth for the quarter consisting of 5% core sales growth, a 2% headwind from FX and a 30% positive contribution from ERICO. Core sales on Enclosures declined 5% as the pressure we saw on our short cycle industrial business late last year persisted. While the year-over-year comparisons we expected remain challenging in the second quarter, we were encouraged to see stabilization in the daily order rate in the quarter and continue to expect easier comparisons in the back half of the year as a result. Thermal Management experienced impressive core sales growth of 22% as two projects in Canada are nearing completion. The Industrial Heat Tracing business continues to see wins in its smaller project business while its more profitable products business remains weak. The Thermal Building business also had a strong quarter. While the results of ERICO are captured as acquisition contribution, the business performed in line with our expectations. As a reminder, over 75% of ERICO's sales are into commercial end markets, which remain very healthy in the quarter. We believe we are on track to deliver over $10 million in synergies for the year on top of the base business' attractive profitability. Segment income grew 45% and return on sales expanded an impressive 190 basis points to 21.5%. Despite negative mix in Thermal Management and some price pressures in Enclosures, strong productivity and the positive contribution from ERICO helped drive margin expansion in the quarter. While core sales are expected to turn negative for the remainder of the year due to the two large Thermal projects ending, we believe Technical Solutions is well positioned to deliver strong income growth and margin expansion due, in large part, to strong execution with the ERICO integration and a strong culture around productivity across the whole segment. Now, let's move to slide 11 to discuss the Valves & Controls' performance in Q1. Valves & Controls reported a 10% decline in revenue with core sales down 7% and a 3% headwind from FX. Most importantly, the top line was in line with our expectations. Backlog was down 2% sequentially, which includes negative FX translation. Core orders were down 11% year-over-year, consistent with the double-digit rate of decline that's been experienced the past several quarters. Core sales were down 9% in Aftermarket and down 4% on projects, as the business continues to ship out of backlog. We expected Aftermarket to start the year slowly as customers were finalizing their budgets, and OpEx continues to be constrained right along with CapEx at many customers. In the second quarter, we'll watch closely both Aftermarket sales and orders but we remain very cautious since it's not clear whether energy markets have found bottom. The right half of the page shows first quarter Segment income and return on sales, which both met our forecast. It was just under one year ago when we saw an acceleration in the rate of decline in the business, and I asked John to step in and lead the business on an interim basis, as we searched for a new leader of the segment, which, of course, we just recently filled. I'm very pleased with the entire Valves & Controls leadership team's resilience during these difficult times. And I want to personally thank them for their tenacious leadership. While the business continues watching for signs of stabilization on orders, they've accomplished a lot the past several quarters in rightsizing the business to today's hard reality. We've believed for some time that the downturn in energy is more than cyclical and we've acted accordingly. Over the past 12 months, we've realigned the business to reflect the energy industry decline resulting in head count reductions of over 20%. It hasn't been easy but it was necessary. I would also like to point out that these rightsizing actions were started a year ago and are on top of what we've already accomplished since we acquired the business three-and-a-half years ago. To put it in perspective, we reduced the number of ERPs, accounting centers and other back-office functions by over 40% and the manufacturing footprint is 30% smaller. While these are steps in the right direction, there's still more opportunity and work to be done. Under Dennis' leadership and with a strong team in place, we believe that Valves & Controls will be well-positioned for an eventual recovery in its end markets. While we expect revenue to recover to be a couple of years away yet, we continue to take actions aimed at improving profitability even this year. So, the 6.5% return on sales in Q1 is not indicative of our current cost structure. We expect improved margins each quarter this year as 2015 higher cost inventory works its way through the income statement in the first half. Our prior communication of $100 million in cost-out benefit in 2016 is on track, and we continue to expect to exit the year with margins in the teens and full year margins just north of 10%, even on muted sales. Now, let's turn to slide 12 for a look at the Valves & Controls backlog. As you can see on this slide, short cycle orders were down 5% and long cycle orders declined 18%. The short cycle weakness was more acute in Europe, but the U.S. also was weak as customers continue to defer maintenance. This was not just in oil and gas, but also in power and mining. We'll watch orders closely to see when customers begin to start spending OpEx once again. The weakness on the project side was broad based with CapEx budgets being cut across the board. The quoting funnel appears to be slowly improving, particularly in LNG and petrochem, but we're not expecting a big increase in orders. We continue to believe there is potential for orders to find a bottom in the second half in projects though. Second quarter orders will be instructive in seeing if the quote funnel begins to bear fruit, and we'll remain cautious and interested to see if there are signs of stabilization in the short cycle business. We will continue to focus on capitalizing on opportunities, particularly where we can leverage the breadth of the entire Valves & Controls portfolio. Now, let's move to slide 13 to provide an update in our segment positioning. Before I turn the call over to John to discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year, I wanted to provide an update on our segment positioning and comment on the reordering of the segments. While Valves & Controls has received a lot of attention the past 18 months, the business has worked to aggressively reposition itself in the face of the significant reset in the energy industry. And now the segment is expected to contribute only 15% of this year's Pentair income. We believe the other 85% of the portfolio is well-positioned, and we remain excited about the opportunities in these other three segments. We have two high-performing segments today in Water Quality Systems and Technical Solutions. Flow & Filtration Solutions has made good progress in improving its margin and cash flow while positioning for a return to growth. This chart shows the progress against each segment's priorities. We introduced these priorities at our Investor Day last November, and highlighted them once again in our 2016 outlook call last December. Both Water Quality Systems and Technical Solutions have continued to perform, and we believe they're well-positioned to build on their momentum. We're encouraged with the improvements in margin and cash flow at Flow & Filtration Solutions. And as the business continues to gain traction in moving to a solutions provider from a manufacturer of components, we expect organic growth to not only return, but to become more consistent and predictable, given their portfolio is well-aligned to grow with macro trends, particularly in Food and Beverage. So, 2016 has started off as we expected. We believe our Water and Electrical businesses are well-positioned to continue delivering strong results, and Valves & Controls has become a smaller piece of the portfolio as a result of the energy industry reset, and we're making good progress in stabilizing and right-sizing that business. Cash and earnings execution remain the mantra for 2016, and we're focused on delivering our commitments to our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Randy. Please turn to slide number 14, titled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. We ended the first quarter with $4.8 billion of net debt inclusive of cash on hand. This is a slight increase from our year-end debt levels due to seasonal working capital build, particularly in our residential and commercial businesses. As Randy mentioned earlier, our free cash flow was over $100 million better to start the year versus the comparable period last year. While we did consume minimal cash in the quarter, in line with historical patterns, we continue to expect to deliver our free cash flow target of approximately $750 million for the year. Our ROIC ended the quarter at 9.6%. Our capital expenditure forecast remains unchanged at approximately $150 million as we continue to invest in the businesses that have earned the right to grow, especially Water Quality Systems and Technical Solutions and drive deeper disciplines into our Valves & Controls factories. Please turn to slide 15 labeled Q2 2016 Pentair outlook. For the second quarter, we expect core sales to decline approximately 3% and total sales to increase 4% inclusive of FX headwinds and a positive contribution from ERICO. On a core sales basis, we expect Water Quality Systems to grow approximately 5% as the segment enters its seasonally strongest period. Flow & Filtration Solutions' core sales are expected to be up modestly as the business continues to reposition itself and comparisons become easier. Technical Solutions is expected to have a core sales decline of roughly 3% as two projects in the Thermal Management business are completed and Enclosures faces another tough year-over-year comparison. Finally, Valves & Controls core sales are expected to decline approximately 13% as the project backlog remains weak and we remain cautious in the short term as to whether the Aftermarket business will accelerate after the slow start to the year. We are expecting segment income to increase approximately 5% and return on sales to be roughly flat at 16.5%. Below the operating income line, we continue to expect the tax rate to remain around 20.5%. Net interest and other to approximate $35 million and shares outstanding to be just over 182 million. Our second quarter adjusted EPS guidance is $1.08 to $1.11, which is an increase of approximately 2% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect a seasonal ramp-up in free cash flow and further improvement in our working capital performance. Please turn to slide 16 labeled Full Year 2016 Pentair Outlook. We are maintaining our full-year adjusted EPS outlook of $4.05 to $4.25 with very few changes to our prior forecast. For the full year, we still expect total Pentair core sales to decline approximately 1%. Water Quality Systems full-year core sales are anticipated to be up approximately 5% as both its Aquatic and Environmental Systems and Water Filtration businesses are well positioned to continue driving the growth rates experienced the last several years. Flow & Filtration Solutions core sales are expected to be up approximately 2% for the full year, led by stabilization in Water Technologies and growth in both Fluid Solutions and Process Filtration. Technical Solutions is expected to see core sales decline roughly 2%, which is slightly better than our prior forecast, as the Thermal Management backlog has grown and we have seen stabilization in Enclosures daily order rates. Finally, Valves & Controls core sales are still expected to decline roughly 8% given our current view of orders for the full year. We expect segment income to grow roughly 9% and return on sales to expand approximately 90 basis points to 16.5% with three of our four segments delivering full-year margin expansion. We continue to anticipate full-year corporate cost to be just over $90 million, net interest and other roughly $140 million and the share count to be just over 182 million; all essentially in line with previous expectations. Adjusted EPS is expected to be up approximately 5% to midpoint of the range. Finally, we expect a strong year of free cash flow at approximately $750 million, which represents roughly 100% of our adjusted net income. Steve, can you please open the line for questions? Thank you.
Operator: Yes. And your first question comes from the line of Steven Winoker from Bernstein. Your line is now open.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks, guys, and good morning.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Just a couple of quick questions. The first one is can you maybe comment on the treasury rules and regulations that came out, particularly regarding earnings stripping and the impact you see on Pentair's tax rate over time?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes, Steve. Still obviously, processing, it's a very generic rule now. We've got to look into the specificity of all of it. But in the next several years or at least the longer term, for however long we have the debt in place, we don't see any impact to our overall tax rate. But clearly, the rules would challenge acquiring North American businesses and layering on new debt onto those businesses. So, we would have to take advantage of our operational synergies to get to those tax synergies that we would have. And, clearly, any acquisition in the future needs to strategically fit and be an operational synergistic acquisition, and then we would look to utilize our advantaged structure to still gain the cash fluidity and then, ultimately, advance the cash strategies on a more permanent basis.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you. And then there's been quite a lot of speculation, Randy, about how you're positioning Valves & Controls. Clearly, you've been improving the business and we can see that. But part of that debate is whether Pentair is a consolidator or consolidatee in this business over time or what your desire is? Can you maybe comment on how you're thinking about it?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, yeah, I think there's been some confusion about that. I think it was not a secret that we saw ourselves with our structure and with this really great business that we have in Valves & Controls. And in a fragmented industry like Valves & Controls, or in Flow in general, as a likely consolidator. And what I've said is right now, we're not focused on being a consolidator. We're focused on fixing what we got. So, our focus really is on continuing to get our margins back. And we believe, as I've mentioned in the prepared remarks, we believe we are on the road to do that. We'd like to see the first quarter be the natter, if you will, on return on sales for the business, and continue to execute, because the business has a lot of headroom. Even without revenue, as I've said, even without revenue recovery, I believe we can get back to teens. And we want to prove that.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And just when...
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I don't want to be laying stuff over it at this point.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. That's clear. And just a quick one, organic growth ex those large projects, the large thermal projects in the quarter, what was that if you took those out, the big one?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Flattish.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks. I'll pass it on.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray from RBC. Your line is now open.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hey, Deane.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Morning, Deane.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey, in Water Quality specifically Aquatics, that's impressive core revenue growth of 13%. So, it looks like you got off to a strong spring selling season in pool. Anything regarding like a pre-buy that happened? Are there going to be any comp issues? And how does this business set up for the second quarter, because that's also seasonally important?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, Deane. Our dealers are the pool builders. They exited last year with a pretty good backlog of pools unbuilt. So they entered the year with a backlog of business to do, plus we have all the rebate programs and all the advanced equipment, the Eco Select line we have. So we really think it's – there's share gain, but it's generally market. There's not a lot of pre-buy. The early-buy program we had was not remarkable. And so a lot of this is not the big early-buy product but real – if you will, stocking to sell through or normal seasonal stocking to sell through. So we've had a lot of momentum in that business and we continue to invest in that business in sales and in new product development in order to keep the momentum going.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Do you have a sense of the product vitality of your pool equipment recently? I know you had the IntelliFlo, but just how much of that product line is new in the last three years?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I think I'll get the number wrong. It's close to 30% right now. And it's not just the IntelliFlo – in fact, we have a new – the next versions of IntelliFlo are coming now. But there's new controls, there's new LED lighting, there's new heaters. There's really a complete new suite of product, all aimed at fitting that Eco Select sustainability mark. And as you – I think as you saw we just got the third ENERGY STAR award from the EPA which makes us a sustained sustainer. I don't think they call it. So, we feel really good about that business, and we got a lot more growth. And, as you know, that was the basis, it was our strength there, that was the basis of foundation of our aquaculture business, which is, again, just managing bodies of water.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Understood. And then, over on the Valves & Controls side, so you've added Dennis Cassidy to the team. And I'm interested in hearing, as you bring him onboard, he's coming in midstream and that's an unfortunate pun, but he's onboard when you already have an existing restructuring plan, existing commitments and just what's the continuity in terms of leadership there? Was John going to be still part-time there? Does he roll off? And should we expect any tweaking to the plan and the commitments because you said you're going to exit 2016 which will be if the math works in the teens in margins. I just want to know what kind of variability there might be with the change in leadership?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I mean, it took us a while to find the right person for the reason that the business is facing some challenges and we needed someone who's up to it. I'm quite excited to have Dennis. Dennis from AlixPartners, I know AlixPartners has a reputation for transformations and restructuring. And he has some of that experience, but he also has some extraordinarily deep and successful experience doing value stream transformations in the oilfield services business. And he's deeply engaged in the energy field. So, as we – well, let me back up. He spent a lot of time getting to know the business and the programs that are in place, and he's totally onboard with them. And he'll tweak them, and he certainly has – as president, he has full right to do that. But, it's again, tweak to, tweak, it'll be tweaks to get us to the objectives we have. One area where he will be very focused is on these two value streams, Aftermarket and Projects and tuning, if you will, the business, so that we can really focus on the Aftermarket so that as it comes back, we can gain share there. I think, as we've said before, we really didn't differentiate the way we served Aftermarket versus Project. And by tuning the system, we believe that we can get growth in that market. And the fact that he's intimate with the industry is really, really beneficial and that he's done things like this before. As for John, he's back to being CFO full time and Dennis doesn't need his help anymore than, what he'll get with John as CFO.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And that's plenty.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: That's great to hear. Thank you.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Good morning, guys.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hey, Joe.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Joe.
Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. So, I heard a few times in your script, you guys mentioned the word stabilization. And so, I want to touch on that a little bit, specifically is it relates to the order rates what you're seeing in your front log in Industrials. And, I guess, what implication, if anything, did that have to the guidance range – did the guidance raise you had in Tech Solutions?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I can answer that, Joe. I mean, very little. I think the word stabilization is really related to the fact that when we exited Q4, we saw double-digit declines in our North American Industrial space. And clearly, Q1 became a big quarter to see if that was going to continue or start to recover in. Clearly, we had achieved our expectation in Q1, but we also saw order rates on a daily basis start to, as we said, stabilize, which means becoming less worse and starting to improve on a day-to-day basis. A long way to what we'd say is a growth recovery but certainly gives us more confidence of the Enclosures business and also the North American Industrial hitting its expectations for the year. The tweaks to Technical Solutions are really around, we continue to build a project backlog in the Industrial Heat Trace business. We feel really good about that backlog. It is impacting margins slightly, but we ultimately feel that that project backlog will shift this year, and that was our tweak to the revenue numbers in Technical Solutions.
Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And just was there any change to the kind of $30 million to $40 million headwind that you guys expected to see from the megaprojects rolling down?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: No, there isn't. It's the same.
Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And then, I guess, maybe my follow-up question, just touching V&C. So, you hit your margin target for the first quarter. And clearly, there's a ramp in your guidance for the remainder of the year. Can you just kind of touch on the key factors that are going to help you get to that ramp? I think, last quarter, we touched on short-cycle mix. There was something related to your inventories as well. Maybe touch on the factors that are going to allow you to get from the 6.5% to teens margin in V&C as we progress through the year.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. I think Randy said it very eloquently in his script on last year's higher inventory rolling off this year. And to help you quantify that, let's think of somewhere around $25 million of cost that needs to roll into the first half of the year. And you can think about that split between Q1 and Q2. And if you think about that as last year's coming in and we've got our cost base now in line with what we're shipping and building, you kind of see the headwinds that we're factoring in Q1 and Q2 that are no longer there in Q3 and Q4. Plus, we see the acceleration of a lot of the head count actions and people-related cost-out actions come into the benefit to Q3 and Q4 as well. So, very little revenue expectations from a standpoint of anything beyond what's in the backlog and still assuming double-digit declines in aftermarket in Q2. And it's really about the actions we took last year and the timing of how those actions flow through between Q2, Q3 and Q4.
Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Steve.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: So, I just wanted to be clear on the tax question. So, is there – like, is there risk that the tax rate is going up or what are you kind of messaging here? That there's kind of TBDs that need to be worked out? What is kind of the final message on that for now?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: The simple answer is everything they've announced has nothing to do with anyone who's already got the structure, and we already got the structure. That's point one. Point two is we have to figure out what it means for things we do in the future. But right now, we're not doing anything because we're focused on cash and earnings execution. But when we get back to doing acquisitions, we're going to have to look to see what the impact is in terms of what's called the debt pushdown strategy, what they called earnings stripping. We still – on whatever we do, we'll still have the opportunities to focus on operating synergies, as John said. And we still have the ability to move cash around freely which is an extraordinary advantage that doesn't get focused on as much in our tax structure versus our former tax structure.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Right. And you don't have to keep as you grow earnings, you don't have to keep adding inter-company debt to kind of make sure that that extra income is shielded, for lack of a better term?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: No
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Got it. On the Valves, I think, you made – I joined the call a little bit late, but I think you called the Valves recovery two years out. Can you just maybe expand on that a little more? Does that mean you don't expect growth until really 2018, is that a simple way of saying that?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: No. What we said was that we – and it was an imprecise comment. It was actually an adlib off the script. We think there's a chance that project orders will bottom out in the second half this year which wouldn't give us growth until next year, second part of 2017 – so, maybe 18 months. Right now, we're not clairvoyant. But if we saw projects start to recover in the second half then ultimately it will give us growth about (36:16).
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: So, can you grow in 2017 do you think at this stage?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. I think we can grow in 2017.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Particularly, Aftermarket has to come back. I mean, the fact that Aftermarket is down and short cycle. Basically, there's a continuum of ongoing maintenance. There's must do. There's good to do. And there's nice to do. And right now, they've taken a cleaver to all their spending and it's just bang, down 40% and so, they haven't really fully sorted it out, and to the OpEx too. Now, they got to get back to the must dos and the should dos but they don't have to get back to the nice to dos. So, that's what we want to be close to and help them as they sort out – now, they've insourced things they're going to figure out longer term that they probably should be outsourcing things. It's very fluid.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Steve, I think real quickly, I just add to what Randy said. I mean, I don't think we see or we'll be able to call the recovery this year. Which means, any growth we get will be our backlog plus modest expected growth in 2017. Given where we are in the base this year, we would expect to grow modestly next year, continue to work the cost actions that we need to, and then any long-term recovery or rapid recovery is definitely in our views beyond 2017.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Got it. And then one last question just on the Flow & Filtration segment. I think that implies a relatively strong back half of the year. Is that some lumpiness in Food and Beverage? What's kind of the driver there?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. It's just Food and Beverage. I think what we've got is we've got a little bit of customers who have completed some consolidations and they're a little bit more lumpier in their execution of the projects and how their letting the capital flow through. And so, while we still have a very solid backlog, we're seeing a little bit of retiming of that backlog, which is impacting what quarter that ships.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Got it. Thanks a lot. Way to go.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Steve.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan from UBS. Your line is now open.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Good morning, guys.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hey, Shannon.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Hey. On Valves & Controls, just in terms of actually hitting the forecast this quarter, that seems regardless of what the actual numbers were, it was on plan, which has been a challenge. John, can you talk about kind of the actions you took while you were there? And do you feel changes you've made to the processes there are going to enable more kind of reliable delivery on forecasts regardless of what those forecasts actually are?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. I appreciate that, Shannon. I think what Randy and I are introducing, and what I took into the business and we tried to improve the discipline is there's known ways to think of project execution and working long-cycle businesses and project backlog. You start out with a shippable backlog, and then you get – you look at standard deviation and what's going to happen between being pushed out or pulled in? Customers are always going to retime you. But if you look at that over a period of time, it's always a percentage of the backlog. And what happens is people work deep in the business is they have a lot of hope in their forecast, that all, everything is going to be good and nothing bad is going to happen. And so, when you take a look at it at a high level, we just started to take out those stretches from the expectations and, really, build on the precision of what's going to get shipped out on a weekly basis. And I really think that muscle has now been developed and built within the team. And I'm very proud of what they've accomplished, as Randy mentioned. And, I think, we're going to be much more predictable as we go forward. So, that's what I would say...
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I'd add in complement to you John. If you will, the algorithms, there was not great coordination between the sales forecast, the operating forecast and the materials forecast and the finance forecast. They were not – as you said, there was assumptions. But I mean, John, really streamlined that, got people talking and we have higher quality forecasts now. And this is the second quarter. I mean, we hit the fourth quarter too.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So, we're a long way away from a perfect SIOP (40:51) process. But, I think, we're on our way to getting the expectations aligned and, therefore, not trying to have anticipated production against demand that's not needed.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. No that helps. Thanks.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: And then just a little follow-up on the stabilization in Enclosures. You talked about exiting last year down double-digits, and then getting less negative. Are we turning positive yet? Or when do you expect it to turn positive, maybe just a little bit more of the cadence to that daily sale (41:08)?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: No. No. We haven't turned positive yet. And so, what we're saying is, if we stay at the level we're at when we start lapping the second half, the comps will look better, But we're not – I would call bouncing along the bottom, maybe.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: We think we get back to flattish as we exit Q3 and maybe some slight increase in Q4 Shannon.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Howard from Baird. Your line is now open.
Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Morning, everyone.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Mike.
Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): So, just continuing that thought process then, when you think about stabilization beyond just the Enclosures piece, are you at the point where you're starting to see a little bit more normal sequential patterns through the year? And when you get towards the back half of the year, is there any fundamental improvement embedded in some of those kind of core industrial markets or is it just following that normal sequential pattern?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Yeah. I think we are getting back to sort of more normal expectations. I think one of the learnings for everybody is that when the Energy business spends $1 trillion a year, and goes down to $600 million a year, the knock-on effect into many other industries is pretty profound. And that's really what's I think is the core driver of a lot of the – what we call Industrial, but sort of the second order effect of the cuts in the Energy business. And so, those are getting sorted out. I mean, people are adjusting to the new reality at this new level. And so, I think we'll see more seasonality. And, as John said, we're hopeful that there'll be an increase in the fourth quarter. We typically would see a bump in the fourth quarter in Industrial so.
Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): And then on the Aftermarket side, you guys talked about insourcing versus outsourcing before and obviously still competitive out there. But when you think about what the competition is doing, not so much some of the larger valve guys, but some of the smaller valve guys, what are you seeing with them and what are you seeing your customers doing? Is there a migration towards some of the lower cost guys at this point and how are you defending core share?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. We're certainly looking out for that, but I think what's happening right now is dynamic. First of all, we've got the cutback of OpEx because it's a spend. But the downstream right now is where all the cash is being generated on for our customers' customers, and they're running them full out to bring cash into the organization. And so, a lot of the deferrals are still happening because we don't have the planned shutdowns we used to have. As Randy mentioned, you can only do that for so long and then ultimately you got to – you do the shutdown. Now, we haven't assumed any recovery in Q2 in that pattern, and we're thinking that that's more likely a Q3 event.
Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): And just from that perspective, what do you guys need to see besides time? Is there anything specific or is it just time needs to push on and then these guys can come back to the market again?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, I mean, what they need to do, our customers need to adjust to the fact that this may not recover soon. So, they have to adjust their own operating practices. So, I mean, it's not just the maintenance but the first thing you do when you have downturn like this is before you lay people off, you insource everything. You can't end up bringing maintenance in-house. And then when you start realizing that that's not as efficient as if I have a contractor do it, you end up then going out more aggressively. It's not a mystery. I mean, this is what we are expecting. So, we want to be in a position. That's one of the reasons why we want to focus more in Valves & Controls on the aftermarket value stream is so that we can be in a position to be that provider on valves because with the breadth of our product line, we – and with the service centers we have, we can be more aggressive as they make that next step and they haven't gotten to that next step yet.
Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks for the time.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey. Good morning.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Scott.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): This is more of a question for John. You guys are looking to do a lot in your footprint rationalization plans over the next several years. I was just wondering if you can kind of give us a little bit more on the metrics, the factories, distribution centers closed, things that are in process and what have you. I know you've said that you feel good on track there, but it's still early and – I was just wondering if you could share some more metrics with us.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. So, to put that in perspective right now, we have 29 factories in Valves & Controls, and we have announced the closure of maybe two to three, well it is three factories. I think we're focused right now on making sure that we've got good standard work and that we've got good documentation as Lean generally requires you to do, because moving these factories is not very easy. So, I don't think we're going to announce or discuss substantial factory reductions over the next several years. I think where the big opportunity is and where Dennis is focusing is, how do we improve the linearization within a quarter of how we're shipping, how do we reduce the inefficiencies, these are all great tools that, Lean brings that tool to the table. And I think as far as the distribution in the outside service centers, we have 43 independent service centers that aren't part of a current distribution center or a customer's factory. I think the customer is going to help define that for us over the next three to four years because it's moving in-house into their operations is where we see it going because eliminating that brick and mortar in between us and them seems to be where the industry is heading. So, I can't give you specifics, but I think there's opportunities in both of those areas. But I'd say on the factory side, I wouldn't expect very many closures in the next several years. I'd talked about optimization.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Right. Fair enough. My follow-up is about the Valves & Controls split of revenues where you guys are calling that business essentially half aftermarket and MRO, and every valves company has their fair share of standard products. So, it just seems like half of the business coming from the aftermarket just seems like a pretty high number because typically when a standard valve fails, the end users essentially cuts it out and throws it in the garbage. So I'm just kind of wondering, is it possible that there are some CapEx from your customers in your aftermarket?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Look. Yeah. Let me – aftermarket, short answer. It is aftermarket in standard product because you can't tell the difference particularly if it's sold in the U.S. it is heavy distribution. If you've got a standard keystone butterfly valve, and it's sitting in stock, if it's going in to a new installation or replacement, you can't tell the difference. But it's the same selling motion. So, to be precise, we put aftermarket and standard product together in the same selling motion because there's an urgency and an intimacy that you need with the customer in order to win. And we haven't had that clearer focus on it and that will help both the aftermarket, serviced valves and the standard replacement valves. Now when you get to engineered valve, it's closer to a project selling motion. So, we'll try to be more precise.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): That sounds much more specific. Thank you. Would you say the standard valve product which is essentially a cat backs item, is that maybe half of the MRO?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, it isn't always the CapEx, it's OpEx. The only difference between an operating expense dollar and a CapEx expense dollar is how the accounts treat it. And to me, it's money spent, and then different people control it. So you – I don't mean to be flip but the operating expenses to run a refinery, a petrochem plant, they're enormous. And a lot of it looks very much like – particularly in the standard valves side, it looks the same. So, I think a lot of people, including us, were surprised by how much the OpEx spending was impacted given that it was the CapEx that was intended to be cut, but it's a blunt weapon, and we all know all that from our own, when we have to crank down costs, it's cranking down costs. We don't differentiate when there's an urgency about it. And then we get better, right? We say we got to put more into the efficiency of the existing plants and we've already cut as many projects as we can. So – I don't mean to go down to, into the depths here but, that's all I got.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Thank you. I was just wondering, if you wouldn't mind, if I can just tack this one on. Could you tell us at all how April is looking outside of Valves & Controls?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: No, we don't do that.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I mean, it's all incorporated in our Q2 guide, Scott.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Fair enough. Thank you.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Nathan.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Nathan.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Let's start in Water Quality, some very nice margin expansion there. But, Randy, you also mentioned increased growth investments. Can you talk about the kind of investments that you're making there, and perhaps quantify the increased headwind. I know you're always making growth investments, but maybe the increased headwind to margins in the quarter?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. We talked a lot about investing in products which we're doing both in Residential Filtration, a lot in Food Service, which is a really attractive business, and in the pool side. But in addition to that, we're making investments on the sales coverage side on our Residential Filtration business. We moved Residential Filtration to Karl Frykman and his Water Quality team about 18 months ago. And what we want to do is we want to replicate what we've done in Pool in the Residential Filtration business. We're the largest maker of product and components for water treatment and water filtration in the world for residential. We are the largest. But we don't have the same kind of customer intimacy that we see that we have in the pool business that has turned into such a sweet business for us. We believe that Residential might have the same potential for us. So what Karl and his team has done is they're replicating the kind of coverage, direct dealer coverage on the other side of distribution in order to drive brand and drive product adoption and get customer intimacy and getting voice of customer back to our product. So, a lot of the investments are actually on the sales side and that's global and we're doing it in the United States. We're doing it in Europe and Canada. Less so, it's a different kind of coverage investment in the emerging markets. But I'm quite excited about the early returns on that. I don't think it's really affected our numbers yet, but it's given us great insight and I'm expecting great things.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And Nathan think about that as somewhere around $10 million to $12 million on an annualized basis.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: That's helpful. Thanks. Second one is on the Enclosures business. You talked about Industrial stabilizing, but there's also a bit with a couple mentions of some price pressure in Enclosures. Is that something you expect to continue as Industrial stabilizes, perhaps the pricing pressure eases, just how you're thinking about that?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. One of the things we're seeing is, we've been more aggressive on the Enclosure side of going back after what we would call modified standard product and there's a little more pricing pressure in that and that's what we're really seeing there. Plus there isn't a lot of commodity inflation, so there's not really a lot of price being passed on on the standard size. So, we're not assuming we're going to bounce back to getting 1 to 2 points of price, but we don't think it's a systemic issue.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: All right. Thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski from Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.
Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, guys.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Josh.
Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hey. Could you just update us, John, on what you're seeing on the price cost side and how we should think about your guys' purchase commitments or hedges and how those weigh out over the course of the year? I guess, Valves & Controls is its own animal so maybe the rest of the portfolio?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. So, I'll hit Valves first, we said we expected roughly 4 points of price for the year and that includes standard product which is not a lot of price and then margin compression coming from the project side and I would say that that's still the right forecast. I think we hoped that that would be a little bit conservative I think right now, that's playing out to be realistic. On the rest of the portfolio, very, very modest as far as what pricing we could get across the general portfolio, areas of two-step distribution we have normal price increases, we're seeing it. But for the most part, the low inflation on material, which are recognized as material productivity is leading to a more flattish pricing environment globally.
Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Is that – when is that gap largest just based on the timing of purchases as you see it today?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. I think you're seeing – in Q1, you see kind of by segment what the prices cause we break it out. And I think we expect that rate of price increases to be the – what we think for the rest of the year. But I think the inflation starts to become a little bit more on the raw material side as we move into Q3 and Q4. We're expecting some modest inflation the back half of the year, which then would lead to what does the pricing cycle look like for 2017.
Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Got you. And just to shift over to the Food and Bev comments – I don't remember if you guys mentioned this in the script or not, but the push outs there, are those are all getting made up in 2Q or will those filter in as we move through the balance of the year?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Balance of the year.
Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Got you. All right. Thanks, guys.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Drab with William Blair. Your line is open.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning. I just wanted to ask about the free...
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Brian.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning. Just wanted to ask about the free cash flow forecast. Having done about $635 million in 2015, you got the $100 million improvement in the first quarter of this year, and the target is $750 million. Just any thoughts regarding why we wouldn't see more significant year-over-year improvement as we move through the balance of 2016 given you're just – you're talking about these opportunities to further improve working capital as we move through the year.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I think the linearity of the cash flow, first of all, great Q1 and I think the linearity looks a lot like last year. The opportunity to do better than $750 million would be incremental working capital opportunities, and right now, although we're making progress, we're not confident enough yet to say that we're going to realize those in 2016. So, it is the opportunity and now we got to get after it and make it a realized benefit in 2016.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Got it. And then could you give an update on the geographic trends that you're seeing in Water Quality. I think it was on the outlook call in December that you talked about the different geographies. You mentioned in Europe, you were seeing some strengths, but that it might be fueled largely by restocking, do you have a better sense for how much restocking was driving that growth, and have you seen any improvement in China? And then also if you could just comment on what you're seeing in North America? Thanks.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I'll grab it really quickly. I mean, first of all, we did see a recovery in China in Q1. It was nice to see. So, we saw a recapture of our normal sort of double-digit growth rates in the China space. Europe is stable, modest growth, single-digit core growth in Europe. And we had strong shipments in North America in the Water Quality side. So, overall, I think the developed region's doing well in that space as you would expect and then doing pretty well and seeing some recovery in China as we add new distributors, and we work on different distribution channels.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: So, this wasn't just a blip in Europe, a positive blip with restocking you're seeing the continuation of that?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I mean, Water Quality globally is a pretty good market. And it's up more in North America. It's up modest in Europe.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Which is good.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Really great. Yeah.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Eighteen months ago (58:51).
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah. Thanks for taking my question.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Barry with Susquehanna. Your line is now open.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Hey, guys. Good morning.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hi, Barry.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: So, just kind of a big picture question on the margin outlook, it's staying the same even though you came in ahead on 1Q and raised the outlook for growth in the highest-margin segment. I'd think FX would probably also be maybe a little less of a headwind. Is it that all just the kind of slight tweak to the Tech Solutions outlook, or is there anything else going on there?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. It's pretty much just Tech Solutions. And we feel good about the first quarter, it's kicked off the year well, but we're still pointing at the same commitments we made. Second quarter, we're focused on right now.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Got you. Okay. And then in FFS, just to follow up on some of the questions about the shortfall there, is that delta between the down 2% that you did and the guided 4%, is that all in the Beverage shipments or is there anything else going on in there?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Irrigation was a little worse. I would – I almost going call it like – I think we whiffed that one, I think – before we got the plans finalized, we came out with a 4% organic growth in Q1. If we take a look at 2% for the year, just put that one on me, I don't think we had ever an expectation to deliver 4%, but we apologized and we said it would be up 4%.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So, I think we start to think the municipal ramp and all the contribution in the back half of the year. And so, we think we ramp our organic core growth as the year goes along and...
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Got you. Could you actually just shed a little light on what's going on in muni? It does sound like that's an end market that's been building momentum. It sounds like it was pretty good in the quarter.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. I think the break and fixes are starting to accelerate, and we're starting to see municipalities start to let some of those projects – and obviously not large ones, but we're seeing a market that's starting to grow 3% or 4% on a more sustained basis.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Got you.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And globally it's still a good market as well.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Got you. And the recovery in the beverage piece in FFS, is that all in the backlog? It's just timing or...
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes. Yes, it is.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Got you.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Actually, they built backlog. We had a good orders quarter. So, there's still – we have a lot of newer technologies that are being applied, but it's just in a sense lumpy in terms of when they get shipped.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Got you. And as those projects come on in Food & Bev, is that mix positive or negative?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: It's slightly negative. I mean we're putting a project in. We wait for the aftermarket to pick-up on the better margin rate.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Got you. Thank you.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Rose with Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Good morning. Thank you for taking my call. Just a quick housekeeping. Can you highlight some of the biggest changes in the accruals for the quarter, and how they stack up against fourth quarter comparisons or back half-of-the-year comparisons?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: What do you mean by accruals?
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Well, are there any compensation accruals or any other accruals that might change the comparisons this year versus last year in Q1 and then in the back half of the year? Just something that we should be watching?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. The only one of note would be the incentive accrual or the compensation accruals in Q1 are generally different this year as we look at the vesting periods of directors and officers and so you can kind of see that if you take a look at a full year of 90 and roughly 30 in Q1. The rest of the quarters looks a lot more like last year from a seasonality standpoint, a little bit of a benefit in Q2.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you. And then last, if I may, were there any particular variances, V&C was spot on but within the different segments, was there anything that stood out from forecast as it relates to labor and materials or productivity within the either different segments?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: No.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: One more?
Operator: Your next question comes from Joe Giordano from Cowen. Your line is open.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. You mentioned desal in industrial water reuse in your prepared remarks. And I am trying to remember, I don't think we've talked too much about that on calls in the recent past. So what are you seeing there?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: We haven't talked much about it because it's been kind of dead.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yeah. Yeah.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I mean, we're a large supplier of subsystems for desalination projects and they, after the financial crisis, they kind of went all soft around the world. And they're getting let loose. We have some in Eastern Europe. We have some in the Middle East. And some on the industrial water reuse side, where everything is distressed, industrials don't vote, so they get curtailed on the water faster than anything and they're the ones that will be the early adopters of water reuse technologies which we have a number of different technologies applicable there. That's what we're talking about. And it's been a focus of ours. We've been trying to get more focus there. (1:04:41)
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Can you maybe scale that for us? Like how big was that at its peak for you? And where is that today, those two, like maybe those two businesses in terms of just overall size?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Probably $100-ish million and it's probably in the $20-ish million in the quarter.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Is that in the quarter or...
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: No. It's probably – yeah, it's roughly just less than $20 million on a quarterly basis and the $100 million is some was annual. So, we're down 20% from peak.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, okay. And then just last from me. Can you talk about the magnitude of the price pressure on the Aftermarket you've seen in V&C just on that piece of the business?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: On the standard MRO side, it's not significant on a product versus a product basis. We are seeing a mix issue in the sense that the larger markets, North America and Europe, we're down substantially in the quarter and we saw some, the fast growth markets actually pick up on the Aftermarket side and the margins are slightly lower. But on a like-to-like product, roughly, around 1% to 1.5% is all we are seeing on the pricing at the moment.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Perfect. Thanks, guys.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: All right. Thank you.
Jim Lucas - Vice President-Investor Relations: All right. Steve, thanks.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Jordan, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Pentair Q4 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Jim Lucas, you may begin your conference.
Jim Lucas - Vice President-Investor Relations and Strategy: Thanks, Jordan, and welcome to Pentair's fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call. We're glad you can join us today. I'm Jim Lucas, Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Planning. With me today is Randy Hogan, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and John Stauch, our Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, we will provide details on our fourth quarter 2015 performance, as well as our first quarter and full year 2016 outlook as outlined in this morning's release. Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as the risks outlined in Pentair's most recent 10-K and today's release. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today, and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results. Today's webcast is accompanied by a presentation, which could be found in the Investor section of Pentair's website. We will reference these sides throughout our prepared remarks. Any references to non-GAAP financials are reconciled in the appendix of the presentation. We will be sure to reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. I would like to request that you limit your questions to one and a follow-up and get back in the queue for further questions in order to ensure everyone has an opportunity to ask their questions. I will now turn the call over to Randy.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with the executive summary on page four. There's no doubt that 2015 was a challenging year for Pentair and most other industrial companies. But we were encouraged that our fourth quarter results met our expectations operationally. Overall, earnings came in higher than forecast due to a better ongoing tax rate. And our ability to forecast sales demonstrates that the quarter-to-quarter volatility in some of our served markets may finally be showing signs of stabilizing. While our businesses serving the Energy and Industrial markets will likely face continued challenges in 2016, the two bright spots in 2015, Food & Beverages and Residential & Commercial, appear to still have more upside. In addition, we've finally seen signs of stabilizations and some green shoots of growth within our smallest vertical, Infrastructure. We understand why Valves & Controls has been the focus of many of our investors as our efforts to right-size the business in the face of this significant energy – in the significant energy industry reset remains a big priority. While we're now seeing sales and orders in Valves & Controls meet our forecast for the second consecutive quarter, gross margins remain under pressure due to project pricing and mix. Our acquisition of ERICO, completed at the end of the third quarter, is delivering what we expected and the integration is well underway. Cash flow, which has historically been a hallmark for Pentair, did come in slightly short of our forecast as we had foreshadowed on our outlook call last December. This is due exclusively to working capital timing and we're fully committed to demonstrating our cash flow prowess in 2016, expecting greater than 100% adjusted net income conversion as we double down on working capital, following the dramatic top line challenges faced in 2015, principally within Valves & Controls. We're maintaining our 2016 full year adjusted EPS guidance of $4.05 per share to $4.25 per share. We made good progress on further reducing the tax rate as demonstrated in the fourth quarter. While this improved tax rate will add just under a dime compared to our prior forecast, we've lowered our Valves & Controls forecast by a similar amount given the degree of margin compression the business has faced due to project pricing and uncertainty around the timing of the recovery in the short-cycle business, which slowed in 2015. Overall, we're pleased to have met our fourth quarter expectations and our 2016 outlook remains intact. Now let's turn to slide five for discussion of our Q4 2015 results. Fourth quarter core sales declined 4%, which was a modest improvement from the 5% decline in the third quarter. Valves & Controls was slightly better than our sales forecast, and the rate of decline is stabilized in the mid-teens. Water Quality Systems delivered strong 7% core growth. Technical Solutions' core sales were flat and Flow & Filtration Solutions showed further signs of stabilization on the top line. Overall, FX remained a headwind in the quarter, and ERICO contributed positively and in line with our commitments. Segment income declined 7% and margins were down 90 basis points to 15.9%. As expected, Valves & Controls was the major contributor to the margin contraction, while Water Quality Systems had a very strong margin quarter. Flow & Filtration Solutions had another quarter of margin expansion, which is why we believe this segment is well positioned for further gains in 2016. Due to end-of-the-year tax adjustments, the tax rate in the quarter was favorable and our full year rate finished just north of 21%. We believe this is an ongoing rate and expect further improvements to the tax rate in 2016. Free cash flow ended the year at $643 million, which was short of our $700 million forecast. As mentioned, free cash flow has been impacted by working capital timing due to the top-line softness we've experienced so quickly, but we expect the free cash flow to return to greater than 100% of adjusted net income in 2016. Now, let's turn to slide six to discuss Pentair's Q4 2015 performance elements. Our performance by vertical was similar to the third quarter with solid gains in Residential & Commercial and Food & Beverage being offset by ongoing pressures in both Energy and Industrial. Encouragingly, infrastructure was flat in the quarter and continued to show signs of stabilization and potential return to growth in 2016. As you can see on the right-hand side of the page, we had another solid quarter of productivity, and with price, they more than offset inflation. Our cost-out actions in Valves & Controls continued through 2015, and we still expect over $135 million in savings to read out in 2016. Negative mix impacted both Valves & Controls and Technical Solutions. But our other two segments, Flow & Filtration Solutions and Water Quality Systems, delivered improved margins. Now let's turn to slide seven for a review of Valves & Controls. For the fourth quarter, Valves & Controls' core sales declined 15% which was a point better than our forecast, an improvement from the 18% core decline experienced in the third quarter. FX remained a considerable headwind at 7%. Backlog was down 4% which includes the negative FX translation. Core orders declined 15% which is consistent with the double-digit rate of decline the business experienced throughout the year. Core sales declined in three of the four sub-verticals served by Valves & Controls as mining showed growth in the quarter on the result of one project shipping. We continue to see weakness in our short-cycle business as many of our customers have cut their operational budgets in addition to their capital budgets including scaling back maintenance turnarounds. We do not expect this trend to reverse in the first quarter, but we remain optimistic that customers will begin spending more in maintenance as 2006 (sic) [2016] (7:31) progresses. As we indicated last quarter, we've seen a trend of customers delaying shipment, but there are few order cancelations at the current time. The right half of the page shows fourth quarter Valves & Controls segment income and margins. While we continue to drive productivity, which offset inflation, it was not nearly enough to overcome the dramatic top-line drop experienced during the quarter and the year. We've aggressively been rightsizing the cost structure, but it does take time for the benefits from those actions to read out. In addition, we've seen higher-than-normal margin compression due to pricing pressure within the project business. Mix has also been a headwind to margins as the higher-margin short-cycle business has remained under pressure. Now let's turn to slide eight for a look at the Valves & Controls backlog. As you can see on slide eight, Valves & Controls' backlog is broken down into four key sub-verticals, three of which fall into our Energy vertical, oil & gas, power, and mining. And one, in our Industrial vertical, which is the process business. Orders declined in all four of our sub-verticals, with oil & gas the only business to not decline double-digits. As 2015 progressed, we saw customers continue to curtail spending as they assessed their long-term plans and adjusted to the new reality of lower oil prices. Many expected oil and gas to feel the pressure, but delays in project timing have extended to other areas like LNG and petrochem. As stated previously, it has not just been projects that have been delayed or cut. It's clear the customers have been delaying maintenance spending as well. It's still too early to call a bottom. We're encouraged at orders and (9:06) forecast for the second consecutive quarter. It's uncertain when the short-cycle business will return, but maintenance cannot be deferred forever, and we're watching for some signs of improvement beginning in the second quarter this year. Now, let's move to slide nine to discuss the Q4 performance of Flow & Filtration Solutions. Flow & Filtration Solutions had an 8% top-line decline with core sales down 2% and foreign exchange translation, a 6% headwind. The fourth quarter showed signs of stabilization for this segment, and we continue to expect the business to return to growth in 2016. We did see all four serve verticals contract in the quarter. Food & Beverage was down as growth in our Beverage business was not enough to offset the ongoing headwinds within agriculture. We would note that our sales decline in our agriculture-related businesses was not as bad as the overall industry. Residential & Commercial was down due to product line exits we made to better position the business longer term. While Infrastructure overall was down, this was the result of a tough comparison last year when we had a large filtration project shift. We were encouraged to see further improvement in the trends within our North American municipal pump business. Segment income was down modestly, but margins expanded 40 basis points to 11.3%. This marks the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin expansion and believe it is a positive sign that the actions taken in 2015 positioned the segment for further gains in 2016 and beyond. Now let's move to slide 10 for a look at Water Quality Systems. We believe that the slower top-line growth seen in the third quarter was an anomaly and the fourth quarter growth performance was validation that Water Quality Systems remains on a positive track. During the quarter, sales grew 4% which consisted of 7% core sales growth offset by a 3% FX headwind. Both Residential & Commercial and Food & Beverage grew at high-single-digit rates in the quarter. Our aquatics business led the way once again in pre-buy activity as a good foretoken that 2016 should be another good year for aquatics. Our water purification business saw favorable growth in Europe but China remained weak as distributors exhibited caution in their order patterns. Food service had another solid quarter and saw growth return in China after a pause in the third quarter. Segment income grew 30% and margins expanded an impressive 450 basis points to 22.3%. This dramatic improvement was a combination of strong productivity execution and positive mix on top of an easier comparison against last year's fourth quarter results. Water Quality Systems has proven to be a consistently high performer, and we remain committed to getting all of our businesses to the same level of performance. Now let's move to slide 11 for a look at how Technical Solutions performed in Q4. Technical Solutions reported 23% growth for the quarter, which consisted of flat core sales, a 6% headwind from FX, and a 29% positive contribution from ERICO. Industrial sales were down 2% overall as we saw further caution exercised by North American electrical distributors, offset partially by our ,industrial heat tracing business. Energy was down 3% after growth the past few quarters, as a couple of larger heat tracing projects began to wind down. Infrastructure saw modest 2% growth following tough year-over-year comparison for the past two quarters. Residential & Commercial showed strong 7% core growth in the quarter, and ERICO, which generates a large portion of its sales from commercial, tracked with our expectations. Segment income grew 17%, while operating margins contracted 130 basis points to a still-strong 22.6%. Principal factor contributing to the margin performance in the fourth quarter was more project shipments than product shipments within industrial heat tracing, and the margin differential between them created a negative mix impact. ERICO met our income expectations, including synergies. While 2016 will see headwinds with the absence of two energy projects and expected first half softness continuing in the short-cycle industrial business, we remain focused on driving productivity and have taken further cost actions to deliver in this typically high-performing segment. Let's now turn to slide 12 for a look at our full year Pentair results. For the full year 2015, our core sales declined 4%, as performance in Water Quality Systems and Technical Solutions was not enough to offset significant challenges faced by Valves & Controls served markets. Segment income declined 12%, and margins contracted 60 basis points to 15.5%. Our tax rate ended the year at just over 21%, which was better than the 23% we projected at the beginning of the year. We believe this improved tax rate is sustainable, and would expect further improvement in reducing the tax rate in 2016. We're not pleased with our free cash flow performance of $643 million, which represented only 90% of adjusted net income, but we know this is due fully to working capital timing, and remain committed to correct it in 2016. Overall, 2015 was a challenging year where we saw two of our segments deliver strong performance, one segment stabilize, and we're addressing the reality of the other segment. Now let's turn to slide 13, to the 2016 outlook assumptions. Before I turn the call over to John to provide additional insight on Valves & Controls and to discuss our first quarter and 2016 outlook, I wanted to update you on what has changed since we issued our initial 2016 outlook in mid-December. As you can see on this slide, the majority of our key assumptions remain unchanged. We continue to expect solid performance from our businesses serving Residential & Commercial and Food & Beverage. We've seen signs of stabilization within Infrastructure. Industrial is expected to continue to have a challenging first half of the year, but comparisons become less difficult in the second half, and we're encouraged that distributors may begin ordering once again in the back half of the year. Foreign exchange has been tracking to where we plan. We all know that this can change at any time. The one area that has worsened is Energy, particularly the further decline seen in the price of oil. We've seen several major energy companies announce capital expenditure plans that call for additional 20%-plus cuts following similar reductions in 2015. Further, the delays in the short-cycle business give us pause. Don't expect any signs of improvement in the first quarter, and we'll watch the second quarter trends closely to see if customers stop deferring their maintenance spending. The other bright spot we have is the improvement in our tax rate. This added structural improvement provides an offset to the further weakening in Energy and gives us increased confidence in maintaining our full year guidance. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Randy. Please turn to slide number 14, titled V&C update. We thought it would be helpful to provide an update on our Valves & Controls business and the further deteriorating conditions in its space since issuing our initial 2006 (sic) [2016] (16:18) guidance last December. We continue to see pressure on incoming orders, and now expect orders to be down as much as 5% for the full year of 2016. The well-publicized decline in oil prices is just one of the factors that leads us to remain cautious about the timing of order stabilization. But even more, we are watching the short-cycle business for signs that customers will begin to accelerate maintenance spending. As a result, we have modestly lowered our full year revenue forecast for 2016. We continue to see pricing pressure on the project side of the business, and this shows up as margin compression. While we have aggressively implemented cost-out actions, we expect industry uncertainty to persist, and we plan to remove additional cost from the business. When forecasting where we see sales and orders, coupled with further anticipated margin compression, we now are forecasting return on sales in Valves & Controls to be 100 basis points lower than our original forecast, at 10.5%. Please turn to slide number 15, labeled Non-Cash Goodwill Impairment. We performed step one of our goodwill impairment analysis as required by the accounting rules, and concluded that the fair value of Valves & Controls is below its carrying value. The carrying value was determined when we completed the Flow Control merger in 2012, when oil was over $100 that year. Since 2012, the energy industry has reset significantly, and uncertainty remains around the timing of any recovery. We are finalizing the analysis, but we currently estimate there'll be a non-cash impairment charge in the range of $400 million to $600 million, to be recorded at the time that our 10-K is published. Please turn to slide number 16, labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. Our balance sheet changed significantly with the closing of the ERICO acquisition. We added the – ended the year with $4.6 billion of net debt inclusive of cash on hand. While our balance sheet leverage at 3.75 times is higher than our targeted 2.5 times leverage ratio, we expect to bring that leverage ratio to around 3.3 times by the end of 2016. Our ROIC ended the quarter at 9.9% as our operating income came under pressure with the top-line challenges experienced within our Valves & Controls segment. Although free cash flow ended the year at roughly 90% of adjusted net income, this was due exclusively to working capital timing and we expect a 100% conversion rate in 2016. Please turn to slide number 17 labeled Q1 2016 Pentair Outlook. For the first quarter, we expect core sale to be up a modest 1% and total sales to grow 7% inclusive of FX headwinds in the ERICO acquisition. On a core sales basis, we expect Valves & Controls to be down roughly 7% which is a slower rate of decline than we experienced throughout 2015. Flow & Filtration Systems (sic) [Solutions'] (19:09) core sales are expected to be up 4% on an easier year-over-year comparison and project shipment timing. Water Quality Systems' core sales are anticipated to increase approximately 5% on continued strength in aquatics. Finally, Technical Solutions' core sales are expected to be up 4% as industrial heat tracing and electronics help to offset ongoing sluggishness and closures. We have not made any changes to our ERICO forecast or expectations our synergies. We're expecting segment income to decrease modestly and return on sales to contract 110 basis points. Below the operating line, we expect an improved tax rate of around 20.5%, net interest and other around $33 million, and the share count around 183 million. Our first quarter adjusted EPS guidance is $0.70 to $0.72, which is roughly a 7% year-over-year decline. We expect historically typical free cash flow usage in the first quarter, but turning positive as the year progresses as we continue to focus on improving our working capital performance. Please turn to slide number 18 labeled Full Year 2016 Pentair Outlook. We are maintaining our full year adjusted EPS outlook of $4.05 to $4.25, although the components have changed some from our initial outlook provided in December. For the full year, we expect core sales to decline approximately 2%. Valves & Controls' core sales are now anticipated to be down 8%, which is 3 points worse than our original forecast, as I highlighted few slides ago. We now expect Flow & Filtration core sales to be up modestly for the full year. Water Quality Systems' core sales are anticipated to grow approximately 4%, and Technical Solutions' core sales are expected to decline 4% for the full year. We expect segment income to be up 9% and return on sales to expand 100 basis points to 16.5% with three of our four segments delivering full year margin expansion. We expect overall corporate costs to be approximately $90 million; net interest and other to be around $135 million; our full year tax rate to be around 20.5%, and the share count for the full year to be around 183 million. Adjusted EPS is expected to be up 5% at the midpoint of the range. Finally, we expect a strong year of free cash flow, expected to be approximately 100% of adjusted net income with our working capital opportunities providing potential upside. Jordan, can you please open the line for questions? Thank you.
Operator: Our first question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Morning, Nigel.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I'm sure there's going to be plenty of Valves & Controls questions but I just wanted to switch to the other segments. And you've raised organic outlook by about 1 point across the board and you called out Infrastructure looks a bit better in 2016 then perhaps back in December. So maybe just comment on what you're seeing in Infrastructure that makes you feel more confident. And perhaps within TS, given the midstream CapEx outlooks getting cut, what gives you confidence that that would be better than back in December?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, infrastructure is looking better but also aquatics is looking better. The Water Quality Systems, aquatics is the pool business and it exited the year with a really good tailwind. But in terms of Infrastructure, we've seen the order rate pick up and our backlog pick up in both pumps and in filtration. So it's been a while building and we expect that to actually lift growth for mostly Flow & Fluid (sic) [Filtration] (23:00) Solutions next year.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then...
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: (23:05)
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And then within TS, Randy what gives you more confidence there?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: (23:14) question.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Nigel, what gives us a little more confidence in Technical Solutions...
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Oh, Technical Solutions.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: We' were waiting to see where ended the year with the backlog in the industrial heat tracing solutions business primarily around the projects. And it ended stronger, and therefore, the shippable backlog heading into 2016 was slightly higher and that was the (23:31).
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. I see. Okay. I'll leave it there. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC. Your line is open.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Morning, Deane.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey, wanted to touch on Valves & Controls first and maybe you can update us on what the 2016 customer CapEx decline assumptions that you're making. We know with since December oil has worsened and you cited customers' CapEx plan at 20% plus down. But how are you thinking broadly if you divide that up between upstream, midstream, downstream?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, I'd say first and foremost, I don't think we see a lot of upstream activity and a lot of these projects were in the process of being cut throughout the year, Deane. So, we look at front log which is the things prior to coming into the quote funnel. So, what are the opportunities we might be quoting in any given year? And that front log this year is significantly low as it relates to upstream activity. When we get into midstream, midstream still has a fair amount of the front log activity and we are still quoting a significant amount of midstream activity. And then the downstream business, we would've expected that to be a productivity-based investment. And we've seen delays in the quoting activity there. So, we've got an order outlook next year as we suggested that's down further than what we anticipated. And then we expect the conversion ratio of how many of those orders that we convert within the year to be down further. And hence, that's why we've taken down the Valves & Controls forecast even further.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yeah. What I'm actually looking for is your broad market assumption about how much will your customer CapEx declines be in 2016? So, we've seen estimates as high as down 35% in the upstream side. So, I just wanted to know, what assumptions are you making for your customers on their CapEx plans for 2016?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. If I could – Deane, we haven't in the past shown a really good relationship between the CapEx numbers of the – the big CapEx numbers and then what really happens to our orders numbers. We've had – obviously, we've gotten better at forecasting our sales. What we focus on is what John called that front log. We've seen a lot of projects that were being thought of that are no longer in that front log, or things that we're chasing. So, we're focusing on what's in our backlog and what we can ship and what is in that – what real projects are in that front log, and what's our probability of getting them. And that's how we come to it.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. That's fair. And then, just on the pricing side, you called out pricing pressures on projects. We've seen that now for a year and half. Maybe you can give us some sense of how much pricing is down, size that. And then, we've started to see pricing pressure on the short cycle. Look, everyone's seeing this maintenance deferral. We're seeing that sector-wide, but give us a sense of what that's impacting on pricing on short cycle as well.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. So, the short-cycle pricing, Deane, is called out on our Valves & Controls walk because we list prices part number to part number and, therefore, the standard product is a light product. And so, you get a sense of where that price is. And right now, that's roughly around 1% today. We're anticipating that to get a little bit tougher as we head into 2016. The majority of what we call margin pressure is around the project side and the fact that the projects are coming through at a slightly lower margin. But we're also experiencing a mix differential between less standard product on the short cycle and more of the projects coming out of the backlog, and that caught us by surprise in Q4, especially around December, and we've loaded in those expectations continuing into Q1 and ramping a little bit better as we get the cost benefits reading out in Q2, Q3 and Q4 from our efforts.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it. And just last question for me. On the free cash flow, you talked about this in December, so it's not a surprise that you came up short on the 2015 target. But just to clarify, was there any extension of payment terms for customers at year-end? We saw this in some of the other flow names that, to help customers at year-end. Was that a factor in this? And then real specifically, when do you expect to recoup those receivables?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: The short answer is no to the first question, Deane. It's not something that we've done or needed to do. And as we think about recovering this year, we felt like we had realized the impact of the working capital builds right when I took over in the interim role and we've been after reducing those inventory levels and therefore getting after those receivable collections. So, we're very focused on getting the cash in here in Q1 and Q2. And we feel like we're going to make very good progress.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: That's good to hear. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: That chart that you guys gave, I think slide number 10 from your Investor Day where you talked about Valves & Controls' backlog and orders. First of all, the scheduled backlog of $990 million, is that still intact or has there been some movement in that? And also, how do I reconcile the orders down 8% in that slide and the orders of flat to down 5%? Is that just short-cycle orders you're talking about?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So, real quickly, we're down about $40 million to $50 million on the starting backlog position, Steve.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And that would represent movements out of 2016 into 2017, and that's what we know of today.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: The orders on the slides are still the same number. I apologize. One's core and one's inclusive of FX so roughly the same.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And what we're having a little bit of change to our forecast on is we usually convert about half of those orders within a year, but we're expecting the orders to be a little bit more back-end loaded and therefore, we won't be getting as many of the orders shipped in 2016 as we originally anticipated.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then the start to the year in Valves & Controls, this 6.5% margin, I don't recall it being that seasonal historically. Is there something, I guess, just it's a function of the timing of the cost-saves ramping throughout the course of the year. Anything unusual here in the first quarter to have that – and that's kind of an unusually low-margin rate.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. I think there's three things, Steve. One is we have an unusually low shipment number of 385, and we haven't been below 400 in this business in some time, and that reflects the shippable backlog. But it also reflects the number two issue which is we're expecting the standard product to be slow again in Q1 as we wait for our customers to get their expense budgets aligned and decide where they're going to spend the expense and maintenance dollars, so we have a low mix ratio related to that and also a lower expectation. And then the third element is exactly what you said. We've recognized about $11 million to $12 million on a quarterly basis with a cost takeout of $150 million and that ramps throughout the year. And the first quarter reflects what we have to do with the inventory accounting and putting that into the inventory and then shipping the old inventory first, before we can recognize the benefits. So, those are the three unusual aspects to Q1.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. One last quick one. You mentioned weakness in LNG. I know it's kind of a slow-moving train here over the course of the next couple years, and should roll down dramatically toward the end of the decade. I guess, are you surprised at how early you're seeing some weakness there? Is that just – are they cancelling some projects? Is there a destocking going on there? I know that some of the compression orders at others have been very, very weak on that front. I'm just trying to kind of understand the timing, because...
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: (31:43)
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah. Just on the timing of the LNG stuff. What you're seeing there.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Our view is ultimately, LNG is going to play a bigger role in the energy mix worldwide and the U.S. will be, and should be, a net exporter. There were a lot of projects in pre-feed, in planning. They've all been pretty much put on the shelves, and some of the other ones that actually were in design have been slowed down. So that was the reference that we're talking about. Because what we're really looking at, things we were expecting to be happening in the near term versus – they may still happen, but they may be two or three years out now instead of 2016, 2017.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Right.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I think we were hinting at Analyst Day that, although people were bullish about that activity because of low feedstocks, you got to look at global demand. And the global demand just isn't there at the rate that would support all of those projects coming through. So, I guess to answer your question, are we surprised in this whole energy reset aspect? No, we're not surprised.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: No, no. I get that. I'm just trying to get an idea. I think LNG is going to be kind of a debacle at some point in the next couple years. But I guess the timing is kind of hard to nail down, just because of how big these projects are and the multi-year nature of them. So I'm just more of a timing question than anything else. Thanks, guys.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Your line is open.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks and good morning, all.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hey Steve.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Morning.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, can you maybe comment on Resi & Commercial construction a little bit further? It sounded like you're still bullish here, but maybe a little more of what you're seeing out there and the kind of rate of deceleration, or a finer point on what actual growth do you expect in that vertical this year?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I mean, this year, we're expecting mid-single digits in the U.S. And actually, we've seen some life in Europe as well. We actually saw some growth in the fourth quarter in Water Quality, and a little bit in the aquatics business – excuse me, in the water purification part of Water Quality, both of those both being Water Quality Systems. So, stronger Europe than last year and continuing strength in the U.S. Multi-family and then continuing, as home prices increase, the pool business is back. And the innovation and the switch to energy-saving products and more sustainable products are still – that conversion is still happening ,and we're the leader in that. So, all of the things that's been working for us in aquatics are still working.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Do you think there's upside to the $0.40 number from ERICO then?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: You know what? I want to get that $0.40 number, and then we'll talk. But I was pleased with the fourth quarter, and the order rate, the execution rate. And there's some clear sales synergies that we weren't counting on, that are being worked, that I'm hopeful we'll see read out, even this year.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And, Steve, I would just add on that we're really impressed with the talent that we got with ERICO. It's a great sales and marketing capability, and really excited about the opportunities across the channels that their selling team and our selling team combined can bring to bear.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And just one more comment on, or question on impairment, the non-cash goodwill. The $400 million to $600 million impairment, what's your sense that this is kind of the last impairment that we'll see here?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I think the goal of any impairment is that it should be the last that you see.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yeah. But I guess, when you were quantifying this in the first level, were you taking a look at – were you assuming that the energy headwinds would sort of tail off and come back by 2017? Is that kind of embedded in the valuation?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: No.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: No.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: No. If that were the case, there wouldn't be one.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. All right. Thanks.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Morning.
Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So maybe going back to Steve's question earlier around the V&C margin ramp post 1Q. It looks like you guys stepped up your cost-outs to $150 million. Should we be thinking about the benefits coming through in a linear fashion, starting in 2Q? Or is there a ramp as the year progresses?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: There's a ramp when we – as we progress. I mean, we hit a full annual rate right around Q3. And it really is more about the manufacturing cost-out having to work its way through the inventory side. The benefits on the selling and marketing and the benefits on the G&A are linear, and we've got most of those behind us. And so those are going to be experienced in Q1, Q2 and Q3 and Q4 pretty evenly. And the manufacturing side has to work its way through the inventory, and we have to move the old inventory out first. And we don't have the quickest inventory turns in this business, so that's why it takes till the end of Q2 to really get on a full run rate for Q3 and Q4.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: We also believe the mix between short cycle and projects – short cycle, and then aftermarket and projects, is going to improve.
Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Got it. And maybe – and Randy, if for some reason it doesn't improve, and especially in V&C, if the orders turn out to be worse than flat to down 5%, are there other areas within the cost structure that you guys can continue to take cost-outs? Or are we getting closer to the maximum amount that you could actually take out before you start to impact any service levels?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I never like to say never, but I think we'd have to think differently about – I mean, the team there has done a heroic job of adjusting the cost structure to one of the most precipitous drops in sales that I've ever seen. And they're executing well. We're going to have to think about it more creatively if we need to do anything else in terms of costs. I mean, it's just conjecture at this point.
Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I think as a forecast that John showed you is one – and I understand, first quarter is lower than was expected. But it really is that mix and it's the cost readout in the overall volume level, as John said.
Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: There hasn't been a shipment volume below $400 million in our records.
Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah. We didn't have it in our numbers either. And maybe one broader question on just Valves & Controls, and as you kind of think about the portfolio longer term. Clearly, when you bought this asset back in 2012, it turned out to be a lot more cyclical than you guys initially anticipated. How do you guys think about the long-term opportunity for Valves & Controls within this portfolio? And is there an opportunity to maybe think about whether Valves & Controls should actually even be part of the broader portfolio?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: It may be hard for people to believe but we still believe this Valves & Controls business is a high-quality business with good people, and a lot of the product lines are real crown jewels. Not all of them, but a lot of them are. Right now, it certainly is a boat anchor to the rest of the business which is rising. And so, we want to correct that. And we wanted this diversity, this exposure to energy. I would say this is much more than just a cyclical turn. There hasn't been anything as deep as this since the 1980s. And so, I think it's too early to conjecture.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. I think either way, I mean what Randy's asked me to do is think about this business being much more – how do we think about it as more predictable, consistent earnings stream, meaning a lot less project dependent and a lot more aftermarket installed-base dependent. And then, making sure we understand what our customers value of what we sell and what they don't value of what we sell. And then, thinking about the fact that when you lose this amount of revenue, what's more important is your income and your margin dollars as you think forward. So, either way, we've got to make this a really good business, and I think we have the opportunity to take what Randy's direction is and have it contribute value in the future.
Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Your line is open.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Morning, guys.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hey, Shannon.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Shannon.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Hey. In terms of this watching the short cycle in Valves & Controls and the maintenance spending, there's been the view from you guys and others that you can't defer maintenance forever and this should come back. But we're probably a few quarters past where a lot of people thought it would have started to come back already. So, do you have any more visibility into, could this really continue to get pushed? Are people finding other ways to actually operate without doing the typical maintenance just because – go ahead.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: We have real examples of people servicing a valve instead of what they would have replaced before. In-sourcing service to keep their people busy, if they have them, versus where they would have usually contracted it. That sorts itself out. It laps itself. But we saw it was worse in the second half than the first half, and it was worse in the fourth quarter than the average of the second half. And that can't continue. These are a lot – these are mission critical products that are part of processes that are precision and can be – well, by law, they have to be serviced. And so, they can't do it forever. I mean, right now, as I think you know, crack spreads have been great. So, the longer you can run a refinery, the better. But ultimately, you have to maintain them. So, that's the other thing, those two things. One is a shift to lower-cost ways of servicing and then there's the fact that if they can run them a little bit harder when the crack spreads are high, they make money on the refining side.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. And then similar question on the Industrial side. As you look at Hoffman, anything changing there on the margin? Do you think we've worked our way through any more of the destocking dynamic or just general malaise? Anything in the market there that you think things changing?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Our assumption for the first quarter and the first half is that it's going to be like it was in the fourth quarter. And in terms, if you just look at the stocking in North America distribution, in the fourth quarter, it was down. I think the whole uncertainty around CapEx is distributors always freeze a little bit more. And so, I think we aren't seeing anything for this first half. It's different than the fourth quarter, but the fourth quarter wasn't good.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Robert Baird. Your line is open.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hello, Mike.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Mike?
Jim Lucas - Vice President-Investor Relations and Strategy: Mike?
Operator: Mike, your line is open.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Mike?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I guess he ...
Jim Lucas - Vice President-Investor Relations and Strategy: I guess we'll go to the next one.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, go to the next one.
Operator: Your next question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Your line is open.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, Randy, John, Jim.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Morning.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hey.
Jim Lucas - Vice President-Investor Relations and Strategy: Hey, Nathan.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: If I could just look at the mix issue that you're talking about, Randy, I understand that short-cycle orders or probably short-cycle revenues drop off before project revenues do, but I'm (44:34) that eventually, project revenues will decline more than the short-cycle revenues, and you will actually flip that mix from being a headwind to a tailwind. Can you talk about how that progresses through the year or into next year and what kind of impact you'd expect that to have on margins as we progress through that mix shift?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. You got to look at it business by business. In Valves & Controls, actually, the short cycle held up much better than projects. And it was really in the fourth quarter where the decline was about the same. So, we would expect that to – we don't think it gets better in the first quarter. That's why I was saying that we're watching to see whether there's improvements and we're certainly taking actions to help improve that in Valves & Controls. In the case of Technical Solutions where we have the industrial heat trace projects, which a lot of them are not oil and gas related. There are other industries. And the backlog is good there. There is the Hoffman business being down versus those projects. That gets better in the second half because, just by comparison. Because Hoffman was down in the second half and we don't think it's – as we get to lapping that, we don't think we'll see further down. So, there should be a mix improvement in Technical Solutions in the second half.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: But Nathan, I think you're right long-term, is that as you work the backlog off and you work the large projects off, those do have a lower margin and mix overall. Over time, should be a mix benefit. Now that being said, as Randy was just saying, we ship about $900 million of short-cycle. So, it would take a lot of incremental short-cycle sales to make up for the project sales that are declining. So – and we've got to fill the factories as well, as you know, and work our way through this, so. I think it's a short-term issue on the mix challenges and I think the business will sort its way out. And I think there's still productivity opportunities and I think it's into 2017 before we see that turning favorable.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Is it possible to quantify what the positive mix impact will be or what the negative one has been thus far?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, we did give a hint that the negative one so far, which is total standard margin, has come down about 600 basis points over the last two years.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And you did make a positive comment on the North American municipal pump business. Can you give me some more color on what that's up, how it's progressing, what your expectations are for 2016 and beyond?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I did make – I think I may have a positive comment about that. No, the order rate has picked up and so that's gone into the backlog. So, we're expecting improvement. We saw improvement in the fourth quarter. And after – it was down in the first half, flat in the third quarter, up in the fourth quarter. The backlog is good. I think as governments healed a little bit with tax revenue, they were able to get back to spending.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks for the help.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Your line is open.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, guys. Just quickly back to the ramp in V&C margins. What do you think the exit rate for margins would be if you get this short cycle normalizing and all the cost savings in?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Jeff, hi. Help me with that question one more time. The exit rate. What do you mean by that?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Exit rate for (48:26).
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Exit rate in 2016, where do you think the margin's going to exit.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, I mean, I think we're looking at a full year rate of around 10.5%. I think we'd be closer to 15% on an exit rate.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then, John, any update on a new Valves & Controls leader and when that would be wrapped up?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: We will announce it when we're done. We're finding – we're looking for the right leader. John's doing a good job right now.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: But we are actively still working through it.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yes.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And we're looking for the right fit and the right type of individual to lean into this type of situation and lead with positive energy and get us to where we need to be.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Thanks. Good morning.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Brian.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Just coming back to the free cash flow. So, with the working capital disruption you mentioned in 2015, I would've suspected you would've had some early collections in 2016. So, why – I'm making the assumption that that's not coming through in the first quarter, and maybe just extend on that. Why wouldn't the full year be better than 100%?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: We certainly will attempt to do that. And the first quarter is always a negative quarter for us because we pay taxes, we pay bonuses, we're building working capital in the businesses that didn't do a bad job in working capital which is the water businesses and as getting ready for their seasonal highs in the second and third quarter. So, that's why.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC: But would the working capital that was pushed, are you expecting that in the first quarter or is that (50:29) sometime later in the year?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. I mean, Brian, if you're asking will the Q1 usage be better than the Q1 usage last year, the answer is yes. We believe it will be better.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Yeah. Okay.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: But our seasonality is we do use cash in Q1 and we start to deliver significant cash in Q2, Q3 and Q4.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Got it. Okay. And then, just the commentary about maintenance starting to improve, why – I mean, are you confident that this is not more of a secular change about in-sourcing or internalizing some of that maintenance? Do you just provide a superior economical offering, where that's probably only temporary, where your customers are able to do it themselves but maybe, over the long-term, it's not worthwhile for them to do it? Why are you confident...
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, part of it is we'll...
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Yeah.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: We'll start lapping the declines and it'll be flat year-over-year, number one. Number two, ultimately, when they really want to adjust costs, they should outsource it. And so, right now, this is in major industry changes. And before, you'll see people in-source work to bridge a soft spot, if you will, and then, when they realize that there's a structural change, they start looking at their cost structure. Look at BP's announcement, for instance. And then, when they don't have the people, they have to go outside the (51:58).
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: But, Brian, just to clarify, we did not say it's improving in Q1. Matter of fact, we said it is not improving in Q1.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I think he meant...
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, maintenance. Yeah.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: In the future.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And in the future, we do believe it gets better than the current outlook. I think it's still not robust.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Right.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC: If I could just sneak one last in, I think you also mentioned that petchem actually was a bit weaker than you thought it would be. I guess the project work on that front still seems to be pretty decent. But you did experience delays and some weakness there?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. It's decent, but not as decent as it was expected to be. And there's even delays there, so. And you can just imagine, if you're a company that is integrated.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Right.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Oil, gas, petrochem.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Got it. Thank you.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.
Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, guys.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Josh.
Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Just from a high-level perspective, and I want to make sure I'm understanding this correctly. So, maybe versus mid-December and, John, I think you put up a slide about normal EPS seasonality. And that would have read out to something in more like the high $0.70s versus the low $0.70s for the first quarter. And, I guess, if I'm understanding this right, a lot of the issues in Valves & Controls just come from being kind of below threshold in the first quarter on shipments. But, I guess I'm not really seeing a lot of the incremental caution that you're talking about, whether it be from price or from delayed maintenance spending readout. Is that the right way to think about it, or are those happening and then just some of these pockets of surprise growth versus a month ago in the other segments are offsetting that? I guess, if you were just to zoom out and look at it from the highest level.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. So, let me go back to that seasonality. I agree that we put that up. I think we have two elements that I will draw attention to. One is, our corporate costs are going to be significantly higher in Q1 than the rest of the year. That's related to vesting schedules of options in restricted stock, directors, officers, chairmen, as well as just general corporate spending. And that's about $0.04, Josh, to that level. And that is different this year than it has been in prior years. The other element is that we feel that the shippable backlog and ability to do better than the shippable backlog in Q1 in Valves & Controls is at its weakest opportunity in Q1. And those are the only two things that we're reflecting differently than the normal seasonality schedule that we shared with you.
Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess, just as a follow-up from an earlier question on midstream as it pertains to, I guess, both Valves & Controls and Technical Solutions, I kind of lost the answer somewhere in there between the quote log and shippable backlog and what your customers are seeing and how those all interplay. But is your expectation that that market is okay this year? And how should we think about that from a timing schedule into 2017 or beyond, I guess, just given some of those big cuts that we've seen at some of your customers?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. I think it all reflects it, if you think about the front log of what I'd say the projects that we're looking at, or the opportunities before we're even quoting, you should think about that being down at least 25% versus normalized levels. We then have to then quote, and we're going to get our fair share of products where we're automatically specced in or we're the likely player, and that's what represents the quote log, and then the orders are an output of that. And as you can imagine, that's a moving funnel of opportunities where, every single quarter, you're converting each of those. So, I think the news that we're sharing today is that we still think we're going to get our fair share of what our opportunities are, but the opportunities are lower. And we think that continues through 2017.
Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Gotcha. Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey. Good morning.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Chris.
Jim Lucas - Vice President-Investor Relations and Strategy: Morning.
Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey. Just a question about the capital structure, and what are the shifts in urgency and priority bias right now? Because we've clearly seen that leverage is out of fashion in terms of its impact on equity values, and maybe it's a more durable dynamic than to say merely out of fashion. And would you say the bar has raised on what qualifies as a viable deal prospect?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I would say so. Right now, cash flow and our focus on our balance sheet is number one. And the board and management are unified in that.
Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's all I got. Thanks.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Chris.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brian Drab with William Blair. Your line is open.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Good morning. Thanks. I just wanted to ask about the progression of EPS and organic revenue growth in 2Q, 3Q, 4Q. If we're going to do about $0.70, $0.71 in the first quarter, how do we think about EPS in 2Q, 3Q, 4Q? Is this going to be more like a $1.10, $1.10, $1.25? Or – any direction there would be helpful.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. I think we gave out seasonality before, and we kind of took a look at what Q1 is. And as we mentioned, there's a reason, or two reasons, that Q1 is slightly lower. But we would then expect that our normal seasonality, which is reflected in last year's delivering on that EPS, to be appropriate.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Then for organic revenue growth, 2Q, 3Q, 4Q?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Ramping throughout the year. As we suggested, our year-over-year comparisons get a little easier in Q3 and Q4. So we have the trends out of Q1, or Q4, continuing through Q1 and into Q2, and then we begin to get a little easier comparisons in Q3 and Q4.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: John, that's a little confusing to me just because in first quarter you're going to be up 1% in core sales and then for the balance of the year forecasting down 2%. So there's got to be – you're going to be down from 1%, right? So it's not really progressing up throughout the year.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, yeah. No, no, no, no. I get that. I'm sorry. I mean, we have some projects that are running out and those are in the Technical Solutions side. And so absent the Technical Solutions projects, my point is that Q2 is our seasonal quarter.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And then Q3 is down due to the fact that we tend to have the August. But on a year-over-year basis, everything other than the projects in Q3 and Q4 are about the same. And, Brian, I'm just not going to give you Q2 EPS guidance on this call today. That's where I'm going there.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah. I'm just trying to actually be helpful given that I'm expecting to have Q2 EPS guidance all over the place and then, you're going to give ....
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: No. I appreciate that.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: ... relative to guide.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks a lot.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to our presenters.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Thank you all for your interest and questions, and I'll turn it back over to you for the replay. Operator?
Operator: This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Kim, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Pentair Q3 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Jim Lucas, Vice President, Investor Relations and Strategic Planning, you may begin your conference, sir.
Jim Lucas - Vice President-Investor Relations & Strategic Planning: Thanks, Kim, and welcome to Pentair's third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. We're glad you could join us. I'm Jim Lucas, Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Planning. And joining me today is Randy Hogan, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Stauch, our Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, we will provide details on our third quarter 2015 performance as well as our fourth quarter and full year 2015 outlook as outlined in this morning's release. Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as the risks outlined in Pentair's most recent 10-K and today's release. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today, and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results. Today's webcast is accompanied by a presentation, which can be found in the Investors section of Pentair's website. We will reference these slides throughout our prepared remarks. Any references to non-GAAP financials are reconciled in the appendix of the presentation. We will be sure to reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. I would like to request that you limit your questions to one and a follow-up and get back in the queue for further questions in order to ensure everyone an opportunity to ask their questions. I will now turn the call over to Randy.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Jim. And good morning, everyone. As you saw in this morning's release, Pentair achieved earnings at the high end of the range, driven by core growth in two of our segments, plus solid margin expansion in three of our four segments: Flow & Filtration Solutions, Water Quality Systems, and Technical Solutions. We achieved this despite the energy market challenges we expected and a weakening in industrial short cycle sales towards the end of the quarter. So while our Energy and now Industrial verticals are presenting challenges, we have seen both Food & Beverage and Residential & Commercial sales growth buoy up results throughout the year. Our efforts to right-size the cost structure in Valves & Controls are well underway and we expect to execute all of our planned actions by the end of the year. These initiatives are expected to drive $135 million in gross cost savings in 2016. We'll provide more details on these actions later in the call. During the quarter, we closed on our acquisition of ERICO. As a reminder, ERICO's a leading manufacturer of highly-engineered electrical and fastening products that complement the equipment protection business within our Technical Solutions segment. ERICO has an annual revenue of approximately $600 million in very healthy margins. Our integration efforts are accelerating. We remain committed to our previously communicated synergies target of $10 million in 2016 and still expect the deal to be accretive to adjusted earnings by $0.40 in 2016. We're tightening our full year 2015 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $3.84 to $3.86 from a range of $3.80 to $3.90. while John will give more details on our fourth quarter and full year guidance later in the call, the updated guidance reflects a more cautious outlook on our short cycle Industrial and Energy businesses in the fourth quarter. This is primarily because we're not expecting to see the normal levels of maintenance and year-end budget spending that typically occur in most fourth quarters, given how September looked. We expect about $0.05 of accretion from ERICO in the fourth quarter, which is expected to offset any softness in these fourth quarter short cycle sales as we continue to focus on delivering the midpoint of our guidance or better. We expect to deliver cash flow of about 100% of adjusted net income for the full year. Now, let's turn to slide five for a discussion of our third quarter results. Third quarter core sales declined 5%, which follows a core sales decline of 2% in the second quarter and a 4% core sales decline in the first quarter. Valves & Controls had an acceleration in the rate of decline in its core sales, which was consistent with our outlook for the business entering the second half of the year. Both Water Quality Systems and Technical Solutions delivered core sales growth, while Flow & Filtration Solutions have stabilization in the top line, with core sales declining only 1%. Overall, FX remained a significant headwind in the quarter. Adjusted operating income, which adds back intangible amortization, was down 16%, and adjusted operating margins were down 70 basis points to 16.1%. The income decline and margin contraction came solely from our Valves & Control segment as the other three segments delivered healthy margin expansion. Free cash flow has been impacted this year by working capital timing due to the top line softness we've experienced, but we expect to deliver free cash flow approximating 100% of adjusted net income. Now, let's turn to slide six for a more detailed look at the third quarter with our standard sales and income walks. During the quarter, we saw a growth in two verticals: Residential & Commercial and Food & Beverage, while both Energy and Industrial declined. As a reminder, we include process industries such as chemicals in our Industrial vertical. Infrastructure was down 5%. This was a mixed as we saw a turn to growth in the Flow & Filtration Solutions businesses serving Infrastructure, while Technical Solutions saw a slowdown in its telecom sales. As you can see on the right-hand side of this page, our adjusted operating income adds back intangible amortization, which we believe more accurately reflects the operating performance of our overall business. Productivity and price once again more than offset inflation, but this was not nearly enough to offset the top line contraction being experienced by our Valves & Controls business. Our cost-out actions are gaining traction in Valves & Controls, which we expect to benefit the segment's results in 2016. We've also adjusted the cost structure in our Flow & Filtration Solutions and Technical Solutions segments, with benefits expected starting in the fourth quarter of this year. Now, let's turn to slide seven for a view of our largest segment, Valves & Controls. In the third quarter, Valves & Controls' core sales declined 18%, which showed further deterioration from the 11% decline in the second quarter. FX remained a considerable headwind at 10%. Backlog was down 3% sequentially, which includes the negative FX translation. Core orders declined 12%, the same rate of decline experienced last quarter. Core sales in all four Valves & Controls sub-verticals were down double digits with the steepest declines in mining. We also saw weakness in our short cycle business, which is further evidence that customers will not only cut capital expenditures this year but are also deferring some maintenance turnarounds and operational expenses. We do not believe these deferrals can last long and expect to see some stabilization or return to some growth in the short cycle business next year. We continue to see customers' delayed shipments, but order cancellations have been rare. The right half of the page shows third quarter Valves & Controls segment income and margins. We continue to drive productivity, and price was flat in the quarter. The abrupt and sharp volumes declines experienced this year, coupled with the time delay it takes for cost structure adjustments to read out, has contributed a higher than average margin contraction. While we are seeing pricing pressures on project orders, we're encouraged as standard pricing remain stable for now. Now, let's turn to slide eight for a look at the backlog and orders for Valves & Controls. As you can see on slide eight, Valves & Controls backlog is broken down in four key sub-verticals; three of which fall into our Energy vertical: oil & gas, power, and mining; and one on our Industrial vertical which is the process industries. Orders were down in three of the four sub-verticals, with power being an exception for the second consecutive quarter, with power orders growing 6%. While we continue to see activity in LNG and received a few orders in the quarter, it was not nearly enough to offset the lower orders across the rest of the oil & gas value chain. As mentioned earlier, in addition to weaker project sales, we've also seen lower MRO sales this year. Given that we have some products such as pressure relief valves that are using critical applications and are highly-serviced, we believe this is an indicator that deferral of maintenance is occurring more broadly this year. While the overall rate of order decline was consistent for the second consecutive quarter, it's too early to call a bottom. We continue to expect ongoing weakness in the longer cycle project business, but we do expect to see the short cycle business return to growth in 2016. We continue to believe in the long-term prospects for Valves & Controls. Now let's move to slide nine to review the actions we're taking to right-size our Valves & Controls segment. Last quarter, we discussed the acceleration of more dramatic cost-out actions within Valves & Controls. I asked John Stauch to lean in and drive the actions needed to right-size the cost structure of the business, given the ongoing industry challenges. I'm pleased to report that the team has rallied with a great sense of urgency and has stepped up to the challenge. As a reminder, we've targeted $130 million in gross cost-out actions. That is $115 million of permanent cost structure adjustment and $20 million of accelerated sourcing savings to help offset anticipated project pricing challenges next year. Of the $135 million identified so far, we've executed actions targeting 2016 savings of $125 million, and expect to execute the remainder during the fourth quarter. While we're not in a position to provide 2016 guidance yet, it's worth noting that we expect there to be incremental costs do return next year. Pricing on larger projects has seen continued pressure, and we do not expect this to moderate next year. We'll have virtually no incentive pay in 2015, and we want to build a plan to earn those back next year. In addition, we expect additional cost-out actions and there will likely be incremental spending that target savings in 2017. Further, the project push-outs that we have experienced this year are expected to continue. So, these $130 million worth of actions should be seen as gross savings. And they will be key to putting the Valves & Controls segment in a position to grow income in 2006 despite the ongoing top-line uncertainty. Now, let's move to slide 12 (sic) [10] (10:51) for a look at our Flow & Filtration Solutions segment. Flow & Filtration Solutions had an 8% top-line decline with core sales down 1% and FX translation a 7% headwind. This is a solid showing for Flow & Filtration Solutions as the core business showed further signs of stabilization and we believe it is on track to return to growth in the coming quarters. Food & Beverage was up 11% in the quarter, led by growth in our global beer and dairy businesses. Our agriculture-related businesses were down modestly, which is encouraging given the industry as a whole is down double-digit. Residential & Commercial was down 5%. It would have been up modestly if we exclude our previously communicated big box exit. Industrial was down once again as we saw a delay in some of our pump and filtration sales serving OEMs and tough year-over-year comps in our industrial fire business. Encouragingly, our Infrastructure business grew 6%. This was one quarter earlier than we expected to see growth in this vertical. Both the municipal flood control pumps and water reuse projects contributed to the infrastructure growth. Segment income was flat, and margins expanded a healthy 100 basis points to 14.6%. Productivity was especially strong this quarter, and the decision to exit low margin products also helped the profitability of the segment. The focus for the segment in 2015 has been to stabilize the business and drive margin expansion. And the third-quarter performance was validation that the business continues to move in the right direction. I also want to mention that we had a leadership change in Flow & Filtration Solutions at the end of the quarter. We recently hired Beth Wozniak to lead the business. Beth joins us after a long and successful career at Honeywell, where most recently she was President of its Environment and Combustion Controls business. Beth brings a strong track record of growth, and we're excited to have her join the Pentair team. Now, let's move to slide 11 for a look at Water Quality Systems. Water Quality Systems once again had a solid quarter with 3% core sales growth, though lower than the 6% core growth last quarter. During the quarter, our water purification and food service businesses both saw destocking in China as the correction there led to numerous customers being more cautious. We're monitoring the situation closely since we still expect growing demand for our water filtration products in China. Further, our aquatics business saw some timing impact in shipments due to flooding in Texas during the second quarter that delayed a number of installations, and dealers as a result managed their inventory levels very closely in the quarter. Despite the China inventory destocking and channel purchasing delays, Water Quality Systems' Residential & Commercial core sales grew 4%, while Food & Beverage was flat. Segment income grew 8% and margin expanded 150 basis points to 18.8%. Price offset inflation, and productivity was strong. In addition, mix was favorable. Segment continued to invest both in new products and in selling and marketing. We continue to expect good growth and margin expansion for the full year. Let's now turn to slide 12 for a look at Technical Solutions results. Technical Solutions reported a 1% decline in sales, comprised of a 2% core sales growth, a three-point contribution from ERICO and an FX headwind offset of 6%. Industrial sales were down 1% as our enclosures business saw continued softness in the short cycle Industrial business and further destocking in some of its distribution channels. Energy grew 9% as our thermal management business continued to ship two projects. Residential & commercial grew 9% as demand for our thermal building solutions products was strong. Infrastructure was the one negative in the quarter with a 17% decline, as our electronics business faced tough comps and overall sales to telecoms softened. Segment income was flat and margins expanded 30 basis points to a strong 23.4%. Mix has been negative this year as more of the thermal growth has come from lower margin large projects than higher margin MRO product sales, which have been soft. Price and productivity offset inflation for the quarter. Given the near-term headwinds in the short cycle Industrial business, we're addressing the cost structure accordingly. The fourth quarter will have a full quarter of contribution from ERICO which we expect to help offset Industrial softness and the continued tougher comparisons on the Energy side of the business. Now let's turn to slide 13 for a view of how we're closing out 2015. Before I turn the call over to John to discuss our fourth quarter and full year outlook in more detail, I want to discuss how we feel our portfolio's positioned entering the fourth quarter and as we exit 2015. We'll provide more color on our long-term strategy in our November 6 Investor Day Meeting in New York, and we'll provide our initial outlook for 2016 in mid-December. With the closing of the ERICO acquisition and the integration efforts well underway, we now expect approximately $0.05 of net accretion in the fourth quarter after accelerated integration costs. This accretion is expected to be partially offset by the expected weaker fourth quarter short cycle sales than we saw a year ago with our Energy and Industrial verticals. The right-sizing of the cost structure for Valves & Controls is on track and underway, and the benefits are expected to readout meaningfully in 2016. Sales into the Residential & Commercial and Food & Beverage verticals remain healthy. Infrastructure, while our smallest vertical, is also positioned to deliver growth primarily within Flow & Filtration Solutions, while Technical Solutions continues to expect to see ongoing weak demand in telecom sales. Cash flow continues to be a focus, and we expect to benefit from year-end working capital improvement especially within Valves & Controls and Flow & Filtration Solutions. Our full-year target of delivering free cash flow of approximately 100% of adjusted net income remains unchanged. With that, I'll turn the call over to John who will provide additional color on our outlook. John?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Randy. Please turn to slide number 14 titled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. Our balance sheet changed significantly with the closing of the ERICO acquisition as our debt ended the quarter at $5 billion on a net debt basis, inclusive of cash on hand. We were able to successfully complete two bond offerings during the quarter. And while our balance sheet leveraged at 3.75 times, a little higher than our targeted 2.5 times leverage ratio, we have a detailed plan in place to bring that leverage ratio to around 3 times by the end of 2016. Our ROIC ended the quarter at 10.1% as our operating income has come under pressure with the top line challenges experienced with our Valves & Controls segment. Free cash flow did improve once again but as we indicated last quarter, our working capital performance is not where we would like it to be given our top line challenges this year. The fourth quarter is a seasonally strong free cash flow generation quarter and we expect to deliver free cash flow approximating 100% of adjusted net income for the year. Please turn to slide number 15 labeled Improved Cash Generating Capabilities. The left-hand chart shows how dramatically our free cash generating capabilities have changed over the past few years. We have a long successful track record of converting 100% of adjusted net income into free cash flow. Given the working capital opportunities over the next few years, we expect our free cash flow conversion to remain at these higher levels. The right-hand side of the page highlights our capital allocation strategy which has remained consistent in recent years. While our balance sheet leverage has increased with the ERICO acquisition, we remain committed to maintaining an investment-grade rating. We had raised our dividend for 39 consecutive years and our dividend yield remains at over 2%. We have invested in organic growth and expect to see three of our four segments positioned to deliver organic growth entering the new year. Given the increased leverage on the balance sheet, our near-term use of cash will be of paying down debt. Please turn to slide number 16, labeled Q4 2015 Pentair Outlook. For the fourth quarter, we expect core sales to decline 5% and total sales to decline approximately 3%, inclusive of foreign exchange headwinds and the ERICO acquisition. On a core basis, we expect Valves & Controls to be down roughly 16% as we anticipate continued declines in the short cycle business and further customer push outs as we experienced in Q3. Flow & Filtration systems' core sales are expected to be down 5% on slower Industrial sales and lower distributor stocking. Water Quality Systems' core sales are anticipated to increase approximately 8% by continued strength in aquatics and favorable comparables for our water purification business. Finally, Technical Solutions' core sales are expected to decrease 2% as we expect sales from closures to remain sluggish exiting the year. Due to pullbacks and capital spending and distributor year-end stocking, as well as tougher comparisons for our thermal business as two large projects in Canada anniversary. The inclusion of ERICO in Q4 will help both the top line and adjusted operating income, but we are accelerating integration costs into Q4 from 2016 to get a head start on integration activities. We are expecting adjusted operating income to decrease roughly 7% and adjusted operating margins to contract 80 basis points. Below the operating line, our tax rates should remain around 23%. Net interest and others are expected to be around $34 million, including approximately $16 million of new debt from the ERICO acquisition. And the share count should end the year around 183 million. Our fourth quarter adjusted EPS guidance is $1.03 to $1.05 which is a roughly 10% year-over-year decline. We expect free cash flow to end the year strong with continued focus on improving our working capital performance. Please turn to slide number 17 labeled Full Year 2015 Pentair Outlook. We are tightening our full-year adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $3.84 to $3.86. For the full year, we're expecting core sales to decline approximately 4%, and foreign exchange to remain around at 6% headwind. Valves & Controls' core sales are anticipated to be down 14%. We expect Flow & Filtration core sales to decline roughly 4% for the full year. Water Quality Systems' core sales are anticipated to grow approximately 5%, and Technical Solutions' core sales are expected to grow approximately 2% for the full year. We expect adjusted operating income to be down 12% for the year and we anticipate adjusted operating margins to contract 50 basis points to 15.6%. We are working aggressively to right-size the cost structure in Valves & Controls, while we believe our other three segments are positioned to deliver margin expansion. We expect overall corporate costs to be approximately $90 million, net interest and other to be around $91 million, our full-year tax rate to be around 23%, and the share count for the full year to be around 183 million shares. Adjusted EPS is expected to be down 9% at the midpoint of the range which remains unchanged. Finally, we expect another strong year of free cash flow into, once again, approximate 100% of adjusted net income. Kim, can you please open the line for questions. Thank you.
Operator: And your first question comes from the line of Deane Dray, RBC Capital. Your line is open.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hello. Morning, everyone.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Deane.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Morning.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey, I'd like to start in Valves & Controls and maybe some more color on the pricing dynamics. It was interesting to see that last call out on page seven where standard pricing is stable, but you have a pressure on project orders. And I'm betting the project orders is where you're seeing competitors looking to fill up their factories; that's kind of the playbook that they will run. But be curious how is it that standard is holding up so well.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. So, you're right. I mean, obviously, on the larger projects and there isn't a lot of large projects, but larger projects are the most price pressured. Even some of the smaller projects are receiving a fair amount of price pressure. But the like-for-like highly-sensitive safety-related valve applications in the standard product have not yet seen a price deterioration. I mean, we are anticipating some, but it's kind of – as of Q3, it's generally held on the price-to-price. We have visibility of that in the systems.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Can you give some specifics in terms of how much pricing pressure you've seen on those – on the project orders?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. I mean I would say in general, I mean, we're seeing anywhere from – on a standard larger project, we're seeing 10 points to 15 points of pricing pressure. Now...
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: With a lot of standard product.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Now, some of that is foreign exchange. Some of that is recoverable through the material and the sourcing lines and some of that we're asking our partners to participate. But it's generally in that range on the larger projects. It's probably in the 5 points to 10 points range on the midsized projects. And as I said, it's relatively holding on standard.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: And that sounds like an absolute price difference because you had some adjustments if you're going to go after your partners as well to share in that.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: No. That would be what the customer is asking for, and then, obviously, we're trying to...
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. That would be the headline price and then the issue is how much of that can you recapture in terms of source product and others. So, that's – in other words, that's – really, the comment is about net – what nets to the margin, right.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great. And then just staying in the Valves & Controls side, maybe some perspective from you, John, and you can answer the question either as CFO or as the Head of Valves & Controls, either one is fine. But the idea is how have you retold the workforce? You've talked about maybe converting or, not maybe, but converting the workforce in more contingent labors. So, is that still the plan? Where does that stand, and is that something that's built into 2016?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. So, real quick. Our customer buys from us either in a short cycle, I need it quickly, I want it for a installed based or MRO aftermarket application, or I'm seeking an engineer to order application or a project. So, our sales force has been working to meet those customer needs in that regard. So, what we've done is we've aligned the two value streams to support that within the business around those two buying proposals, which starts to identify the needs to serve the short cycle, which means I need local inventory, I need to get it to you in 24 to 48 hours, I have to have service centers to be able to give you the service you need. And then on longer projects, I can generally ship that from anywhere in the world, and I can begin to work and then engineer the order to the customers' needs. The standard is obviously a higher margin, and you're buying something that you need on a like-for-like basis. The engineer, we have options, and the first option is, where do we want to play? And where do we want to build our annuity base over the next 10 years? And as I mentioned, I think it was at your conference, Deane, that we have to look at our variable nature of that project business. So, can we buy some of the products that we're making today? Can we source in some of the products that are lower margin. And then ultimately, as we build that business back over time, we don't want to carry the large fixed cost structure that we had when we were $2.5 billion to $3 billion business. So, I think as we shape this into 2016 and 2017, those will be the priorities. The team is rallying behind that, as Randy said. It is the right way to shape the business. And we think when we do this, we're going to be in a great position to capture share and to serve our customers better.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Let's talk a lot more about that at the Analyst Day.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Pleasure. (27:16)
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Deane.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Andrew J. Ronkowitz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: This is Drew on for Nigel. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit about Tech Solutions and just what you're seeing on the general industrial cycle? I think it sort of come up on every call that an industrial recession is potentially in the cards. Just whether or not you're seeing that and what you're looking for?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, Drew, I think – I mean, as you recall, we saw what we were characterizing as a pause in industrial spending, I'd say really starting in the first quarter, went into the second quarter. We saw it really roll over into a decline with the short cycle which we really see in our Hoffman business. North America Hoffman which is high share in the industrial world, but broad-based industrial, right? And we saw that, in particular, September; we saw a deceleration. Now, a part of that is uncertainty, how much of it is destocking. But it is what informs us into – you usually see an Industrial – in Energy, you would see a fourth quarter catch-up on spending. And what we're saying is we don't think it's smart to think that will happen in the fourth quarter this year as a result.
Andrew J. Ronkowitz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: And then we don't know how long it will last, but we do think there's a bit of a knock-on effect. We talked about it before from Energy into the Industrial. I think that's really what this is.
Andrew J. Ronkowitz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And just as a follow-up, on ERICO, I know not really industrially exposed, more resi-commercial. But just how you're thinking about top line trends for that business into next year and should we think about the historical rate of growth is in that sort of low-single digit, 4%, zone is the right way to sort of model top line?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. We're thinking about 2% to 3% next year for the ERICO. And you're right, it is skewed commercial; 75% of the sales is commercial, which we like that exposure. Our share is low in the rest of our Technical Solutions offering with the exception of the thermal building. We're one of the key players there on the thermal side. But on the closures and related equipment side, our share is lowest in commercial. And so, we see some opportunities there and we're – we don't have any – we know there are synergistic opportunities, but that 2% to 3% wouldn't include whatever synergy to growth we can get on the Hoffman brand.
Andrew J. Ronkowitz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Got it. All right. I'll pass along. Thanks, guys.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Your line is open.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Morning, guys.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Morning, Steve.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey. Just a little bit of clarification. What's the thinking behind moving amortization back from corporate to the segments?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I mean we had done it from a standpoint of moving to adjusted EPS last quarter. And with the inclusion of ERICO, it didn't seem proper to leave $130-ish million or $140 million in amortization just down below the line. And so, by moving it back to the segments, it more appropriates where that amortization is held and gives a relative margin range excluding that amortization, which then makes it more relative to the industries in which they compete.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: We thought ultimately it would be more helpful. The $0.40 of accretion we talked about for 2016 is on an adjusted income basis. So, we felt that that was more parallel to do – to pass that back down (30:53).
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And as you guys are starting to think about and build your plans, your operating plans, for 2016 across the different segments, are you baking into that an assumption about a return to growth within 2016 for Flow & Filtration, or how are you – if you sort of think about a couple of the business units, maybe help us understand – granted it's early, but you still must be already building those operating plans or starting to think about it. So, how are you positioning on that front for an inflection point?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. We're going to go into that framework in a fair bit of detail at the Investor Meeting. But the way to think about it is that we talked it – what I talked about it on the script is, and I'll just walk through segment-by-segment, we are going to control our own destiny in Valves & Controls. That's why we're taking the $135 million out because we want to build a plan that has income growth next year even if revenue is softer. So, that's sort of the planning effort there. On Flow & Filtration, as I mentioned also on the script, we really are making progress back towards growth. We will have no more of this lapping of the exit of the large but unprofitable big box segment for us, plus we're seeing – we are seeing Infrastructure, as I mentioned, a quarter earlier in growth there and the backlog supports – our order rate supports that to continue. So we do think Flow & Filtration's heading in the right direction and we'll have a lot more background on that. And in Residential & Commercial, the third quarter was a little lower but we think that was more ephemeral than anything structural. So -- but that's how we're thinking about it.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. All right. I'll pass it on. Thanks.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Good morning, everyone.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Morning, Joe.
Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So, my first question, clearly, you guys reduced the 4Q guide slightly on this weakness in short cycle Industrial and Energy. I'm just curious -- how bad was – and how weak was September? Is there any commentary that you guys can give us on just cadence as the quarter progressed?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. I mean, I think we saw the Industrial short cycle down double-digits as we exited the quarter, and we're assuming that, as Randy mentioned, we're not expecting restocking to occur. And usually in the Q4, we're helped in that segment by people buying ahead of what's anticipated to be price increases next year. And also, we're assuming there's uncertainty in their buying pattern. So, we're adjusting Q4 to reflect September levels carrying through Q4, and we think that's appropriate given where we are in the understanding of the markets that we're participating in today.
Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I mean, what are your customers or distributors saying right now regarding inventory that's in the channel? I know you guys made some comment about inventory destocking continuing, but I'm just curious on how you guys are thinking about the outlook there.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, really, it's part and parcel of what John just talked about. I mean, there are – the double-digit decline in September, we think, has a big component of destocking, but it has some real end market decline as well. And that's that maintenance – deferred maintenance, there's lower operating expenses, lower capital spending on a broader base than just oil and gas in the other industries.
Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And then maybe one last question. As you kind of look into 2016 again, you clearly – you guys stepped up the restructuring spending and specifically as it relates to Valves. I'm just curious: where is the additional restructuring spending going? And then can you tell us how much benefit we should expect to see, specifically in the Valves segment, as we get into 2016? Because clearly, there may be some pricing pressure in that segment as well, so I'm just trying to get a sense for how you guys are thinking about it initially from a margin perspective.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. So, we'll be addressing incremental actions in Q4 as we suggest, and obviously some of those are the identified Valves & Controls actions which will be actioned in Q4, and we'll have benefit next year. We'll also be taking a look at the Technical Solutions business as it relates to the industrial footprint and taking some actions there to right-size that cost structure to be competitive with the market conditions we mentioned. Clearly, from Valves & Controls perspective, we are very targeted long term to be at that 18% ROS margin range which we thought was a competitive benchmark. And then, you look at that in the new adjusted operating income, somewhere 20% over the next five years. So, we think we see margin expansion next year regardless of what the top line is in Valves & Controls and that's a huge benchmark for us to continue to work back the cost model. So, when growth returns, and it will return, we start leveraging nicely up and really start to benefit from all the cost actions that we're putting behind us.
Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thanks, guys. I'll get back in queue.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good morning.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Steve.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: On the Valves & Controls side, the seasonality has kind of been all over the place from the last couple years. I know you guys had that kind of the change in the year-end around the business in 2012 and then 2013. I think, sequentially, you're up a decent amount, the revenue guide is, in the fourth quarter. Can you maybe just talk about what supports that? Because I think you talked about being more conservative for the fourth quarter, not assuming stuff comes back.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. So, we saw a fairly significant push-out of revenue from Q3 to Q4. We're assuming that gets pushed out all the way into 2016. The only real difference between Q3 and Q4 is that Q3 has the August which is generally a shutdown month in its entirety, and we have an extra shipping day in Q4. But there's not a big expected seasonality jump for Q3 to Q4. We're just assuming the same level of push-outs and what our existing shippable backlog is, Steve.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And on the incentive comp front. I mean, is that a meaningful number next year? You talked about dialing some of that back in. Is there a number you could give us on what that could be, what – how much of an offset that would be to the growth? It's clearly a lot of good growth cost out on your front.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. I mean, I think if you took a look at Valves & Controls incentives and the total GBU opportunity paid at 100% target, we have no idea what those targets will be after 2016, that would be about a $30 million number. And you can assume that not much of that's being paid this year. So, that gives you a kind of an idea. Now, obviously, we're going to expect some growth next year. We're going to expect some effort, and we'll align those targets appropriately.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then, what's...
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: We'll also see wage inflation, Steve. I mean, we won't – we don't expect to see much on the material side. Definitely, we're seeing commodity prices weakening. But we are still having wage inflation to keep good talent around.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then one last question just on the free cash flow. I mean, I think the number, the 100% number refers to the – around – is that around $700 million for the year?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: That's correct. It would be 120% on the old base and 100% on the new adjusted income base. Yes.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: So, I mean, that's such a huge number in the fourth quarter. Are there discreet things that you're looking to pull through? Are there certain big projects that are coming through on that front? And I guess if volumes are weaker than expected, is that a – does that turn into a positive? How do you kind of – how do you judge the risks around that and what should we think about it as we move to the quarter about kind of the levers that we should be watching to make sure that that come through?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. As we said, both in Randy's remarks and my remarks, we're behind in working capital and we don't want to give up yet. I mean, there's clearly probably a $50 million risk associated with that. But we feel like that working capital is ours to go get, and we don't want to give up on it yet and we feel like there's path and actions to go get it . So, we'll work with the GBUs. We also have capital. We've seen our customers adjust their capital spending; we're adjusting ours as well.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: We identified the inventory was heading in the wrong direction to support growth in a number of places where the growth wasn't there to get. So, that reversed. I mean, we got good focus on it and we made some progress in the third quarter. We expect a lot more progress in the fourth on...
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Right. Okay. Okay. Thanks a lot.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Steve.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Your line is open.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Morning, guys.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hey, Shannon.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Hey. Just on Valves & Controls, can you give us a sort of a geographic look at how that business is doing? Any key geographies that are weaker or stronger than others?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I mean, the weakest geography is not a big geography for us. But the weakest on a percentage basis will be Brazil. Clearly, everybody is seeing that. China has not been a strong environment this year, but it's starting to see some power benefits. And for the most part then, it's just a broad-based – as you stop these larger projects globally, it's affecting all regions. The only strength that we've had this year is North America.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Okay.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: It's LNG deposit.(40:56)
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. LNG.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: LNG and what else?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Petrochem.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Petrochem.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Petrochem. Okay. And then, John, just as you've dug in a little bit more into Valves & Controls, other than adjusting the cost structure to the lower volume environment, any kind of things that has grabbed you as you've gotten in there that are kind of the two or three things you think really you guys need to get working better on that business?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. I mean, it's a good organization, first of all. It's been always customer-centric. And what we needed to do and what we have done as a leadership team and certainly with Randy's sponsorship is addressing the way that the customer or we go to the customer in these value streams. And when you get the simplicity of how the customer wants to be served either short cycle or long cycle, it gives you the clarity to build your SIOP processes and really reduce the complexity in the back office to support it. And so, the team has embraced it. It's a seasoned team who understands the industry, understands the customer needs, and we're excited about the game changer that I think that's going to be.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: And you're just starting that? When did that – the shifts begin, I guess, and how long does it take to (42:13)
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Within the last 90 days. Within the last 90 days. Yeah.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. All right. Thanks.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Jeff.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Jeff?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Jeff?
Operator: I'm sorry. And your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Your line is open.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, Randy, John, Jim.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hi, Nathan.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Nathan.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I guess I'll just hit Valves & Controls for something different. You talked about the $30 million incentive potential coming back next year. There's also a couple of other offsets. So, I'm hoping you could shed some more color on – there's a pay-as-you-go restructuring. I assume that's going to be some restructuring expense that you're not planning on excluding next year. Any color you can give us on where that'll be focus and what kind of number we could be looking for?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. I'll hold back in the number until we identify it specifically. But we have to address – as I mentioned, we have a short cycle of footprint that we need to optimize around which is where our customers' installed base is and how do we serve that most effectively. And then we also have the long cycle or the project-based engineer-to-order footprint that we have to address. I, as the Valves & Controls leader, owe both of those plans to Randy and we'll be taking a look at some footprint actions and beginning to right-size primarily that project side to make sure we got the right cost structure to compete on those larger projects which, again, we'll be prioritizing those types of things that we think grows our installed base over time.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So, you're not planning on excluding those charges? They will be included in your adjusted results?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: These are the things about the cost of transitioning one factory to another factory or the downsizing of those particular...
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Redeployment...
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Redeployment, yeah.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: ...around from where they are now to where the market opportunities are in the future.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got you.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: (44:17) always had that duplicative cost while you're ramping up and then ramping down.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Understood. And then there was another comment, I think, Randy, you made in your prepared remarks that you expect short-cycle growth in 2016. I understand this deferred maintenance on the short cycle going on this year. You also have had like, I think, a deterioration of the macro environment. I'm just wondering if you could give us some more color on what gives you confidence that you can see short cycle growth in 2016.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, let's just talk about oil and gas. You can't defer maintenance forever. They're actually running pretty flat out. Usually, they have refinery turnarounds right about now. A lot of them haven't happened because they have a lot of end market demand and they are maximizing crack spreads. They can't continue that forever. I mean, it's a very safety-sensitive, safety-focused industry. And we also think that a lot of the short – there's been – the capital – the spending reductions in oil and gas and now industrials has been rapid and it has been blunt as opposed to precise. We believe that the planning that's going on right now in the oil and gas industry from the window we have is that there's no intention to keep maintenance down and – unless they're a factory. Yeah. So, for upstream ongoing maintenance, clearly, will be lower. But most of what we're talking about is really refining petrochemical gas plants, industrial factories. Those – unless you're shutting down a factory, you're still doing that. And so, we – history says that you can do it for a short time, but you can't do it forever. So, that's our core planning assumption. We haven't seen anything to tell us different.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: That's helpful. Could you just give us some color on what the refining turnaround maintenance season is down this year?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I don't have a number. I'll be pulling it out anecdotally, and I'd rather – I don't have a specific number. I can't give it to you.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's fair enough. Thanks very much.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Can you hear me?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, Jeff.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yes, Jeff.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Sorry about that.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: That's all right.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Can you just go through the rationale of the management change on Flow & Filtration? You talked about that. And then also just how you're thinking about timing for kind of a permanent replacement for Valves & Controls.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Sure. Beth is someone that I had known by reputation for a while. And we're – we may be dealing with some short-term issues in terms of end markets that we don't control, but we do control our own destinies. You've known us a long time. And we intend to continue to build the company. And to build the company, you need great people. So the opportunity to have Beth join the team was one that we were quite excited about. And so she is, so she's on the team. Valves & Controls, we're actively searching right now. And I'm not going to put a date or tell you, but we have a legitimate candidate. I know at least one person in this room that's anxious to get the person onboard; maybe two.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: So, it won't be quarters. Okay.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research. Your line is open.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Morning.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Brian.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC: I just wanted to touch, sorry, one more time, just on Valves & Controls. But the bridge that you guys provided. So effectively, you've had no price impact, seems, to-date. It hasn't at the revenue line at least. So I assume it's not in the OP as well, given that it's not in revenue. But when would you expect that to start to impact?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Brian, Brian, can I just clarify.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Sure.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Obviously, we would measure prices the way most companies do, which is I have the like product last year and I have the same like product this year. And when I compare those two prices, I've got a year-over-year price impact. And as I've said earlier, we're not seeing a price negativity yet on the standard side where that would show up. Where we are seeing the pricing is on booked margin, when we go off to win a job and we would've won that at maybe 44% gross margin, and then we're down to 42% gross margin because of the effective price pressure that's in the engineered components. And again, that would be a brand new product that we don't have compared against new product today (49:01).
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Right. They're not like-for-like, so you don't put it in price. It ends up hitting productivity.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay. Got it. Yeah. And I don't know if you could provide any increments (49:12) color on this but for 2016, you're still assuming that you're going to have operating profit higher. I mean, how – so what's the assumption that price is going to get away and offset by productivity and restructuring?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. So we've shared that we think it's at least a couple more points of headwind that you see on that booked margin.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay. And then just separately, I know you touched on the working capital and the opportunity but mostly on the inventory side, but can you comment on receivables? There's been some incremental reports recently that customers are holding back on payment especially in the Middle East with Aramco. What has your experience been there? And what's the expectation and are you seeing stress among other customers where that could be a concern?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I'm going to answer this even though you think the CFO would, because I would like to give John and his team credit.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Sure.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: We have really good disciplines around receivables and really conservative practices in terms of watching for late payments and the like. And John and his finance team have been watching it like a hawk. We also have heard some of these reports, and so we're active – we're proactively making sure that we are not hurt by that. And we're not seeing it. We're not seeing anything meaningful in that regard.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Brian Drab with William Blair. Your line is open.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to drill in a little bit more on Tech Solutions and talk about the 9% growth that you saw in the Energy vertical there. Can you talk a little bit about why the energy market's holding up so well in that segment, especially relative to Valves & Controls, and maybe comment on the activity that you're seeing within that segment in the petrochem market?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Sure. First of all, if you recall, the biggest part of Energy, oil & gas in (51:24) specifics in Technical Solutions is the thermal business. The thermal business Industrial business saw a huge decline in opportunity. If you recall, things like Voyager up in Canada got cancelled. We had won that. We were seeing those declines back in 2013. I mean 2013, 2014. So we had already sort of seen a decline and, if you want, this is sort of a positive off that bottom, because two large projects are going forward and we won them both. So, we're shipping those now. We're enjoying those now. When I talked about the margin pressures in Technical Solutions, it's the margins on those large projects versus the product margins specifically. So, those – we're actively winning other projects. They're not that size. So, that'll be a headwind but that's a headwind we're planning on managing through. So, that's those projects. So, it's really not – it's not whistling through the graveyard. It's those specific projects.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And can you comment on what geographies, end markets those projects are in? Those in the oil sands?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Canada. Canada.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah. Okay. And can you comment on what you're seeing in the petrochem market? I guess specifically within that thermal controls heat tracing market.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, there is opportunities there. They're not as large as some of those ones there, we're actively looking at and bidding on some, particularly in North America where a lot of that activity is. We think we'll do fine there and we've actually got a good backlog on the industrial thermal side. So – and a lot of is non-oil sands. And that's where the activity is, so...
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Good morning.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hey, Chris.
Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey. So, sounds like $125 million or so of the $135 million cost-out's already been executed. I think you...
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: The actions taken. They're not reading out yet, right? I mean let's just be clear. (53:37)
Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. So I think the general framework is sort of a January 1 starting line for readout, but that's a little bit simplistic. How would you advise for a little more nuanced view of how the benefits start to ramp into the run rates?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. So Chris, we obviously are getting the cost out this year. But as you know, that gets hung up in the inventory side in what we call deferred productivity or capitalized variance in the manufacturing side. So the costs we got on the manufacturing, we won't start to recognize till next year, and that's a big piece of the cost that we've been after this year. We are getting a little bit of benefit from what we're doing in the G&A in the selling and marketing sides, and we'll experience some of that in Q4. But the main goal here is that we are hitting the ground on January 1 with a full run rate of those savings to offset the types of things that Randy mentioned in his prepared remarks.
Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks for that. And then on the capital allocation side, the Valves & Controls angle maybe rethinking, I think, a year or two ago that was probably a focus for long-term capital allocation. How much has that been supplanted by a view towards scalability around ERICO and Technical Solutions? And even with a little bit of a near-term color with debt paydown, would capital allocation optionality still be part of the plan?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, I'll tackle (55:09) Valves & Controls real quick. And first of all, we are committed to what we call the operating model transformation, which is putting our company – our valves business headquartered in Switzerland and benefiting from the global cash advantaged structure that we have. And so, we'll continue doing that. Obviously, we'll tweak it a little bit to mirror the value streams that I mentioned. But we are – three of those major ERP migrations are behind us, and then we'll continue to right-size the factory structure. But I think you should expect a little less capital spent in Valves & Controls primarily because the volume's down. ERICO itself was not a capital-intensive purchase. Matter of fact, very cash rich and spent less than $10 million...
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Except the purchase price.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Except the purchase price. We spent less than $10 million a year on capital. So not a hugely capital-intensive play. Where we've been spending the money in Technical Solutions has been primarily automating our enclosure lines, obviously reducing labor and improving quality, reducing warranty. So we continue to do that because the payback and the IRR was quite high. So, again, mindful on capital. We always say creativity before capital, something Randy's taught the organization. We'll continue to implement that.
Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski. Your line is open.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Josh. Are you there?
Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Just – yeah. Can you hear me?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Got you.
Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: So, just on the Valves & Controls outlook into next year, obviously, all the costs coming out. I would presume, though, that some of this is part of kind of normal PIMS operation and decremental margin management. If you had to put a thought on kind of the core decremental margin on volume declines that we can add these cost-outs as an offset against, how should we think about that next year? I mean, you're talking about price being a bit more of a headwind. Obviously, that's going to be detrimental to that. Any puts and takes we should think about kind of the core decremental before the cost-outs.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. So, I'll handle the first one, then I'll let Randy clarify it. But right now, material in Valves & Controls is roughly 33% to 35% of sales. So, it gives you an indication when you lose $1 of revenue what the impact is if you can't mobilize the cost-out. And after several cost-out plans, you could assume that we have a fair amount of fixed cost to the business.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I would just say two things, Josh. Number one, the level of complexity that – we have made goods strides, particularly in the Four-Wall Lean, reducing the complexity in the business. But in terms of the business complexity, it's still enormous. And so, really, John and the team have gotten a really good focus on that. So, there's a lot more structure to take out. But I would also ask you to – I mean, I know – I'm anxious to get to those answers, too, and more fully, and we'll be better prepared to give you more insights on November 6.
Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Got you. I'll stay tuned. And then, just one question on ERICO. How does pricing typically function for them? Does it end up being list pricing, job specific? How does that work in kind of a go-to-market?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Most of what they sell is sold through distribution, so it'd be a classic discount to a book list. And then, they have a sales force very much like our pool (58:47) sales force which, even though our product goes through distribution, we have a sales force on the other side that helps sell it through and sells through the applications. There also is some project pricing. But think of it more along – more akin to like a Hoffman structure.
Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Got you. All right. Thanks, guys.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen. Your line is open.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hey, Joe.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Just a question on share. Given the magnitude of the declines in Valves across the space broadly, how do you guys think you're doing in terms of maintaining your growing share in that market?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: We think we're maintaining, not growing, not losing. We think we're maintaining.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Particularly in the product lines we care the most about.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And on the Infrastructure side, you mentioned a little bit more positive view. Maybe you can flesh it out a little bit, like where – is that more of a municipal call?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Yeah. Municipal, it's not just in the U.S., it's more broadly than that. I think it's a recovery of municipal spending. Our backlog – or excuse me, our order rate has been improving the last several quarters and as I mentioned, we figured we were going to turn to growth in Flow & Filtration in the fourth quarter and we actually got growth in the third quarter. So, it's a little bit early. Now, we also put telecom in Infrastructure.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Right.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: And that's in Technical Solutions and that's – we talked about that in the call; I mean on the script.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: And John, just one quick one for you. On the tax rate, how should we be thinking about that directionally going forward over the next couple of years?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. So, we expect to finish this year 23% as we shared, and I think we believe this point of opportunity into the next several years.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks. The last question.
Operator: And your last question comes from the line with David Rose with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Morning. Thank you for taking my call.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, David.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Just a couple last ones. Just to be clear on the accretion – net accretion from ERICO, you say that $0.05 of net accretion after accelerated integration costs. So, is it $0.05 you're adding back the amortization? Are there any other things that we should think about?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, it's on an adjusted basis, right? So, it's ex-amortization. The things like it's rebranding, re-signing, all the startup costs, if you will, that we'd like to get them out of the way quickly, as opposed to, less quickly.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. So sort of we might expect sort of a kitchen sink dump in the fourth quarter on that part, like we did with Tyco.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I don't like that characterization.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Sorry, I didn't mean it in a pejorative sense.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. It's expenses that might have been realized overall a -- within 2016 that we're going to get done and behind us in the fourth quarter.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay, perfect. And then lastly, just as we start to think about – you had some comments about destocking in the channel, and I think you addressed some of the receivables issue. But maybe you can provide a little bit more commentary about the strength in the channel. Do you see some channel partners weak that might get even weaker and you might have to, I guess, reshuffle some of the partnerships where you might see some impact? And then lastly, just sort of a little bit more emerging market color. You touched upon Brazil and China on the Valve side, but maybe you can kind of talk about the rest of the business.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: The first part, no, we don't see any of this causing disruption in our channels, certainly not at the moment. And obviously, we'll be closely watching that as we enter into 2016 and help (1:02:36) sustain this capital spending pauses. As far as the other geographies, I mean, as I mentioned, I mean, North America was doing well and then we saw the currency change, and we saw pullback in the overall North American model. And now we've seen a global malaise, I guess.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I mean, in fast food we have fast growth. I mean, China and Brazil gets a lot of attention, but actually Southeast Asia is growing for us.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I'm talking about at the Pentair level. Latin America, ex Brazil, has grown for us, actually the Middle East overall has grown for us. So, we still have opportunities and promise in those markets even as those larger countries struggle a bit.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you all.
Jim Lucas - Vice President-Investor Relations & Strategic Planning: All right. Thank you, everyone.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Lindsey, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Pentair Q2 2015 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Mr. Jim Lucas, Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Planning, you may begin your conference.
Jim Lucas - Vice President-Investor Relations & Strategic Planning: Thanks, Lindsey, and welcome to Pentair's second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. We're glad you could join us. With me today is Randy Hogan, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Stauch, our Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, we will provide details on our second quarter 2015 performance as well as our third quarter and full-year 2015 outlook, as outlined in this morning's release. Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as the risks outlined in Pentair's most recent 10-K and today's release. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today, and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results. Today's webcast is accompanied by a presentation, which can be found in the Investors section of Pentair's website. We will reference these slides throughout our prepared remarks. Any references to non-GAAP financials are reconciled in the appendix of the presentation. We will be sure to reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. I would like to request that you limit your questions to one and a follow-up and get back in the queue for further questions, in order to ensure everyone an opportunity to ask their questions. I will now turn the call over to Randy.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin on slide four with a summary of how 2015 has started and how we see ourselves positioned for the remainder of 2015. When we reported our first quarter earnings a few months ago, we indicated cautious optimism that the first quarter was simply an anomaly and a slow start of the year that we and others were facing. While second quarter results came in close to our expectations, with Technical Solutions and Water Quality Systems delivering strong organic growth, we exited the quarter with increased concerns about our Valves & Controls segment. We now have a more cautious outlook on spending in energy and industrial and the ability of our Valves & Controls segment to navigate this more difficult environment in 2015. While energy was expected to be down this year, the first quarter slowdown in the broader industrial market has proven to be more than a pause, and we expect sluggish industrial capital spending to continue throughout 2015. Our Valves & Controls segment ended the quarter without the proper plan in place to manage through these increased market challenges. We've already made significant changes and are accelerating cost actions to position our Valves & Controls business better for the long term. As part of these efforts, we made a leadership change in Valves & Controls. I asked John Stauch to lean in and lead the efforts to more rapidly take out the costs needed to right-size the business given the market challenges we face. I'll talk in more detail in a few slides about what we're doing to more appropriately position the business given the ongoing industrial challenges that are expected to continue into 2016. With the industry challenges within Valves & Controls and no improvement expected in industrial, we've revised our 2015 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $3.80 to $3.90, which now excludes approximately $0.45 of non-cash amortization. Our prior guidance of $3.80 included amortization. So on a like-for-like basis, the new guidance range would be $3.35 to $3.45. Going forward, we will exclude non-cash amortization for our adjusted EPS guidance to better reflect the company's performance. John will discuss this in more detail later in the call. Our balance sheet remains healthy and we expect 2015 to still be a strong free cash flow year. We'll continue to invest in M&A where appropriate. We have two segments performing very well. And now that it's stabilizing, we are accelerating actions within Valves & Controls to right-size the business for the industry reset. Now let's turn to slide five for a discussion of our second quarter results in more detail. The second quarter saw core sales decline 2%, which is an improvement from the 4% core sales decline experienced in the first quarter. Food and beverage remained strong and we also saw growth within residential and commercial. FX remained a significant headwind in the quarter. Given the continued top-line pressure, particularly within Valves & Controls, productivity and price were not enough to compensate, and adjusted operating income declined and margins contracted in the quarter. Free cash flow improved sequentially but was behind last year's comparable level due to working capital timing. We expect free cash flow for the full year to still be roughly 120% of net income. Now let's turn to slide six for a more detailed look at the second quarter results. Our 2% core sales decline consisted of negative 3 points of volume and 1 point of positive contribution from price. Foreign exchange subtracted another 7%. Adjusted operating income declined 12% in the quarter and operating margins contracted 50 basis points, even though we continued to see lean, sourcing actions, and standardization efforts in G&A gain traction. We expect to see continued margin contraction in the second half, as the accelerated cost actions in Valves & Controls are not expected to read out until 2016. Now let's turn to slide seven for a review of our largest segment, Valves & Controls. For the second quarter, Valves & Controls core sales declined 11% and foreign exchange translation was a further 10% headwind. Currency translation continued to have a negative impact and the quarter ending backlog was flat sequentially, following declines in the preceding two quarters. However, we do not believe this is a turning point and we expect order volatility in both long-cycle and short-cycle businesses to continue over the intermediate term. Core orders declined 12%, which we will discuss in more detail in the next slide. Core sales in all four Valves & Controls sub-verticals were down during the quarter, with a particularly sharp decrease in industrial process sales. In particular, we saw a continued slowdown in spending, including MRO in chemical and petrochemical in Europe and Asia. We also saw a further pause in buying decisions in North American chemical and petrochemicals. The projects in the backlog, while delayed, still appear to be moving forward. As we indicated last quarter, many customers are delaying shipments and this is not just confined to upstream oil and gas. LNG in North America is one area that has been a bright spot, but it is not nearly enough to offset the overall continued decline in CapEx in the global Oil & Gas value chain. The right half of the page shows second quarter Valves & Controls operating profits and margins. While our lean, sourcing and G&A standardization continue to drive productivity within Valves & Controls, it was not nearly enough to offset the sharp volume declines. In addition, FX translation had some impact on the 42% drop in operating income. Now let's turn to slide eight for a look at the backlog in orders for Valves & Controls. As you can see on slide eight, Valves & Controls backlog is broken down into four key sub-verticals, three of which we've put in our Energy vertical, Oil & Gas, Power, and Mining, and one in our Industrial vertical, which is the Process business. Orders were down in all four sub-verticals, with the exception of Power, which did see a 7% increase in core orders. As we indicated previously, LNG in North America has been the one bright spot compared to overall weakness across the entire Oil & Gas value chain. In addition, with project activity being weak, short-cycle MRO business was down mid-single digits for the second consecutive quarter. The good news is that our quoting funnel remains quite healthy, but these quotes have not yet turned into orders. These ongoing push-outs essentially yield an even lower market demand. As we indicated last quarter, we do not expect orders to improve during 2015, as customers continue to reevaluate existing projects in their pipelines of planned projects. The next several quarters will be focused more on cost while handling the increased pricing pressure on the existing business today. However, we continue to believe in the long-term prospects for Valves & Controls and the transformation underway. Now let's move to slide nine to discuss the actions we're taking to right-size our Valves & Controls segment. Valves & Controls is facing increasing challenges across its businesses. Oil and gas CapEx is down over 20% across the globe, and that's not been confined to just exploration and production. We continue to see orders shift to the right and uncertainty with respect to the timing of these projects only increases each quarter they're delayed. We continue to see pricing pressure within the quote funnel. The two pockets of strength we've seen in North America, LNG and petrochemicals, have not been enough to overcome the global capital spending cuts elsewhere. Though there's been some optimism that delayed projects would break loose and this would be just a cyclical downturn, we now believe what has occurred is truly an industry reset. We must acknowledge this reality and aggressively right-size the cost structure of the Valves & Controls business. While we announced previously that we were beginning cost-out actions, the pace has not been urgent enough. We've now identified over $100 million of targeted 2016 savings. This will come in a few different areas. First, we're more aggressively driving sourcing initiatives to offset the pricing pressures. Second, we're looking at the entire footprint from distribution to manufacturing to service. Third, we're also retooling the sales force with more of a focus on key accounts and selling motions, including more specialized sales. We've made good progress on reducing G&A, but there's still room for further improvement. We've made many, many great strides in the nearly three years we've owned the business, and we've run this playbook successfully in other businesses in the past. With the right leadership and planning now in place, we believe we're in a position to navigate successfully the sales decline we expect to continue through next year. We expect to come out of this stronger. A simpler, higher execution business combined with our leadership in the valves and controls industry will enable us we believe to get Valves & Controls back on track to achieving our profitability goals. Now let's move to slide 10 for a look at our Flow & Filtration Solutions segment. Flow & Filtration Solutions saw a 12% top-line decline, as core sales fell 5% and foreign exchange translation was an additional 7% negative impact. Food and beverage showed growth in the quarter, as global beer and dairy remained strong. Residential and commercial was down 10%, as floods throughout the Central region in the U.S. impacted sales of our pumps. Both infrastructure and industrial showed a small decline, but infrastructure saw orders and backlogs stabilize and we expect to see this read out in a return to growth as we exit the year. Segment income declined 8%, but margins expanded 60 basis points as cost action and pricing read out in the quarter. Productivity was strong and the decision to exit low-margin products, while impacting the top line, is helping the profitability of the segment. The focus for Flow & Filtration Solutions is to stabilize the business and drive margin expansion in 2015, and the second quarter performance was a good step in getting the business to where we want it to be. Now let's move to slide 11 for a look at Water Quality Systems. Water Quality Systems was a bright spot once again, with core sales growth of 6%. Despite the flooding in Texas and its impact on pool sales, we saw our residential and commercial vertical grow 5%. In addition to continued growth from our aquatics business, our water and purification business saw gains in Europe and China. The food and beverage vertical was up an impressive 10%, as both our foodservice and aquaculture businesses delivered another strong quarter. The right half of the page shows first quarter Water Quality Systems operating profits and margins. Segment income grew 5% and margins expanded 40 basis points to 22.1%. Price offset inflation and productivity remained strong. We continue to invest in this business in the form of sales, marketing, and new product development. Our outlook for the Water Quality Systems remains very positive, and we expect to see solid growth and margin expansion for the full year. Let's now turn to slide 12 for a look at Technical Solutions results. Technical Solutions saw core sales growth of 6%, which was offset by a 6% FX translation headwind. After a challenging first quarter, the segment posted strong growth in both energy and residential and commercial, while industrial was up a solid 4%. Infrastructure was the only vertical that was down. This was against a very tough comparison last year. Within energy, we continued to ship on two projects in Canada. But more importantly, we saw good backlog growth during the quarter. We recognize that many of these smaller project wins could be subject to delay and are watching them closely. Within our equipment protection business, we saw an improvement from a very challenging first quarter, but the outlook for industrial is guarded and the second half could see muted growth. Within residential and commercial, our building solutions business had solid growth, and the recent acquisition of Nuheat has gotten off to a good start with Pentair. The right half of the page shows first quarter Technical Solutions operating profits and margins. Segment income grew 5% and margins expanded 110 basis points to 19.9%. Price was modest in the quarter but material inflation began to moderate. Productivity was strong despite some ongoing negative FX translation costs. Going into the second half, we expect to see some mix pressures on margin as we see more project than product sales in our industrial heat trace business, while the top line growth will drive good income growth. Now let's turn to slide 13 for a look at our key priorities for each of our four segments. Before I turn the call over to John to discuss our outlook in more detail, I want to update you on our key priorities in each of our four segments. As we discussed in detail already on the call today, our key focus near term within Valves & Controls is aggressively adjusting to the significant industrial reset they're facing. Our second half financial outlook sees further income pressure as our repositioning of the business is not expected to read out in the financials until 2016. We're confident the issues Valves & Controls faces are fixable and we can return the business to its improvement agenda. While John will be leading the business in the interim, we have a strong team in place, including a new sales leader. We believe we have made great strides operationally as well as reducing complexity in the business, yet there remain many opportunities to better align the salesforce, especially on driving the short-cycle business. We're also aggressively looking at the footprint, which includes manufacturing, distribution, and services. While we have made good progress on reducing G&A and we remain committed to our operating model transformation that's underway, the depth of the initial reset will allow us to further improve G&A. There are growth opportunities within Valves & Controls, particularly with North America LNG and petrochem, and we will continue to competitively bid in a disciplined manner on projects across all served industries. We expect orders to remain pressured through the first half of 2016, and we will watch closely for signs of the bottom. Our focus within Flow & Filtration is margin expansion in the short term, but we remain excited about the long-term growth opportunities within this segment. When we aligned our Flow & Filtration businesses earlier this year, it was to improve our ability to deliver solutions to our customers. We've discussed often that our strategy is informed by the food, water, and energy nexus in the growing middle class globally, as this places pressure on the demand for resources. We have a strong portfolio technologies to help solve the needs of a range of customers by combining pumps, valves, and filters into solutions that allows us to drive growth in areas such as industrial water reuse, beer, dairy, and energy recovery. By the end of 2015, we expect to see our investments start to deliver growth and that will be seen in a return to a more consistent predictable top line. We have two high-performing segments in Water Quality Systems and Technical Solutions. Water Quality Systems had some good momentum as the majority of their businesses is within the residential and commercial and food and beverage verticals. Technical Solutions is weathering a slower industrial CapEx cycle, but a solid energy backlog puts them in a good position to grow within a very challenging industry, at least this year. While both Water Quality Systems and Technical Solutions have strong organic growth opportunities ahead, we also continue to build the funnel around strategic bolt-on acquisitions, as these two segments have earned the right to do M&A. With that, I'll turn the call over to John to provide additional color on our outlook.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Andy. Please turn to slide number 14, titled 2015 Current Outlook. This slide looks at the changes that have occurred since we last updated our forecast in April. The biggest change to our guidance, as you can see, is that volume remains a challenge, primarily within our Valves & Controls segment. Price remains in line with what we have been expecting, and FX has actually improved modestly from when we last updated guidance. The negative operating leverage on this additional volume decline could not be offset quickly enough, and we are working to right-size the Valves & Controls business, as Randy stated earlier on the call. Food and beverage remains strong as does residential and commercial, but energy is facing a large reset, as excess capacity that we've built has not been met by expected demand. For our industrial vertical, we are not expecting any second half recovery as industrial CapEx remains muted. While three segments are expected to deliver margin expansion for the full year, given the challenges within Valves & Controls, overall operating margins are expected to contract for the company. Last quarter we discussed cost actions we were taking to help mitigate FX headwinds and top line pressures. But now we'd like to be even more aggressive in right-sizing the Valve & Controls, and we expect we will get the cost out and better position the business for an eventual industry recovery. Please turn to slide number 15, labeled 2015 Adjusted EPS Outlook. I want to take a moment to discuss the change we are making to our adjusted earnings outlook to avoid any confusion that may arise. Our prior guidance included the amortization that we carry from past acquisitions, which we do not believe accurately reflects the underlying performance of the company. Beginning with this quarter, we will exclude intangible amortization from our adjusted EPS guidance. On a like-for-like basis, our prior guidance of $3.80 per share for 2015 has been lowered to a range of $3.35 to $3.45, which relates to what we view as an industry reset faced by our Valves & Controls segment. As a result, excluding $0.45 of amortization, our new 2015 guidance of $3.80 to $3.90 would compare to $4.22 in 2014 on a like-for-like basis, not the $3.78 of adjusted EPS we reported last year. We have included a reconciliation at the back of our earnings presentation to show what the comparable year-ago period would look like in our new adjusted EPS look. Please turn to slide number 16, labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. Ending debt was approximately $3.3 billion, or $3.2 billion on a net debt basis, inclusive of global cash on hand. In the first half of this year, we returned over $300 million of cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. As a reminder, we completed $200 million in share repurchases during the first quarter, and we have $800 million left under our current $1 billion authorization. Our ROIC ended the quarter at 10.9%. As expected, free cash flow did improve from the first quarter, but our working capital performance is still not where we'd like it to be given our top line performance so far this year. The working capital opportunities, mostly inventory, are within Valves & Controls and Flow & Filtration Solutions, and we remain strongly committed to our free cash flow targets for the full year and still expect to generate 120% or greater of net income. Please turn to slide number 17, labeled Improved Cash Generating Capabilities. The left-hand side of the slide is one we introduced recently, and it demonstrates how the cash generating capabilities of the company have changed over the past couple of years. We have a long successful track record of converting 100% of net income into free cash flow. But for the past couple of years, that number has been close to 120%. Given the working capital opportunities we believe that we have over the next few years, we expect our free cash flow conversion to continue to run at these higher levels. However, over the longer term, given our amortization, we expect to generate free cash flow close to 110% of net income. The right-hand side of the page is a reminder that our capital allocation strategy remains disciplined and consistent. We remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating. We have raised our dividend for 39 consecutive years, and our dividend yield is competitive at 2%. We continue to invest in organic growth. And finally, we'll continue to look at using our excess cash flow in the best way to drive long-term ROIC improvement, whether that be acquisitions, share repurchases, or a combination of both. Please turn to slide number 18, labeled Q3 2015 Pentair Outlook. For the third quarter, we expect core sales to decline approximately 2% to 3% and FX to present a 6% headwind. At a core basis, we expect Valves & Controls sales to be down 11% to 12% based on the shippable backlog, and we expect to be further project delays. Flow & Filtration Solutions core sales are anticipated to be down 4% to 5% on slower industrial and infrastructure business. Water Quality Systems core sales are expected to grow 7% to 8% on continued strength in aquatics, foodservice, and environmental systems. Finally, Technical Solutions core sales are anticipated to be up 2% to 4% on the strength of energy backlog in our heat management solutions business, offset partially by continued sluggish industrial capital spending. We expect adjusted operating income to be down roughly 18% and adjusted operating margins to contract 140 basis points to 13.8%. Below the operating line, we anticipate our tax rate to be approximately 23%, net interest and other to be around $19 million, and the share count to be approximately 182 million. Our third quarter adjusted EPS guidance range of $0.94 to $0.97 represents a decline of roughly 14% year over year. We also expect free cash flow to continue to improve as we manage working capital closely. Please turn to slide 19, labeled Full Year 2015 Pentair Outlook. For the full year, we are now expecting adjusted EPS of $3.80 to $3.90, which excludes intangible amortization. For the full year, we expect core sales to decline 2% to 3% and FX to be around a 6% headwind. Valves & Controls sales are anticipated to be down 11% to 12% on a core basis. Flow & Filtration Solutions sales are expected to be down 4% to 6% on a core basis. Water Quality Systems sales are anticipated to be up 6% to 7% on a core basis, and Technical Solution sales expected to be up 1% to 2% on a core basis. We anticipate growth in our residential and commercial and food and beverage verticals, with energy declines expected to continue and industrial to remain sluggish. We expect adjusted operating income to be down 14% for the year and adjusted operating margins to compress 70 basis points to 13.8%. We have talked at length during this call about the actions we are taking to right-size the Valves & Controls business, and we expect to enter 2016 stronger as we navigate near-term market challenges, mostly in energy and industrial. We expect overall corporate costs to be approximately $90 million, net interest and other to be around $73 million, our full-year tax rate to be around 23%, and the share count for the full year to be approximately 183 million. Adjusted EPS is now expected to be down roughly 9% at the midpoint of the range. Finally, we expect another strong year of free cash flow at approximately $750 million or greater than 120% of net income. Lindsey, can you please open the line for questions? Thank you.
Operator: Certainly. Your first question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Bernstein. Your line is now open.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks and good morning, all.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hi, Steve.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: I'd love to dig into the whole commentary around industry reset and make sure I understand the difference between a reset and structural problems, as evidenced by pricing pressure and increased competition in Valves & Controls. So, Randy, could you just maybe clarify your thinking on this front? Are you seeing increased competition? What are you seeing in the marketplace? You talked about excess capacity, et cetera, from a structural perspective.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Let me back up and just talk about – what we did during the quarter is we actually saw – as you can see, we saw revenue come in about where we thought we were seeing, but we weren't seeing the margins come in. So when we dug in deeper, we saw that the business was under more margin pressure. That was less about price and more about the fact that the costs that we had agreed would come out weren't coming out, and that's cost above material. And at the same time, we saw too much optimism in terms of all of the products not only in the quote log that was going to close, but in the backlog some more hope than certainty about when those things would ship. So as we looked at those realities, we said we need to be much more radical about our cost reductions, we need to accelerate a lot of our thinking about reducing the complexity in the business. And that's why John and I leaned in, and I have John specifically leaning in even deeper to drive a bigger cost-out agenda. Yes, we're seeing more price competition. We even feel it a little bit on the MRO side, though that's anecdotal, not a trend. And I think basically the longer this goes on and if you look at the whole industry serving oil and gas and all elements of it, there's going to be a wringing out of cost to get efficiency. And so for us to compete in this environment, we characterize that as an industry reset. The business was hoping it was just a temporary downturn. That's why we used the language we did. That reality is well understood now in the business and the requirements to take the costs out are known and we want to show a commitment to action.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: John, I don't know if you want to add anything, but go ahead, Steve.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: What do you think is happening on the competition side? Given the industry situation and excess capacity, are you actually seeing some of the smaller or mid-sized guys struggling to the point where you could see some industry consolidation occur more aggressively as a result of that, and what do you think is on that front?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Absolutely, Steve. This is John. I think to Randy's point, we're seeing quotes in funnels that we're getting quote dates on them and then those quote dates are being pushed again to next quarter and the quarter after. The reality is the longer those quotes gets pushed off, the more likely they are not to be let, at least not in this year. So we do have a lot more competition quoting for jobs. There's a lot more time to evaluate other competitive orders against other competitive orders because we're not in a rush to get it done in 30 days or 60 days on the quote side. And there is more competition coming in. And as Randy mentioned, we've got to be competitive ourselves and we are going to continue to see the smaller people be more aggressive. But if they don't win, then I think there's a consolidation that has to occur.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Right. Over time I think it will lead to more consolidation. The smaller guys, they're bidding to keep their doors open and they get aggressive on price.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And is that a place where you'd want to participate in the consolidation in that sector as opposed to your other businesses?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: As I mentioned, we have two really high performing, as high performing as any business as anybody has in Water Quality and Technical Solutions, and they're ready to go on M&A. I think we could do well in the consolidating of the valves space, but I want to sort our own situation out first so I can do that with confidence.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: All right, fair enough. Before I hand it off, just one more thing. Are you seeing on the inventory commentary inventory advances or working capital pressure as a result of the current environment? Is your outlook for working capital pressured at all because of the customer situation at this point?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: No, I think not. You can see the signs. We still improved working capital in the quarter, we just didn't improve it as much as last year. And that's as much because sales was down so much. It takes a while to shovel it out, if you will, as sales come down. So we've got great processes on receivables. And a big part of it is in Valves & Controls, and because of their hopefulness around some of the stuff breaking loose, they were less aggressive on the inventory side than I think they will be going forward.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Deane.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: I'd like to stay within this industry reset definition and maybe if you could share with us in Valves & Controls what the CapEx decline expectations are for this year. You said it's 20% year to date. How bad do you think it turns out for the year? And maybe if you can give the specifics around upstream, midstream, downstream.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: There's a lot of data out there, Deane. We've seen it as bad as 30% on the high end of the data that we've seen. And that would probably represent the upstream CapEx spending where the cuts are harder, and we've seen the average that we were using around 20%. It's a little less than the downstream and a little deeper in the upstream. The midstream is, as Randy mentioned, especially outside oil and gas and LNG, et cetera, is still in a relatively growth mode. So it's a pretty deep cut. And we think that given the fact that we've come through two quarters, it's not likely that August and July, which tend to be slower months, are going to rapidly pick up. And then when you come out of the Q3 window and you've got one quarter left, it's very easy to push those projects into next year. So we're taking the view that the high end of the range is what's likely to occur, and we think that this lingers through the first half of 2016, and then we're hopeful that it starts to recover at the end of 2016 as some forecasts would suggest.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: So I would think of it as – obviously exploration and production, the exploration side is down the most, and that's well understood. But particularly the large integrateds, they cut capital more generally. And we understand how that works for a big company. It could be as much as 30%. That's what we're using as our planning assumption.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Is that 30% across the upstream, midstream, downstream, so in total for Valves & Controls?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yes, I'd say roughly it fits. It's how we're looking at it, how it will impact us.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: So that's why we're being more aggressive on cost. And, Deane, you followed us a long time. We've been, unfortunately, at this movie before, so we know how to get it to turn out right.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: All right. So just from our perspective, it looks like you are being very conservative, and certainly you couldn't look at this and say you're being optimistic. So we like seeing a point that it could worsen from here, and we know this is an industry event, not a Pentair execution side. And then, just to switch gears, if we could, Randy, to the extent that you can, can you comment on the activist news, any initial discussions? And very specifically, I think where everyone was a bit surprised was the emphasis that you all would be a consolidator in the Flow segment. And maybe if you could, reconcile what your ambitions are in M&A versus what the activist might be suggesting.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: We have a lot of shareholders, and we've talked to all of them. We welcome constructive input from all of them. So we've had discussions with a lot of folks. That's why we've led to a lot of things we've done. I talked for some time about the fact that we have – and it's one of the reasons why we changed the way we were talking about earnings. We believe we have an advantaged structure. We have strong execution skills. We have proven that we can do large and creative deals and pull them off well despite what we're seeing now, which is as you said, a market downturn, not an issue with what we've done with the business. So we are logically the right consolidator. It was part of the vision as we looked at it to build the company and get scale and have this advantaged structure. And we want to put it to work. We want to put it to work across the segments in a way that creates shareholder value going forward. We think we are aligned with shareholders on creating shareholder value. We're not happy. We're not satisfied at all with recent performance, and we're open to all kinds of ideas. And we believe we've earned the right to be a consolidator, and we want to be.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Robert Baird. Your line is now open.
Michael P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Good morning, guys.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hi.
Michael P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): On the cost saves side, could you just line out what's incremental this quarter versus what you guys lined out on the first quarter? It certainly sounds like you're layering on more cost saves going into next year based on just three months ago, but I wouldn't mind hearing what the difference is and, if you can, put some numbers around it.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So when we came out of Q1, and I'll just talk to Valves & Controls specifically, Mike, and I'm going to come back to the other GBUs, which are actually performing relatively well in the markets that they're involved in. We wanted to get $40 million to $60 million across Valves into 2015 to 2016, and that was relative to expecting that the foreign exchange headwinds would be about that and suggesting that that would be a permanent reset that needed to be dealt with. We're now tasking, if you look at the slide, close to $135 million of costs out when you add in the sourcing benefits, and so those are comparable numbers. We did not and have not felt like we're going to realize much of that first opportunity of cost that we wanted to get out, and that's why we're making the change and ongoing in there with Randy's direction. And we're working through how to get it out in a way that actually reduces complexity, improves the customer experience, and positions us well for the recovery when it happens.
Michael P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): That makes sense, and then on the pricing, last question there. I don't want to beat a dead horse. But can you talk about the pricing on a net basis in the marketplace today? Obviously, you're seeing some pressure from a bidding perspective. But when you think about how you guys are sourcing with commodity deflation – probably there's a little bit of a benefit for you guys. How is that lining out cumulatively for you guys?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: As we look at it, even in Valves & Controls, when we're into the aftermarket or the MRO or the like product in a like market, the pricing pressure has been relatively flat. There's competition, but for the most part there is a desire to replace a like-for-like component there. And we're not seeing huge pricing pressure on the installed base. It's more the larger projects. The same would be true in the rest of Pentair as we go through into the aftermarket. We're seeing modest price increases right now. Certainly we're not in a situation where we can raise price given where raw materials are. But we are net-net in a positive position on that, as you suggest.
Michael P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC: Hi, good morning. So obviously, the process markets are treating you with a lot of difficulty like everyone else. My question is really about within 30 days – I'm sorry, 90 days, we've had what I would call a draconian change in the way you guys are talking about this business. It was looking weak, and now it's looking really weak. So my question is a couple years ago, we went to a structure where your global business unit heads reported directly to you. And I'm wondering now if we need another layer in there because it just seems as if whatever happened in Valves & Controls I believe should have been sniffed out a little earlier than this given the degree. Could you bring some thought to that, Randy, and whether in fact the company needs a COO?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Scott, it's John. Real quick, let me just give you the Valves & Controls view. When you take a look at the quote funnels Randy mentioned, it was at record levels. We have a record quote funnel. I think the a-ha moment for us was when we started to ask appropriately the movement in that funnel, what was actually getting quoted, what was actually getting pushed out, how many of those projects have been there for long periods of time. And then you get to the fact that there was a lot of projects in there that we honestly felt were not going to get quoted this year and therefore not going to come into backlog. It's very easy for people to want to believe in an optimistic forecast, especially in the future, because it takes away the pain of having to deal with the reality. And so we're acknowledging the reality of where we are. We're getting on with the solutions that we have to implement, and that's where we're going forward. I think it was our questioning of the leadership and going through that funnel that led to the realization that the back half was not going to recover. Now there's a lot of market data out there that would say that there is some hope that the second half will recover. We're just not buying into it.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Layers don't improve. Simplicity layers don't improve communication. Layers don't do anything except for expand capacity which – I think that would be a fair question to ask. When our COO retired, we asked four presidents to step up to be mini COOs. Could we have seen this sooner? Probably. Should we have seen it sooner? Your judgment, it's up to you. But we did see it. And we thought we acted as fast as any COO would have ever acted.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC: Fair enough, thank you for that answer. Let me just ask this one follow-up, if I can. On the synergies with the Valves & Controls business, we had that number pegged at about $270 million, if I recall. I was just wondering how much synergy savings, separate and apart from your restructuring, is still on the come for you guys in this business.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Let me start by – let's look at the arc of Valve & Controls since we got it. If you take a look at our current outlook on a like-for-like basis – John, correct my numbers to get them accurate, we were down $400 million in sales. Yet on $400 million down in sales, we will have the same margin as the business had when we bought it. That isn't because we haven't done anything. That is because we've done a lot. And with volume, we get the cost structure down more. Even with pricing pressure, we'll be a winner in this. We've had to do this before. It's not pleasant. Yes, I wish I started it six months ago or even three months ago. We started it a month ago. And so all the cost we took out is out. This business wouldn't be making 10% right now in this outlook if we hadn't. It was making 10% when we bought it. John?
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC: So you're saying that the answer to my question is that the costs are out, the $270 million is done.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yes, run the math and you'll see what this business would look like if we hadn't done what we did already.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC: Thank you.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: But there's still too much complexity. There's still too much. There's still opportunity.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Joe.
Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Just touching on the leadership change for a second in Valves & Controls, can I just better understand what your thought process is right now? John is going to take over in the interim. You mentioned you hired a new sales leader. I'm just trying to understand what the long-term direction of the management team is on that business.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Sure. One of our management philosophies is when you don't fully understand what the core issues are, you go to the problem. That's what we expect in leaders. You go to the problem. You understand the problem yourself. And then you define the execution plan, and then you act. And that's what John and I did on this. And what we do is, to the earlier point, you've got the layers out of the way in order for you to see that. And we decided that rather than appoint a new president right away, we should understand the problem more fully. And I have ultimate trust in John. And barring myself doing it, John is the right guy to do it. So we will find and appoint the right president for that and make a very thoughtful choice. And so the structure will still be four presidents, four segments.
Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. But I guess from a timing perspective, how long do you think it will take to really decipher what's going on and then start to think about who the successor would be?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Right now, we've got a good handle on the cost and we're working through some of the changes we want to make to be more effective on the sales end. But I'm not going to gate it to that. We're going to take the time this time to find the right – and judge the people to get the right leader, which maybe we should have taken a little more time to do.
Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: All right, that's fair enough. And, John, maybe going back to your comment earlier on the $135 million in cost-outs, to your point, it seems like you didn't really realize much of it in the second quarter. And so I'm just trying to get a sense for the cadence. How much do you expect to see in 2015 versus the benefits that you would expect to see in 2016?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: We have very little of that expectation into the 2015 forecast.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: We did have some in the prior forecast.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: We did have some modest in the prior forecast, but very little of the overall expectation is in the actual 2015 expectations at the moment. I would expect that we're at a full run rate basis by Q4, but the nature of how we bring that through to manufacturing and inventories, we would expect to see that benefit in 2016.
Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, all right. That's helpful. Maybe just following up on that for one second. Given that we haven't seen a lot of pricing pressure yet on the Valves business but maybe there's some to come in the second half, would you then expect the decrementals to potentially get worse then from here in the second half of the year, or do you expect some of the benefits to help offset that? I'm just trying to get a sense for what your thinking is within the guidance.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: We've gauged the trend on the margin pressure into the back half of the year, and we have not yet put any of the expectation of the savings into the back half of the year.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: So we believe we have pretty sober assumptions about the decrementals.
Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, fair enough. Thanks, guys.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Just on Technical products, you guys cut the forecast there on sales as well as margins a bit. I think on the sales front, it looks like the fourth quarter is going to be really tough there. Can you maybe just talk about those dynamics?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: We have an energy and industrial business in Technical Solutions, and we took a little bit of the trends that we're seeing in the Valves & Controls business and applied them to some of the fourth quarter assumptions, thinking that some of that might slip into 2016.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And so that's like backlog-related business like maybe some offshore stuff where the backlog rolls down?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Correct.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then on this cash EPS change, obviously there was a filing from one of your major shareholders that talked about this move. This happens a few weeks after that comes out. Was there something that was in consideration prior to the activist discussion? It just seems the timing here in concert with the $0.40 EPS cut, I'm just curious as to what the thought process was on that front.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: We've been considering this for some time and we've been hinting at this for some time in several of other earnings calls and analyst discussions where we had the slides out there showing the impact of the amortization. When we take a look at our advantaged structure, how Randy said, we don't think necessarily people are looking at below the EBITDA valuation of the company and we think the performance isn't being properly reflected.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. One last question. If you adjust to the new margin guidance for Tyco Valves & Controls, and clearly I think without the cost-out you would be at a lower profit level. That's pretty clear in light of the revenue dynamics. What is your return? Have you reset that return on that investment? Where is your return now on the Tyco Flow deal ROI?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: It's still exceptionally high. We're well north of 10% on that deal. You've got to remember that the advantaged structure also leaks over into the value on the rest of the Pentair businesses. So the structure itself and what it's done to optimize the below the line has helped us immensely.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Right, the tax benefits.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thermal has done very well.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Your line is now open.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Good morning, guys.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Shannon.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Good morning.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Hey. Can you explain a little bit more this retooling of the sales force in Valves & Controls? I know obviously there's just a ton of end market pressure on you guys right now. But even back when those end markets were pretty decent, it seems like there was work to be done on retooling the sales force. What are the issues there that you're trying to resolve and what do you think the fix is?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: We're working with a professional sales leader. And we have always felt that where a territory leader might have a budget, that budget is not properly broken out by account. And we feel it takes a different type of sales leader to call on a global account, a different type of sales leader call on an EPC and then a different type of sales leader to call on the base MRO/services opportunities. In some cases, that was the same sales leader in that territory calling on all three. So we're looking at it from a customer back account-based optimization and looking at those metrics globally to make sure we're properly dealing with the opportunities in the regions where those opportunities exist and we're making sure that we have that optimization. We're also going a step further to say once that quote comes in, how do we optimize the quote process. And when we're in a standard product quoting, we should have that in hours, not days. And when we get into longer-cycle engineer to order, there should be some thoughtfulness put into which projects we should be quoting and what is the prioritization of what's in the backlog, not all projects being equal. So that's what we've been working on. We've been working on that for close to nine months now. We've rolled it out in some of the regions and seen some great results from it. And we think we're going to continue to advance that sales optimization throughout the rest of 2015 into 2016.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: And is there another business within Pentair that you're modeling that off of that does that well, or is that something outside the company that you're using where you've seen that work?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Clearly, our aquatic systems business is account-based, sales-focused, calls on the end user, specifically on the end user, and that's served us quite well. We do also have other pockets of success in Pentair that we're modeling that against it as well.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: And then just in terms of the acquisition potential in Water Quality and Technical Solutions, I understand those are the ones operating well, and so they're the ones that are ready to fire away on acquisitions if they find them. But can you just give us a little sense what that market map looks like for those businesses in terms where you could take them via acquisition?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: There are a number of opportunities for consolidation there. They're still pretty fragmented, too, when you take a look at Water Quality, which includes the whole residential and commercial filtration area. It includes the aquatics area, which is pool; and then the aquaculture space, which gets us into some food processing, which is growing very rapidly. It's just small still, still small. So really there's a pretty broad play there. We're large in residential filtration. We think residential and commercial filtration is a good space. And now I think it's really well in a good home in Water Quality Systems. Then in Technical Solutions, we have a high-performing, high-execution business that has done great with everything we've ever put in there. And there's still – despite the consolidation that's going on in the whole industrial and electrical space, there are still opportunities there.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Okay.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I'm not going to get into it right now.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: That's helpful. Thanks a lot, guys.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Jeff.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, just as a follow-on to Shannon's question, can you just talk about what's in the pipeline more imminent or visibility within those two segments where you want to grow and how that does or doesn't impact how you're thinking about buyback?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I'm not going to talk about – we have things in the pipeline. That's as far as I want to go. And we have a $1 billion authorization. We already did the first $200 million of it this year, and that was what we intended to do. So I wouldn't announce any change in that. So we've talked for some time about the fact that we've been looking. But there have to be sellers as well as buyers. I guess that goes without saying. I don't know if I...
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Jeff, and the other thing I would add is we have a very active pipeline. It's across a lot of our growth, as we call them, platforms or technology positions. We're always looking at that active pipeline. And right now, I would feel that we're far enough down the line on several of them that we feel that our current capital allocation plan is appropriate.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then just real quick on Tech Solutions and the Thermal business, can you just speak to maybe why that business is growing so nicely in this tough environment and maybe the disconnect versus what you're seeing in Valves & Controls?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I would say that they went through their – the thermal business went through their adjustment to the new reality in oil prices when oil prices first started to fall. And even before they started to fall, when the oil fans, which is a large segment for thermal large market, cancelled a lot of projects. And so a lot of their opportunity was wrung out during 2013, even the fourth quarter of 2012 and 2014. And then their focus was on winning the things that we thought would really happen, and they did. So those are in the backlog now. That's why we showed a measure of caution about how long that will continue. But right now, they have a good backlog. They have great execution. They've been very responsive to customers' needs to reconfigure projects to save money, and our team is really good now. And so the backlog is good, but I mentioned actually the backlog is up in the quarter and there are a lot of smaller projects. There's a fair degree of maintenance in that business. So these small projects we think are pretty solid, but we're going to be cautious given what we've seen in Valves & Controls.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: All right, thanks a lot.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones from Stifel. Your line is now open.
Nathan H. Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, Randy, John, Jim.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Nathan H. Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: If I could just ask you a question about slide 14, you have a lower sales outlook there of $110 million and an operating income impact there of an additional $90 million just on volume, which is a decremental margin on that of about 82%, which seems incredibly high. I would have thought just not buying steel would have the decremental being lower in that. And obviously, it looks like zero benefit from any restructuring actions. What could move the needle there so that that is not quite as bad as what you've put in that forecast?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So your math is right. The slide is right. We reviewed the slide and did the same look internally. It is solely related to the drop in the operating income outlook of Valves & Controls, and you're seeing there both the high volume drop-through, which is the high decrementals in the first bullet, plus the realization that the cost actions that Randy and I tasked them to focus on this year are not likely to occur this year.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: (59:23).
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And that's the impact that you're seeing that drifts into (59:28).
Nathan H. Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. So the absence of some benefit from cost actions in there as well, as Jeff illustrated, leverage on sales.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: The positive change is accelerating those actions and realizing the benefit on these actions or doing slightly better on the expected booked margin of those projects.
Nathan H. Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, thanks. And then I'm just going to actually ask a question that's not on energy. You said the residential and commercial – I thought you'd enjoy that. The residential and commercial part in Flow & Filtration was down 10%, with a big impact there from the floods. Could you possibly quantify that and how that business is tracking ex those discrete events?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: As we've said before, we've exited some product lines, which has been a good margin – not products but basically the big box sales. We've been over a two-year process of exiting that, and that's been a margin lift, but it's been a top line and that's probably half of it. And then we actually think we're making pretty good progress on the pro side. But basically, all our distributors stopped buying and it just started raining and that's a pretty big market. And we believe others have seen that as well. So we don't believe it's going to stay down that low. We think the residential/commercial growth or market growth that's showing in Water Quality Systems is more along the lines of the end markets that we're seeing. There, we even grew in China.
Nathan H. Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And we must be about lapping the big box exit now, correct?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: At the end of 2015.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: End of 2015.
Nathan H. Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: End of 2015. Okay, thanks very much.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Yes, hi. Good morning.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay. I'm going to ask one in Valves & Controls and then I'll move on as well. But on Valves & Controls, and I think it relates to Nathan's question also. So I guess I just didn't understand the explanation there, just the fact that you're not going to be realizing some of the savings you had previously anticipated. I don't understand why that would add to the incremental the way you're describing it. The incremental should be incremental on the volume. Just because you're not getting the savings, I would assume that doesn't – that would reduce the decremental, not augment the decremental.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: We're comparing to a previous forecast where the expectation of realizing those benefits was in it. We're not comparing to prior year. So what we're looking at and what we're saying is that the change in the year, the change in the forecast and revenue versus the April forecast about changing the operating income, that was the question he was asking. If you look at it year over year, you'll see those high decrementals as well, but they're close to being in the 60s, and that's just the difference between sales and material.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay. But maybe you could...
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: (1:02:27) other costs out.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay, I got it. But just maybe touching more on that, previously Valves & Controls, you were looking at 14% previously. Now you're looking at 10%, and 10% excludes intangible amortization as well. So it's probably more like a 500 basis point decline, maybe more, I don't know.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: It depends. We have not adjusted any of the segment margins for enhanced lag (1:02:50).
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC: That hasn't been adjusted, okay. But can you bridge that a little bit? How much of that is volume? And I know you're not baking any savings than they are now. How much of that is volume, price, and exclusion of savings? Can you maybe give a little bridge from that perspective?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: There are one to two points of standard margin decline on a year-over-year basis, and the rest is just the volume drop-through.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Just leverage.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC: So no price is in that number pressure?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I just said it's one to two points of margin decline.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay, got you. And then I'll just move on to – in Water Quality, so resi, commercial, food and beverage still doing well. Maybe food and beverage specifically, so that's been doing very well for a long time. Maybe just give a taste of how do you see the market progressing from here. Is that still going to be a source of growth for you? Is there an opportunity for that to remain a nice contributor for the top line?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: We think it will. We have innovative products. We have a great relationship with customers. Our newer products are gaining share. So in both the foodservice business and in food and beverage manufacturing, we expect that to continue.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay, thank you very much.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: All right.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Jody and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Pentair Q1 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Jim Lucas, VP of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.
Jim Lucas: Thanks, Jody. And welcome to Pentair's first quarter 2015 earnings call. We're glad you could join us. I'm Jim Lucas, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me today is Randy Hogan, our Chairman and CEO; and John Stauch, our Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, we will provide details on our first quarter 2015 performance, as well as our second quarter and full year 2015 outlook as outlined in this morning's release. Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as the risks outlined in Pentair's most recent 10-K and today's release. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results. Today's webcast is accompanied by a presentation, which can be found in the Investors section of Pentair's website. We will reference these slides throughout our prepared remarks. Any references to non-GAAP financials are reconciled in the appendix of the presentation. We will be sure to reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. I would like to request that you limit your questions to one and a follow up and get back in the queue for further questions in order to ensure everyone an opportunity to ask their questions. I will now turn the call over to Randy.
Randy Hogan: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Let me just begin on Slide 4 with a summary of how 2015 has started and how we see Pentair positioned for the remainder of 2015. As we announced two weeks ago this year has started off significantly below our initial forecast. We expected most of our energy related businesses to be challenged this year given the dramatic decline in oil prices in the second half of 2014. But a global capital spending freeze and its impact on industrial businesses was not foreseen. We do not see this to be a Pentair specific issue as this broad-based decline was across virtually every business, every geography and every market. In fact, the only geography of growth we saw was North America. We believe there is broad, economic uncertainty that is contributing to delays in our customer’s spending habits, and we have felt this in both large projects and some MRO business. As a result of the dramatic impact of FX translation and a significantly slower start to the year we are now taking a cautious position on any expected recovery this year. So we have gone back to our cost [paybook] and are working aggressively to adjust our cost structures accordingly. Our balance sheet remains healthy and we expect 2015 to still be a strong free cash flow year. We will continue to invest in M&A where appropriate while executing on costs. Given the uncertainty, we have rebuilt the plan to drive performance in 2015 to equal 2014. As a result we are adjusting our 2015 adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $3.80 per share, making 2015 a pause year. We believe that Pentair is in attractive markets for the long term. We have detailed plans in place to work through the anticipated near-term challenges and we are executing them. Now let us turn to Slide 5 for a quick look at our key 2015 forecast assumptions. Given the significantly slower start to 2015 as a result of the global capital strike we are experiencing, we are now expecting our core sales for the year to decline 2 to 3 percentage points instead of growing 2% to 3%. Given the first quarter top line shortfall and its negative operating leverage, we could not adjust our cost structure quickly enough in Q1. But we still expect operating margins to expand roughly 50 basis points for the full year. We completed $200 million of share repurchases in January, and we’re still focused on our active M&A list in our most attractive businesses. John will outline in detail the cost actions being taken both variable and fixed as we adjust to the start of 2015. As a result of these actions, we are expecting roughly 40 million of repositioning benefits this year, an accumulative 100 million plus in 2016. Our balance sheet capacity is over 800 million. Although the external headwinds have worsened, we are focusing on the elements within our control. This includes getting more aggressive on cost actions, continuing to invest in differentiated growth, and as I mentioned, select M&A where appropriate.  Now let us turn to Slide 6 for a discussion of our first-quarter results. This first quarter saw our core sales decline 4% as all verticals declined except Food & Beverage. The one geography that performed well was North America, but we saw weakness in all other key geographies, particularly in fast growth regions. As previously mentioned, FX was a significant headwind in the quarter. Given the sharper than anticipated volume declines, productivity and price were not enough to compensate and we saw adjusted operating income decline and margins contract in the quarter. Cash flow was a typical seasonal usage where we expect another strong free cash flow year, and expect significant improvements in sequential cash flow improvement. Now let us turn to Slide 7 for a more detailed look at the first quarter results. Our 4% core sales decline consists of 5 points of volume decline and one point of positive contribution from price. FX subtracted another 6%. Adjusted operating income declined 15% in the quarter and operating margins contracted 60 basis points, even though we continued to see lean sourcing actions and standardization efforts and G&A gained traction. We are accelerating our cost actions to adjust to the reality of the FX environment and lower core volumes, which should reverse this operating margin contraction.  Now let us turn to Slide 8 for a review of our largest segment, Valves & Controls. Valves & Controls has seen a fair amount of quarter to quarter volatility in its performance, and the first quarter saw both sales and orders fall double digits. North America was the one pocket of strength, particularly in processed and with LNG customers. But all other geographies were down with double-digit declines in fast growth regions as customers seem to be delaying and in some cases canceling projects. For the first quarter, Valves & Controls core sales declined 11% and FX translation was a further 8% headwind. Including significant adjustments due to currency translation the quarter ending backlog declined 4% sequentially following a 7% decline in the fourth quarter of 2014. Over half of this six-month backlog decline was the result of FX headwinds.  Given that backlog is generally shippable in the next 6 to 12 months we feel it was prudent to adjust backlog for FX to give the most appropriate view of the state of the business. Core orders declined 15%, which we’ll discuss in more detail in the next slide. Total orders declined 22% while including negative FX translation.  During the quarter we saw some customers [directed] delays of scheduled shipments, and this accelerated near the end of the quarter. We anticipate some delays and expedites in shipments every quarter. The first quarter saw an even greater amount of net delays than we are accustomed to seeing. We did not see a material increase in project cancellation. We are seeing more customers requesting delayed deliveries which is not surprising within oil and gas, but we have also seen in the process industries. The right half of the page shows first-quarter Valves & Controls operating profits and margins. While our lean sourcing and standardization continued to drive productivity within Valves & Controls, it was not enough to offset the volume drops in an already typically slow period, and FX translation also had some impact in the 30% drop in operating income. We are still making progress with our changed agenda and gross margins in Valves & Controls expanded as a result of strong productivity. So we continue to feel good about our efforts underway, including lean transformation and the OMT initiative within Valves & Controls. While the strong margins gains of the past two years are encouraging, there is much more to do. So we plan to go even more aggressively after the cost structure and getting results from where we are investing for growth.  Now let us turn to Slide 9 for a look at the orders and backlogs for Valves & Controls. As you can see on Slide 9, Valves & Controls backlog is broken down into four key industries, three of which fall under our energy vertical, those being oil and gas, power and mining, and one in our industrial vertical, which is called [process here]. Orders were down double digits across all four industries in the quarter, while the impacts to our energy related businesses were not a surprise given the decline in oil prices, process order weakness was not expected and declined globally with North America the lone bright spot. We are not expecting orders to improve during 2015 as customers continue to re-evaluate existing projects and in their pipelines for planning projects. Although backlog has been hurt by the stronger dollar, we saw a decline in our backlog in real business terms as well. We will continue to focus on capturing shorter cycle MRO business, which has remained somewhat stronger than projects. While we do not expect the global capital strike to last forever, we are being cautious and are rightsizing to the current reality that Valves & Controls is likely to see top line pressure throughout the year. We continue to believe in the long-term prospects for Valves & Controls and the transformation underway. For the next several quarters we will be focused more on cost, while anticipating increasing price pressure on the existing business.  Now let us move to Slide 10 for a look at flow and filtration solutions. Flow and filtration solutions saw a 13% top line decline. Its core sales fell 7% and FX translation was an additional 6% impact. All four verticals served by flow and filtration solutions saw a decline. Residential and commercial fell 11% as global weakness and destocking in some of our North American distributing channels impacted the top line. Infrastructure was down 14% as municipalities continued to delay spending, although we have remained more disciplined on pricing and believe we are seeing declines greater than in the served market. Food & Beverage was down 2% as the strength in global beer and diary was not enough to offset declines in agriculture spending. Segment income declined 16%, but margins contracted only 40 basis points despite the volumes, FX and mix drags during the quarter. Productivity readout was strong and we believe we continue to have a long runway for improvement in margins within flow and filtration solutions. Given the weaker top line environment we plan to go after more than just G&A standardization opportunities and accelerate our rightsizing efforts within this segment. Now let us move to Slide 11 for a look at Water Quality Systems. Water Quality Systems was a bright spot in the quarter with core sales growth of 4%. The growth within Water Quality Systems was not a surprise given that they are over 70% in North America and mostly serve the residential and commercial, including beverage verticals, which have been our two growth verticals recently. Our aquatic systems business started strongly and we believe it is well positioned entering the pool season. Our foodservice business continued to grow globally with core sales up 11% in the quarter. The right half of the page shows first quarter Water Quality Systems operating profits and margins. Segment income grew 3% and margins expanded 40 basis points to 16.1%. Price and productivity offset inflation and new product development investments continue. Our outlook for Water Quality Systems remains positive and we expect to see solid growth and margin expansion for the full year. Let us now turn to Slide 12 for a look at technical solutions results. Technical solutions saw core sales grow 1%, which was offset by a 6% FX translation headwind. Energy was up 2% as our heat management solutions business entered the year with strong backlog, including two larger projects beginning to shift. We will watch orders closely as the year progresses. Industrial was flat as our equipment protection business was impacted by delays in industrial spending that occurred in the quarter. Residential and commercial grew nicely and despite a tough comp, infrastructure also was up modestly driven by telecom. The right half of the page shows first-quarter technical solutions operating profits and margins. Segment income declined 8% and margins contracted 70 basis points to 18.4%. With the absence of price in the quarter, productivity was not enough to offset inflation and mix further hampered the income and margin performance during the quarter. Negative FX transaction cost were a factor in margins as strong growth in Canada, combined with the strengthening dollar, squeezed margins on our U.S.-made products. Following the end of the first quarter, we closed a small bolt on acquisition within technical solutions for our thermal building solutions business, which we believe has attractive growth opportunities. We have five criteria around acquisitions and this transaction met all five. The deal made strategic sense. It made financial sense. We were the right buyers. We have a detailed integration plan, and we know who will lead that integration. Process and Technical Solutions will be addressed in cost structure as a result of FX and mix, we believe we have interesting M&A tunnel for this segment.  Now let us turn to Slide 13 for a review of our key verticals and our expectations for growth in 2015. Given the difficult start to the year, we have adjusted our expectations across all verticals. Starting with industrial, our largest vertical representing roughly 29% of sales, we now expect core sales to decline 4% to 6% in 2015. While Valves & Controls continued to see strength in sales with its North American customers in the first quarter, the rest of the globe saw a sharp decline in orders. The remaining parts of Valves & Controls, industrial business, also saw weakness including industrial gas and shipbuilding. We now expect the channel and customer destocking to continue throughout the year and pricing is something that we are actively managing. Core sales in our second largest vertical, residential and commercial, are still expected to grow 2% to 3% for the full year. But the slow start to the year has lead us to shave a couple of points off of our expected full-year growth rate. We believe that our aquatics systems business within Water Quality Systems is well positioned for another strong pool season in North America, and while a smaller piece of our vertical we expect improvements in non-residential construction as well. Roughly 10% of our sales are within our Food & Beverage vertical, which we expect to grow 5% to 7% on a core basis for the full year. This is on the anticipated strength of our global beverage and food service businesses. Food service had a great first quarter and should stay strong through 2015. While core sales growth in beverage is also expected to be strong, this is a global business and we expect to be negatively impacted by FX translation. The strength in beverage is in both beer and diary. Within Food & Beverage, we also include the agriculture related businesses in flow and filtration solutions. While we are driving differentiated growth in agriculture, it will likely continue to be a drag on growth in our Food & Beverage vertical. Within our infrastructure vertical, which accounts for less than 10% of our overall sales, we are now anticipating a modest decline in core sales for 2015. We knew our electronics protection business in the technical space had tough comparisons to start the year, but we are encouraged to see modest growth in the first quarter. We expect our infrastructure related businesses within flow and filtration solution, serving global desalination, water treatment and water supply to continue to be challenged. While it appears the municipal desalination markets have bottomed, we do not expect any recovery this year. Within North America the infrastructure break and fix business, we expect it to remain mixed with continued price competition. We now expect energy core sales to decline 6% to 8% for the year. This includes oil and gas, power and mining industries for us. The upstream business has been as weak as we had anticipated. We now expect to continue the pause in shorter cycle downstream business with capital spending delays or reductions have spread to midstream and downstream as well. We saw continued strength in North America in LNG, but the majority of global oil and gas was as weak if not weaker than we are expecting entering 2015.  Let us now turn to Slide 14 for a look at our updated 2015 adjusted EPS guidance. As we take into account the challenging start to the year and the pause in global capital spending we are adjusting our guidance to approximately $3.80 per share from a range of $4.10 to $4.25 per share. The volume shortfall will not be overcome in one quarter. We are taking corrective cost actions that we expect to begin to read out in the second half of 2015, and also benefit 2016. Begum not foresee the industrial pause continuing indefinitely, but until we see customers beginning to spend again, we will remain cautious. In the meantime, we plan to continue to invest for the long term. Not all of our businesses have been impacted in the short term and with our strong balance sheet and cash flow we will be thoughtful as we look at M&A opportunities. With that, I'll turn the call over to John to give more details on the cost actions we are taking and provide additional color on the outlook. John?
John Stauch: Thank you, Randy. Please turn to Slide number 15 titled 2015-2016 cost actions. As Randy mentioned, we faced increasing headwinds in the first quarter and we are working to align our cost structure appropriately. To start, we saw a strengthening dollar create both top line and bottom-line headwinds. With euro at $1.07, we anticipate a $65 million operating income headwind for 2015. If the Euro were to move to parity against the dollar, it would create another $10 million impact on operating income. We’re not planning for the dollar to weaken, in fact we are assuming that this will be the new norm for the year, and are now implementing cost out actions to mitigate the translation impact on the go forward basis. If the dollar weakens, we would expect to benefit, but we’re not counting on it. The cost actions will primarily be in Valves & Controls and flow and filtration solutions, the two segments hit the hardest by the global capital spending pause. We expect these actions will yield $40 million in savings in 2015, an accumulative $100 million plus in 2016. We plan to continue to continue to focus on G&A and variable labor, but we are also expanding our cost actions through our fixed cost structure. Please turn to Slide 16 labeled 2015 current outlook. This slide looks at the changes that have occurred since we last updated our forecast in early February. We experienced lower than expected volumes in two of our larger verticals, energy and industrial, and we are now anticipating pricing to be flat for the year and down for the next three quarters. As our Valves & Controls segment is expected to see increase in pricing pressure as the year progresses. Within the residential and commercial vertical, we expect another strong year in North America, while anticipating residential spending around the globe at slower levels. We believe that Food & Beverage will continue to be a bright spot, where we expect benefits from commercial expansion. We do not expect the negative operating leverage from lower volumes to be offset immediately, and the translation impact discussed previously has become more challenging. We plan to continue to drive productivity and expect the cost savings from our actions to read out in the second half to help mitigate some of the top line challenges. We still expect operating margins to expand approximately 50 basis points to 15% for the full year. Please turn to Slide 17 labeled balance sheet and cash flow. Quarter-ending debt was approximately $3.4 billion or $3.3 billion on a net debt basis, inclusive of global cash on hand. In the first quarter, we returned 258 million in cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We completed $200 million in share repurchases during the quarter and we have $800 million left under our current $1 billion authorization. Our ROIC ended the quarter at 10.9%. The first quarter has historically been a seasonal usage of cash, just as it was this year, but we expect strong cash flow during the second quarter and throughout the second half of the year. Please turn to Slide 18 labeled 2015 forecasted cash flow usage and capital allocation. For the full year, we are expecting free cash flow of approximately $900 million or greater than 120% of net income. We anticipate returning nearly $200 million to shareholders through additional dividends for the remainder of the year. We remain committed to our investment grade rating and will remain disciplined in our capital allocation approach. We expect to continue to fund organic growth opportunities and that capital expenditures will be slightly ahead of depreciation. We still see select opportunity for M&A in some of our businesses. If these deals do not materialize as we get later into the year we will consider incremental share repurchases. Please turn to Slide 19 labeled Q2 2015 Pentair outlook. For the second quarter we expect core sales to decline approximately 3% to 4% and FX to present a 7% headwind. On a core basis, we expect Valves & Controls sales to be down 13% to 15% based on their shippable backlog and what we expect to be further project delays. Flow and filtration solutions core sales are anticipated to be down 3% to 4% on slower industrial and infrastructure business. Water Quality Systems core sales are expected to grow 6% to 7% as we enter the peak period for North American residential, which includes another expected strong pool season. Finally, technical solutions core sales are anticipated to be up 3% to 5% in the strength of energy backlog in our heat management solutions business, and some expected increase in industrial capital spending as the quarter progresses. We’re expecting adjusted operating income to be down roughly 10% and adjusted operating margins to contract 10 basis points to 15.1%. Below the operating line, we anticipate our tax rate to be approximately 23%, net interest and other to be around $18 million and the share count to be approximately 182 million. Our second quarter adjusted EPS range of $0.95 to $0.96 represents a decline of roughly 6% year-over-year. As mentioned previously, we are expecting a strong quarter of cash flows. Please turn to Slide 20 labeled full year 2015 Pentair outlook. For the full year we are now expecting adjusted EPS of roughly $3.80 as the cost actions we’re implementing in the second quarter not anticipated to be enough to fully offset the volume shortfall and negative FX translation impact that hit our first quarter results. For the full year, we expect core sales to decline 2% to 3% and FX to be around a 6% headwind. Valves & Controls sales are anticipated to be down 8% to 10% on a core basis. Flow and filtration solution sales are expected to be down 4% to 6% on a core basis. Water Quality Systems sales are anticipated to be up 6% to 7% on a core basis and technical solution sales are expected to be up 2% to 4% on a core basis. We anticipate growth in our residential and commercial and Food & Beverage verticals with energy and industrial decline expected to continue. We expect adjusted operating income to be down 5% for the year and adjusted operating margins to expand 50 basis points to 15%. We will continue to right size our cost structure for the economic realities we are facing. It will take time for those savings to begin to materialize. We expect overall corporate costs to be approximately $100 million, net interest and other to be around $73 million, and our full-year tax rate around 23%, and the share count for the full year to be approximately 182 million. Adjusted EPS is expected to be roughly flat in the pause year we are anticipating. Finally, we expect another strong year of free cash flow of approximately $900 million or greater than 120% of net income. Jody, can you please open the line for questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning everyone.
Randy Hogan: Good morning.
John Stauch: Hi Deane.
Deane Dray: Yeah, maybe we could start with the comments about the global CapEx spending freeze, and maybe take us through the cadence of the months and I am particularly interested in the comments regarding how it may have spilled into some of the MRO spending and maybe this was part of the destocking comment in your – the negative [Ph] announcement, so could we start there please?
Randy Hogan: Yeah, thanks Deane. Basically if you take the industrial market that we follow most closely is of course our equipment protection business, and actually industrial and that business, industrial showed some increasing weakness in Valves & Controls as the quarter went. But really we saw a pronounced decline in March in the other industrial businesses, the sell through distribution, which we believe is some destocking and uncertainty as the knock-on effect, which we can see in valves as we saw the knock-on from oil and gas into some slowdowns in other projects and delays in other projects. So we think there is a bit of a knock on effect and uncertainty that has caused this and we do believe this destocking, we even saw some destocking in the residential and commercial side in flow. So we do believe that distribution has taken a cautious turn in their re-ordering in industrial and in some places in residential and commercial.
Deane Dray: And then could you expand on that comment on energy regarding seeing the softness starting to work its way into your midstream and downstream businesses, I mean, clearly everyone has been set up for an upstream headwind, and that seems to be playing out a little bit earlier, but could you expand on the comments and any specifics regarding the midstream and downstream activities?
Randy Hogan: Well, we – particularly the downstream is bigger for us than upstream. So to see the oil and gas decline that we did and when we look at the projects we see a slowing in the orders rate across the board really. Our hit rate seems to be okay. But with the exceptions we pointed out, process, which we count as industrial, in North America was pretty good, but we saw a slowdown in process. In the fast growth markets we saw a slowdown in refining in the fast growth markets and now a lot of that is in specific countries like Brazil, which shouldn’t be much of a surprise. But we do think there is a knock-on effect and I think you can see it in oil and gas companies, who are basically constraining capital and [Indiscernible] constrains capital it is a blunter instrument than just precisely focused on projects. We also saw MRO decline, you know, single digits, but MRO sales in Valves & Controls generally has been up every quarter, and we actually saw a decline, which to us feels like a – obviously you have to maintain things. So, it feels like a slowdown in general capital spending to us in the downstream. We will see how this – if they see it too.
Deane Dray: And just last one from me related to the energy side, Randy you made some comments about delays versus cancellations in some of the orders and maybe just expand there by your major energy businesses, you know, how much are delays?
Randy Hogan: Yes, it was a comment about Valves & Controls, primarily the – our Valves & Controls ship later in projects cycles. And so, you know, every quarter we see projects get pushed out some because they don’t want the valves onsite until they are ready for them. But also usually there is some that get pulled in because projects speed up and slow down. So we always see a mix of delays and expedites in a quarter. We basically saw no expedites in the quarter. I would say delays were probably 20% higher than normal, but there were no expedites to offset it and that to me – that feels like to us just a general slowing on project execution. We have had some specifics, which I won’t get into, people exploring, we have had a few cancellations, but I can’t say that that is any – that is abnormal. You know, orders that we thought were going to go the projects we cancelled. But we are very cautious as to that was my comment about customers reviewing project pipelines. I think mergers in the industry affect that and the customers industry affects that and as they look at adjusting the capital obviously they’re going to take some projects off the list.
Deane Dray: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs, your line is open.
Joe Ritchie: Thank you and good morning Randy, John and Jim. So, my first question clearly oil and gas is weaker you’ve got this contingent effect it’s still over into industrial Randy you mentioned in your prepared comments that the delays accelerated in March. And so, I’m just trying to get, I’m trying to understand I guess, when I think about your organic growth guidance for the year of down 2 to down 3, your complicated puffer organic growth is down 4 in the first quarter and just trying to get the sense for what gives you the confidence that you’ll get some improvement as the year progresses?
John Stauch: Joe just to clarify its John. I think some of the Valves and Controls as we call Q3 and Q4 were not great quarters for us, so we started to see some of the slowdown from the order shortfalls in last Q1 and Q2, start to work its way in Q3 and Q4. So, some of those comps and Valves and Controls gets a little bit better, same thing in industrial (indiscernible) business solid backlog that we feel comfortable is going to continue to shift throughout the year. And then, residential commercial has been strong as Randy said in Water Quality Systems and we also start to anniversary some of the tougher headwinds in our flow and filtration solutions. I think we’ve looked at the organic growth and although we don’t see if we took a 90 day rolling average of historical sales we don’t see that improving throughout the year. We do think that gives us a little bit easier comparison to the back half of the year.
Joe Ritchie: Okay. Do you guys have any clarity at this point on the destocking and when you would anticipate some of the headwinds associated with destock to subside?
John Stauch: We think it continues in the Q2 for us, I mean, we look at some of the same bell weathers that you guys do in the industrial distribution side, I think they saw the slowdown a little later then we did and they started to correct as Randy mentioned and that started to work its way through our March shipments, we expect that to continue through April and May.
Joe Ritchie: Okay. And then, I guess one last question on – I’ll pass it up. On the restructuring side I applaud your efforts to take cost out just given the economic backdrop, can you just maybe provide some more clarity on the run rate that 100 million plus in 2016 just given the restructuring actions that you have 60 million this year, does that bake into some of the restructuring actions that you took last year as well because the magnitude of that number just seems like a big number and the payback seems quick?
John Stauch: Yes. These are new actions incremental to the things we’re working already in synergies and in fact as Randy and I met with the business precedence we’re still hopeful and our sales people are still hopeful that things going to improve throughout the year, we’re trying to be hopeful as we were trained, hope it’s not a plan and we think our view now is react to this new economic uncertainty and take the cost out. So which you’re seeing in G&A and then some entry into footprint actions finally in our Valves and Controls and other businesses where we can get after some product line moves and get ourselves right sized and competitive. As Randy mentioned in his remarks and I followed up, I mean, we now expect pricing to be the new norm in Valves and Controls and so even the projects that we’re anticipating wining we’re expecting to come at lower margins and so we’ve to accelerate our competiveness to continue to bring those projects in at the same drop through that we anticipated for.
Joe Ritchie: Okay, helpful guys, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan, your line is open.
Steve Tusa: Hi guys, good morning.
John Stauch: Good morning Steve.
Steve Tusa: So, just on the pricing dynamics, I guess this is just happening in Valves and the orders, just happening a little bit faster than expected in Valves and Controls, I mean, is pricing, are these orders kind of going to impact ’16 now or is this say kind of reshuffling in the backlog such as becoming more, it was longer cycle on the way up and it’s now shorter cycle on the way down I guess. And then, from that perspective prices already kind of stating here in that business in revenues, so I mean, how we think about pricing in the back half of the year does that actually go negative in the back half of the year in Valves?
John Stauch: Let me talk about 2000 – we think, we were very cautious on orders through the year which we think will effect Valves and Control sales in 2016. So, we don’t see a change really in sort of things going faster or slower, I think it’s going to be a tough year on order and we’re going to do everything we can do to win in a discipline way which will put switching the price. We already see pricing and you already heard about what customers are asking in terms of pricing. It might not just be in Valves and Controls, I mean, one of the things that effects does is if you’re, the example I used in – which was a surprise, it won’t be a surprise next time in terms of the transactional impact of effects that was an impact in our technical solutions business. Technical solutions really did pretty well in the quarter but we had a few surprises that being one that was a Canadian dollar transaction in the U.S. dollar cost and that hits prices. And as competitors as foreign, as non-U.S. competitors start using their change in cost advantage, price advantage we expect the challenging price environment in more than just Valves and Controls.
Steve Tusa: So when think about kind of this total price of Pentair going negative in the second half of this year?
Randy Hogan: Yes. We do think it goes slightly negative still in some of our distribution business we still expect to gain normal price increase and we have those through and they’ve been accepted but we would expect any project and certainly areas where we got a bid on a cost to the price negative to the back half of the year.
John Stauch: We’ve good material productivity that’s hung up on the balance sheet so that will get more productivity as we go through the year too which will help offset some of that price. But, we think it’s a more cautious plan to assume, we’re going to see tougher pricing environment.
Steve Tusa: And then, I think you said in Valves and Controls next year, just kind of a high level 100 to 200 basis points as kind of not out at the question, I mean, as you move through the quarter here and assume you’re just seeing on your dashboard, I mean, is that now maybe a little too aggressive, I mean, could we see more, we did – price decline in the long time in any of the markets we cover so the magnitude is always kind of tough, could it be worse in that do you think in ’16?
John Stauch: I don’t know, I think we’re – to address the previous question, we’re getting after the cost in aggressive way to continue to be competitive, so we’re anticipating a tougher environment on the quotes and we’ve got to have more cost competitiveness and so we’re looking to our suppliers to participate as we’re being after participate and we’re also looking on our own cost structure and trying to be more competitive within that cost structure. So, the goal here is to continue to improve margins even with the decline of the revenue and we’re going to have to be very aggressive to accomplish that.
Steve Tusa: Okay. One last quick question on free cash, what’s kind of the key lever to ramp that cash flow throughout the year, what’s kind of the one or two things that you’re looking at to play out because it’s little bit weaker than expected in the first quarter?
Randy Hogan: Yes. It’s right sizing the inventory in our working capital levels to the new one.
John Stauch: Yes. Basically we’re relying on working capital inventories to support the higher sales level and needs to be corrected and we know how.
Steve Tusa: Okay. So that’s a negative for margins going forward then?
John Stauch: That’s baked in.
Steve Tusa: Okay, thank you, thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Bernstein, your line is open.
Steven Winoker: Thanks and good morning. Just I want to stick on pricing and margin for a minute, we are entering this environment you had significant material deflation I think as a tailwind as well as pricing up until now has been helpful. Now those are both going against you and my question is given that you don't know how long this will last the restructuring that you have already taken and that is going to be fairly aggressive here how much more can you do there because there seems to be some risk to the margin opportunity going forward?
John Stauch: Yes Steve, I do want to be – I want to clarify something. I think we expect we have done really well in material productivity we expect material productivity to do even better going forward. We can see that and what we call the deferred productivity as Randy said what’s done in Q1, but its hung up in balance sheet and we work its way in a positive way throughout the rest of the year. We’re continuing to partner with our suppliers to anticipate these potential pricing headwinds and the pricing is an anticipated pricing. It’s not realized so we are expecting that environment is going to be tougher and we are managing it appropriately as when I want you to take away. In addition we are saying if it continues to get more competitive we have to be more competitive and therefore the other actions that we are taking to make sure the long term our margins are still very high.
Randy Hogan: On the comment about – concerned about cost cut getting into growth we are very cautious about touching our growth resources but what we are doing is, I am personally redoubling my efforts with our platform, we’re using our precedence to make sure that those investments we made are paying off. I didn't see enough read out of some of them in the first quarter.
Steven Winoker: Okay. And I think it’s also leads into sort of the broader question on M&A that you put out there which is clearly you are on the hunt for attractive M&A at this point in the current environment. But how are you thinking that about that as well given all the pressures that you are seeing yourself and what makes an attractive acquisition given the weakness that you are seeing out there?
John Stauch: One thing is that given how difficult and uncertain things are sometimes opportunities become available that weren't available before so it’s actually a good time to be looking but to your question how are we sure that we are ready, we that's one of the reason I put in the comments that we did in the prepared remarks on the small acquisition we just made, -- this is a good example, our thermal building solutions businesses is a growth business. We have some great innovations there and had a great year in growth last year. We expect to have a great year growth this year. This business built on is augment that are offering gives us more to put through our distribution channel. So, it fit those five questions, it fit our strategy well so there are strategy to drive growth, profitable growth it fit it well. The financials may think, we were able to do that deal with the comfortable set of financials that we know we can execute. We were the right buyers. We have the best fit that's why the financials work the best. And the last two things, we don't do a deal unless one we understand how we are going to integrate into the company and then two, we know who is going to in-charge be -- the in-charge of the integration and we trust them to execute it well. And so we are going to keep that – keep to that discipline and make sure that might start at the bottom and say which businesses are ready, which businesses are more strategically ready and capacity ready and we always do that but I think you should all count on this to continue to put that first.
Steven Winoker: And is Australia process on track the divestitures?
John Stauch: Yes. 
Steven Winoker: Okay. Alright. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham of Jefferies. Your line is open.
Scott Graham: Hey. Good morning. I am sorry to beat the old dead horse here but if we can just go to slide 13 where we have the forecast for organic by vertical. The energy number has only really been taken down 1 point versus two months ago and we are talking about more concerns about pricing and moving into mid stream and downstream which I think many of us did expect that but nevertheless I am just wondering why we are only down 1 point incrementally from the two months ago guidance particularly given the order scenario that was laid out on an earlier slide?
John Stauch: Yeah its fair question. Thanks for asking it. I think its couple of things and couple of factors in here, Valves and Controls is experiencing more challenging entering into environment, we are also experiencing some key wins in technical solution primarily around industrial e-trace so these are down streams and later projects there are productivity related and we are starting to see a pickup in that area. So, we do have a mix of where the projects are coming through our typical businesses but all in we have backlogs and those backlogs give us confidence that this is not only appropriate number that we will ship this year.
Randy Hogan: Yeah we also don't think that the – we think - -we don't think the MRO declines on the first quarter this sounds like one orbit plan, is going to be as acute as it was in the third quarter, as it was in the first quarter.
Scott Graham: Alright. Thank you. And the other – my follow-up would essentially be on the share repurchase so I know we are kind of back into the M&A hunt mode and all that which is great I think I am wondering though is that why would we wait on share repurchases given this environment. Do we, you say if we don't find anything then you are kind of – you buy shares sort of a guess that was implied for the second half of the year you have a ton of balance sheet capacity why would we wait for that?
John Stauch: We feel optimistic. We have been working for fair amount of time as Randy said we have what we call platforms or businesses underneath the four segments that are high performing both in revenue and also on the operating side and we want to continue to feed the core and we have enough in the pipeline that would give us the feeling that we are going to execute on some of those throughout the year if in fact we don't feel that those are going to come through we are not going to execute clearly we would take a look again at share repurchases.
Randy Hogan: Right I mean we can only use the part or one so if we can't use our M&A then we will have through that but if we use that when we won’t have M&A.
Scott Graham: Right. Fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Your line is open.
Shannon O'Callaghan: Good morning guys. 
John Stauch: Hi Shannon.
Shannon O'Callaghan: Hey. Can you give a little more color on the geographic difference in Valves and Controls, I mean, you mentioned that the fast growth regions were getting hit the worse maybe a little more kind of specific countries or types of projects just being on there and then in terms of North America being the only piece up was that basically just L&G being the area strength that was there a more positive in North America beyond that?
John Stauch: Starting with that North America was strong in process in industrial as well stronger and L&G was a nice pick up. We had a particular focus on North America and we have actually invested in coverage there and I think that actually helped in Valves and Controls when – few years ago when we first got into it, it looked like our coverage and our share in North America was weaker than it was in other so that's an investment that I think is actually has paid off a little bit. It’s obviously – somewhat by the overall trends. But on the fast growth side both China and Brazil we’re down significant double-digits in the quarter. And Brazil I guess isn’t that surprising, but China was more surprising than we expected and that was in chemicals as well as in oil and gas in industrial.
Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay. And then just maybe a follow-up on this global capital strike point, I mean, as you kind of made sense over the first quarter and talked to your customers what are the most cautious about or uncertain about that sort of driving the decision making is there one sort of macro concerns that's particularly weighing on people one or two things you tend here?
John Stauch: Well, I think the oil and gas industry is one of the biggest drivers in capital spending in the world and I think it’s the uncertain here on the knock-on effect and there is a lot of cuts and there is a high degree of caution and uncertainty about – well, there is projects that are getting delayed and won’t get done but just concern about what all that mean we believe that is the fact and that's why we think destocking. When we see in industrial space where we kind of exclusively distributors we were pretty confident that there is destocking effect going on. But we also – we have seen delays in not just oil and gas we have seen continued delays in deferrals and power. And I think that has more to do with the general need for electricity and the fact that the economy generally is just buttering along in the world and electricity needs grow with the economy so we have had a lot of power projects that are just delayed, delayed, delayed and the fact that percent delays in the first quarter in power were in the projects that we tracked whereas the percent delays was high in oil and gas.
Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.
Randy Hogan: And I would just add to that I think all the investment tasks could be considered now in the fact of where are the cost basis and while ago you wouldn't have thought of investing in Europe and look at the new competitive nature of how the European factories on the global basis are competitive again and all that gets paused to people to say where do I put my investment and what is my likely return is going to be. So I think there is a lot of uncertainty out there that needs to be worked through. I think we feel good that energy as long term is a great investment cycle and we are going to see that rebound and we also think the industrial cycle long term will rebound. We are not just planning for 2015.
Shannon O'Callaghan: Got it. Great. Thank guys. I appreciate it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones of Stifel. Your line is open.
Nathan Jones: Good morning Randy, John, Jim.
John Stauch: Morning.
Nathan Jones: There has been a lot of talk about the pricing pressure that you guys are feeling and are planning on feeling, can you discuss a little bit more where the opportunities are for you to put pressure on your suppliers in terms of pricing to participate in the pain if you will?
John Stauch: Yes, I think clearly global commodity prices are not increasing as Randy mentioned we don't want to use the word deflation yet but it feels like we are heading a little bit more into deflation area environment and so we are put our main suppliers on notice that we all have to work competitively to reduce our cost structures and certainly in the long cycle businesses we usually are participate in the “going in and asking everybody to participate with you” so we have our supply base primarily in those long cycle businesses that we certainly put on notice early, we tell them where we are in the quoting cycle and they are prepared, they being in the same headlines we all are and they know what’s coming so we just all have to be more productive and we all have to participate to win the orders.
Randy Hogan: So couple of things, if I am just going to add to that is the decline in oil prices has led to some good declines in prices in resins. We want to make sure that we are getting the benefit of that. The change in FX means say we are buying something in dollars today if we can get it from supplier who is making in the Euros or the Canadian dollar that can be a transactional benefit to us. So, I mean that's those are the kind of things that we have been working as we said because of the productivity gets defer to the balance sheet to the shipment. So, I mean, we actually feel pretty good about our material productivity, we feel good about the actions our team is taking even beyond what they have already booked in the balance sheet.
John Stauch: Nathan I think just to finalize this question I don't think this is unique to us and that's my point. I think the industry in itself is going to go through it together and so we are all going to be dealing with the same dynamics and I think we are prepared for it and we are anticipating to be prepared for it and we are making sure that all our partners are prepared for it.
Nathan Jones: Okay and my follow-up you talked about increasing pricing pressure in Valves, you talked about the residential and commercial part of flow and filtration thinking you saw a greater than market decline due to holding price. Can you talk about where the decision or how you think about the decision to hold the price and lose share versus cut price to protect share in various parts of the business.
John Stauch: To clarify the on the point about where we are being very discipline that's in water, that's in large pumps infrastructure. Large infrastructure pumps. It wasn't I might haven't – I am going to have it blend it together with a sentence before the residential and commercial but just to clarify that comment was about basically our large engineered flow pumps and they had loss on pricing, we felt took some things on lower margins so we changed that and we have more discipline now. We make those products in Europe. Those are more competitive we make those products in North America and in Mexico and well Mexico is good in North America is less competitive. So we are trying to keep pricing disciplines that reflect our margin goals but also where we make things in that infrastructure space. On the residential and commercial side, I would say we haven't really seen pricing pressure. We feel pretty good about that. There are some of the areas that were weaker in residential or not in North America, Europe and Middle East but we think Europe is actually showing some signs of life in residential and commercial that we didn't see it clearly in the first quarter. But we saw some promising signs. So, I would say that pricing is really more of a concern in energy and in industrial not in residential and commercial.
Nathan Jones: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Jeff Hammond: I’m all set guys, my questions have been answered.
John Stauch: Okay. Thanks Jeff.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg of Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.
Brian Konigsberg: Yes. High good morning. Couple of more on Valves and Controls just when it comes to the MRO and slowing that you noted are you seeing any in the customer base trying to in-source that service component to try to save cost or is that economically beneficial for the customer to do?
John Stauch: Right. I don't think, we haven’t seen any kind of trend in that regard at all because ours is mostly replacement in parts there is some service, in sort service but on the replacement which is replacing whole valves or whole servicing on existing valves that's I mean the parts for service valves. They have come back and our service revenue was not the issue. It was the parts and replacement valves that was down.
Brian Konigsberg: Okay. That makes sense. And also just on the pricing front are you seeing re-pricing of existing backlog or is it that the pricing pressure really on the new bids that you are pursuing?
Randy Hogan: New bids only.
Brian Konigsberg: New bids only. Okay and then lastly are you seeing any trends where for larger projects you are seeing the customer base or potentially EMC substitute start to substitute maybe some of the domestic higher quality suppliers of Valves and Controls with – maybe in some of the non-critical applications with some of the lower cost and potentially lower quality suppliers potentially out of Asia?
John Stauch: We have seen that before the decline in oil prices, we saw some more uses on – particularly on with close of the commodity products throughout the more commodity products and we expect that particularly where companies go to the EPCs for fixed bids. The EPCs have for some time used that as a focus to try to drive profit into their box frame. So that doesn’t always pay off in launch in Valves – don't work but we have seen that in the Middle East. We have seen that in Asia for a long time and we expect that will just continue.
Brian Konigsberg: That's it from me. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Drab of William Blair. Your line is open.
Brian Drab: Hey good morning. There is one more left I guess. You talked about the 100 million in cost cuts and the timing of that and that we are going to see it I guess more likely in Valves and Controls infiltration but I am just having I don't know how much color you can give on it having trouble figuring out where do you find that much in cost cuttings when you are so successful in developing cost synergies and attacking that after the merger if there is any more detail around the types of moves you can make that will be helpful?
John Stauch: Yes, I think the discipline is, we forecast where we are going to be in organic growth and we certainly look at right sizing labor and the variable cost associated with what those declines would be and then we also take a look at our fixed cost structures and our plans on where we want to be on standardization and we accelerate those based upon where we are on our ratios I mean when you are declining you got to hold margin and to hold margin you got to take your cost out at the rate of sales and then sum. So again we are – we have $6.5 billion in the company in sales and when you take a look at this as a percentage overall cost we are still relatively modest as far as the cost take out on the percentage cost and we have been pretty clear that the more we saw on the standardization front the more opportunities we actually saw in front of it.
Randy Hogan: The way we look at it is we benchmark against the best and you can look at our businesses and you can see two of our GBUs that do not have margins close to the best of the peers and that would be on filtration solutions GBU in our Valves and Controls GBU. So these are not plans that we invent in the moment. These are long range plans that we accelerate it. The – we have ambitions to get to the valves and control business to be the best among the bests in right margin so that's a roadmap that we have contemplated for some time and it’s just the matter of in this environment that you accelerate and we have done that before.
Brian Drab: Right. What's the long term target there Randy for that business if you could remind me. 
Randy Hogan: Well we have talked in Valves and Controls I mean I don't want people to think I am hallucinating given the first quarter we just had you know valves and controls was well above 15% margin we got it to 45 with lots of more opportunities. So we have talked about a number of well north of 15 but I don't want to give that again because I think it might lack credibility right now.
Brian Drab: Understood and then John what percentage of your cash is broad versus in the U.S. today?
John Stauch: Well, I mean two roughly – keep in mind we are outside the United States, so it’s not as relevant but we have roughly $100 million of cash that we hold in any given time under 150 and most of that is international are outside the U.S.
Brian Drab: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer, your line is open.
Christopher Glynn: Yes thanks. Hey good morning. So you made an effort to sort of ring-fence the price pressure dynamic. How do you feel about that exercise of being able to ring fence it in the guidance?
John Stauch: I am – I guess Chris I would say again we don't think it’s going to be unique to us and we think we are in the forward looking piece of it and I think if you are in this industry and space as you are not anticipating and I think it’s going to be a challenge later and so we feel like we have pushed the business to accept the reality of where we are and to get on with the solutions that would be required to still maintain competitiveness and bake the margins that we expect within that environment. We are hopeful we’re wrong, but I think the worse case is if we are wrong we feel like there is upside to it. I wouldn't want to be anticipating it not coming and then have to rely on the back half of the year to take the cost out. So, I think the fact that we are dealing with it now and right sizing where we think the businesses are, I think it’s going to put us in much better position for 2015 and 2016.
Christopher Glynn: Fair enough and then just quickly the MRO side I think would be debt pressure more concentrated in the first quarter could you just elaborate briefly on that?
Randy Hogan: Well, I mean most MROs is maintenance related and you can defer maintenance for a little while but you can't defer it forever and I mean there are – these are industries that care a lot about safety and so we believe that its MRO side is one that should be at least zero, and it wasn't it was negative and it has been positive right up until the first quarter. So that's why I mean I kind of view it as the same thing of destocking in distribution that can't go on forever.
Christopher Glynn: Right. It makes sense. Okay. Thanks.
Randy Hogan: Was that last question or – okay one more question. Thanks.
Operator: Your last question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski of Buckingham Research, your line is open.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Hi good morning guys and thanks for taking question. Just back on the comment on MRO Randy, if you can help me out on Valves and Controls it looks like first half to second half there is about maybe 500, 600 basis point acceleration in core growth actually looks like the comp gets a little tougher so maybe from your earlier comment Jim and I can follow up on the math there but how much of that acceleration would you call MRO kind of normalizing versus some visibility have in the backlog just trying to dimension out some of the drivers there?
Randy Hogan: Yes, I think it’s right sizing the shippable backlog and timing that out I mean I think there is most certainty as you move into Q2, Q3 and Q4 with what that backlog produces. We are not expecting a significant order rate in the back half of the year to be helping our revenues this year and we think you can't unless you are going to cancel the job you can't push these projects out for a while some of these are so far along and that will be – we’re pretty confident that we ship, it’s just the matter of the timing of when they are going to ship. So clearly we are taking a look at current run rate and you can look at the current run rates that we are seeing in Q1 and Q2 and take a look at the seasonality bumps that we normally see we are not expecting those seasonality bumps that usually happen to Q3 and Q4 at the full year capital projects finish out to be consistent with where they were in prior years.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Okay. I guess if you have to think about it backlog visibility versus MRO normalization half and half, 60:40?
John Stauch: We are probably most confident about the MRO which you know in any given years call it a billion dollar of business and we feel like that's within a deviation certainly going to be closed to right around where it was last year if not slightly better on a core basis. And then, the projects are coming out of the shippable backlog from that shipment timing.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Got you. Alright. Thanks John.
Randy Hogan: Alright. Thank you all.
Jim Lucas: Alright thank you. And Johnny if you can give the replay number.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Jim Lucas, you may begin your conference.
Jim Lucas: Thanks, Elisa. And welcome to Pentair's fourth quarter 2014 earnings conference call. We're glad you could join us. I'm Jim Lucas, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me today is Randy Hogan, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Stauch, our Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, we will provide details on our fourth quarter 2014 performance, as well as our first quarter and full year 2014 outlook as outlined in this morning's release.

We will be sure to reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. I would like to request that you limit your questions to one and follow up and get back in the queue for further questions in order that everyone has an opportunity to ask their questions.  I will now turn the call over to Randy.
Randy Hogan : Thanks, Jim. And good morning, everyone. Let me just begin with the summary of 2014 on Slide 4. As we highlighted during our outlook call in December, we are very pleased with the integration of Flow Control and our progress for last two years demonstrates the power the Pentair integrated management system or PIMS as a differentiating tool for integrating acquisitions. We are very pleased with how the company has come together and one Pentair culture has been firmly established. Yes, we know the best is still to come. In 2014, we delivered 2% core sales growth which we recognize as mid- pack at best. But our 160 basis points the margin expansion, 24% adjusted EPS growth and very strong free cash flow clearly places us in the upper quartile of performance last year compared to our peer group. In addition, we returned $1.4 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, a very solid year indeed. While the market environment remains challenging, we further simplified the business and consolidated GBU. We are more closely aligned around channels solutions than ever, we have structured our four business units as reporting segments allowing even more strategic alignment. 2014 was another good year for Pentair. We built momentum on our internal execution to drive shareholder value in 2015 and beyond. Now let's turn to Slide 5 for a quick look at our key 2015 forecast assumptions. Lots changed in the world since we provided initial 2015 outlook just last December. In our initially EPS guidance we provided a list of key variables that could impact the low, mid and high end of the range. Some of these have gotten better but unfortunately some more critical factors have gotten more negative. The further fall in oil prices is rightly came under the lot of attention with many other companies have indicated the ongoing strengthening dollar has created substantial foreign exchange headwinds as well. In mid December we forecasted an FX headwind of roughly $0.10 per share. This headwind is now doubled as the dollar further strengthened against most currencies. We've not sat by idly, and have continue to go after further cost structure resulting in recognizing additional restructuring in the fourth quarter as we've positioned for a continued push to achieve top line growth. These external challenges are also reflected in our core sales growth outlook, which is now targeted to be 2% to 3% down from 2% to 4%. To point out the top line is a response to the reality of substantial uncertainty in our energy vertical due to oil and gas. We've forecasted $200 million also buyback for 2015 and that is already been completed. Our balance sheet capacity remains over $1 billion and we will continue to remain disciplined in our capital allocation as we build an active M&A pipeline. Taking all these into consideration, we are adjusting our 2015 EPS guidance to a range of $4.10 to $4.25 from a range of $4.20 to $4.35, with a dime adjustments being solely related to the increase FX headwind. John will cover the 2015 outlook in greater detail later in the call. It is important for us to be realistic about the economic environment of the world day while we continue to execute on the elements within our control at a very high level. Now let's turn to Slide 6 for discussion of our fourth quarter results. We delivered a strong fourth quarter with the core sales growth of 2% which is in line with our forecast. We saw continued strength in our Residential and Commercial and Food & Beverage vertical while Industrial improved in the second half and appeared to build momentum entering the new year. Technical Solutions had another strong quarter with 7% core sales growth and Process Technologies also delivered strong core sales growth of 5%. We delivered 10% adjusted operating income growth, 160 basis points of margin expansion and 23% adjusted EPS growth. Free cash flow was very strong in the quarter and a full year as we generated nearly $900 million of full year free cash flow. We've represented 121% conversion of adjusted net income. This is a large part of Pentair's ongoing value proposition. Now let's turn to Slide 7 for more detail look at the fourth quarter results. Our 2% core sales growth consisted of one point of volume growth and one point of price. But FX was 4% headwind as a dollar strengthened later in the year. We are expecting this type of foreign exchange headwind to persist in 2015 with the first quarter facing a particularly tough comparison. The quarter's 10% adjusted operating income growth is also consistent with our long-term value proposition with price and productivity offsetting inflation. We saw inflation run fairly consistent throughout 2014 and raw material inflation may moderate, wage inflation is expected to persist. Our lean sourcing and standardization efforts continue to deliver, contributing to our 160 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. The fourth quarter showed solid core sales growth which we believe demonstrates the diversification in our portfolio and our strong internal execution highlights our unwavering focus to over deliver on the elements within our control. Now let's turn to Slide 8 for review of our largest segment, Valves & Controls. Values & Controls' fourth quarter sales declined 1% as we faced the very tough year-over-year comparison since the prior year Q4 included over $30 million of loan margin shipments out of the backlog. Including significant adjustments due to currency translation the quarter ending backlog declined 7% sequentially with over half of the decline a result of FX headwinds. Given the backlog is generally shippable in the next 6 to 12 months; we feel it's prudent to adjust backlog for FX to give the most appropriate view of the business. Core orders declined 6% which we will discuss in more detail in the next slide. Once again the sales results were mix for Valves & Controls with process up modestly, oil and gas down and power and mining both flat in the quarter. The right half of the page shows fourth quarter Valves & Controls' operating profit end margins. Although the top line had its fair share of volatility, the operating income performance within Valves & Controls has been very strong. Operating income grew 30% and operating margin expanded 470 basis points to 16.9%. While the comparable quarter's results were dragged down by the low margin shipments last year, Valves & Controls make tremendous progress in driving productivity as they build momentum in lean sourcing and standardization all part of PIMS. Now let's turn to Slide 9 for look at the orders and backlog for Valves & Controls. As you can see on slide 9, Valves & Controls' backlog is broken down in four key industries, three of which fall under our energy vertical, those are oil and gas, power and mining and one in our industrial vertical which the process business is. It's clearly been a lot of focus on our Valves & Controls business particularly its oil and gas exposure, 65% of the Valves & Controls is not oil and gas related. Orders remain volatile, core is growing in process and mining while they decline double digits in both oil and gas and power. The decline in oil and gas orders follow two quarters of orders growth was not unexpected given the dramatic decline in oil prices throughout the fourth quarter. Power and mining both continue to see evolved order pattern but excluding the negative impact of FX, backlog in these two smaller sub verticals appears to be stabilizing. Process orders showed small growth in the quarter and we continue to expect orders to grow in 2015 as the North American chemical build out continues. Valves & Controls' orders come later in the procurement cycle and projects that have already been commissioned continue to move forward, giving us confidence and some order momentum building in 2015.  Now let's move to Slide 10 for look at our Process Technologies segment. Process Technologies achieved another strong quarter growth with 5% core sales growth overall with all key verticals contributing. Food and Beverage growth is 7% and spread across both our beverage and food services businesses and residential and commercial saw growth from both pool and residential filtration. The right half of the page shows fourth quarter Process Technologies' operating profit and margins. So while the top line showed strength once again, this is the second quarter in a row where incoming margin performances were challenged. We continue to see opportunities to drive lean and standardization within many of our filtration businesses and have combined these businesses with flow to focus on accelerating the pace of change. While price and productivity were not enough to offset inflation this quarter, we've taken the necessary root cause counter measures and are focused on driving the type of income growth and margin expansion we expect on the strong core sales growth performance.  Now to move to Slide 11 for look at Flow Technologies. Flow Technology reported a core sales decline of 4%, half of which was attributable to our strategic decision to exit the big box channel and focus on a profitable pro channel. Despite this headwind our residential and commercial business showed a modest increase in the quarter. We are now pleased with our performance in industrial and infrastructure in the fourth quarter. We believe backlog is stabilized. While we do not anticipate this would read out fully in the first half of 2015, we do expect continuing improvement in both of these verticals within the segment as 2015 progresses. The right half of the page shows fourth quarter Flow Technologies' operating profits and margins. Operating income grew 5% and operating margins expand at 110 basis points to 10.3%. Flow Technologies delivered strong price and productivity while differentiating growth and improving mix should help continue the momentum we built to drive margins to higher performance level.  Let's now turn to Slide 12 for look at Technical Solutions results. Technical Solutions had another fantastic quarter with 7% core sales growth led by energy and residential and commercial. For the first time this year Technical Solutions posted a small decline in infrastructure as comparisons for the electronics business began to get more challenging. Within energy, we saw strength once again in the Canadian oil and sand shipping and projects currently in the backlog. Our heat management solutions business is more than just oil and gas and we saw strong orders and backlog growth in the fourth quarter driven by two large projects. Residential and commercial benefited from continued growth in Europe and North America. Industrial growth of 6% was led by our North American equipment protection and North American heat management solutions businesses. The right half of the page shows third quarter Technical Solutions' operating profits and margins. Operating income grew 7% in the quarter and operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 22.9%. Our price and productivity initiatives continue to outpace inflation while core sales growth leverage is partially offset by increased FX headwinds during the quarter.  Now let's turn to Slide 13 for review of 2014 full year results. In 2014, we delivered 2% core sales growth led by our Process Technologies and Technical Solutions segment. We completed our previous share buyback program during 2014. Adjusted operating income for the full year increased 13% and adjusted operating margin expanded 160 basis points to 14.5%. We made a lot of progress for last year's improving our operating margins but many opportunities remain to drive overall margin even higher. Free cash flow was nearly $900 million and represented 121% conversion of adjusted net income. I am pleased with our operating performance in 2014 and recognized we must continue to drive more consistent, predictable organic growth.  Let's now turn to Slide 14 for look at our Oil and Gas profile. Pentair has narrowly diversified industrial company operating in five verticals. Just under 20% of our business is exposed to global oil and gas market and over 80% of the portfolio participates in other verticals where we believe growth exist today. We highlighted this part of our portfolio in December outlook call and wanted to remind our shareholders that even within oil and gas we are diversified, specifically we are 5% exposed to upstream, 5% midstream and 9% downstream on a total Pentair's sales basis. Our upstream and midstream exposure is mostly in our Valves & Controls segment and are split roughly 60:40 between new constructions and install base. The upstream portion is where we believe the greatest uncertainty exists today. Our downstream exposures will involve Valves & Controls and Technical Solutions. During the fourth quarter, we mentioned previously we saw strong orders and backlog growth in our heat management solutions business within Technical Solutions. While there has been some focus recently on the outlook for refining, we continue to see strong MRO activity that I have not seen any slowing in maintenance spending as our focus on the install base continues to gain traction. The continued volatility in oil prices which remain below $50 per barrel does create a level of uncertainty within 19% of our portfolio. So our focus for our growth is squarely on the other 81% of our portfolio where we have several areas of opportunity entering 2015. As shown on Slide 15, our overall 2015 core sales growth profile by vertical. As you can see on 15 starting with industrial, our largest vertical representing roughly 29% of sales. We are forecasting 3% to 5% core sales growth in 2015. Our Valves & Controls business is expected to see improving orders during the year in North America as expansion and process industries continues. Within Technical Solutions our North American equipment protection business saw improving order trends in the second half of 2014 and globalize ISM report remain positive and support our expectations in industrial will remain solid. Our second largest vertical, residential and commercial has been our bright spot for past couple of years. In 2015 should see momentum that momentum continues. This vertical represents approximately 27% of our sales with large portion of our residential and commercial business exposed replacing spending which remains positive. We've recognized that our big box exit within Flow Technologies creates some modest headwind for this vertical but overall we are forecasting 46% core sales growth in residential and commercial. Roughly 10% of our sales are within food and beverage vertical. Our agriculture related businesses are facing markets that are likely to be down overall again in 2015. But both or irrigation and crop spray businesses are expected to deliver differentiated growth to mitigate some of the market related headwinds. Our food service business is expected to continue to perform well expanding with customers globally while also further penetrating areas such as grocery stores and convenient stores. We believe our beverage business is well positioned with global customers in the beer industry and we expect to see more growth as our dairy business gains momentum. Within our infrastructure vertical which accounts for less than 10% of our overall sales, we are forecasting modest growth in 2015. Our electronics business and Technical Solutions faces tough comparison in the first half of the year but the business is focused on winning new opportunities. Within our advanced filtration business it appears to global desalination markets and water treatment and finally reached a bottom after prolonged hibernation. And we are encouraged to see order in the fourth quarter of 2014. Within our engineered flow business, our infrastructure backlog improved in the back half for 2014. And leads us to believe that after challenging first quarter this business should see growth return in the second half. In addition to our 19% in oil and gas, we have another 8% of our sales in power and mining within our energy vertical. For 2015, we now expect core sales in energy to be down 5% to 7% on a core basis. With the momentum we are seeing in a majority of our portfolio there is non energy related is expected to drive low single digit overall core sales growth in 2015.  Let's now turn to Slide 16 for look at how we believe will driving shareholder value. Before I hand off the call to John, I wanted to focus on what we believe we are doing to drive shareholder value. Simply put, we remain focused on three areas. Organic growth, margin expansion and free cash flow and capital allocation. We've recognized in the last couple of years when the second and third performance quartile in organic growth. That's why we continue to sharpen the growth tools within our PIMS tools box. At the beginning of last year, we organized into 18 growth platforms under our four reporting segments, which provide us a better mechanism to prioritize investments across the enterprise. The platform focus allows us the ability to differentially fund and track growth actions on a more granular level within the businesses. While we cannot control the external economic environment, we are focused on driving differentiated growth in our most attractive businesses in our portfolio. That's already reading out in spots. Regarding margin expansion and free cash flow and capital allocation, we believe we have proven track record of success that places in the first quartile of performance, top of class. Over the last two years, we've expanded our adjusted operating margins over 300 basis points and we believe we have the proven play book to continue driving productivity and cost structure. Our free cash generation has increased dramatically for the last two years. We returned $2.3 billion to our shareholders through buyback and dividends for last two years. We remained disciplined in our capital allocation and our free cash flow is nearing $1 billion per year on an annual basis, allowing us more degrees of freedom than any other time in Pentair. All three components are important to driving shareholder value. We are doing very well in two areas and are focused on improving the third area, organic growth which we know is important to driving long-term shareholder value and we are committed to delivering that.  So with that I'll turn it over to John.
John Stauch : Thank you, Randy. Please turn to Slide number 17 titled 2014 Free Cash Flow Generation. Cash flow was strong 2014 as free cash flow for the year was $889 million, which represented 121% of net income. This is the second consecutive year that free cash flow exceeded a 120% of net income. Just as important, ROIC increased over 11%. Free cash flow is an important component of our value creation story and we remain committed to delivering strong free cash flow on a consistent basis. Please turn to Slide number 18 labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. As I mentioned on the previous slide, ROIC ended the year just over 11%, which we believe demonstrate the value creation from the Flow Control acquisition. We returned $1.4 billion to shareholders in 2014 through share repurchases and dividends. Our capital expenditures were lower last year to $130 million as we focused on fewer, higher return investments. But we expect that number to increase in 2015 as we continue to invest in growth and productivity initiatives across the company. Ending debt was $3 billion or $2.9 billion on a net debt basis inclusive of over cash on hand. Please turn to Slide number 19 labeled 2015 Forecasted Cash Flow Usage and Capital Allocation. We expect another strong year of free cash flow in 2015. With free cash expected to be around $925 million or greater than 115% of net income. We anticipate returning at least $440 million through share repurchases and dividends. Through January 2015, we completed $200 million of share repurchases under our current $1 billion authorization. And we've recently announced a dividend increase for the 39th consecutive year. We remained disciplined in our capital allocation approach which starts with our investment grade upgrading. We continue to fund organic growth opportunities and expect capital expenditures to be slightly ahead of depreciation. We are building our M&A funnel and expect to see acquisition activity return as the year progresses. We've made great strides in our standardization efforts and many of our businesses have earned the right to make strategic acquisitions. If we do not see deals materialize as we get later into the year, we will consider incremental share repurchases.  Please turn to Slide number 20 labeled New Pentair Segmentation. As Randy mentioned earlier in the call, we are further streamlined the organization and have eliminated a GBU. This means that each of our four remaining GBUs will now also be an external reporting segment. We expect this new alignment to help optimize the revenue expansion of our growth platforms while also driving standardization to PIMS within the platforms and GBUs. We have moved our former filtration and processed platforms and combined them with our former flow technologies business to create flow and filtration solution. The Process Technologies segment has been renamed Water Quality Systems and includes our product systems, water purification, food service and environmental systems platforms. Valves & Controls and Technical Solutions remains the same. For your modeling purposes we have included restated segment numbers in the appendix in today's presentation.  Please turn to Slide number 21 labeled Q1, 2015 Pentair Outlook. For the first quarter we expect core sales to increase 2% to 3% with the FX anticipated to be large 4% to 5% headwinds. On a core basis, we expect Valves & Controls sales to be flat based on their shippable backlog. Flow and filtration solutions sales are anticipated to be down 2% to 3% on a core basis which includes the big box exit. Water quality system sales are anticipated to grow 6% to 7% on a core basis with pool energy efficient penetration and continued growth in food service.  Finally, Technical Solutions sales are expected to be up 2% to 3% on a core basis with strength in both industrial and energy. We are expecting adjusted operating income to be flat and adjusted operating margins to expand 40 basis points to 12.6%. Below the last operating line we anticipate our tax rates to be approximately 23%, net interest and other to be around $18 million and share count to be approximately 180 million. Our first quarter adjusted EPS range of $0.75 to $0.77 represents 7% growth to the mid point. As a reminder, free cash flow is historically run negative in the first quarter.  Please turn to Slide number 22 labeled Full Year 2015 Outlook. As Randy mentioned earlier in the call, we are lowering our 2015 adjusted EPS guidance by a dime to range at $4.10 to $4.25. This reduction is solely attributable to the anticipated increased FX headwinds that we and most others are expecting. We continue to focus on the elements within our control and are working to deliver another year of double digit adjusted EPS growth. For the full year we expect core sales to grow 2% to 3% which we anticipate will be more than offset by 4% to 5% FX headwinds. Valves & Controls sales are anticipated to be flat to down 2% on core basis. We'll watch orders closely and continue to drive the short cycle business. Flow and filtrations solutions sales are expected to be up 3% to 5% on a core basis inclusive of the big box exit. Water quality system sales are anticipated to be up 5% to 7% on a core basis and technical solutions sales are expected to be up 3% to 5% on a core basis. We anticipate growth in our residential and commercial, industrial and food and beverage verticals while infrastructure is expected to improve as the year progresses. We expect adjusted operating income to be up 5% for the year and adjusted operating margins to expand 90 basis points to 15.4%. We continue to drive lean sourcing and standardization, expecting growth leverage to materialize within our businesses that are growing although FX headwinds will mitigate some of their leverage. We expect overall corporate cost to be approximately $105 million, net interest and other to be around $71 million. Our full year tax rate amount to 23% and the share count for the full year to be approximately 183 million. EPS growth is anticipated to increase 10% at the mid point of the range. Finally, we expect another strong year of free cash flow at approximately $925 million or greater than 115% of net income. Elisa, can you please open the line for questions. Thank you. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Steve Tusa: What are you assuming on the raw materials dynamics for this year? 
John Stauch : We are seeing -- we are expecting to see little inflation if no inflation is there, Steve. I mean clearly we are going to expect especially in Valves & Controls more difficult pricing environment with our large customers and they are going to ask us to work with our channel partners and suppliers to keep cost down. So we are basically assuming no inflation right in material. 
Steve Tusa: Okay. And is there anything that you kind of marked to market, is there any kind of benefit or anything like that?
Randy Hogan: Not really that. We are looking for -- how do we turn the FX change and doing advantage from a sourcing standpoint, yes. That's one of the active actions we have on; we don't have anything quantified yet, so Europe on sale and some other countries are too.
Steve Tusa: Right. On the oil and gas weakness in the fourth quarter. Where exactly could you maybe little more precise that where you saw that? The orders? 
John Stauch : We are downstream for sure. So what we saw was -- what we are recalling earlier, Steve is we saw those orders being delayed in Q2 and Q3. And in fact they just continued to push out so most of the weakness was in the downstream and the capital expenditure models of our customers. 
Steve Tusa: Sorry downstream or upstream?
John Stauch : No, upstream.
Steve Tusa: Yes, too many streams. 
Randy Hogan: Yes. You are already seeing rig counts declining. Projects that are committed the downstream once refining and other profit-- those committed ones are we think are moving ahead and we are seeing releases on those. What it means for downstream in 2016, we will figure out but we are seeing a much faster change in the upstream activity. Midstream, they look good.
Steve Tusa: Within your upstream, I know the business is pretty diverse globally. Within your upstream, is there any geography that you know I know this kind of parses it again but any geography that you are seeing that in? I mean it's pretty obvious the North America rate of changes obviously pretty dramatic keeping even though there were some companies that didn't really see it in the fourth quarter yet. Is it a global thing? Is it North America?
Randy Hogan: Well, yes, North America clearly is a lot of coverage on that. But North Sea offshore which is obviously North Sea even Middle East.
Steve Tusa: Okay, so it's in global stuff and then -- 
Randy Hogan: Really the -- on the upstream side they are rapidly looking at all the budgets globally so -- 
Steve Tusa: And then just one last comment. I mean this re-segmenting, I understand that there's a degree of perhaps cost saves associated with realignments and stuff. But this constant re-segmenting just breed's skepticism, I think, in the investment community. Hopefully, this is the last one. It really does not help, especially in an environment like this where there's a lot of stuff moving around. It does not help people gain confidence in the numbers.
Randy Hogan: I appreciate that. And we didn't do it to make anyone's life difficult or to make things opaque when we merge the companies two years ago; we have seven GBU that wasn't sustainable. We got down to five GBUs and what this alignment was we have some under performance in one of the GBUs, we are getting cost structure that's easy and fast but the real focus is to get -- we now have all of -- in water we have all of our standard product sold through distribution in one business and now we move the engineer solution or filtration together with the engineered solutions or flow particularly with the exit of the big box so we have more consistency of end market and channel this way. And hopefully get some leverage.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Your line is open.
Steven Winoker: Thanks and good morning, all. Randy, it sure sounds like you were declaring victory on Tyco Flow at the beginning of this call. And we are two years in, obviously some great margin expansion. But could you maybe expand a little bit on that and where you are headed? And what does that imply for your thinking about M&A going forward?
Randy Hogan: Yes. We feel pleased about where we are, we are two years in. I hesitate to call and declaring victory but we are pleased with our progress and I put it that way. And we are pleased because we believed in going in there, there were some very good businesses, they were not performing at the level they could perform if you apply good operating discipline. And this two years has proven that number one, yes, they are good businesses. Number two, our approach which we call PIMS was fundamental to bringing operating disciplines to those businesses very quickly. It raises our confidence and raises the Board's confidence; it raises many of shareholders' confidence that we can do it again. Our capacity is larger and what I mean by that our capacity and our expertise and the talent base we build to do it again. And we believe that we created a lot of value through doing it. And we talked before that the biggest myth in Tyco was the fact that if you go back to the Form -10 forecasted growth that they would see in those businesses was at least 3x higher than in all of the segments than what the world really delivered on that two years so we over delivered on what we controlled in an environment that turned out to be not as good. So what's the implication for M&A, we believe we have capability and we should put it to work. But we are going to remain discipline. We have the capacity, we mentioned in a $1 billion worth of capacity and but we are going to remain disciplined. We wanted to fit our five -- our five questions we always go through which is how does it fit our strategy? Number two, how is the financials work? Number three, why we the right buyer? Where is the value? And actually we have more offered there now with our capital structure and tax structure and our domicile. We actually have more unique opportunities to bring to play there. And then what's the integration plan importantly and what's the integration team? And we really got that right on Tyco. And we are not going to rush anything but we certainly up on our toes, on our balls of our feet looking out.
Steven Winoker: Okay. And on the oil and gas topic, let's assume for a minute that oil prices stabilize maybe even get a little bit better from here. In terms of -- I don't want to -- maybe I shouldn't use this word. Well, in terms of the damage that has already been done to this point right as this just -- the time -- can you help me with the pacing through orders and revenues and earnings, assuming things were to get a little bit better from here on the commodity side? Does that still -- how would that maybe change your outlook or how you're thinking about everything flowing through the business?
Randy Hogan: Well, I'll ask John to give you a little more detail on the forecast. As we look at our forecast -- our forecast is we restart valves to basically be flat year-over-year and it is going to work to be there because we are seeing some price pressures. Our base case of how we are looking at this is where our underlying base case is that oil is going to be in turmoil for at least another 9 to 10 months. And even when it gets back up to more what let's call it sustainable level of $70 a barrel. The spending in the oil companies isn't going to snap back as quickly and snapped away. And I think they remain cautious. But it is basically supply demand in balance. So the price went lower than people expected, so they weren't forecasting the six months ago, I tend to be cautious about the forecast they make now. That's why we are assuming -- we are not assuming that there is any kind of snap back. 
Steven Winoker: Okay. And when you mentioned downstream and petro -- and North America process build out on page 15 in industrial, the North America process build out, are you talking about petrochem and everything or do you include -- 
Randy Hogan: We put process industries and petrochemical not in a sort of after the refinery, petrochemical and other chemicals that aren't just petrol related. We put that in our industrial category. There are still a lot of attractive economics to most of those projects and we are not seeing cancellations there. Some of the ones that are on the deep planning board may have a little bit of doubt to them now but even the LNG facilities, all the ones that FERC has approved and we expect those to go forward. We still have the opportunities to ship natural gas overseas to other countries. We have in North America; we still have an advantage if not an even more advantaged situation. 
Steven Winoker: Okay and just building on Steve, just one last question. That page 10, process technology, is the only place where you had inflation not offsetting productivity and price. So is that part of having function of this additional segmentation? Is that what you're saying?
Randy Hogan: Yes. Our performance on productivity and managing inflation and actually price realization wasn't very good in that GBU. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Appreciate all the calibration you are providing on your oil exposure. And I know it's 19% of your portfolio, but that's where we're seeing most of the changes, and that's why you're getting all of these questions. So let me just chime in with mine. Just for clarification on slide 9, the energy backlog, the sequential decline. I believe you said that you had re-priced your backlog for FX. So how much of that sequential decline was in FX versus push-outs?
Randy Hogan: Yes. It is about half. What we did there as we -- that's the reality if you price it today and revalue it with FX today, so we just think that's like the better way to do it because if you sold it today that's what sort of would be add and Valves & Controls business we have fairly large book of business actually in Europe is booked in euros but to change that more in dollars, it is work to be done yet. So that's what we are doing there. 
Deane Dray: Have any of those backlogs been re-priced, customers coming back to you?
Randy Hogan: No. We are hearing from customers as John mentioned customers asking us to look hard at price and on what's being lack, what's being worked but not in what's in the backlog.
Deane Dray: Okay. And then if we go back to slide 5 which was very helpful in saying, look at the changes since the December outlook call, maybe just clarify on the restructuring comment, where in December there was modest, and then saying more aggressive. But it says 2014 restructuring. Does that suggest you did more in the quarter? And what about -- can you give us some color on the restructuring actions for 2015?
John Stauch : Yes. We did more in the quarter. It's really what we were referring to as we started to see some of the currency challenges and the oil and gas headwinds we went to the businesses and took incremental restructuring. So far up to 2015 we are not anticipating any more so our current guidance reflects net adjusted end reported are equal there. If we need to do more we will do more. 
Deane Dray: And then last question, John, since I've got you here. On FX, just refresh us on what types of natural hedges that you have, the currency exposure; might you be doing any translational hedging? We're seeing companies like GE and Honeywell talking about that. We're in an unprecedented FX headwind right now. Might you be doing anything additional on the hedging front? And especially if it ties to your foreign domicile, whether that's an advantage or a disadvantage?
Randy Hogan: Yes. So this number here represents the translational impact of the dollar against global currencies. It is unprecedented and being that the dollar strengthens against every currency generally in the world. I mean usually there are natural hedges where the dollar weakens against some and strengthens against others. There is as Randy mentioned also the transactional benefit that we would expect and that would come through the sourcing line where the lower currency is actually giving us productivity and less expensive purchases. I would think that somewhere in the 40% of this number range. And that we will see to the sourcing benefit. As far as what everybody else is doing a hedging, I remain interested and curious. We are looking at some of those options but quite frankly we got to find a way to make them work into our reporting and as you know you can hedge sequentially but you can't hedge year-over-year. So we have to be comfortable that if we were to do that everybody would understand what we are doing and I think right now there is -- it is anybody's call what's going to happen and so I am not a genius at hedging so we have to look at the upside and downside. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Joe Ritchie: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. My first question is on V&C. The margins were incredibly strong this quarter. And I basically wanted to just get a sense from you on the long-term trajectory of these margins. I think we've talked historically that this could be a high-teens type business. But just in light of your commentary on wage inflation, pricing could be a little bit more difficult in 2015. I'm just trying to understand the trajectory of that business moving forward.
John Stauch : Yes. I'll start with just framing and I mean we still think we are roughly 400 to 500 basis points behind what we call a peer group that continues to perform and improve their margins as well. And so we still haven't -- I look at this as opportunity but we acquired some 20 ERP systems and lots of global back offices and lots of entities that we never integrated, and so what we are doing and we are launching this year is OMT initiative which is our operating model transformation and as we go live we will be able to put all these businesses on a common framework and really believe that there is enormous potential that still remains on the margin side. I'll let Randy comment on incremental value for them.
Randy Hogan: Well, I mean really and we wanted to turn some of that increased capability to improving our differential growth. But we actually haven't touched the go to market side of Valves & Controls, so we are focusing on the operating side so that we can keep growth going but frankly I am disappointed with the performance on the growth side of Valves & Controls, so I think we need to leverage that to get better connected and leveraged and gain share on -- based on the execution improvements we've had in things like pressure management where we have moved situations very difficult up to being almost high performing in terms of delivery and quality. We should be gaining a lot more share from that. 
Joe Ritchie: Now that makes sense. But maybe following up on OMT, did you guys start to see some of the benefit already this quarter? And can you just remind us what your expectation is for the benefit in 2015?
John Stauch : A lot of the benefits that we have been getting in 2013 and 2014 were lean sourcing, lowering operational fruit, fixing quality delivery and over time and premium freight -- 
Randy Hogan: Then a few plant shutdown 
John Stauch : And then a few small plant closures as Randy mentioned. Also fixing some low margin product mix challenges, so a lot more of the operational prioritization side and what we realized in 2013 and 2014. What we are going to see now coming in 2015 and beyond will be the benefits of related to OMT is we would see coming through primarily the G&A side as well as more operational efficiencies and working capital improvement.
Joe Ritchie: Okay. And is there a number that you guys have quantified that is embedded in your guidance?
Randy Hogan: It is probably 200 -300 basis points more on that regarding over the next couple of years. 
Randy Hogan: That's couple of years not this year. 
Joe Ritchie: Okay. And maybe one last question. John, you mentioned earlier -- clearly you guys bought back about $200 million this quarter. You've got about $1 billion left. And I think you mentioned earlier that you'd consider incremental share repurchases if M&A didn't come to fruition. So is it fair to say that you are going to put the buyback on hold for now just based on what you see in your pipeline, and then could get more aggressive in the back half of the year? Is that how we should interpret your comments?
John Stauch : That's a fair assessment, correct.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Your line is open.
Shannon O'Callaghan: Good morning, guys. Well, I do have one non oil questions.
Randy Hogan: Thank you. You win the prize. How many minutes in are we?
Shannon O'Callaghan: On tech solutions, this industrial strength that you started to see the last couple quarters, could you may be fill that out a little bit in terms of what you're seeing, and your confidence that that's real, sustained momentum? And then also on kind of on the flip side there of -- I guess I'm not totally avoiding -- is the energy piece on Canadian oil sands. Where does that head from here?
Randy Hogan: Sure. On the first one, a lot of that strength in industrial is North America, is the North American investments and you can see the ISM numbers. We've also had -- one of the reasons we are up energy there is that we've launched a new line of product that is finding good promise particularly in the downstream refining and really very well received by customers. So we believe we are gaining share in that product line. So it's end market it is North America and it is both the discrete and process manufacturing so that's why we feel like second half bodes well for the industrial part of technical solutions there. On the oil sand, the oil sand there is small projects are going forward the MRO, it is a hostile environment that requires money to be spent to keep it going. And we think it will, that money the MRO the short cycle will keep going. Couple of larger projects have been affirmed and going forward. And I think all the other projects are probably -- all the projects that haven't been given the go ahead are questionable at this point. That would be my conjecture. 
Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay. And then on the re-segmentation again, could you just fill out a little bit more what you expect the benefits to be? Is it more of a -- you think it's going to show up -- you mentioned where you are in quartiles on growth, versus things like cash or margins. Do you expect this re-segmentation to benefit more on the growth side or margins? Or what was exactly not working?
Randy Hogan: Yes. Let me start with -- seven GBU was too many, I think four was just right. We are really driving towards a simpler structure that is more intimate for John and I in particular to deal with the presidents on the opportunities and challenges that they each have. We had a mix, we had two in the process technologies we had the water quality businesses which included pool and residential filtration. These are products that were -- they are largely standard, they are engineered but they are standard set of products largely sold through distribution. And it is a different go-to-market model than the engineered bespoke filtration systems that was at the high end. And it is closer to the infrastructure and industrial kind of things that flow does particular as flow is moved away from the big box business. So we have the opportunity to get cost but we have a simpler organization, they are each well over a $1 billion in size so we have scale and we have expectations on those four presidents that are higher, clear and more demanding. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Scott Graham: Hey, good morning. And thanks for all this clarity. The one thing I would hope that maybe you can bring a little bit more to bear on would be the Valves & Controls 2015 outlook, which actually looks like was upgraded from what you said a month ago, month and a half ago, of down 2% to 4%, to flat to down to 2%, in an oil environment that has obviously deteriorated. So could you give us your thinking on that?
John Stauch : Yes. I think just to clarify to you Scott, I think the update we probably gave last time included the foreign exchange impact and the flat to down 2% that we are looking at now which is core, if you look at them on a FX or the same basis we think it is maybe two points worse on the top line -- 
Randy Hogan: And on same, same basis.
John Stauch : On same, same basis.
Scott Graham: So you're saying that within your 2015 outlook, that was a grossed up number?
John Stauch : Yes. I think we definitely adjusted two points down on the top line. As you know, there is piece every single year that you head into the year and shippable backlog, so we've FX adjusted as shippable backlog and that makes up almost 50% of the shipments we expect this year and then the rest is what orders you take in and the booking ship nature of those orders within the year. So I think we are really talking as Randy mentioned earlier what is the impact to 2016 and 2017 as we kind of go to through the year with Valves & Controls and what happens with oil prices and what happens with this end market that we are facing. 
Scott Graham: Okay, got you. On the adjusted margins, no change there, but obviously a little bit lower on the operating leverage. And you are essentially saying and obviously a little bit off on the FX but you're saying that the restructuring kind of fills a lot of that gap, yes?
John Stauch : Yes. I mean I think we took out the translational impact of foreign exchange; it still seems double digit operating income across most of these segments. 
Scott Graham: Okay, great. Thank you. Last question. How skewed towards the second half of the year is the share repurchase going to be? Could you maybe be a little bit more specific on that prior question?
Randy Hogan: We've already finished it. 
John Stauch : We've already finished the $200 million -- 
Randy Hogan: $200 million out of the $1 billion. The original approval was the $1 billion over multiple years and first $200 million was what we intended to do this year -- we finished it already. 
Scott Graham: I was referring to the 2015 within the guidance.
John Stauch : Yes, Scott, I think we really -- we are seeing a richer funnel of M&A activity right now and we think that our business that we mentioned that are more standardized and certainly the ones that are growing organically you could certainly benefit from adding some content to their customers. And I think this could be a year where we complete several transactions. And if those don't materialize and we feel like they are fading away from the funnel then we would look at our capital allocation strategy again and certainly buyback is a smart thing to do if you don't have any use of the capital. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Jeff Hammond: Hi, guys, good morning. Just to clarify so what's the offset to the oil and gas top line weakness? Is that the additional restructuring within the guide?
John Stauch : Yes. 
Jeff Hammond: Okay. And then just on the new segments, how should we think about the long-term margin trajectory in the two segments? You have one that sticks out as very good margins and one as much lower. Where can those go?
John Stauch : I would just say you are going to see a higher level of basis point improvement in Valves & Controls and flow and filtration solutions. Both have significant standardization opportunities in front of them. And both obviously Valves & Controls because they started lot later but both have more lean opportunities. What I call the systems and technical solutions, they have pretty nice margins. And the majority of their platforms but some of their platforms still substantial opportunities as well. So we see margin improvement across all of them. But you are going to see the majority of the opportunity in flow and filtration solutions and Valves & Controls. 
Randy Hogan: And I just add also those higher margin ones, water quality systems and technical solutions, they have really good growth opportunities and we want to make sure that we are taking that high profitability and high grading with they are going after so that we can continue to drive that. You see that in a technical solutions performance in the fourth quarter where we had good quarter growth and we got significant margin expansion on top of that which is the operating leverage. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.
Brian Konigsberg: Yes, hi, good morning, guys. Just actually one clarification. On the guidance, it just looks like you reset the base a little bit both on the Q1 comparison also the full year. Is that just purely the water transport business that is being reflected there?
Randy Hogan: No. Water transport we took out -- we had no water transport in for the year. 
John Stauch : Yes. That's in discontinued operations, Brian. So there is no impact of water transport. The full year guidance was just adjusted $0.10 on a lower end and $0.10 on a higher end for further foreign exchange. And when -- as the currency moved probably just the year ago from the mid $1.20 all the way down $1.13, so that's really what we are adjusting for this Q -- sorry Q1 is little bit more FX on a year-on-year basis of headwind and then there is plus shipping days in the quarter and it is just overall not the strongest quarter of the year. 
Brian Konigsberg: Actually, I guess I was asking a different question. I was just looking at your Q1 2015 guidance. You're looking -- the comparison is $1.64 billion. When you reported it, it just was $1.725 billion in the first quarter of last year.
John Stauch : I have to follow up with you; I'll find Brian on that. 
Brian Konigsberg: Okay. And I think actually the full year 2014 number -- well, actually I'm sorry. The full year 2013 number is a little bit different too. Anyway we'll follow up on that.
John Stauch : Just to clear, I mean last year's shipments were $1.644 billion Q1 on a continued operation basis. 
Randy Hogan: So probably is water transport 
Brian Konigsberg: Okay, so it was the water transport. It was just in disc ops.
Randy Hogan: Yes. You are probably right. 
Brian Konigsberg: The base was just -- okay, got it. Separately, just on working capital, so you kept the free cash flow assumption. I think when you gave the outlook for 2015, you only anticipated about $10 million of working capital benefit. Is that still the same in the outlook? And maybe separately, just maybe comment on the lower CapEx, where you're cutting and --
John Stauch : I mean roughly yes we do still have significant working capital improvement in front of us. We are not forecasting a lot of improvement in 2015. But it remains our largest opportunity and so really on a cash flow to net income basis we are somewhere that $1.15 to $1.20 range I mean you can like collect cash once, so we had a strong cash performance in 2014 and we are expecting a strong gain in 2015. Not really cutting capital, we are prioritizing it. And we are prioritizing it to program that have the highest level of return. And right now we've always generally had a concept here that we have creativity for capital. And that's part of lean and a lot of our businesses are realizing that through the lean adoption especially our newer businesses they have less capital are required. So where we have opportunities to upgrade for automated purposes or driving significant productivity, we continue to fund those projects as they generate substantial returns. 
Brian Konigsberg: If I could sneak one last in, just on the FX. So obviously with the stronger dollar and the weaker euro, would you anticipate that to translate actually into greater demand within the European region? Is that in the plan at all or maybe just general thoughts on -- 
Randy Hogan: I mean we would expect that the European business is -- European base businesses will be more competitive globally and so that over time macroeconomics would say that would favor economic growth there, economic growth there -- it would be good for the world unless it comes with the expense of another region like -- 
Brian Konigsberg: But not in the 2015 plan?
Randy Hogan: No.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Andrew Obin: Yes, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple of clarifications. Did I hear right on Valves & Controls pricing that you are renegotiating with the customers given the current environment?
Randy Hogan: No. We said -- what we said was that customers are asking us to participate in the difficulties they are facing. But nothing has been renegotiated. This is on new things. So just what I would characterize, I would characterize it is tougher pricing environment on the horizon. 
Andrew Obin: So, do you think pricing could turn negative?
John Stauch : In Valves & Controls, yes, I mean obviously it is anticipated pricing so it's not anything to do with margin and backlog. So these are projects that on horizon so you don't usually score keep price but the competitive dynamics will be tougher. And so therefore we will have to get tougher in our cost reductions to be competitive on those projects.
Andrew Obin: And just another clarification on Valves & Controls backlog. Did I hear you right that you guys think that it will start going up in the second half? I'm just questioning, where does the confidence come from given that so far I think it has been somewhat below expectations?
John Stauch : Yes. I don't -- I think we don't want to interpret; there is a lot of confidence in the backlog increasing. I mean what we are suggesting is that the orders throughout the year will reflect the projects in the market that we are participating in. And so I am not suggesting that we are going to raise backlog substantially for the year. We are actually saying -- 
Andrew Obin: But did I hear right that the expectation is that sometimes this year backlog will turn positive?
Randy Hogan: No. What we said specifically was that we think that the process segment which is an industrial, order will go forward and we expect that we will get orders. We didn't read that across the backlog at all. Do some more work on us, okay?
Andrew Obin: Okay. Then just a last question on M&A. It sounds like you said certain businesses have earned their right to do business, to do deals. And clearly you guys are very happy with underlying performance at Tyco. You also highlighted that I think I heard a comment that Europe is on sale. Private equity guys are pulling back due to regulations. Does that mean that energy is probably the most likely place where you guys are going to look for M&A? Just a little bit more color there.
Randy Hogan: Our performance on the integration of Tyco is what I said it has been very, very good and we have one company now, it is not Tyco, it is not Pentair, it is one new Pentair -
Andrew Obin: Yes, I apologize, yes. 
Randy Hogan: We are -- we have demonstrated with our performance and we have lots of happy shareholders as a result. The M&A -- I would not rule out oil and gas but I wouldn't say if that was necessarily the priority. I wouldn't say anything in particular to priority, we will apply our disciplines, we will apply our four questions or five questions and if we find things that are -- that meet our screen we will be active. If we don't -- 
Andrew Obin: So what are the other businesses that earned their right to do M&A, then? You were very, obviously and deservedly so highlighting very strong underlying execution. So what other businesses should I think about?
Randy Hogan: Well, Technical Solutions and water quality systems are our highest performing businesses. We like those a lot but all four of the businesses do have opportunities in one or more of their 18 platforms, but I won't in the interest of competitive thus -- 
Andrew Obin: No, sure. I appreciate. Thank you so much.
Randy Hogan: All right. That was last question. About the replay information. Operator?

Operator:  Good morning. My name is Keith and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Pentair Q3 2014 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Jim Lucas, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.
James Lucas:  Thanks, Keith, and welcome to Pentair's third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. We're glad you could join us. I'm Jim Lucas, Vice President of Investor Relations, and with me today is Randy Hogan, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Stauch, our Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, we will provide details on our third quarter 2014 performance, as well as our fourth quarter and full year 2014 outlook as outlined in this morning's release.

We will be sure to reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. (Operator Instructions) I will now turn the call over to Randy.
Randall Hogan:  Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with our third quarter performance, which is on Slide four. We are very pleased with third quarter performance as revenue met our forecast and we delivered strong margin expansion and EPS growth once again. Sales grew 3% during the quarter with Technical Solutions leading the way with 8% growth. Our operating income grew 12% and operating margins expanded 130 basis points to 15.2%. EPS grew 22% and exceeded the high end of our guidance for the quarter. Free cash flow continued to be strong and was greater than 120% of net income in Q3. We remain on track to generate free cash flow greater than 110% for the full year. Now let’s turn to Slide five for a more detailed look at the third quarter results. After a slow start to the year, the 3% sales growth was an encouraging continuation of the top-line acceleration experienced in the second quarter. Volume grew 2% and we delivered a positive point of price in the third quarter. Foreign exchange was neutral, but we are closely watching the strengthening of the dollar against many currencies and are anticipating FX headwinds to pick up in the fourth quarter. We will discuss the geographical and vertical performance of the company in more detail shortly, but it was particularly encouraging to see all five vertical markets grow in the quarter. The right half of the page shows third quarter Pentair operating profits and margins. Our adjusted operating income increase of 12% and adjusted operating margin expansion of 130 basis points to 15.2% were driven by growth leverage and strong productivity and synergies. Inflation remained consistent with the first half and price and productivity continued to more than offset inflation. We continue to make great progress with our lean and sourcing initiatives, particularly in our 16 focus factories. Now let’s turn to Slide six for a review of our largest segment, Valves & Controls. In the third quarter, Valves & Controls had flat sales with price mostly offsetting slightly weaker volume. Orders were flat in the quarter and backlog was down 3%, excluding FX, to $1.3 billion. During the quarter Oil & Gas grew 3% and process sales saw a 5% growth, while the smaller Power and Mining sales declined. We continue to see quarter-to-quarter volatility in Power, but the Mining weakness is expected to continue. The right half of the page shows third quarter Valves & Controls operating profits and margins. We were very pleased with the operating performance of Valves & Controls in the third quarter, with adjusted operating margins expanding 260 basis points to 15.7%, even including $4 million in cost for the segment Operating Model Transformation, or OMT. As a reminder, we expect the OMT investments in Valves & Controls to continue on an annual basis through 2016, with that investment expected to drive nearly $80 million of annual operating income savings, once completed, and overall tax benefits to Pentair of roughly three points through the optimization of the global Valves & Controls structure. We continue to see strong adoption of PIMS and momentum in Lean is accelerating as seen by continuing improvements in on-time deliveries in Valves & Controls Now let’s turn to Slide seven for a look at the orders and backlogs GBU. As you can see on Slide seven, Valves & Controls backlog is broken down in four key industries, three of which fall into our energy vertical, Oil & Gas, Power & Mining and one in our industrial vertical, which is the Process business. Overall backlog at the end of the quarter down 3% including FX to $1.3 billion. Energy remained mix in Valves & Controls with Oil & Gas delivering strong order growth while Power declined and Mining was weak. This is the second consecutive quarter of orders growth for Oil & Gas and quoting remains healthy. In particular, we continue to see strength in North American LNG. With a sharp decline in oil prices the past month, we are monitoring quoting activity closely. Overall Power orders were down in the quarter. We did see some large Power orders finally break in India and China during the quarter, while Europe remained soft. Mining continued to be in a secular decline. And while we’re seeing maintenance orders comes through in Mining, the overall outlook for this smallest piece of Valves & Controls remains guarded. We saw the biggest backlog declines in Process and Power. Although Power is expected to remain volatile quarter-to-quarter, we expect improvements in Process in 2015 as we continue to see positive signs with an acceleration in North American orders based upon strong quoting activity. Now let’s move to Slide eight for another view of Valves & Controls orders. Obviously, the fluctuations around orders and backlog are disquieting. That’s why we’re building more rigor in our forecasting of Valves & Controls orders and sales. This chart is an example of one way we’re looking at the business. The left side shows the quarterly volatility we’ve seen in Valves & Controls orders. So to see clearer trends, we look at running averages. You can see on a trailing six-month basis, orders are showing that a positive trend may be emerging. On a trailing 12-month basis, that potential trend is further evident. It's likely that quarter-to-quarter volatility will continue with this business given project timing and customer needs, but our improved forecasting models are showing improvement in both the trailing six and trailing 12-month orders for both industrial process and oil and gas. Given these two industries comprise nearly 75% of Valves & Controls business, we remain cautiously optimistic for the GBU. Now let’s move to Slide nine for a look at our Process Technologies segment. Process Technologies reported solid top line growth of 4%, with volumes contributing 3% and a positive 1% from price. Residential & Commercial remained strong with 7% growth, Food & Beverage grew 5% and Infrastructure was up 2%. Our beverage business experienced some customer delays in spending, but these projects or delays are not cancellations. Our food service business delivered another strong quarter of double digit growth, which was broad based globally. The right half of the page shows second quarter Process Technologies operating profits and margins. We are disappointed with the operating margins of Process Technology during the quarter. Mix was a primary factor in the income and margin declines as we saw more growth from our lower margin project businesses within Process Technologies and our pool business began managing its early buy program more closely. In our Residential Filtration business, we have seen a shift to more point-of-entry than point-of-use solutions, which also had a detrimental effect on margins. While mix will be important to improving margins, we continue to have a lot of opportunities to drive productivity within the businesses and so this is an area of focus for Process Technologies. Now let’s move to Slide 10 for a look at Flow Technologies. Flow Tech reported a 2% revenue decline as a point of positive price contribution was not enough to offset a 3% reduction in volume. As we indicated last quarter, we have strategically been deemphasizing lower margin retail business and this did have a negative impact on the quarter's reported results. This is the correct strategic and financial decision. And while we will have a few more quarters of top-line headwind, we more clearly focused on driving differentiated growth in the more profitable Flow channel. The retail shift was the contributing factor to the Residential & Commercial decline in the quarter, but we also saw the industrial and infrastructure businesses decline in this GBU. Industrial saw growth in its global fire offerings, but this was not enough to offset sluggish OEM demand. Within infrastructure, we saw some growth in the break and fix business where project activity continued to be slow for our engineered flow business. We saw growth in Food & Beverage as our applied water business once again delivered differentiated growth, which more than offset continued weakness in agriculture. The right half of the page show second quarter Flow Technologies operating profits and margins. Operating income was flat with operating margins expanding 30 basis points to 14.1%. Flow Technologies delivered positive price and productivity that offset inflation during the quarter. The weaker top-line, including the retail shift we mentioned previously, hindered income growth. But operating margin expansion is expected to accelerate as mix slowly improves. Let’s now turn to Slide 11 for a look at Technical Solutions results. Technical Solutions had a great third quarter with 8% sales growth, with all verticals contributing in the quarter. Volume grew 7% and price was a positive contribution of 1%. Industrial grew 5% led by our North American Equipment Protection business. Energy still showed strong growth of 13% in the quarter with strength globally, particularly in Canada. While it was encouraging to see Canada turn positive for the first time this year for Technical Solutions, it is far too early to call this a trend, but we’re watching order rates in the oil sands very closely. Infrastructure was up 12% on the strength of our European Electronics business where comparisons will begin to get tougher starting in the fourth quarter. Finally, Residential & Commercial grew 9% as last year’s cold winter has led to early stocking in both North America and European channels. The right half of the page shows third quarter Technical Solutions operating profits and margins. Operating income grew 15% and operating margins expanded 140 basis points to 22%. Price and productivity remained a hallmark of this GBU. What the strong top-line demonstrates is leverage in this business and how little bit of growth can quickly flow through to the bottom line. Again, we’re very encouraged by the strength of Technical Solutions in the quarter. And while the growth rate is expected to moderate in the fourth quarter, it does appear that the industrial business is strengthening the back half of the year as we had expected. Let’s now turn to Slide 12 for a closer look at the total Pentair growth profile. Like the first half of the year, during the third quarter we saw solid growth in developed countries while fast growth regions remain mix. U.S. grew at a mid single digit rate and Canada grew double digits. But we saw Europe decline for the first time this year. Overall, developed economies delivered solid growth. Fast growth regions were down modestly for the quarter, but it truly was a mixed bag. China, South East Asia and Latin America, all grew double digits, but we continue to see declines in the Middle East and softness in Eastern Europe and Africa. While weakness in the Middle East is due mostly to a couple of large projects last year that did not repeat, we still see attractive growth prospects for the Middle East long term. Energy turned positive for the first time this year, but remains down year-to-date. Part of the decline is the previously mentioned large projects in the Middle East. We’re seeing strength the last few quarters in oil and gas, particularly in North America, but the declines occurring in the smaller power and mining industries are masking the oil and gas improvement. Industrial grew modestly overall and is up year-to-date. We're particularly encouraged to see the strength in our high margin North American equipment protection business. While process orders have shown quarterly lumpiness, we believe that we’re well positioned for what we see as improving North American orders in 2015 and 2016. Quoting activity remained strong as process companies made CapEx commitments to take advantage of lower energy and feedstock prices. While we’ve seen residential and commercial growth rates moderate, growth remains healthy on the strength of a strong North American housing market. We also saw continued signs of recovery in our smaller commercial businesses. Food and beverage has seen growth moderate largely due to two factors. First, as mentioned earlier, the slowing in agriculture is clearly having an impact on our Ag related businesses. Second, delays in beverage projects have muted the growth in this vertical. Infrastructure was a positive story once again this quarter, driven mostly by our electronics business within Technical Solutions. While the comps begin to get tougher for electronics next quarter, we’re seeing small signs of encouragement that make us believe our water related infrastructure businesses are slowly turning positive. After a slow start to the year, we’re seeing improvements in our two largest verticals, Energy and Industrial. We continue to grow albeit at a more moderate rate than was anticipated at this point of an economic recovery, and we’re positive about the progress we’re making around productivity and standardization. While the global economic environment has its share of challenges, we remain cautiously optimistic. Cash flow remains a very bright spot for us and we remain focused on disciplined capital allocation. With that, I’ll turn the call over to John.
John Stauch:  Thank you, Randy. Please turn to Slide #13 titled Q4 '14 Pentair Outlook. For the fourth quarter of 2014, we expect sales to be up approximately 1% to 2% to 1.85 billion which includes about a point of anticipated FX headwinds. Valves & Controls is forecast to be flat, Process Technologies is expected to be up 5%, Flow Technologies is estimated to be down 4% with tougher comps in Ag and further deemphasis of lower margin retail business, and Technical Solutions is expected to be up 4% on continued strength in industrial. We expect operating income to be up roughly 9% and operating margins to expand 90 basis points to 14.5%. This includes ongoing OMT investments in Valves & Controls unless of a negative mix issue in Process Technologies. Our EPS forecast for the fourth quarter is a range of $1.02 to $1.04 for an increase of roughly 20%. We are expecting the tax rate to be around 23.5% and the share count to be around 187 million, reflecting recent stock buyback efforts. Please turn to Slide #14 labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. Quarter end debt was approximately 3 billion, or 2.7 billion on a net debt basis, inclusive of global cash on hand. In the third quarter we returned over 450 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. At the end of the third quarter we had approximately 300 million remaining under our current 1 billion share repurchase authorization, but we plan to exhaust the remaining authorization levels in the fourth quarter. Our ROIC ended the quarter above 10%. We continue to have a lot of opportunities on the working capital front with the legacy flow control businesses and we expect to make further progress as the year continues. Please to turn to Slide #15 labeled Full Year 2014 Pentair Outlook. We are raising our 2014 adjusted EPS to a range of $3.72 to $3.74 from a range of $3.65 to $3.70 or greater than 20% growth reflecting the third quarter results. For the year, we’re expecting the top line to grow 1% to 2% inclusive of the impact of foreign exchange to 7.1 billion. We expect Valves & Controls to be down modestly for the full year. Process Technologies is expected to grow 5% for the year on the strength of pool, beverage systems and food service. Flow Technologies is anticipated to be down 2% for the full year and Technical Solutions is forecast to grow 4% due largely to an improving industrial business. Adjusted operating income is expected to be up approximately 13% to just over 1.01 billion and this includes roughly 20 million of OMT investments within Valves & Controls. Adjusted operating margins are anticipated to expand 140 basis points to 14.3%. For the full year, we expect the tax rate to be around 23.5% and the share count to be about 195 million. Free cash flow remains on track to be north of 110% of net income. Operator, can you please open the line for questions? Thank you.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: So when we think about the dynamics around the valve orders and some of the stuff that's coming out of process or which segment is the one that’s down in the fourth quarter, the flow segment, this year along with some other incremental headwinds, how does all this kind of mix together and set up for the growth dynamics for next year? You talked about the rolling valve orders being good. Does the fourth quarter look okay on that front? Maybe you could just talk about those dynamics.
Randall Hogan:  I think we never put too much emphasis on Q3, first of all. I mean with August being a pretty light quarter month traditionally than July, and we take a look at a couple of dynamics. We look at our win rate in the quarter’s that we're quoting. We look at how strong the front log is than where the quote log is. The actual quoted activity in Q3 was down, so we feel like our win rate held in. And we still see a bunch of projects heading into Q4. So we're expecting Q4 to be another strong orders growth and we need it as we set up our expectations for next year. But we're certainly in wait-and-see mode on the pace of those orders and obviously mid-December we'll be providing guidance that will give an update on how we feel about next year.
Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: And so can you still -- that $4.50 number is still kind of out there as a possibility or is it too late now to book enough orders to have that at least as part of a range?
Randall Hogan:  I wouldn’t take it off the table at all, no. I mean we are not done until we're done. As we mentioned, our hit rate is good. There is lots of activity out there. We track hit rate, and things have slid, we all know that, everyone in the industry has seen that. But we haven’t seen massive cancellations or share loss that we can calculate.
John Stauch:  Steve, I think when you look at the dynamics of what we are trying to drive, and I think Q3 is indicative of this, we want to have most of the things in our control. And one of the things not in our control is the market. But we still have a lot of synergies remaining and we are building momentum at Lean. We have got carryover restructuring that we are still working on heading into next year. And the operational performance is encouraging because we are building momentum there. We want to grow more than anybody. And every time we see some markets go forward, a couple of markets go backwards. And so we have got to look at things we can control and within the things we control, we're exceeding our expectations. And then we have to see where the market is going to shake out next year. But I think given our operational execution, we still feel confident that we can deliver superior value to the company.
Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: What percentage of your oil and gas business is midstream, upstream, downstream? How do we think about that?
John Stauch:  Just under a third would be midstream.
Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: And then upstream? Is it a third, a third, a third?
John Stauch:  It is more than a third and then downstream is a little down of third.
Randall Hogan:  The way we look at Valves & Controls, we are particularly strong in mining and power. They are not as big as oil and gas obviously, or process. So their being weak is not great news for us. But frankly, we are very strong in LNG and we are very strong in process. And those two, the outlook for those two applications, LNG in particular with cryogenic applications, we are very strong in that. We see a number of projects there that are quite exciting. And there is going to be five-six -- in just in North America there are going to be five or six new plants every year for the next three years in the Petrochem space and probably five to six expansions. And it's early days for the valves to be led in that because in the way it rolls out, there will be plant level awards first and then get to the valves. But we are tracking them all and we feel good about those.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Bernstein Research. Your line open.
Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC: Hey Randy, maybe you could follow up a little bit on that. In terms of if oil prices were to stay similar to the current range for a little bit more of an extended time and you look at the balance of your exposure that you just described upstream, midstream, downstream, I mean to what extent do you see that as kind of a headwind versus tailwind for the company?
Randall Hogan:  Well I am not an oil guru, but we are watching with great anticipation like everyone else on what the impact will be, what oil price is, different activity change. But the end customers don’t -- they are not changing their CapEx plans based on movements week-to-week on oil prices. They are waiting – they'll take the year to do directionally drill the well in a tight shale formation. So it's not something that you turn on and off on a weekly or monthly basis, so – if we look at overall CapEx plans. But in particular if you take a look at the two businesses that I just talked about, LNG, the thing that’s driving LNG right now is the opportunity to export LNG from North America. If you take a look at it, we have a vast amount of natural gas that is priced for the first time the lowest BTU value since the deregulation natural gas and the first time natural gas is trading at a price lower than its BTU value. And with the abundance of natural gas, you can see us having a real opportunity to export that gas to other countries, but basically Asia and Europe. And there's four or five projects underway right now then there are 17 being planned. And then on the petrochem side same thing. A lot of the investment left overtime as natural gas, which is the feedstock at petrochem, the natural gas liquids, as they even up in price, that capacity left in the country and now it’s coming back and all for the same reason, natural gas prices were pretty low. So, those two in particular benefit from the longer term lower cost of natural gas. So that’s why I'm encouraged and I’m worried less about what oil prices do to those two things than I am to what it would do to E&P.
Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC:  And then John, Page five, which is really helpful, the operating income walk that talked about growth inflation and productivity versus price. The inflation you're saying is sort of 1.5% for the whole company. I mean I make the assumption that that’s including wage and material, total inflation, And then mix is somewhere baked in here, maybe you could describe where you put it. And then the basic business model then is kind of 1.5% inflation offset by 1% of price and 1% of productivity. Is that the way – that just happened obviously this quarter. But as you think about kind of the business model for the company in the absence of growth, how should we think about this? And then how do you think about it sort of a little bit longer term?
John Stauch:  You’re right. I mean our inflation numbers include both labor inflation and material inflation, so you’re right. And then mix is netted into productivity and price columns and that’s inclusive of a negative mix we have. I think as we think about where we are right now, I think inflation is going to get a little higher and that’s not a bad thing, we’re actually hoping it to go up a little bit. And then overall we do strive to get about a point of price. I mean where 70 to 80 basis points of price is a full yield for us given the fact that half of the revenue -- or about 40% of our global revenue is more projects and systems now, so less price opportunity there. And our productivity is two points and that’s what we try to archive. And right now we've got a lot of tailwinds there. We'll start to see benefits in OMP next year. But as I mentioned, we have to carry over restructuring and we’re really building momentum around lean and sourcing in the new flow control additions. So I don’t think it’s time to pull back on productivity anytime soon. As a matter of fact, we want to push the pedal harder on that, Steve. And those – I said it earlier, those are in our control.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran from Baird. Your line is open.
Mike Halloran - Robert W. Baird:  So just on the thermal side of the business, maybe you could just talk a little bit about how backlogs are trending there, project acceptance, some of the Canadian activity. But then also what that quoting activity looks like and how that’s tracking relative to expectations?
John Stauch:  So a couple of elements there, I mean I’ll start with Canada first. Canada, we are at levels now on an annual basis that we feel really reflect hopefully a floor. But we’ve been tracking at those levels and starting to see an uptick and we did see an uptick at both orders and shipments in Canada in Q3 that we think continue into Q4. As far as the order rates, certainly getting a strong pickup in the order rates on the industrial side, industrial heat tracing, and starting to see the benefits of some of those petrochemical, particularly sulfur orders that Randy mentioned earlier and we’re starting to see some fairly strong encouraging news on what’s happening in energy in that space. And so we feel pretty optimistic heading into Q4 that we’re starting to see those orders pick up in a way that could be helpful in the future.
Randall Hogan:  And I’d add, one of the things, as we've talked before, we’ve gone underneath the segments we’ve gone to 19 focus platforms to drive growth. In the thermal areas what that did was we broke out the commercial thermal business, commercial thermal solutions, and that focus has led to higher growth. I mentioned in the script that we’ve seen some nice stocking orders in preparation for – or as a result of the cold winter last year we actually had stock out last winter with the heat tracing for snow melt and rail protection and et cetera. And so our business, with the focus we have, we've been able to get out front make sure the stock is in place for what might be needed for this upcoming winter and that whole focus has led to some more innovations in terms of other applications in the commercial space for install on hot water and some other interesting applications. So thermal is looking pretty good.
Mike Halloran - Robert W. Baird: And then at a higher level, obviously you guys took down revenue expectations last quarter. There is still talk of push outs and there is a few moving pieces within the portfolio. I guess what I’m asking is if you take out the FX swings with the strengthening dollar here, relative to your expectations, how much on a revenue line on a forward basis has really changed? So maybe you could just talk about a couple of the puts and takes as you see versus where you guys laid out expectations last quarter?
John Stauch:  Yes. The way we do FX is we take the ending rate at the end of September of about 28 on euro, and there's other currencies of course, but that one had the biggest impact. And so if you would take that into next year and assume that we’re tracking right around where the euros to dollar is today, that is roughly a 1% headwind next year and that is current views. We can forecast where the currency is going to go. The way I would tell you is every penny of euro to dollar movement is worth about 10 million to Pentair on an annual basis.
Randall Hogan: On the revenue line.
John Stauch: On the revenue line. And what it gives the operating income line is the natural transactional benefits that also occurs of not being substantial headwind. Other than that, I think we’ll be watching as we head into next year where the Valves & Control backlog is and how that impacts next year. And then we’ve had a couple of headwinds. We’ve had this retail issues in flow which is about a point of revenue to Pentair and that continues next year. So, I mean there is puts and takes. At the same time, the industrial and the thermal is performing at a higher level.
Randall Hogan: But I'd say with the exception of FX, we kind of see the world where we did when we talked last quarter. I mean FX is different. But other than that...
Mike Halloran - Robert W. Baird:  That makes sense. And that’s what I thought you were driving to. So, appreciate the time.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs:  So, my first question is -- really just not to delve few much into the oil & gas pressures that we’ve seen of late, but perhaps maybe you can talk a little bit about the quoting activity that you mentioned, it was lower this quarter. Is that a seasonal factor? How much of that related to what you were hearing from your oil and gas customers? And specifically going back to the question that was asked earlier on your exposure, when you talk about your upstream exposure, what percentage of your business is linked to longer term projects versus shorter term projects?
Randall Hogan:  On that one, I can’t give you how it splits in here right now. I don’t know if John, you can get that?
John Stauch:  Yes. So, I mean yes, Q3 is seasonal. We inherited some businesses that used to have a fiscal year of September. So just to remind everyone, it used to be a big push for them because it was a fiscal year end. But naturally, Q3 would be a lighter quoting activity given kind of shutdowns in August in Europe and that kind of leaking over in the United States lifestyle. When it comes to projects, large projects do make up about 70% of our overall quote activity still today and so we are looking for large projects. I want to define large projects as anything over $1 million to $5 million. These aren't mega projects at all. They're just larger valve order rates. So those continue to be the trends that we are looking to. And like Randy said, the quarters have been very volatile and what we’ve been looking to is the six-month, the trailing month order rates to try to get some sense of normality as to where these markets are going.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs:  And so is it fair to say in a sense necessarily from the conversations you were having with your customers that the project push outs we’ve been talking about for quite some time now, but there wasn’t really -- was there much of a change in the quarter and in the tone relating to the projects that you’re looking at?
John Stauch:  We would have expected to be up modestly in orders entering into the quarter and we came out around flat. So there were a couple of projects that we could point to that felt like they slipped primarily around EPC actions and activities that have pushed those out. And so that’s consistent with what I think you’re hearing from others. And we don’t feel like there is any share loss in there and therefore we feel like as the market comes back, we’re going to participate in that. 
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And just one follow-up question on the margins, because look, the margins in your Valves & Controls business was really strong this quarter. The expectation as you head into 4Q is another really strong quarter. So, two follow-ups there. One, can you tell me the OMT headwind that you’re expecting in 4Q versus 3Q? And then secondly, you’re basically expecting to see about 280 basis points of margin expansion in 4Q. Just help me understand the confidence in that number from where we sit today.
John Stauch:  Yes. So we're expecting 5 million of OMT in Q4, which is about 1 million higher than it was in Q3, but no tracking to the 20 million on the annual basis. That’s fairly consistent. The margins last year, just to remind you, we had a little challenge in a couple of our factories and a couple of...
Randall Hogan:  We had one big project too that shifted.
John Stauch:  One big project that was a very low margin project. So, when you take a look at it sequentially, it looks more normal. And we feel like Q3 performance is indicative of how we are performing in our factories and the sourcing benefits we’re receiving and the mix of projects that we’re shipping. So we feel comfortable heading into Q4 with that same margin look.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones from Stifel. Your line is open.
Nathan Jones – Stifel Nicolaus:  If we go back to the Valves & Controls business, you said you were looking at order rates pretty closely with the decline in oil and gas. If you looked more at the short cycles part of that business, have you seen any meaningful change there over the last couple of months with the price decline in oil?
Randall Hogan:  Well, we were softer in short-cycle orders than we'd have liked to have been in the third quarter. That’s largely due to lower mining activity and lower power than it is in oil and gas. As when we take a look at what the change rate was, not so big a difference in oil and gas.
Nathan Jones – Stifel Nicolaus:  Okay. You also called out softer Middle East relative to some tough comps from projects last year. It’s pretty typical of the Middle East to build a lot, digest for a while, build a lot, digest for while. It sounds like we are in that digesting period. Can you talk about the outlook there and where you think we are in those cycles, maybe when you expect to pick up in Middle East?
Randall Hogan:  Well, I would say second half next year would be when we would expect to see it. I mean there is some activity in terms of quotations now that wouldn’t hit sales until the second half of next year.
Nathan Jones – Stifel Nicolaus:  So you would expect orders to start hitting maybe six months before that?
Randall Hogan:  Yeah.
Operator:  Your next question comes from line of Scott Graham from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Scott Graham - Jefferies:  When we look at the fourth quarter sales guidance and we adjust for the FX, it doesn’t really look a lot different than what we saw in the third quarter. Yes, we've had a bunch of negative headlines in press from second quarter till now. Is this essentially a function of your saying -- or are you essentially saying to us that your customers have really not -- their orders have not been impacted. And again, the company as a whole I am talking about here. I think that there was some fear of that out there heading into the quarter and you guys are in a lot of markets. So just as a general statement, are you not seeing your customers pull back off of some of these negative headlines?
Randall Hogan:  Well, let me start with your last point. We do serve a diverse set of end markets and they are not all moving together. And they don't all move with move oil and gas. Even within oil and gas, as I mentioned, the lower prices are actually good for some applications. But, we think food and beverage is still strong. We think our residential position in the U.S. is going to continue to give us growth, albeit maybe at a little bit more moderate rate. And so we think that particularly those two businesses are quite good. Europe is the thing that is weaker now than we thought it would be. So we are cautious on oil and gas. But again, oil and gas is just part of our energy exposure and energy is only 28% of our sales. So oil and gas is less than 15% or so. I will give you exact number. So we look at all of those end markets as important to us. And particularly the industrial North American growth and capital spending is a huge driver for us. And we saw that in the third quarter and you can see what it does when we get some growth there if we don’t expect to book another 8% in the fourth quarter then.
Scott Graham - Jefferies: It sounds like there was nothing knee-jerk from what you saw in the quarter, essentially?
Randall Hogan:  Right.
Scott Graham - Jefferies:  The second question is more about the intended usage of cash next year. With sort of the reset to the guidance and the divestiture of that business, kind of looking at that $4.50 maybe a little bit differently, is there a chance that we could see some M&A mixed into your cash usage next year on top of share repurchases?
Randall Hogan:  Yeah.
John Stauch: There's a chance, yes.
Randall Hogan: There's a chance.
Scott Graham - Jefferies: Okay. From anything sizable? Are you no longer looking at small things? Are you looking at things that are maybe a little more sized as the company is larger?
John Stauch:  We are always actively looking at and we have been actively looking hard. We think that we have proven that we can integrate. And there is some of our platforms and businesses that are -- certainly have an appetite to do deals and have the capacity to do deals. So we are constantly looking and we got to have the right price between the seller and the buyer and those things have to line up. So it’s hard to predict.
Scott Graham - Jefferies: Fair enough. In the absence of M&A though, we should, I think realistically then, expect more share repurchases in 2015 kind of maybe not along the lines of year and a half ago, but maybe something along the lines of maybe the last couple of quarters that we have seen?
Randall Hogan:  Currently we are a new company, but we used to be -- before our merger we had 250 million in cash flow, that was a big deal. We are going to do over 800 million and as we get bigger it's going to be in the billion dollar range . Over the last -- since the merger, which was just two years ago, close to two years ago, we have returned almost -- we have almost done 2 billion in share buybacks already. So we see the benefit of doing that. At that level and with that rate, it would be pretty dramatic. But we do believe in returning shareholders -- giving shareholders return. And we have done it about 38 years in a row – or was it 39 -- 38 ears in a row with our dividend increases. And our belief is that capital should be used, not wasted.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Jeff Hammond – KeyBanc Capital Markets: John, just back to your comment about we expect strong orders in the fourth quarter, can you just clarify that? I mean, is that just translating some of this quoting activity into orders?
John Stauch:  Yes. What I was saying is that obviously we’re going to put the pedal to the metal on trying to get as much orders as possible. And there still is activity out there. And as Randy mentioned, we can’t just be wed to the price of oil and there is a lot of other markets in which we serve that we’re focused on. So, I mean we've got to keep going after it and there is still a good solid quote log heading into Q4 and we want to continue to take advantage of that.
Jeff Hammond – KeyBanc Capital Markets:  And then just on this $4.50 number, clearly you’re doing a lot more buyback here than certainly I would have thought. That helps. You seem to be pushing pretty hard still on productivity and you should get some OMT benefit. But can you maybe frame how you think about -- what do you need in terms of top line growth to kind of approach that $4.50 number?
John Stauch:  I mean, I think just to remind everybody, the $4.50 was in response to the $5 target with about a quarter of that related to losing water transport contribution, the other quarter due to macro environment and that’s all at a point in time. So as we talked about earlier, mid December we’ll be giving guidance heading into next year which will frame kind of how we feel about the overall contribution based upon what we see in December. That will include our Q4 order rates and include current foreign exchange views, include where we think the balance sheet participates in that and we'll have a better insight to what to provide. Right now there is really nothing out there against that number.
Randall Hogan:  Yes. Where we are in our process right now, over the next month and a half we will be doing the heavy lifting and doing the discipline planning. Productivity will always be part of our strategy. We plan our work and we execute that and I think you can see in our integration and you can see in our consistent productivity overtime, we know how to do that. What we'll be doing is building that detailed growth plan. That will roll off into our budget. Those budgets will then form the guidance we give in December. So we'll tell you then.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg from the Vertical Research. Your line is open.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners:  Can you actually just give an update on where you stand with the synergy number? I know you've been kind of moving away from it. But you talked about 200 million completed as of the end of Q2. Where do you stand at the end of Q3? And to the extent you can, maybe what the bridge will be between '14 and '15?
John Stauch:  I think the 200 million was – it might be the same number, but it was also the repositioning our cost takeout that we were actually driving to, so permanent cost structure reduction. I mean, as we gave the update, we’re looking to get over $275 million of synergies by the end of next year, which was the new number exclusive of the water transport contribution. And given where we ended Q3, it’s fair to say we’re tracking stronger than that number. And if you would push me for a number, I would say we're $10 million to $15 million, maybe $20 million better than expectation. We’ve been blending this in. What we’re really looking at is what we do in gross margin and how much that gross margin is coming from lean and sourcing, and then what are we doing on cost structure, primarily G&A, and what is that percentage of sales in the reductions there. That’s really where we’re driving it. It falls under standardization category, the reductions in ERPs, reductions in accounting centers and then where are we as far as lean evolution in the all factories, including legacy Pentair side as well. We feel really good about what we've achieved so far.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners:  Yeah, it's been good. Another question, just coming back, you talked about your strong position in LNG and chemical. When you’re bidding for these projects, are you really appointed as a sole source supplier as valves and heat tracking equipment on these projects or are they breaking it up amongst multiple suppliers?
Randall Hogan:  It really depends on what the specific quotes are. Sometimes it will be a multiple package. The range of technologies and then performance characteristics of valves are pretty broad. So for instance we’re a leader in triple offset valve, we’re a leader in pressure relief valves. And all of those get specified and you bid those, sometimes you bid them as a package. The EPC and the end customer in our large project will decide how those split up the packages. They'll let the DCS go and then they'll do the pumps and then when they get to the piping and the valves, each of those common packages. So it’s not a one-size-fits-all on how it gets bid. And then it depends on, I mentioned LNG. LNG has a lot of cryogenic applications. We’re a leader in that in terms of our valves, our triple offset valves and our pressure relief valves. So we tend to have higher share in those applications. Other applications, maybe not, so maybe not so high a share. So it's kind of hard to generalize.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners: Can I just sneak one last quick one in? I see you changed your CapEx modestly to downside, same with D&A. Can you just address what the thought behind that was?
John Stauch:  Yes. I mean it's really as simple as every year the GBUs -- our businesses and segments start out with a plan and we approve the capital if it goes along and we make those capital decisions based on the returns. And usually they overestimate in the beginning on what we're going to spend. And usually by the end of the year we get to the correct number. So we’re just kind of getting to the correct number.
Randall Hogan:  Brian, in my 14 years it's probably 12 out of 14 years where that's been the case.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer & Co.:  Hey John, just wanted to go back to the Valves and Controls margins, sort of showed some pretty significant upside versus the margins. The plant issues last year were known and so a pretty sudden sharp uptick. I’m wondering is that just all sustainable structural step up?
John Stauch: I think that we crossed into the upper 15%s. We are forecasting just slightly above 14.5% to 15% for Q4. The only difference is that we get a stronger level of manufacturing in the September and December we sort of have those last couple of weeks where we start to tail off which creates some absorption issues in some of the factories. So we think that we’re now at this type of run rate, we feel very good about the progress being made around sourcing, as I mentioned, and we can see margin of backlog and we’ve got a better handle on a lot of the inter-company shipments between each other. So, feeling good about the Q3 performance and feeling good about our ability to sustain it.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer & Co.: Great. And then you mentioned being aggressive to get the orders in place in the fourth quarter. Just to kind of beat the dead horse on the Valves and Controls margin sustainability. Do the second half run rates here – do they reflect the level of quoting discipline that you have room to back up a little bit?
John Stauch: Yes. And I don’t -- I wouldn’t say that we’re necessarily backing off. But one of the things that the Valves and Controls team has done a nice job of is using Lean across the quoting activity. And we’re spending quality time on the right quotes and right engineering jobs. And when we’re doing that, we feel good about our ability to go on with a quote that we think meets our margin needs and meets the customers' value proposition. So, I think we feel good about the progress we’re making using the Lean tools outside the factory and I think you’ve seen that in our quoting activity.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski from Buckingham Research. Your line is open.
Josh Pokrzywinski - Buckingham Research: Hey guys. I think it's me based on the announcement. On the -- just to circle upon Valves and Controls, you mentioned some of the other areas that you’re participating in and are focusing on outside of oil and gas and maybe why we shouldn’t be focused on the correction in oil prices and I get all that. But I guess thinking about a comment you made earlier, John, on 70% of the business being project related in some way, even if those projects are smaller, how much of this business that you’re going after in pockets of strength is a legacy position for Flow Control or for Valves and Controls where you’re calling on customers where you have relationships versus trying to start things from scratch and maybe in an environment where projects are getting pushed around and it’s a little tougher to kind of calling a customer for the first time?
Randall Hogan: Yes. We have -- our brands are well known and they're known pretty much to all the EPCs and all of the oil and gas or any other customer set for that matter. But we are, for instance in sub-sea, we're not really strong in sub-sea. So, a lot of the sub-sea activity we’re not going get. We do better on land. In that category I mentioned, we do better in liquefaction stations and natural gas than we do in pipelines. And this is really more of a product mix. So, we look at all of that and we look at our hit rate and what I would like to do is I'd like to see a higher hit rate on where we’re strong and I would like to see us figure out how to get better in some of the places where our hit rate isn't. So there isn’t a general answer I can give you on that.
Josh Pokrzywinski - Buckingham Research: I guess what drives the better hit rate though is my question. I mean clearly it’s not price. I mean you guys have been very forthright with that. Is it lead time, is it capability, is it just...
Randall Hogan:  We believe configured-to-order can help us on smaller projects in particular. Having product in stock and being able to configure to order in our 80 locations is something that we think we can do better at. That’s an idea yet, it’s not a plan. We are doing some alpha test on that that will be helpful for the smaller projects. The rest is a lot of specification work. And we’d rather be specified and take our chances than just compete on price, as you said. We have been more disciplined, we believe, on price than maybe before.
Josh Pokrzywinski - Buckingham Research: Got you. And then John, just two follow-ups, little housekeeping items. If spot rates stay where they're at on FX, and you mentioned that point of top line headwind in the next year, what does that work out to on an EPS basis with some of these transactional benefits you get that you mentioned? And then on the share count, if you do what you claim in the fourth quarter, what is the starting share count for 2015?
John Stauch:  Yeah. So a couple of different answers there. I mean on the transactional and translational FX basis, if we saw somewhere around a $0.10 movement in the currency, that would be the impact on the revenue line of $0.10 times what I said before. $100 million on the top-line, we would be inside of a nickel is what the impact would be on EPS. That’s a model that we run quarterly and annually. And there is, as I mentioned, benefits to currency going down that offset some of the impacts of currency going down. When we take a look at where we are in share count heading into next year, we are anticipating what purchase should be made. And as of today there is $70 million remaining on the authorization and that would drive somewhere around 185 million of the share count next year.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Brian Drab from William Blair. Your line is open.
Brian Drab - William Blair:  I think at this point in the call I need to drive in some finer detail on a high level that hasn't been touched on. One comment you made today is that you are seeing a shift I think the point of entry water filtration system.
Randall Hogan:  Yeah, I said that back. I am glad you asked that. It’s point of use, not point of entry. I said it backwards. I've read that script three times and I didn't think [indiscernible]. Basically a lot more under sink, a lot more point of use versus point of entry. Point of entry has a bigger content for us and frankly a better mix of margins on the products. So I'm glad you asked.
Brian Drab - William Blair:  All right, thanks for that clarification. The related question was just going to be around that Hybrid DI system. I think it was last year with your Milwaukee team, they said that they are working hard on that product, but it didn’t seem to be at the point yet where the price was going to result in an inflection point where you'd see a significant uptick in adoption of that product. But how is that going with that Hybrid DI product?
Randall Hogan:  We are still in development. We have actually done some redesigning work to take some of the cost out and improve the efficiency of the what's called the sack, a membrane sack, and improve the control of it so that it doesn’t have to cycle as often. And so we have got that on beta test now and looking at it. We don’t have a new launch date yet to go public with. But we still have positive thoughts about what that can do in the marketplace to eliminate – we basically provide the softness.
Brian Drab - William Blair:  And then I guess you touched on this but I just wanted to ask maybe a little different way. For the fourth quarter forecast for Valves and Controls and I am just trying to get a better, a higher level of confidence in the forecast. Your forecasting plant revenue for the segment suggests a 5% sequential increase, but backlog was down sequentially in the third quarter. Is this just the typical end of your push seasonality dynamic or is there a particular vertical you have more confidence in or better than average visibility in? Thanks.
John Stauch:  Yeah. Part of the backlog decline was foreign exchange and that’s already reflected. But that rolls through over the next 12 months. So there is a small impact to Q4 related to that. It is a combination of how we feel about the shippable backlog. And then just as a reminder, we had about 35 million to 40 million of one project last year that went out on zero margin, which was in the Q4 number last year. So if you pull that out, you're going to see a little bit more revenue growth excluding that project. And year-over-year you should see the benefit of that drop through as it pertains to the operating income and where the margin. Does that help?
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin from Bank Of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. 
Andrew Obin - Bank Of America Merrill Lynch:  Just a question on your bridge, just going back to Slide 5. As I am think to the fourth quarter and I am thinking about your productivity price in the fourth quarter. Should we see it roughly in line with the third quarter? Because if you sort of do the math, it implies a slight deceleration. 
John Stauch:  Yeah, I mean as I mentioned earlier, we don’t tend to get the same December contribution that we get out of June and September on an end of quarter basis primarily because of the way the holidays impact the last couple of weeks of shipping in the year. But all other components, inflation roughly there, little bit of headwind from foreign exchange, not a lot, and then also we expect to see a good productivity price push as well. 
Andrew Obin - Bank Of America Merrill Lynch: And just to clarify, no restructuring this quarter? And what’s the thinking -- does that mean we are accelerating in the fourth quarter?
John Stauch:  We have not taken any incremental restructuring in Q3, as you indicated. And as Randy mentioned earlier, the context of rolling up plans and taking a look at where we think we are going to be next year and what contribution we have in productivity and growth, any further decisions on that would be taken as necessary.
Andrew Obin - Bank Of America Merrill Lynch:   So are we waiting for the board meeting or right now there's plan for no restructuring in the fourth quarter, it's just a placeholder?
John Stauch:  No, we are evaluating where the markets are going. We are evaluating the confidence in the growth plans. We are evaluating the confidence in the current productivity views and how all of those things work their way into any further access we need.
Operator:  And your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Wright from Nomura Securities. Your line is open.
Jonathan Wright - Nomura Securities:  Just on SG&A, 18.7% sales this quarter. I think in the past you've talked about a long term target of 20% of that. Is there anything going on specifically in the quarter that was weighing on or bringing down SG&A or is that longer-term target now sort of sliding down a little bit? Can you get more cost out there than you originally thought?
John Stauch: It is a combination of a couple of things. I mean one is we do think we can get more G&A out, no doubt about it, but certainly feel even on current levels of G&A, we don’t need to add any, so growth helps to leverage that down. And then we certainly -- we come up the difference by adding more into the R&D line overtime and adding to selling and marketing if necessary. And right now we’re evaluating these 19 growth platforms that Randy mentioned and we’re certainly giving them all the money that need at the moment as they earn the right to invest in more, we’ll add more to the growth pocket.
Jonathan Wright - Nomura Securities: So looking forward, do you think SG&A as going to sales is going to be more like 18% to 19% sustainable? 
John Stauch:  Yes, I think so. I mean the quarters fluctuate. So we can take a look at where your full year's coming it and right now we think around 20% is achievable and then also drifting down to 19% would not be -- there is no magic formula there.
Randall Hogan:  But we are disciples of Lean enterprise. And G&A -- no offense to anybody on my team -- G&A is considered muda in the lean concepts. Muda is waste. So we want G&A to be as productive. In a perfect world there would be no G&A.
Randall Hogan:  Operator, any more questions in the queue?
Operator:  We do have one more question from the line of David Rose. Your line is open.
David Rose – Wedbush Securities:  I don’t want to beat this to death either. But just to get a little bit more clarity around the comfort in orders for Q4, if I look at Q4 last year, you really had an exceptional period and you've got some very tough comps. Mining, as you mentioned, is not doing that great. That’s probably your easiest comparison. Help me get more comfortable on the specific projects that you’re looking at and how do we frame the risk at Q4 orders on the upside and the downside given where they were last year?
Randall Hogan:  I can say comfort is a word that I’m not familiar with while you’re projecting the future. But I mean in terms of the model, when you think about it, we look at our backlog we have and we look at what's shippable and we look at the quotation activities and that’s what we use to drive our forecast.
David Rose – Wedbush Securities:  So this is all front line, right?
John Stauch:  Yes. And I just -- what we’re doing is we’re trying to build the backlog up to get the next nine to 12 months of shippable backlog. And there is also booking shift in the order take as well. So I agree with Randy. I wouldn’t use the word comfortable. But the level of execution around consistently getting robust orders growth is where we’re trying to drive to and we are not yet ready to say that it’s not where we needed to be. But I also want to remind you it relates to a third of our business and we also are looking at all the order and the booking shift business and the other two thirds of the business. And there is, as Randy mentioned, when you see oil and gas move in a particular direction, that’s not necessarily bad for some of the industrial segments that we serve either. So all of it has got to weigh into what we think we can achieve for next year.
David Rose – Wedbush Securities:  And maybe last one is, last time we had a big disruption in Europe or at least concerns over Europe, there was a lot of destocking in the channel. Has October shaped up to be that way at all?
Randall Hogan:  I'd say too soon to tell in terms of Europe specifically. I mean, Europe was the surprise weakness and Europe was -- we had growth in Europe in the first half and then it declined in the third quarter. So that’s a note of caution in terms of what we’re looking at.
John Stauch:  It was one of the bigger pull-backs in September -- with the Europe performance in September was really soft.
Randall Hogan:  And for Europe, because July and August are vacation months, it’s all about September in Europe. So making sense of what that means when you have a weak September in Europe takes a little while.
Randall Hogan:  Thank you. So that’s it then. You can give the calling information please, operator. Thank you for listening.

We will make sure to reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Randy.
Randall J. Hogan: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Before looking more closely at the second quarter results, I thought it would be helpful to provide a summary of what we will cover on today's call. We have a lot of information to share and we want to leave time for your questions. The second quarter met our expectations despite ongoing economic headwinds in our 2 largest verticals, Energy and Industrial. We announced this morning that our board has approved our strategic decision to exit the Water Transport business, which we will cover in more detail shortly. We're reducing our 2014 expectations mostly due to our exit of the Water Transport business, but also due to a reduction in what we see as a more modest topline outlook. This is based on an Industrial recovery that's slower than originally anticipated and continued pushouts within Energy. In particular, we continue to see lower-than-anticipated contributions from Canadian oil sands. And while we continue to win with both small and large customers, many of the large projects have continued delays in releasing capital spending. Six months before the start of 2015, we do not see enough strength in the Energy and Industrial markets in particular to hold the 2015 $5 EPS target. We're adjusting that target to $4.50, reflecting the exit of our Water Transport business and factoring in these lingering economic uncertainties and ongoing deferrals in Energy CapEx. While we have continued the overdrive on synergies and are seeing some growth, it's not enough to close the gap. Nevertheless, we're still targeting EPS compound growth rate greater than 20% overall across 2014 and '15. As we have overall -- as we have overdelivered on synergies, we continue to show the power of PIMS adoption in the businesses that we acquired and our ability to integrate the acquisitions. Lean enterprise is a part of our DNA now and it's gratifying to see it delivering this way. The results is that our free cash flow continues to be strong in capital allocation disciplined as we continue to run the company for the long-term, focused on creating sustainable, long-term shareholder value. Now let's turn to Slide 5 for a review of our second quarter performance. This slide is a review of our second quarter including Water Transport. We will have a more detailed look in the quarter in a few moments excluding the results of our Water Transport business. With it, second quarter revenues declined 3% on a reported basis. Adjusted operating income increased 5% and adjusted operating margins expanded 110 basis points to 14.8%. Adjusted EPS grew 13% to $1.04, which met our outlook of $1.02 to $1.05. Please turn to Slide 6 for a review of our balance sheet and cash flow. Free cash flow was $384 million in the quarter, which followed a small usage in the first quarter from the seasonal working capital build in many of our Residential businesses. We expect to generate full year free cash flow greater than 110% of net income in 2014. Our balance sheet remains strong, ending debt with approximately $2.7 billion or $2.5 billion on a net debt basis. And the second quarter returned nearly $250 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. At the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $700 million remaining under our current $1 billion repurchase authorization. We recently increased our quarterly dividend to $0.30 per share from $0.25 per share, which marks our 38th consecutive year of annual dividend increase. Our ROIC ended the quarter above 10%. We continue to have a lot of opportunities in the working capital front in a number of our businesses and we would expect to make further progress as the year continues. Please turn to Slide 7 as we look more closely at our rationale to exit our Water Transport business. As we mentioned in the beginning of the call, we announced our decision to exit our Water Transport business and move it to discontinued operations in the third quarter. As we discussed at length last quarter, this is a business that came with the Flow Control acquisition that was completed nearly 2 years ago that has consistently underperformed our expectations. At the time the acquisition was completed, Water Transport generated over $700 million in annual revenue with operating income of $50 million and had a couple of large projects in the backlog and several others in quote stage. At that point in time, the expectation for 2014 was for revenue to decline sharply, but operating income continued to remain near $50 million. Shortly after the deal closed, we saw some larger projects that canceled and while there have historically been a flow of smaller projects each year, there's been virtually no new activity of consequence over the past year. This is due in part to the impact of the Australian economy from a sharp downturn in mining. We worked aggressively to rightsize the business. It has remained profitable despite revenue levels, declining significantly from where it was expected to be. We believe the decision to exit the business will allow us to better allocate resources to growth areas. The decision to exit the Water Transport platform is consistent with our new platform approach, leaving us with 19 technology platforms. We aligned around these platforms at the beginning of this year within our 4 reporting segments. We have leaders in place to drive all 19 platforms and have recently completed our first round of strategic reviews with them. The platform approach allows us to more clearly define and invest in areas that have differentiated profitable growth opportunities. This approach also helps us identify businesses that may not have the same prospects and will have to play a different role for Pentair. We've talked for some time about flowing our resources to our best opportunities and this platform structure enables that more effectively. Please turn to Slide 8 as we review the past performance of Water Transport net impact on reported results. To provide a baseline of Pentair excluding Water Transport, we want to share the impact on last year's result without it. On a reported basis, sales were up 3% in 2013 and adjusted EPS grew 26%. Without Water Transport in last year's results, sales would have been up 4% and adjusted earnings per share would have grown 29%. Going forward, we'll exclude Water Transport's results from the discussion of this quarter's results. So let's turn to Slide 9 as we look at Pentair's second quarter results excluding Water Transport. For the second quarter, sales grew 2%, with 3 of our 4 segments growing. Adjusted operating income was up 13%, adjusted operating margins increased to 150 basis points to 15.2% and adjusted EPS grew 21% to $1.02. Again, a very solid quarter of execution. Now let's turn to Slide 10 for a more detailed look at our second quarter performance. The waterfall on the left-hand side of the page shows that our 2% sales growth was the result of 1 point from volume and 1 point from price. FX was a slight positive in the quarter as strength in the euro was partially offset by continued weakness in the Australian and Canadian dollars. We saw many of our markets firming throughout the quarter with backlog and most product platforms expanding. The right half of the page shows second quarter Pentair operating profits and margins. Operating margin expansion of 150 basis points was driven once again by strong productivity, which includes our synergies. We continue to gain momentum on both Lean and sourcing initiatives and our standardization effort continued their progress. As the top line has remained sluggish, we've taken further repositioning actions to accelerate our productivity results. While the top line continues to be slower than we had anticipated at the beginning of the year, we continue to focus on the elements within our control and feel good about our ability to continue delivering on productivity and synergies. Now let's turn to Slide 11 for a performance review of our largest segment, Valves & Controls. For the second quarter, Valves & Controls grew 2%, which is comprised of 1 point of volume and positive 1 point from FX translation. This was slightly better than our forecast. Orders grew 7% from their comparable period 1 year ago and backlog remains firm with a slight sequential increase to $1.4 billion. During the quarter, oil and gas showed a slight increase. Power was up modestly, Process grew 6% and Mining was down once again. The right half of the page shows second quarter Valves & Controls operating profits and margins. Adjusted operating margins expanded 60 basis points to 14.1%, which includes $4 million in cost for the segment's operating model transformation or OMT. As a reminder, we expect the OMT investment in Valves & Controls to continue on an annual basis through 2016. But that investment is expected to drive nearly $80 million of annual operating income savings once completed and an overall tax benefit to Pentair of roughly 3 points through the optimization of the global Valves & Controls structure into Switzerland. Now let's turn to Slide 12 for a look at the orders and backlog for Valves & Controls. As you can see on Slide 11, the Valves & Controls backlog is broken down in 4 key industries, 3 of which fall into our Energy vertical. Those are Oil & Gas, Power and Mining and one in our Industrial vertical, which is the Process business. Overall, backlog ended the quarter near $1.4 billion, which is consistent with where it has been since we acquired the business in the end of 2012. We saw healthy order growth in Process, Oil & Gas and Power, but Mining orders were down due to a combination of a tough year-over-year comp and continued weakness seen throughout the mining industry. As we've seen many energies subverticals experience pushout for several quarters now, we're encouraged by the strength in Oil & Gas orders during the second quarter. In particular, North America was strong in LNG and pipelines. We'd like to see a few consecutive quarters of strong order growth before we start to view a trend materializing. The quoting activity remains healthy. With Power, backlog has remained steady but orders remain lumpy. While Mining is the smallest part of Valves & Controls, we're seeing signs that a bottom may be near and since we have a good installed base, we expect to see stable MRO demand. Within Industrial process, orders and backlogs are up and we anticipate continued order growth as capital spending in North American capacity expansion in particular continues. Now let's move to Slide 13 for a review of Process Technologies. Process Technologies reported solid top line growth of 4%, with volumes contributing 3% and a positive 1% from price. Residential & Commercial remains strong with 10% growth during the quarter, as our Aquatic Systems business benefited from healthy demand during its seasonally strongest quarter. Food & Beverage was down modestly as the business faced a tough year-over-year comp with strong beverage shipments in the comparable period 1 year ago. But we still expect Beverage to be positive for the year. Infrastructure, now a small piece of Process Technologies, was down another 11%, as demand within the global desalination industries remains weak. The right half of the page shows second quarter Process Technologies' operating profits and margins. Operating income grew 17% and operating margins expanded 200 basis points to 18.6%. We discussed last quarter a slow start to the year for the segment and the impact of negative mix. But we saw that trend reversed during the second quarter, as Aquatics, one of our higher-margin businesses, had another strong performance. Although price was not quite enough to offset inflation, we saw a strong productivity that contributed to the robust margin expansion in the quarter. Now let's move to Slide 14 for a look at Flow Technologies. Flow Technologies reported a 2% revenue decline, as the point of positive price contribution was not enough to offset a 3% reduction in volume. Residential & Commercial was down modestly as we continue to emphasize the more profitable pro channel and deemphasized the lower-margin retail business. Food & Beverage, which is ag in this segment, was up a modest 2%, a sign that our agricultural business is delivering differentiated growth since overall agricultural demand has been slower this year, particularly on the irrigation side. Industrial was up 6%, led by continued global expansion in our fire suppression product lines. The right half of the page shows second quarter Flow Technologies operating profits and margins. Operating income was up slightly, with operating margins expanding 40 basis points to 13.9%. Mix did have a negative impact due to the lower contribution from Infrastructure and Food & Beverage. We continue to focus on improving productivity within Flow Technologies and have actions in place to drive margin expansion as the top line remains more challenged short-term. Let's now turn to Slide 15 for a look at Technical Solutions' results. Technical Solutions grew 3% in the quarter, with 1% volume growth and a 2% contribution from price. Industrial was down modestly in the quarter due to slower-than-anticipated recovery for our Equipment Protection business. Energy was down 11% as our Thermal business has seen continued weakness in Canada. Infrastructure, which is primarily datacom and telecom in this segment, was a bright spot, with a 33% gain reading out on our Electronics business driven by improving demand in new products. The right half of the page shows second quarter Technical Solutions' operating profits and margins. Operating income grew 10% and operating margin expanded 120 basis points to 18.8%. Productivity and synergies remained strong, but slower growth in our profitable Equipment Protection businesses did limit margin expansion in the quarter. Standardization and repositioning remain on track, but as our most profitable segment, more growth is needed to leverage that high profitability. Let's now turn to Slide 16 for a closer look at the total Pentair growth profile. During the second quarter, we saw solid growth in developed countries while fast growth regions were mixed. U.S. grew at low single-digit rates. We saw a larger decline in Canada, primarily in our Technical Solutions business, where the oil sands impact reads out. Meanwhile, our other businesses were up modestly in Canada. In Western Europe, we saw a very healthy mid-single-digit growth with all segments positive. China and Latin America showed growth, but we saw declines in the Middle East and Southeast Asia. The weakness in the Middle East was due to a very large project that shipped last year. We still see attractive growth prospects for the Middle East longer-term. Energy continues to see demand shift to the right, to face the tough comp in the second quarter. We expect Energy to turn positive in the second half based on the strength of our backlog in Valves & Controls and overall improvements in order activity, particularly in Oil & Gas. Industrial continues to grow modestly. While we expect that overall CapEx activity to begin to accelerate, this is a trend that has not materialized for the last 2 years and we believe it is more realistic to taper our second-half expectations. We experienced healthy mid-single-digit growth in our Residential & Commercial vertical, driven by strong Residential demand globally and in the Infrastructure vertical led by our Electronics business. Food & Beverage faced a very tough comparison and was flat in the quarter, but the growth prospects for this vertical remains strong for the year. Our North American Residential business have continued to see growing in demand and Europe and China showed healthy demand for our Residential products as well. While a smaller piece of our Residential & Commercial vertical, we continue to see improvements in Commercial demand, too. Infrastructure enjoyed a strong quarter and we expect a good year of growth on the strength of our Electronics business and Technical Solutions. Although comps will begin to get tougher later this year, overall demand has remained relatively steady for the past few quarters while we wait to see how and when Infrastructure and the water businesses rebound. Food & Beverage is expected to post strong mid-single-digit growth for the full year, following strong double-digit growth last year. While the U.S. agricultural base businesses has slowed on lower farm demand, our businesses are experiencing growth due to expanded coverage from global expansion. Beverage continues to have a healthy backlog and foodservice continues to experience strong international growth. Let's now turn to Slide 17 for an update on our guidance. We're updating our full year adjusted 2014 EPS guidance to a range of $3.65 to $3.70 from a range of $3.85 to $4. The principal reason for the revision in guidance is the exclusion of our Water Transport business, which is about $0.20 of the guidance reduction. At the top of the range, we've also lowered our full year organic growth expectations as continued delays in energy met slower global industrial recovery are factored into our expectations. Energy started the year very slow and while our orders in backlog give us increased confidence the first half declines will turn to growth in the second half, it will not be enough to overcome the slow start to the year. Our cost actions remain on track. Our cash flow remains very strong. We continue to have flexibility with our balance sheet and adjusted EPS remain on track to grow an expected 20% for the full year. We continue to be confident about the elements within our control, but many of our end market segments remain lower-than-expected and we feel it's prudent to adjust our second-half outlook accordingly. Please turn to Slide 18, labeled Q2 Assessment and Full Year Outlook. We delivered on our first-half expectations as operating income grew 15%, despite only 1% gain on the topline. Operating margins expanded 180 basis points to 13.8% and EPS grew 25% in the first half. As we entered the second half, we're expecting a modest pickup within Industrial and our orders and backlog gives us some expectation that Energy will accelerate in the second half. While we're seeing some signs of inflation, price and productivity are expected to continue to offset inflation and projected synergies remain ahead of our initial expectations. We also will continue our OMT investment in Valves & Controls in the second half. We're expecting the top line to grow 2% to 3% for the full year, operating income to grow roughly 12%, operating margin expansion of 120 basis points to just over 14% and EPS growth of roughly 20%. We believe we are on track to generate free cash flow greater than 110% of net income. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.
John L. Stauch: Thank you, Randy. Please turn to Slide #19, titled EPS Impact on 2015 $5 Per Share Target. As Randy mentioned at the beginning of the call, we are updating our 2015 EPS target to $4.50. While the $5 target is a number that we have been committed to, both internally and externally, the current economic backdrop is just not strong enough to overcome the impact of moving Water Transport to discontinued operations. We are still very excited in the value creation capability from this transformational deal and continue to expect strong organic growth rates, double-digit operating information for the base, plus the benefit of synergies and the balance sheet, just not quite at the levels necessary to offset the ongoing deferrals in Energy CapEx and lingering economic uncertainties. We're quite pleased with our ability to overdrive in synergies, which we believe speaks well to the power of PIMS and our ability to integrate acquisitions and the higher synergies we needed to offset lower core organic growth rates than were originally anticipated. We have seen continued deferrals in Energy CapEx and a muted Industrial recovery has contributed to grow not quite at the levels of our original expectations. Our decision to exit our Water Transport business removes $0.25 from our base. And as we highlighted earlier in the call, we believe this is the right strategic decision to allow us to reallocate resources to other platforms that have differentiated profitable growth opportunities. We've seen lower CapEx in many areas, but particularly in the Canadian oil sands. We have seen 2 larger projects continued to be delayed and although we have secured supplier-of-choice contracts for these projects, these are the types of pushouts that we have been experiencing with projects of all sizes. This does not mean that these projects will not eventually become revenue, but rather, we are choosing not to keep focusing on the recurring delays and will welcome the revenue if and when they finally come to fruition. The $4.50 EPS targets still represents a 21% EPS CAGR, which we believe continues to demonstrate the shareowner value creation from this transformation deal. Please turn to Slide #20 labeled Disciplined Capital Allocation. We've used this slide in the past to remind everyone of the strength of our cash flow and the flexibility our improved balance sheet gives us. We continue to create further opportunities for more value creation, both on the cash we generate and the leverage opportunity from the incremental EBITDA. All in, we expect to have significant capacity for further bolt-on acquisitions and share buybacks as opportunities arise. We recently raised our dividend for the 38th consecutive year and we still have roughly $700 million left under our current share repurchase authorization. After looking at our current dividend commitment and our buyback authorization, we still have capacity. We've continued operating performance of nearly $1.3 billion to fuel further acquisitions or buybacks. This is nice flexibility to have and we will continue to make smart capital allocations to improve overall shareholder value. We continue to run the company for the long term and we'll not exhaust our balance sheet flexibility simply to reach a near-term target. We'll continue to optimize our balance sheet strength to create sustained, long-term shareholder value. Please turn to Slide #21 labeled Deal Economics Overview. We continue to believe in the long-term reasons why this was truly a transformational deal for Pentair. We acquired 2 leading businesses in Valves & Controls and Thermal Management that further diversified our portfolio and strengthened our position globally, particularly with the exposure to Energy. Our portfolio was better-balanced today, not only from a vertical and geographic standpoint, but also with stronger technologies. We still expect Energy to recover, albeit later-than-expected, and the progress we have made on the cost side is expected to read out in strong leverage as this important vertical rebounds. We have made great progress with regards to our standardization and integration efforts, particularly in Lean and sourcing, but there's still a long runway ahead as evidenced by G&A levels that have more room for improvement. When looking at the value of the transaction after excluding Water Transport, we acquired 2 leading businesses in Valves & Controls and Thermal at less than 9x EBITDA, which is a multiple that cannot be found in today's M&A environments. We believe this deal has demonstrated our ability to create significant value for our shareholders at a very reasonable price. Please turn to Slide #22 labeled Q3 2014 Pentair Outlook. For the third quarter of 2014, we expect sales to be up approximately 3% to $1.76 billion. Valves & Controls is expected to be up roughly 3% based on our scheduled backlog and seasonal improvement in the shorter-cycle MRO business. Process Technologies is expected to grow nearly 8%, led by Aquatic Systems related to the strong end of the pool season and backlog infiltration and process. We're anticipating Flow Technologies to be flat with tougher comps in ag and continued deemphasis of our lower-margin retail business. And Technical Solutions is expected to be up roughly 4%, as comps at Thermal get a little easier and improved daily order rates and equipment protection continue. We are expecting adjusted operating income to be up roughly 8% and operating margins to expand 50 basis points to approximately 14.4%. This includes ongoing OMT investments in Valves & Controls, as well as a negative mix in several of our businesses. We expect mix to be more favorable in the fourth quarter, which is factored into our full year forecast. Our EPS forecast for the third quarter is a range of $0.93 to $0.95, or an increase of roughly 15% versus 2013. We are expecting the tax rate to remain around 23.5% and the share count to be around 193 million shares. Please turn to Slide #23 labeled Full Year 2014 Pentair Outlook. Our revised 2014 adjusted EPS outlook of $3.65 to $3.70 represents growth of roughly 20%. For the year, we expect the top line to grow approximately 2% to $7.15 billion, which excludes Water Transport. We expect Valves & Controls to be flat for the full year after a slow start to the year, but the second quarter order growth gives us increased visibility that the topline growth rate should accelerate modestly in the second half. Process Technologies is expected to be up roughly 6%, with strength in Aquatics, Beverage Systems and Foodservice. Flow Technologies is expected to be flat for the year. Technical Solutions is anticipated to grow roughly 3% for the full year, with Electronics remaining strong, equipment Protection growing modestly and Thermal seeing continued slowness in Canada, offset by a seasonal pickup in the business in the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating income is expected to be up 12% to just over $1 billion, but this does include roughly $20 million of OMT investments within Valves & Controls. Operating margins are anticipated to be up nearly 120 basis points to 14.1%. For the full year, we expect the tax rate to be around 23.5% and the share count to be about 196 million shares. Free cash flow remains on track to be north of 110% of net income. Kim, can you please open the line for questions? Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Steve Winoker from Sanford Bernstein.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: I'm sure it was hard for each a few to come off of the $5 promise, so I understand that. But I'm just now trying to understand, you still got 18% EPS growth in your '15 over '14 plan at the midpoint, I guess. And when I look at that, it'd be hopeful to understand the cost -- the operating margin and cost synergy side again. On the op margin assumption now, where are you next year versus this year?
John L. Stauch: I'm sorry, the question, Steve, was op margin or...
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Op margin expansion 2015 over 2014.
John L. Stauch: About 120 basis points.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay. And the cost synergy, that old $310 million number, you keep talking about overdriving now. Of the $310 million I'm talking about, full cumulative, where is that coming out now?
John L. Stauch: Well, I think we -- the $310 million, which I do acknowledge, had about $35 million or so that would be moved to discontinued ops along with Water Transport, so I think that would give you roughly a $275 million ongoing synergy rate that we think would apply to the continuing [indiscernible]
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay. And that's still the same number. You're not changing that at all, the $275 million?
Randall J. Hogan: Yes, Steve, we're not giving -- I mean, it's -- just to put this in perspective, we're not -- we're going to go back to our normal giving actual guidance for the year in -- when we get -- when we talk in December, which is our fair practice. We felt, as all our degrees of freedom began to get pinched away for us against the $5, we felt we owed it to you to tell you. So the way to think about the $4.50 is we know Water Transport goes, but we also looked at all the puts and takes, the overdrive and synergies, the -- frankly, the lack of confidence that we have in these head fix we keep getting from the economy. And we've been counting on those to come through on a positive way. And they're coming through, even though we're getting some growth in line with what looks like everyone else's, it's just not something I have a lot of confidence in right now. So that's -- so think about the $4.50 that way. We don't have a definitive guidance -- we're not giving a definitive guidance. The $5 was a target and it was something that we held out there for everybody; us and you. We had multiple degrees of freedom to get there. It's 6 months before 2015. I...
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay, okay. Fair enough. And Randy, I remember the last time we talked about Water Transport, you described it as "What do you do with an empty bag of groceries?" And so now, we're putting it over and this is -- it sounds like obviously the right strategic decision over many years to exit this. But what's your confidence in, I guess, even that process moving forward? How are you thinking about it now?
Randall J. Hogan: Well, I mean, we really did feel like we needed to build a backlog. And the business, the people in the business have worked so hard and committed to the brutal activities necessary to keep their nose above water and it's profitable. There's 2 reasons to discuss. One is it really isn't part of our strategic roadmap going forward. And right now, it has been a distraction within Flow Technologies. Flow Technologies without them doesn't look that great, right? And now they can focus, really can -- the Flow Technologies can really focus on driving the growth in the areas that look quite attractive for them and continue the exit of the retail side of residential and really focus on what we believe is the bright future for Flow Technologies. We've moved -- we're moving the business to actually report to our VP of Ops, which reports up to John. And we're just beginning the process, but we believe that there are prospects for the business in someone else's hands. And I don't know who that is. We haven't started the process yet. It's early days. We just went through a rigorous discussion with our Board about the right way forward and we think this is certainly the right way forward. And this -- our platform, I mentioned this in the script, this platform approach is really quite helpful in that regard in terms of really identifying and letting us differentiate who's going to -- where we're going to flow more of our resources, a much more granular approach than the GBU approach.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Right. And I fully appreciate that. Just before I hand it off, last quick thing. Price is less than from a inflation in Flow Tech that you called out. What's going on there? And are you -- is this just a question of timing and catch up on the pricing side?
John L. Stauch: Yes, it is. I mean, the short answer I mean, we are exiting, as Randy mentioned, several product lines within Home Depot in which we did take a large -- within our retail space, which we did take some large concessions on. So that's what we're managing through right now. But that headwind starts to go away in the second half and into next year.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: The -- so the restructurings this year, I guess, how much is that going to be? $60 million or something like that, the total?
John L. Stauch: Yes, that's probably about right. Yes.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: How quickly does that -- do you think that pays back?
John L. Stauch: We feel like it -- all in, we're just slightly -- since we've done this and we're sort of concluding our large restructuring actions, we've taken about $200 million of restructuring today. And the expected full year run rate benefit of that is roughly $200 million on an ongoing basis. So I would say that this last grouping is consistent with that. I mean, a little bit delayed in the sense that we notify and then the benefits come a little bit later, but that's what we're really running to is an ongoing run rate of about $200 million since the inception of the merger.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. So when we think about the year-over-year increment on that debt has yet to come in 2015, what is that number?
John L. Stauch: It would probably be approximately $30 million.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: For '15?
John L. Stauch: Correct.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then are there any other -- I think there's this OMT benefits. Is that separate and is that also a plus for '15?
John L. Stauch: Again, we would think that the investment continues, so the $20 million we're spending this year, we'll have another $20 million of investment next year. And there would be a slight pickup from the G&A savings that we'd expect once we go live with that program.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And just lastly, on the balance sheet, I mean, very strong free cash flow in the quarter. If -- the $1.3 billion you guys highlighted as kind of an opportunity and then on the next page or a page before that, whatever, you talked about how well you've kind of integrated this deal. You're buying back a little more stock. Is the priority -- given kind of what's transpired here, is the priority to descend the stock with more buybacks or should we take your comments around how well Tyco Flow has been integrated as we're ready to go on to do another deal and we're going to be opportunistic on something of size if it comes along?
John L. Stauch: Yes. I think the way we look at it now is just really $2 billion of capacity less the $700 million remaining in share authorization. Our goal is to create long-term sustainable value and acquisitions continue to be a big part of that. But right now, there isn't a plethora of significant acquisitions to go get. So short-term, we've been doing what we feel is a disciplined capital allocation model of choosing between all of the options and making sure that we're looking at the one that drives the right long-term value creation.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Right. And sorry, one more question. In terms of the Valves & Controls, the order -- the visibilty on the kind of the order pipeline. Things have been lumpy. Is this the real -- like this 7% growth, did you think there's enough visibility now in the pipeline to say that at least the orders should continue to grow here, acknowledging you're conservative on timing and the revenues and stuff like that?
Randall J. Hogan: Yes, I mean, there's a certain amount of lumpiness, as you say. But the 7% growth in orders this quarter, we think portends more positive things coming. We have the quote log, we track ahead of that and that's up as well. It seems to be legitimate, the -- and the real projects and that's up. I think that, that will be good. And I'm really looking forward to seeing how we clock it in third and fourth quarter. That's really going to tell us a lot. I really like the discipline that the Valves & Controls team has put around the quote following now. I think we're in a much better shape than we were a year ago in terms of tracking and managing that.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs.
Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: My first question is on the restructuring. And I think that you're pretty much through it now for the year at $69 million. But I think your original expectation was something closer to the $23 million. You did $46 million this quarter. 2 questions. What surprised you such that you accelerated the restructuring actions this quarter? And the follow-on, is it safe to assume that we are done with the restructuring for the rest of the year?
John L. Stauch: I'll never say we're done. I think we aggressively went to everybody and said, "Listen, we want to put it behind us and we want to move forward. We want to start having reported and GAAP be the same -- I'm sorry, reporting just be the same number for the rest of the year." And on that context, I think we were more aggressive in the quarter based on the fact that we gave that guidance that we needed to put this behind us. But I think, overall, we feel really good about how the teams have stepped up. We feel really good about the productivity actions. And a lot of this is being driven, as Randy mentioned, by PIMS and Lean standardization and all the right things that we're doing to simplify the businesses to be better to deal with from a customer perspective and also to get the standardization in line so that we can be better at acquisitions going forward.
Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And I guess something that I'm struggling with a little bit is the impact of the Water Transport business. And so I think in Slide 8, you guys mentioned that the impact in 2013 was about $0.16 from Water Transport. And yet you gave us a delta last quarter on Water Transport, expecting to be a $0.13 negative headwind to 2014 results, which implies that the Water Transport business was going to add roughly about $0.03 this year. And so, I guess, help me bridge the gap of that $0.03 versus the $0.20 impact that you guys are talking about in terms of the guidance reduction for this year.
John L. Stauch: Yes. I mean, I think you'll see it in the documents that where we were with Water Transport last year was what we described, which is the fact that the numbers we gave you were last year's 2013 numbers. We expected the business to the roughly flat for '14. When we came out and saw that the projects on pipeline was going to be less and there was going to be less contribution from Water Transport after we gave our original guidance, the goal was to drive the other businesses and hope that we would see back half upside to make up for that difference. And what you're seeing now is what the actual forecast for the business looks like this year, which is significantly less than the way we planned it and significantly less than its contribution last year. The other element that's going through the impact of the EPS is the changing share count from where we were in 2012 at 213.8 million shares to where we expect to be next year, which is sub 190 million. So that if you take that off the contributions, that's where you're seeing the impact.
Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And I mean, maybe trying to slice that up a slightly different way. It seems like the Water Transport business was in a loss position in the first of the year. But in the second half of the year, was it your expectation that you're going to get about $0.20 in benefit in Water Transport in the back half?
John L. Stauch: Well, it was about in a breakeven position for the first half and we thought it would have a slightly larger uptick in the second half. However, we're talking apples and oranges here. Again, the plan was that we'd have contribution in the first half and we'd have contribution in the second half. When we didn't get the contribution in the first half, we adjusted our Water Transport outlook. We tried to overdrive the other businesses to get back on plan. And therefore, we are now telling you, we don't think that, that's...
Randall J. Hogan: That's not happening.
John L. Stauch: That's not going to happen.
Randall J. Hogan: Because of the revenue. I mean, we were encouraged when we saw some of these projects getting released and that's why we're talked about the oil sands. We talked -- we saw some of these things getting released. We were getting excited about them and then we see them all pushed to the right. We just -- it's -- I don't -- just not going to comment on stuff until they happen.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham from Jefferies.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: The 2 questions that I have are when we talked about the step down on the 2005 -- 2015 target, it looks like you're only carving like 1 point or so out of the topline, yet $0.25 a share out of the bottom. Can you maybe walk us through that?
Randall J. Hogan: That's really, as 1.0 out of '14 -- it's a 1.5 out of '14. It's a 1.0 out of '15. It's the general bad news in missing the growth profile for 3 years running and the compounding of it.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: That's fair. Okay. My only other question was really about the Valves business. So some of your wording, are you suggesting that your 2015 target is really devoid of the project business because you're kind of, I think as you said, kind of tired of waiting for it. Is that gravy to the $4.50?
Randall J. Hogan: Well, I mean, these -- this CapEx pushing to the right affects Valves & Controls. It affects -- it, really, it affects 3 out of our 4 segments. But it really effects Valves & Controls and it really effects Technical Solutions. The big number, the big project that I was referring to really wanting to sort of fill in the upside to what we're saying are the thermal ones. There's some big Valves & Controls ones, too, that are -- would also be a risk of sliding, but Valves & Controls is thousands of projects. And so with the -- the law of large numbers helps us a little bit of that. In Thermal, they've had some really large, large projects that we were all excited about starting on and they're on ice.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: That's -- I get that. And I actually did have one last one I wanted to squeeze in, just on the -- based on the December Analyst Meeting you guys typically have, maybe it's November, whenever it's going to be, where were you really formalized your next year guidance. Randy, you're suggesting that $4.50 is sort of approximate, the final range that you give at that meeting could be higher, could be lower, or are you saying that your guidance will capture that number?
Randall J. Hogan: That will be my best guess right now. It could be higher. It could be lower. I mean, frankly, as I said, I can't go out and tell you anymore that I'm -- that I have a path to $5. I had to decide -- we had to decide, do we just take it away? Or do we give you some indication of what our best thinking is now? Obviously, our -- we weren't thinking -- it wasn't our best thinking that gave us $5, was it? I mean, so I think that would say that the $4.50 is our best guess right now based on what we know today. That's how I would want you to think about it.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Hammond from KeyBanc.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Just to kind of a follow on the large project. But Randy, more broadly, you mentioned kind of multiple degrees of freedom to hit the $5 and maybe now to hit the $4.50. And I'm assuming you're kind of talking about added buyback, kind of the $1.3 billion and the large projects and tax. Can you just talk about some of those levers that you can pull to kind of get you to the $4.50, or maybe nudge it above the $4.50 if the macro cooperates?
Randall J. Hogan: Yes, let's -- let me go back. Let me talk about it. I mean, that's exactly -- how we thought about the -- when we said that we were creating a business that had $5 of earnings power in 2015, when announced the merger on March 28, 2012. That was the takeaway on my last page. And when we thought about that $5, we said we believe we can overdrive synergies. We believe we're looking at a market, thought that should have really -- the economy should have rebounded really nicely and that'll be really good for Industrial and really good in Energy and we're going to clock some nice organic growth and we'll get drop through on that. And we have buyback. And we added all that up and we were comfortably above $5, right? And as the buyback, we were grateful that the stock responded to the early performance of the business and so the stock buyback didn't get quite as much impact because the stock price was higher. We did overdrive synergies. That was great. We had big disappointments in Water Transport, which we talked about. But also, Energy. And we really have underrun by 1% to 1.5% in '13 and '14 and now we think '15, what we really needed to have that great headroom above $5. So as we look at $4.50 and we came to that number, it's going to take another 1.5 -- more than 1.5 points of growth on the organic side to really help drive the topline, to drive above that number. Is that possible? I think it's possible. But we need less uncertainty in the world. We need more commitment to capital. We need some of these animal spirits of the economy to come to the floor. And look at the profitability we have. We're building in Valves & Controls and we have in our Technical Solutions business. We need organic growth. We will mint money when we get it. So I'm very focused right now. And that's one of the reasons why Water Transport, God bless the people in it, put them aside and focus everybody else on driving growth. Now we have the $700 million that's already approved in stock buyback. I'm committed to that. And we've got this other $1.3 billion. But how we use that $1.3 billion is to create shareholder value. And it could be stock buyback. It could be acquisitions. And we're going to look at all of it. So that's how we think about it. It's the way we thought about it when we put the businesses together. And I think our prospects as a company are every bit as good as they were. And we're going to exploit the ones we can capture.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay. Perfect. That's very helpful. Just a couple of clarifications. Process margins in 3Q look a little bit light. What's going on there? And how do think about tax x Water? I'm kind of...
John L. Stauch: The process margins, real quickly, is we do have some systems that we're beginning to ship and especially in our filtration processes. And so when we ship those systems, we generally get a little less margin. We do them for the aftermarket revenue of the membrane annuity stream. So every once in a while, we're going to have some lumpiness with the project margins in that business. Everything else is as is. And on the tax rate side, we continue to do all the right actions to benefit from the global structure that Randy mentioned in the OMT. We also have a similar project that were leading in Technical Solutions.
Randall J. Hogan: And I think, yes, the Water Transport x doesn't affect tax.
John L. Stauch: We're not expecting that to dramatically impact our tax rate, Jeff.
Operator: And you next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: A little more on the process margins. I -- Fourth quarter implies snapping back pretty quickly. So it sounds like the mix impact is pretty localized in the third quarter.
John L. Stauch: Yes. Keep in mind that our product systems business is generally a stronger-margin business right now than the Filtration & Processing. And so they have a strong Q2. They have lighter Q3 and then they usually have a stronger Q4. So the contribution for Aquatic Systems within the Process Technologies side versus the contribution from Filtration & Process also has an impact on the overall segment margins.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Okay. Great. And in terms of realizing value for Water Transport, you're exiting it at a pretty high bottom. Could you just comment on the timing a little bit?
Randall J. Hogan: Well, I mean, that was the early comment about the hard to sell an empty bag, an empty shopping bag. It's also not worth carrying around forever. So we showed you the evaluation of the deal economics as we see it today, one of the charts that John showed. And that basically is assuming modest value for that. So those multiples of how everybody, all the shareholders involved here, did very, very well with this acquisition, assumes we get a realistic number for Water Transport. Let me leave it at that.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Okay. And I heard a fair amount of companies saying the oil sands is picking up. You said sliding to the right, but also said you're seeing some pickup in the orders there. So how would you characterize that?
Randall J. Hogan: It's the releases against the orders that we need because we don't -- until we ship something, we can't bill it. And we can't make it until they release the order. And that's what really has me shaken because I've seen it slip 3 times and it's baseball season.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Credit Suisse.
Hamzah Mazari - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: You folks talked a lot about projects getting pushed to the right. Maybe give us a sense of, within the Energy, as well as in Industrial vertical, how much of your business would you say is tied to growth or discretionary CapEx versus maintenance? Any color around that will be helpful.
John L. Stauch: Yes, I mean, I think we gave you a rough percentage. I mean, our installed base is obviously substantially higher than what our greenfield projects would be. So with any given quarter, we're looking at about 50% to 60% our revenue comes from serving what we would say is the general installed base. And it's not like we're a project-dependent business. We're more CapEx-dependent. And this CapEx in these Energy spaces usually continues to flow. Right now, we're in about 2 or 3 years straight of that amount of capital being reduced or being timed, as Randy said. Our belief is that there's not a great fear of inflation so there's no sense of urgency to put the projects in motion.
Randall J. Hogan: Or in effect, the bids and rebids, they keep getting lower prices. So that's why they keep them in rebid.
John L. Stauch: So what we're really referring to is we're not counting or hoping, because hope is not a great plan, on any large, unique bluebird projects that may or may not be coming into the forecast.
Hamzah Mazari - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Great. And just a follow-up, any color you can give around North American residential markets? Are you seeing any pause there or continued momentum in your business?
Randall J. Hogan: I would say, we have, we've got the 3 businesses that serve. We have the Aquatics business, we have Residential pump and we have the Residential Filtration business. And in the pro channel, Residential Flow, we've got some modest growth, but nice growth. It's masked by the exit of the retail side that we've talked about. And Residential Filtration is growing, again, single digits. Not exciting, but decent, not quite mid-singles, but -- and then Aquatics continues to do well with the share gain and the energy savings and the leading product lines and the best sales force. So that's pretty high. And that's continued. I see it as pretty steady. And the thing that really drives, certainly, the Residential Filtration and the Aquatics business is people putting money into homes. It isn't just housing starts, it's actually investments, if you will, in the housing stock. And so we -- it's been pretty stable for the 3 or 4 quarters of growth and even for a couple of businesses longer than that. And so we've actually seen in a couple of markets, where we think the markets can be stronger if there were -- if contractors could actually hire skilled labor. There's skilled labor shortage in some of the crafts in some areas of the country. It's affected our pool business and I think it's affected some of the remodeling business as well. On the pump side, it's really good for all of our pump players when -- the well pumps, so homes being built. When communities are being opened up and when larger homes built outside, they have the most pump content. Most of the housing that's being done is multifamily. So it has a more muted benefit to the Residential business when you have multifamily housing tighter to the city. That's probably too long an answer. Sorry.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg from Vertical Research.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Coming to just the lock on the free cash flow and the buyback and everything else. You did keep your free cash flow estimate despite the fact that you are taking operating profit down between now and 2015, I think about maybe $100 million. So a little bit less on that income line, but maybe just talk about what the bridge is. Are you getting better working capital performance out of -- versus your original plan? It would be helpful to get some detail there.
John L. Stauch: Yes, the -- I think the original forecast did not include any real contribution from working capital. And yes, we are performing better in working capital. And yes, we continue to feel confident about achieving greater than 110% of net income. So I think it was really more of a conservative first look at the cash flow. And generally our forecast right now is what the see and therefore, what we shared with you.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Okay. And that's mostly on the Valves & Controls side of the business or is it coming elsewhere?
Randall J. Hogan: No. Valves & Controls would be the primary contributor.
Randall J. Hogan: Yes. But we have -- in our Process Technologies business, we have a lot of opportunity. We really have opportunity on working capital in all of our businesses, but Valves & Controls is a big one.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Got you. And just secondly, just on the Valves & Controls and the outlook. I mean, we actually have been hearing, I guess it's been mixed, but generally positive data points on orders our pumps related to oil and gas and other projects. And typically, you do see the Valves follow that by a couple of quarters. So most of the pump guys have been, I guess, giving a little bit more confidence that things are starting to happen. I guess, why are you being so conservative in that case if you do see the leading indicators actually starting to improve?
John L. Stauch: I think as Randy mentioned, we're optimistic that we can see a couple more quarters of sustained order growth. Our Q2 reflected a pretty solid order quarter and we're hopeful Q3 and Q4. But we're now in the point of the cycle where if we book the orders and the valve is processed, we're looking at 2015 shipments. So what we're reflecting right now in the 2014 forecast is our shippable backlog, plus what we believe we can get to the book and ship and get out by the end of the year. We're hopeful that -- we looked at that same days that you did and that is the right leading indicator. And we're hopeful that we see those order start to come in Valves space and that would set up a nice 2015.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: And can you just touch on the pricing of some of the emerging projects that are coming to market? Is it more competitive, or is it holding fairly stable?
Randall J. Hogan: I don't think there's anything -- there's nothing surprising or any kind of large move that I have seen in pricing. I mentioned earlier about a lot of rebids that are happening in the Energy business. That's really for the whole project. It didn't really affect our scope of the projects. But some of these huge, huge, $10 billion projects, they want to cut $1 billion out. That comes from redesigning the plan and doing things differently. So that's what I was referring to there.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time.

Operator: At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Pentair Q1 2014 earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Lucas, you may begin your conference.
James Lucas: Thanks, operator, and welcome to Pentair's first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. We're glad you could join us. I am Jim Lucas, vice president of investor relations, and with me today is Randy Hogan, our chairman and chief executive officer, and John Stauch, our chief financial officer. On today's call, we will provide details on our first quarter 2014 performance, as well as our second quarter and full year 2014 outlook as outlined in this morning's release. Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as the risks outlined in Pentair's most recent 10-K and today's release. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today, and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results. Today's webcast is accompanied by a presentation, which can be found in the Investors section of Pentair's website. We will reference these slides throughout our prepared remarks. All references today will be on an adjusted basis, unless otherwise indicated, for which the non-GAAP financials are reconciled in the appendix of the presentation. We will be sure to reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. We will target to be done in an hour. I would like to request that you limit your questions to one and a follow up, and get back in the queue for further questions so that everyone has an opportunity to ask their questions. I will now turn the call over to Randy.
Randall Hogan : Thanks, Jim. Good morning everyone. Let me begin with our first quarter performance, on slide four. Before I go through the results in detail, as has been our practice since the Flow Control merger, I want to note that we’re discussing our operating results on an adjusted basis to more clearly show the core operating performance of our businesses. With that, here are the first quarter numbers. First quarter revenue grew 1% on a core basis, but showed down 3% on a reported basis, which we will explain in more detail in a moment. Adjusted operating income was up 14%, and adjusted operating margin expanded 170 basis points to 11.8%. Adjusted EPS grew 26%, coming at the high end of our expected range at $0.73. Free cash flow was a small usage, which is normal in our first quarter. This reflects a seasonal working capital build in many of our residential businesses and in this year’s first quarter, the fact that a larger than average portion of revenue was generated in March due to the slow January and February. We believe we are on track to deliver full year free cash flow greater than 105% of net income.  During the quarter, we completed our original $1.2 billion share repurchase authorization and are now into our next $1 billion repurchase authorization. Now let’s turn to slide five, for a more detailed look at the first quarter results. As I said previously, our reported sales declined 3%. The waterfall on the left-hand side of the page shows that we experienced 2 points of foreign exchange headwinds, principally the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar, a 1 point headwind from divestitures, and another point of headwind from the nonrepeating Glebe Weir project in our water transport business in Australia. We’ll provide more detail on this business when discussing our flow technologies segment.  We do not believe we were alone in seeing a slow start to the year, with weaker revenue in January and February, but the majority of our business has experienced nice revenue acceleration in March and early April has seen many of those trends continue.  The right half of the page shows first quarter Pentair operating profit and margin. Operating margin expansion of 170 basis points was helped in large part by strong productivity, which includes synergies. As we have discussed in the past, in order to deliver on our targeted margin expansion of 150 basis points per year, we need to deliver on both base productivity and synergies, so we track them together. We continue to gain momentum on both Lean and sourcing initiatives, and we identified 18 focus factories that we expect to drive additional margin gains in 2014. As we’ve experienced additional top line challenges, we took further repositioning actions in the first quarter to accelerate our productivity results. Overall, while we are not satisfied with our top line performance in the first quarter, we continue to deliver on productivity and synergies and see strengthening of the top line as we enter the seasonally strong period for our residential and commercial businesses. Our backlog gives us further confidence in our expectation for an accelerating top line growth rate in the second half of the year as well. Now let’s turn to slide six, for a performance review of our largest segment, valves and controls. Valves and controls organic sales declined 7%, which followed strong double-digit growth in the fourth quarter 2013. This segment has shown a great deal of variability quarter to quarter, and we will continue to seek improvements in our forecast for the top line. One of the ways we’re doing that is by looking at longer periods for comparisons and evaluations. For instance, if we combine the fourth quarter of 2013 and the first quarter of 2014, and compare that six-month period to its prior year comparable, sales show growth of 5% year over year as compared to the 19% gain in the fourth quarter of 2013 and the 7% decline in the first quarter of this year. A fair amount of the quarter to quarter swing relates to timing of large project shipments, but we also experienced a fair amount of variability in our shorter cycle business. All four industries served by valves and controls posted a decline, with sharp drops in power and mining.  The declines in oil and gas were principally related to the timing of large project shipments, while the power decline came from weaker nuclear demand. We did see some softness earlier in the quarter on our overall short cycle business, but service showed solid growth in the quarter.  The right half of the page shows fourth quarter valves and controls operating profits and margins. Adjusted operating margins expanded 140 basis points to 11.5%, which included $5 million in costs for the GBU’s operating model transformation, or OMT. As a reminder, we expect the OMT investment in valves and controls to continue on an annual basis through 2016, and that investment is expected to drive nearly $80 million of annual operating income savings once completed, and an overall tax benefit to Pentair of roughly 3 points due to the optimization of the global valves and controls structure in Switzerland. Now let’s turn to slide seven for a look at the orders and backlogs for valves and controls. As you can see on slide seven, the valves and controls backlog is broken down into four key industries, three of which fall into our energy vertical, oil and gas, power, and mining, and one in our industrial vertical, which is process industries. Overall backlog remained near $1.4 billion, which is relatively consistent with where it has been since we acquired the business near the end of 2012. Orders were relatively flat in process, oil and gas, and mining, but power showed a sharp decline in orders. We’ve experienced a fair amount of quarter to quarter variability in sales and orders within oil and gas, but we still see healthy quoting activity. Industrial process is still expected to benefit from increased capital spending related to anticipated growth in North American chemical capacity. We anticipate this will be more of a second half and 2015 benefit for our valves and controls business.  Power remains a wildcard, but the backlog remains relatively consistent, and despite the quarter to quarter volatility in orders, we expect shipments to pick up later in the year. We remain very cautious on mining, but this is the smallest portion of valves and controls. Now let’s move to slide eight for a review of process technologies. We indicated on our fourth quarter earnings call that we would begin to report in four segments, as our previous water and fluid solutions segment was split into process technologies and flow technologies. As a reminder, process technologies comprises our filtration and process and aquatic systems GBUs. Process technologies reported good top line growth of 5%, which included a 1 point FX translation headwind. Both the residential and commercial and food and beverage verticals grew at a double digit rate, building on the momentum we saw in this business last year. The right half of the page shows first quarter process technologies operating profit and margins. Operating margins expanded a disappointingly modest 10 basis points to 11.7% as a result of two principal factors during the quarter. First, we saw strong shipments of larger system sales in our beverage business, which as we indicated last quarter has a dilutive impact on the overall segment results, as these systems carry lower margins on initial installs, but they’re important to building an installed base to drive higher margin replacement sales in the future. Second, our residential filtration business experienced a slow January that resulted in poorer operating leverage than normal that month, followed by a strong increase in demand in March, which led to overtime and some expedited freight. We expect more normalized sales trends and greater operating margin expansion in the seasonally strong second quarter. Now let’s move to slide nine for a look at flow technologies. This is the first quarter that we’ve reported our flow technologies segment, which as a reminder is a combination of the legacy Pentair flow technologies business and the Australian water business that was part of legacy Flow Control. As expected, we saw a sharp decline in flow technologies, with sales down 7% on a reported basis. There were two main causes of this decline. We saw a 4 point headwind from the Australian dollar and another 4 point headwind from the nonrepeating Glebe Weir project in 2013. We’ll discuss the impact of the Australian water transportation further on the next slide. The legacy flow technologies businesses actually saw modest growth in the quarter.  The right half of the page shows first quarter flow technologies operating profits and margins. Operating margins expanded 50 basis points to 9.9% as the impact of no project activity in Australia and the tough comp it created was nearly a full point of margin headwind in the quarter. We continue to aggressively rightsize the cost structure of the Australia water transport business to reflect the reality of a much different looking business today than was expected over a year ago. We continue to see strong productivity in the other parts of flow technologies, and the repositioning benefits are helping to partially offset the sharp declines experienced in water transport. Let’s now turn to slide 10 for additional color on our water transport business. Given the dramatic decline in water transport, we thought it would be helpful to explain how much of an impact the decline in the Australian economy has had on this business.  When the mining industry was strong, in 2012, and there were a number of large projects in Australia, this business generated over $550 million of revenue. This is about the average revenue over the five year period five years prior to 2012, with the peak around $715 million in 2010. At the time of the Flow Control acquisition, based on projects booked and being bid, this business was anticipated to generate over $800 million in 2015. We knew, based on the backlog and the debooking of two large projects shortly after the acquisition, that we were facing a decline in 2013, but this business has faced a significant lack of projects that has led to further declines in 2014 to historically low levels. We’ve been aggressively going after restructuring in this business, but there is a fixed cost element that, on these lower sales, is creating earning headwinds in 2014. As shown in the slide, the second quarter is the last expected large headwind, and this is likely to lower our overall EPS in the quarter by $0.08. It’s not realistic to expect this business to rebound anytime soon, as demand from China on the mining industry remains low and municipal investments just aren’t happening. We’ve taken significant costs out of this business and the tough year over year comps diminish in the second half of the year. A decline in Australia of this magnitude was not foreseen, but it in no way does it lead us to back off of our commitment of $5 of EPS in 2015. We’ve stepped up the restructuring activities and driving up side performance in other businesses, and we continue to drive productivity and synergies across all of Pentair to help offset this lingering headwind. We’ll keep you posted on our progress. Let’s now turn to slide 11 for a look at the technical solutions results. Technical solutions sales grew 1% in the quarter, but price and volume contributed 3 points of growth, offset by 1 point of headwinds from FX and another point from divestitures.  As a reminder, we sold our [unintelligible] specialty motors business in the first quarter last year, so this divestiture comparison goes away in the second quarter. This is the second consecutive quarter of growth that technical solutions has delivered following declines in the first nine months of 2013.  We saw growth in the industrial, residential, commercial, and infrastructure verticals while energy declined in the quarter. After a slow start to the year, we saw daily orders rates in our electrical business accelerate in March, and this trend has continued into early April. The cold weather in the U.S. did have some benefits for our thermal business, but Europe experienced unseasonably warm weather, and we saw weakness in Canada offsetting that. At the same time, our electronics business has benefited from improving demand and new products.  The right half of the page shows first quarter technical solutions operating profits and margins. Margins were a great story yet again, as adjusted operating margins expanded 210 basis points to 19.1%, with strong productivity, synergies, and operating leverage all on display during the quarter. While thermal is entering its seasonally slowest quarter, our equipment protection and electronics businesses are seeing improved momentum entering the second quarter.  Let’s now turn to slide 12 for a closer look at the total Pentair growth profile. First quarter saw solid performance in the U.S. and Western Europe, weakness in Canada and Australia, and mixed signals in fast growth regions. In the U.S., we continue to see strength in residential and commercial. In Western Europe, we saw a modest recovery. In the fast growth regions, the Middle East declined due to timing of one large project. We still expect strong growth for the full year. Southeast Asia remains mixed, and we continue to see growth in China and Latin America.  Our residential and commercial and food and beverage verticals remain the bright spots. We still expect growth in all of our verticals except infrastructure, which is weighted down by the weakness in Australia. Energy continued its trends of lumpiness with a first quarter decline, following a 15% gain in the fourth quarter of 2013. First quarter weakness was principally related to the power declines in valves and controls, as we discussed earlier.  We continue to see strength in oil and gas quoting activity, so we expect to see low single digit growth in energy for the year. Industrial was down modestly in the quarter, with the improvement in our electrical daily orders rate and the continued strong quoting around the anticipated North American chemical manufacturing renaissance gives us increased confidence that industrial will grow at a modest pace for the full year. We’re entering the seasonally strongest period for our North American residential businesses, which follows another strong mid-single digit growth quarter for this vertical. We also saw improvements in both the European and China residential markets and our businesses exposed to commercial construction are also seeing signs of improvement. Infrastructure remains the weakest vertical, but again, this is due exclusively to Australia. Our North American break and fix business remains steady. We’ve seen a bottoming in desalination, and datacom, telecom, electronics has bounced off the bottom, as evidenced by a second consecutive quarter of strong growth. Food and beverage is expected to see solid mid-single digit growth this year, which follows strong double-digit growth last year. We expect continued slowness in our U.S. agriculture related businesses, both irrigation pump and crop spray OEM, but the aftermarket piece in cross spray remains solid. Our food service business continues to experience strong international growth, and beverage systems continues to have a healthy backlog.  Please turn to slide 13, labeled Q1 Assessment and Full Year Outlook. Before turn the call over to John to review our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2014, I wanted to offer a summary of why we remain optimistic that we’re on track to deliver on our full year commitment. Our top line came in a little lower than we anticipated, but this was due in large part to a slow January and February after robust growth experienced in the fourth quarter of 2013 to end the year. We saw strengthening in many of our businesses in March, and that has continued into early April. We will still have the Australian water transport headwind in the second quarter, but we expect this will be partially offset by the seasonal strength of our North American residential businesses. As we look out to the second half, we’re seeing signs of increased capital spending by industrial customers and a building backlog in our valves and controls business. We continue to drive our productivity and synergies and have put additional action plans in place to drive even more productivity gains. And our OMT investment in valve controls is on track. Of course, we’re committed to investing in growth, which we expect to start reflecting in our results in the second half of 2014. In addition, our balance sheet remains in great shape, and we’re on track for another record year of free cash flow. Our businesses that have earned the right to grow are building their acquisition pipeline. We continue to focus on the elements where we can control our own destiny, and while we still have to earn the right to talk about growth, we believe the second quarter will represent our last difficult year over year comparison, and of course we have opportunities to drive further margin expansion into 2015 and beyond. With that, I’ll turn the call over to John.
John Stauch : Thank you, Randy. Please turn to slide number 14, titled Q2 2014 Pentair Outlook. For the second quarter of 2014, we expect sales to be flat to down about 1%, and approximately $1.95 billion. Valves and controls are expected to be flat due to timing of current backlog and an expected ramp of short cycle orders. Process technologies is anticipated to be up 6% to 8% in its seasonally strongest quarter. Flow technologies is expected to be down approximately 20% due to the last tough comparison in our water transport business that Randy discussed in detail earlier on the call. Excluding this project, sales should be up approximately 3%. Finally, technical solutions is expected to be up 4% to 6%, led by our equipment protection and electronics businesses. We are expecting adjusted operating income up 6%, and adjusted operating margins to expand approximately 100 basis points to 14.7%. This includes about $7 million more of OMT investments in valves and controls and the impact of the Australian headwinds mentioned earlier. Excluding these, operating income would be up approximately 16% versus Q2 of last year. Our EPS forecast for the second quarter is a range of $1.02 to $1.05, or an increase of roughly 13%..  Please turn to slide 15, titled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. Quarter end debt was approximately $2.9 billion, or $2.7 billion on a net debt basis, inclusive of global cash on hand. In the first quarter, we returned $300 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.  At the end of the first quarter, we have now completed our initial $1.2 billion share repurchase authorization, and have just under $900 million remaining under our current $1 billion authorization. We are seeking authorization from our shareholders at our May annual general meeting to increase our dividend to $0.30 per share per quarter from $0.25 per share per quarter, which, if approved, will mark our 38th consecutive year of annual dividend increases. Our ROIC ended the quarter at 10%. We continue to have a lot of opportunities on the working capital front with legacy Flow Control businesses, and we expect to make further progress as the year continues. Please turn to slide number 16, labeled Full Year 2014 Pentair Outlook. We are reiterating our full year EPS guidance of $3.85 to $4.00 on approximately $7.7 billion in sales. We have moderated our growth rate by a point to a range of 2% to 4%, reflecting the impact of FX and the slower start in January. Valves and controls is now expected to grow 1% to 3%, as backlogs remain strong and we continue to focus more on the short cycle businesses. Process technologies is expected to grow 8% to 10%, with continued strength in aquatics, beverage systems, food service, and an improving residential and commercial filtration business. Flow technologies is anticipated to be down 5% to 7%, related to the lack of project activity in Australia, the tough comps we discussed earlier, and [unintelligible] backs. Excluding the water transport business, we expect flow technologies to grow approximately 4% to 5%. Technical solutions is expected to grow 4% to 6%, as we signs of business improving in the North American electrical distribution channel, strength in our electronics business, and easier comps for our thermal business. We do not expect any megaproject activity in 2014, but as we have stated in the past, we will update accordingly at the appropriate time if any megaprojects enter the backlog. Adjusted operating income is expected to expand to approximately $1.1 billion, which would represent a record for Pentair. We expect three of the four segments to expand operating margins in excess of 100 basis points, with only flow technologies not achieving that level, as we continue to aggressively rightsize the cost structure with a dramatically reduced demand environment at our water transport business.  Overall corporate costs are expected to be down due to lower corporate integration costs. For the full year, we expect the tax rate to be around 23.5%, net interest expense to be approximately $70 million, and the share count to be around 198.5 million. We expect EPS to expand around 22% to $3.93, at the midpoint of the guidance range. We are expecting another record year of free cash flow, with at least $850 million, or greater than 105% of net income. Operator, can you please open the line for questions? 
Operator: [Operator instructions.] Your first question comes from the line of Mike Halloran from Robert Baird. 
Mike Halloran - Robert Baird: Let’s start on the revenue guidance. It sounds like the two main pressure points, a little bit of Canada FX and maybe some volumes there, but the predominant part is the Australia side. Maybe you could just go into a little bit more detail - and by the way, great color on slide 10 on the year over year and some more water transportation information - but maybe if you could just talk about what you’re seeing on the short cycle, kind of everyday business over there, as well as what the outlook on the project activity looks like, and if there are even any projects embedded in the guidance as you look forward in that specific piece today.
Randall Hogan : The volume we get is really all small projects, maintenance. There’s always some of that. That business has always had at least one or two larger projects, and then they’d get big ones on top of that. This year is unprecedented in that it has none of those bigger projects. And we don’t have any bigger projects coming in the forecast. So that’s what’s different. We thought we’d get a couple of those. They went away.
Mike Halloran - Robert Baird : And on the regular way side, how’s that business? Is that a little bit worse than expected as well right now?
John Stauch : No, that’s clipping along at roughly flat or modestly up. As Randy mentioned, primarily a break in fix or reestablishing fixing things that are already installed. That business has always been relatively steady. But it’s the project business, and usually at this particular point in time, we’ve always got two or three, or we at least have meaningful ones at the front [log]. We’re not even seeing front log activity in Australia related to these projects.
Mike Halloran - Robert Baird : If I take out the Australia and some of the Canada pieces and things like that, it looks like the core businesses outside of that are tracking consistent, if not ahead of your expectations, on a full year basis. You obviously have commented on some improving trends as you look through March and April here, but what gives you the confidence on the energy side that you’re going to see some improvement as you work through the year there? And then also, maybe just a little bit more color about some of the end markets you’re starting to see improve a little bit.
Randall Hogan : We’re getting better at seeing the businesses in our current configuration, and as we’re looking at our bidding activity. In energy, bidding activity remains strong. The power surprise, nuclear valves is a nice business, and that was surprising to see the short cycle in that. So, short cycle, which is repair and maintenance, was actually weaker in the nuclear business than we would have anticipated. That was really the only surprise in energy. But the variability quarter to quarter is not that big a surprise. So we feel good about energy because of the bidding activity, and that’s consistent across all of the GBUs that serve energy. 
John Stauch : The only thing I would add to it is, I’m sure like a lot of the companies you follow, our January and February slow start, March was very strong. And we’ve anticipated or put in the normalized view of what we think the year’s going to be, so we’re obviously monitoring April, and is April tracking more like March, and how comfortable do we feel. We’ll have a better picture of that, obviously, as we close out Q2. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of Citi Research.
Deane Dray - Citi Research : It looked like corporate expense came in lighter than what we were looking for, and right at the end of your prepared remarks, you commented that corporate is coming down with lower integration costs. But maybe just what were the dynamics this quarter on the corporate line that might have made it more favorable?
John Stauch : We’re looking at around 23 to 25 this year, probably closer to 23, each and every quarter. So we’re about $1 million under that. We’re going to have variability in things like stock comp timing, medical timing, and litigation. That’s about the only variability we would have. So it wasn’t a big delta. The year over year is the integration costs. We were obviously very heavy into the corporate integration last year, and you see that number reflected in over $30 million of expenses. That came down throughout last year. So most of our integration activities now are all in the businesses. So we mentioned OMT, that’s being absorbed in the valves and controls business. And most of all, our Lean activities and costs that are being borne to drive the synergies that are all being managed by the businesses now.
Deane Dray - Citi Research : And then on process tech, the margin hit, or just the margin pressure because of the mix, maybe you could just expand on that. When you ship these larger systems, is that also because you have content that’s not Pentair content, and that’s more of a pass-through. If you could just give us some context and color regarding those kinds of shipments, and what that outlook embedded is, for the balance of the year. 
Randall Hogan : It’s both. It’s both a lower margin because the systems are direct to the OEMs or part of lower projects, and they’ve always been a little bit tighter. But there’s also, as we build a valves kit, or we build a [cold] block, there is a lot more purchase pass through parts. That’s part of it too.
John Stauch : But as you know, we’re doing it because we’ve got the memory there that within 12 to 18 months, it’s going to be replaced, and we look for those aftermarket sales, and that’s much higher margin. So this is the razor, if you will, and the razor blade is to come.
Deane Dray - Citi Research : Yeah, I’d much rather see you shipping these systems as solutions as opposed to component pieces. And then just a quick clarification on the nuclear business. We’ve seen this elsewhere, from mothballed plants, that just would have ordered these valves that are now just being mothballed, or is it lower utilization, lower maintenance spending?
Randall Hogan : Well, it’s some of both. Germany was down, but Germany is moving away from nuclear, so those are being mothballed. So that’s maintenance that isn’t going to get done unless, for some reason, they open them up. At the same time, France has recommitted to another 50 year life extension for their whole nuclear fleet, and they’re going to be net exporters of electricity to all of Europe. But their maintenance was lighter than we would expect. The U.S. maintenance was lighter than we would have expected. And then there’s project businesses in China and other countries that are there to ship, and they just don’t ship. But the mothballing factor, we believe that we have that factored in. The surprise was more on the expected maintenance and the shipping of projects that are new installations, in countries that are building them.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Sanford C. Bernstein. 
Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein: John, question for you. When you sort of now think about how long you’ve had valves and controls, and the difficulty in forecasting this business, when you look within your FP&A process and talent pool, what kind of changes are you putting in place so that - I know there are big projects, I know you’ve gotten certain surprises, but nonetheless, there are a lot of highly diversified companies with similar dynamics who have a maybe more mature FP&A process in businesses like this. How far away from that are you, do you think, in terms of time to get there? Or do you think it’s just going to be a tough business to ever get there?
John Stauch : I think we’ll definitely get there. I mean, we talk about blue chips being top priorities here, and believe me, this is Randy’s top blue chip, which means it’s my top blue chip, which means it’s the business’s top blue chip.  And right now, it’s complicated. These acquisitions were acquired, and we basically have 40 individual businesses that really take sales in 128 different locations, and then those sales are put on the factories. And you could imagine, some of these are in stock, and some of these make the stocks, and some of these configure the order, and some of these are larger projects.  But this is all solvable, and this is where our Lean tools really come in, and we’ve initiated and kicked off that project. So there is a financial element to this, but there’s also a process element that goes all the way through the sci op process. And as I mentioned, it’s Randy’s top priority, which means the business is all over it right now. I can’t tell you why they reach at the end of the quarter so much, like in Q4, and then you see the slowness this quarter, and then the catch up. I think that’s their lack of confidence in what that shipments needs to be to manage those quarters.
Randall Hogan : We all have experience in those kinds of businesses, in our past life, that with longer cycle, should be more predictable. That’s one of the benefits of a longer cycle business. But as John said, it’s a function of the fact that the businesses have not been integrated, and that’s our big opportunity. That’s what our OMT project is about. And beyond the OMT, to get more granular understanding of the forecasts that come in, it’s not just in FP&A. It’s the sales forecasting. It’s an organizational capability. And we know how to do it, and we’re working on it.
Steve Winoker - Sanford Bernstein : And then on capital deployment, what is your willingness or desire to step up the repurchase part of the deployment over the next year or so?
John Stauch : We definitely have the ability to. I think we will, if we need to. Right now, we’d like to balance that with acquisitions, especially in the platforms that Randy mentioned [unintelligible], they’re growing nicely, organically. They have a great standardized back office. And right now, there’s a big willingness to have discussions around acquisition. There is an agreement on price. But that’s what we’d like to do, is balance this between share buyback and acquisition.
Steve Winoker - Sanford Bernstein : And then this food and beverage has been a fantastic contributor now for some time, and offset a lot of weakness in other segments. As those segments start to come back, do you think food and beverage has got this sort of longer-term secular story, where it’s not like we’re going to see that decrease as the other ones come up?
John Stauch: I don’t think we can sustain 20% growth a year, but the reason we think we’re more in the double digits on a long term basis is we have solved something significant for the large beverage manufacturers, which is a way to filter their product, which has become a standard element. And so as they expand the breweries or rearranged the breweries, we’re a big piece of that. The other element that’s in the food and beverage is not only our ag offering, but what we believe is, you know, aquaculture and aquaponics, and a lot of other offerings. So we are focused on it. We have a lot of new product introductions there, and we have a global offering, which is really being well accepted. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Shannon O’Callaghan of Nomura Securities.
Shannon O’Callaghan - Nomura : First, I was just wondering, I know you touched on this a little bit, but the fast growth markets have been rather lumpy in the recent quarters. Can you talk a little bit more about the moving parts there, and maybe some detail around your outlook for these regions for the rest of the year?
Randall Hogan : The Middle East is still in a long term growth trend. We just had a really big project that shipped last year in the valves and controls business, in the Middle East. And that [unintelligible] in the Middle East looks weak. The secular trend, if you will, for our Middle East growth, is good. China has come back in residential spending. It’s nice to see that again in China. And it’s slowed down. And for us, that’s in the water business. So we think now that that’s coming back, it should continue for us. Latin America had suffered some setbacks from Brazil, but the rest of Latin America is lifting that. 
John Stauch : I’d say any time you get to see a valves number like this, you’re going to see its impact. It’s been our largest fast growth provider product, it’s going to have a general toll on the reporting. But the underlying water businesses right now in the fast growth regions is seeing nice, sustained, consistent growth. We’ve put a lot of investment and effort there, and I think I’m with Randy, I think we feel like these markets continue to be better than they were last year, with the exception of Brazil, and I think we have a long term growth rate here that I call mid-single digits.
Shannon O’Callaghan - Nomura : And then just maybe on acquisitions, what are these main areas of priority? Do you have a range in mind when you think in terms of size, of what you’d be willing to do? Or is that kind of a rolling target?
John Stauch : We look at everything. And as I said earlier, obviously the integration effort, we’d like that to be on something that’s much more lean today, and could accept a larger acquisition.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.
Steve Tusa - JPMorgan Chase : Just kind of a nitpicky question on the process technologies. You had two businesses that are, I guess, representing about 85% of the segment, residential, commercial, food and beverage, they were up 10%, 17% respectively. But sales were only up 5%. What was down so much in that business? Presumably, it’s forex or anything like that. Am I missing something on the end market dynamics?
Randall Hogan : It’s the water purification, the business that serves desalination and just the pure water side.
Steve Tusa - JPMorgan Chase : How big is that business?
John Stauch : A little over $160 million annually.
Steve Tusa - JPMorgan Chase : So it must have been down a lot.
John Stauch :  Yeah, it’s a muni play. It was down around 20% in the quarter there. And we were also slightly down in our energy, which is more of a timing issue, and when those shipments will go out. That was down roughly 10%. That’s about a $100 million a year business.
Steve Tusa - JPMorgan Chase : And then on valves and controls, your profits were up $3 million this quarter on a pretty significant revenue decline. I think the guidance for the next quarter has kind of a similar profit on a flattish revenues. Is that like OMT flowing through? Is there something there? Why wouldn’t that be better? Why wouldn’t the $3 million and increase be better with flattish revenues?
John Stauch : I actually love your question, because we feel the same way. Right now there’s a couple million dollars more of OMT, and we do think that the productivity that we’ve seen in the last several quarters, we believe that that’s going to continue to come through here. So we’re looking for that increased Lean and sourcing savings, and I think whenever you’re flat, I think businesses find it hard to forecast significant operating income on flattish growth.
Steve Tusa - JPMorgan Chase : So the OMT, I think it was $5 million in the first quarter, I think we thought it was going to be more like $7 million. I know this is nitpicking, but what’s the number for the second quarter in OMT?
John Stauch : Roughly $7 million.
Steve Tusa - JPMorgan Chase : So you get back to that kind of run rate. And then just one last question on overall productivity. I know you’ve changed the slide somewhat, but getting to about $45 million in combined productivity and synergies for the quarter, I know you’re not going to give us explicit guidance, but I would assume, are the synergies on track here as far as what you had laid out on an annual basis? Are you still expecting the same amount of synergies from [unintelligible]?
John Stauch : Absolutely. I think the piece that we absolutely know about is the restructuring, and when you take a look at what we’ve done today, we’ve taken roughly $200 million in charges, and that run rate on those savings would be north of $200 million. And that’s the piece that we absolutely have tangible confidence that we’re going to achieve. The piece that’s a little harder to gauge is some Lean savings, and how much is core, and how much is synergies, especially when you need growth leverage to benefit from both, and also, on the sourcing side, how much would you have gotten anyway. But right now, I did the same math you did. We exited at $40 million. I think we picked up some incremental synergies on top of that, probably knocking on the door of close to $45 million to $50 million, from a run rate basis. And we continue to believe that we’re going to escalate through the year, based upon the incremental actions we even [drilled] in Q1.
Steve Tusa - JPMorgan Chase : But I guess the comp gets tougher on synergies year over year, into the second quarter. Is that where the restructuring comes in? You just did some restructuring and that kind of reloads that, if we want to call it a core productivity pipeline. So that does look like, in the second quarter, that that productivity, if you kind of parse those out, and use what you had guided to previously, on synergy, it does look like that steps up in the second quarter on your guidance, because the revenues are obviously weaker, but in the context of those weaker revenues, the profitability still looks pretty decent in the second quarter. So is that kind of the way to think about it, that the restructuring, if we assume that the synergies were what they were, does the restructuring kind of help that productivity number step up in the last nine months of the year?
John Stauch : Yeah, because we’re getting the restructuring, we’re getting the synergies, and when we start to grow on that reduced cost structure, the leverage is very nice. And when we track this year, synergies aren’t the problem. We’re slightly underperforming on the core, and that’s related to the revenue. We’re also utilizing those incremental synergies, as you know now, to cover the water transport impact. And we anniversary that in Q2, so I feel like we’re well positioned on restructuring and when we get the growth, we’re going to see some pretty nice leverage. 
Steve Tusa - JPMorgan Chase : Is this it for restructuring for the year? Are you guys done for the year?
John Stauch : We expect to be done by the end of Q2.
Steve Tusa - JPMorgan Chase : Okay, so it will be more than $22 million or $23 million or something like that. 
John Stauch : I think they’ll carry over into Q2, correct.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Pokrzywinski with MKM Partners.
Joshua Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners : First question, on slide 10, that’s helpful color, but did any of that come together or become more clear as we worked through Q1. I guess as I look at that, a lot of that seems like it could have been more helpful to point out last quarter. So I’m just wondering how much of that is more of a recent revelation in terms of sizing up some of those things.
Randall Hogan : Well, it’s not recent. As we were doing the restructuring, one of the things we knew was this business was one of the reasons we wanted to consolidate GBUs, is we want to take out cost structure around businesses that just didn’t need the cost structure, and couldn’t afford the cost structure. The new information is the fact that the expected additional one or two projects just aren’t materializing. It was at that point we realized, this is something we should share. It’s not a surprise. What’s a surprise is the fact that none of the projects that would be reasonably expected, and that were actually being talked about, have materialized as real projects. 
John Stauch: This isn’t a highly configured business. It’s apparently a standard product that goes into our factories that maintain a fairly high fixed cost structure. So when you get a project, you can usually start shipping it within 30 to 60 days. And so this is the season that we usually see those projects enter at least the front log, if not the back log. And what Randy’s saying is, we don’t even see them in the front log, let alone the back log. So this was the time we felt we needed to share with you guys what we’re absorbing in the rest of the base business. 
Joshua Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners : And then just shifting over to valves and controls, it seems like there’s a bit of a gap forming between pretty healthy quoting activity or tone from customers and orders that I think have hit a new low since, on a quarterly basis, since you guys took over the business.  And then I guess the same question on backlog versus shipment. Backlog seems like it’s pretty healthy, and you get these persistent delays. What am I missing? Or what is the gap there? Is it walking away from unprofitable business, like you guys had talked about? Is it a forecasting/timing issue that you’re still getting your arms around? I guess are there any other unintended consequences of this transformation, like sales force attrition or anything else? 
John Stauch : Not seeing that. We’re feeling the same optimism in the market that everybody else is talking about. Last Q2, we had a difficult orders quarter. We saw a little bit of recovery in Q4 of last year. And I wouldn’t say we’re at a historical low, but we’re not ecstatic about the Q1 orders. But if you take the March order rate, it was relatively strong. So I think we’re hearing the same optimism in the market, and we’re expecting that quoting activity to turn orders, and we’re tracking this to a weekly order rate, and looking at the variances and doing our root cause countermeasures. I don’t think there’s any systematic issue to what you’ve asked. I think it’s a matter of getting this capital investment spent, and getting those projects put into place.
Joshua Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners : Is there anything else outside of nuclear, which sounds like it was a bit of a short cycle surprise in Q1, from a short cycle perspective, that was particularly underwhelming in the first quarter. I guess you’ve seen energy bounce around in general. Any other kind of quick lead time…
Randall Hogan : Well, yeah, on the short cycle. We have probably the lowest conversion of, if you will, short cycle orders in quarter four quarter the business has seen in a while. And mining affected that too. If the mine’s open, it’s going to have maintenance. And so that was lower than we would have expected. So I would say it’s both power and mining.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America. 
Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just a question on markets and how should I look at performance? It seems that nuclear was a little bit weaker. Mining was weaker, Australia was weaker. If we strip that out, and if we look at the forecast, what else has changed? And what are the positives and what are the negatives? Just another level down. 
John Stauch : Yes, Europe remains a slight positive. They did have a warm winter, as Randy mentioned. We had a thermal business that obviously was impacted, but the rest of our other businesses we saw a slight benefit from that warm weather.
Randall Hogan : Yeah, it seems to be stable and heading up.
John Stauch : The U.S. continues to do really well in the market. Canada was a little weaker this time. And Southeast Asia and China, as Randy mentioned, as well as the Middle East, from a core basis, are good, solid markets right now.
Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  You also highlighted the fact that you have some overtime in March. Is there enough time to catch up, given the construction season? Or do you think we now basically have to wait until…
Randall Hogan : That comment was really specifically to the process technologies segment, and particularly the water purification or U.S. residential. It was the U.S. residential and European residential comment. And no problem catching up.
Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Are we going to catch up in the second quarter, or do we have to wait until the second half?
Randall Hogan : No, it’s building now. The second quarter and third quarter are the residential quarters.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Jeffries.
Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company : I calculated about $76 million of productivity plus synergies, which would be net of the pricing. I think you indicated that you did about $40 million of synergies in the quarter, which would suggest, if my math is right, about $36 million of productivity, which on the sales base, is over 200 basis points. Is my math about right on that?
John Stauch : Yeah, I think I’d say about $50 million in synergies, but your $26 million is right. And then obviously some of that’s going to offset the inflation. So we always look at two elements. We want price to offset inflation. We want productivity to offset inflation in the core. Sometimes we don’t always get there perfectly, but that’s our targeted actions. And so we’re always looking to offset that inflation rate on the [unintelligible] core productivity.  But yeah, we’re seeing that strength of operating performance, seeing good cost structure, good cost discipline management. And that’s why Randy and I are optimistic when we see the growth, we’re going to get that leverage. And the growth is frustrating, because we have 20 product technology platforms, half of them are growing.  And when we talk about growing, they’re growing high single-digits. And we’ve got a couple of these platforms that are in significant contraction mode. The good news is, most of the ones like water transport aren’t our highest margin, but some of the ones that are growing are higher margin, and so that’s part of that positive mix we expect to see as well. But I think your math is generally correct, yes.
Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company : I’m actually calculating off that adjustment about 150 basis points of productivity, which is still 50 basis points above what your target is. So I just wanted to confirm that. The next question is really more of a question for you, Randy. And you know, once out of every three or four quarters, there’s some questions surrounding the top line that maybe should have been maybe a couple of points higher. Could you maybe talk about some of the things that you’re doing to maybe address some of the vagaries that you see in sales from time to time across the businesses? Anything that you’re hatching that’s new to start to build on the critical mass that you now have in this company?
Randall Hogan : You know, we’ve gone from seven GBUs to five. And then underneath the five, John mentioned that we’ve identified and defined and staffed 20 platforms, focused platforms, to manage profitable growth, so that we can make sure that we’re flowing the resources to our best opportunities. And we just put that in place at the beginning of this year. And John can say what he just said, which is we really do understand which ones are leveraging us for growth, and which ones are laggards, and what do we do about it. So we have much more granularity to that. At the same time, we’ve invested in a growth function, and we’re very much targeting that right now to get a better handle on the forecasting ability in valves and controls.  And so really, our focus right now is on growth and our growth processes. We’re building the competencies and capabilities for growth that we have built in Lean. It’s taken us 13 to 14 years to get where we are on Lean, but we are among the companies that are, if I dare say so, great at it. We don’t tend to take that long in growth. We’ve been working on it for a couple of years. We want to see more results, more sustained results. And one of the benefits, on the flipside, of being a narrowly diversified company, is we’re able to still execute and perform to promises, even when stuff happens.  And growth is clearly the number one agenda for me. It’s the number one agenda for the company. And that’s really where I’m putting all my focus right now, to make sure we are funding the right things. We need to get the average growth rate up to the low end of what we believe is possible. The profit potential is amazing. The best driver of productivity is growth, operating leverage. We get that. And so between the organization changes we made, between the way we’re flowing resources and we’ve changed resources, it’s all about to drive a more sustained growth.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets : Just kind of back on the guidance, and maybe a follow-on to what another caller was asking about, just within your guidance range, you seem like you’re talking about more negatives than positives. And I’m just wondering if I’m not picking up on any kind of positive offsets within the number, whether it be lower corporate expense or some additional restructuring savings that you get later in the year. Or should we just be taking our numbers down a little bit within the range? 
John Stauch: I think we’re looking at a couple of things. We were hopeful that water transport would recover, but we didn’t plan on it happening. We never really gave Q2 guidance, so within our plans, I don’t think we’re bringing up anything new today within water transport. We’re just sharing with everybody that we doubt it’s going to recover back to historical levels and be any positive contributor past the $3.85 to $4.00 that we’re giving. We continue to work all those restructuring actions, which are more than offsetting the water transport headwind, and we feel very confident that we’re building the growth process, as Randy said, that is going to generate the growth that’s going to give us the leverage. So right now we feel like we’re being really balanced.  Obviously, we’re managing the corporate expenses for two reasons. One is we’re keeping the spending lower as a contingency, but the other reason is there’s a lot to absorb in the business right now in integration, and they don’t need more initiatives on top of what they’re already driving.  So those are all the normal things that a business goes through, this cycle. But I think we feel like we’re on plan for the year, and we feel like we’ve got enough positives to offset the negatives. Things have been a little bit more choppy in the external markets. I don’t think anybody anticipated a slower start to January. I think we scrambled, like most companies, to make that all up, absorb those costs within our productivity in Q1 as well. So I think you’re just hearing a balanced view from us, Jeff.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets : And then just on this bidding activity, when do you think you start to see that acceleration in the order book?
Randall Hogan : [crosstalk] better, and expecting the second half to start seeing some shipments from it.
John Stauch: Randy’s put the business on a weekly pulse cycle. If you want to take a look at orders and you want to look at your front log, which is a manageable process, to have visibility into what’s coming, they you want to have a predictability on the hit rate, you want to turn that into what you expect your daily orders rate would be, and what you want to see is a day to day improvement against that. And clearly, given what we saw in valves in Q1, that’s where Randy’s got the business target in Q2. And we all have visibility into how we’re doing against that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg from Vertical Research. 
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners: Just coming back to valves and controls, it sounds like you are optimistic that you will start to see a better ordering environment, but I guess I don’t know if you’re getting any indications as far as the pricing of the early surge in potential orders coming to market. Typically when we see these types of cycles, it does get pretty price competitive in the beginning, and then [unintelligible] takes place, it gets better. So I guess from what you see today, do you see pricing pressure potential associated with the early projects and how disciplined do you expect to be associated with those dates?
John Stauch : I think oil and gas, as we said before, will always have a price element there that’s the most competition in that space. I think the thing that we’re looking at now is based upon our substantial productivity that we’ve driven, we have to have the confidence to maybe take a little bit lower gross margin knowing that we can drive the productivity in those projects.  I can’t tell you that we’ve lost anything over price, though. But we want to have that type of visibility to know that if we are this confident we can continue to get the productivity, does that open up an increased order book for us? Randy, I don’t know if you want to comment, but I don’t think there’s been any of that element. I’d also say that a window that we have as well is we have an [unintelligible] and controls business, which serves our competition, the whole industry. And I can assure you that based upon their performance in the quarter, it doesn’t feel like we’ve lost share. So we have an inside view to the rest of the world in the valve space. We are still the world’s leading valves and control player, so we feel we’re involved in every project. And we feel like we’re going to win our fair share here.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners : And then just moving over to working capital. That was a little bit more of a headwind than I thought it would be in the first quarter. Is it just related to the cadence of how activity progressed through the quarter?  
Randall Hogan : You know, we had more stuff that would have sold in January that we would have got cash for. But it just wasn’t balanced in terms of the usual mix of sales by month. The quarter always is a cash usage quarter for us, just because of the nature of the business. 
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners : And I know you’ve made comments before on bringing working capital from Flow Control down to more in line levels with legacy Pentair. Is that a benefit you expect you’ll see in 2014? And I guess how much more typical does that become if the cycle is starting to get going?
John Stauch : No, I think we made great progress in ’13. We still have a long way to go, but I think we expect to make another big jump forward here in 2014. It’s just receivable discipline. It’s inventory disciplines, and it’s tracking it and managing it, and holding people accountable to it. No, we think we’re still going to make progress, even with growth in the business.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.
Nathan Jones - Stifel Nicolaus : A couple questions on the short cycle oil and gas business. You talked about in your prepared comments that there’s more variability in that business than you thought there was going to be. I think we all understand the timing issues in the long cycle business, but what’s behind their variability in that business, in your opinion?
John Stauch : What I was saying was, in this quarter, we saw a lower short cycle business. That was a surprise, frankly, that, if you will, book in the quarter, ship in the quarter was the lowest conversion that we’ve seen going back in history since before we owned it. And it just seems like that in our area, in our installed base, that there was a little bit of a slow start. And I don’t know if that was weather related in the U.S. There’s a lot to conjecture, but I can’t give you root cause analysis on it. But we’re certainly focused on it. That’s one of the things that, as John mentioned, we have some new disciplines in terms of weekly reviews on order rates. It’s one of the things I think we’re watching to understand better. So I wouldn’t say that that’s something that was worse in the first quarter than we have seen.
Nathan Jones - Stifel Nicolaus :  At this point, are you able to say that you expect that conversion rate to improve?
Randall Hogan : We would expect it to revert to the mean. That short cycle business is largely replacement. You know, as long as the refineries are running, as long as work is being done, products get worn out. So it’s the kind of thing you wouldn’t expect to have a high percent of deviation around the mean.
John Stauch : One of the things that we’ll have a clearer picture as we conclude the year, Randy and I both have a lot of experience in long cycle businesses. And when you get into project and maintenance related businesses, Q1 is usually the lowest quarter and Q4 is usually the highest quarter. So one of the conjectures is, the high rate of book and ship in Q4 of last year impacted the low rate of book and ship in Q1, but they were on a different fiscal year. Really shouldn’t be an element of difference. Quarters should be quarters. And you should be responding to whatever the customer demands are. And so we should probably see a more normalized cycle with Q1 being the lowest shipment quarter, Q4 being the highest shipment quarter. And we’ll see how that plays out this year. But that’s what Randy and I are expecting, and that’s what we’ve forecasted.
Nathan Jones - Stifel Nicolaus : And you also said that you expect the ramp in short cycle oil and gas as the year goes on, I know we’ve heard similar things from other companies. Can you just provide a little bit more color on what you’re seeing out there that gives you that confidence?
Randall Hogan : Well, again, it’s the bidding activity, and it’s the quoting activity that gives us that confidence.
Nathan Jones - Stifel Nicolaus : Are we seeing those turn into orders in a timely fashion?
John Stauch: That’s what we continue to track, which I was talking earlier about. We want to make sure that we’re looking at those hit rates, we’re looking at the time in the cycle, from the time that the bidding goes into the front log to when it converts to an order. And we obviously have a lot more data and much more track record now that Randy and I can push the business to see. We are very optimistic as the market is, and we’re tracking those orders. And our expectation is April is a big step up from March, and right now we’re not off of that expectation.
Operator: Your last question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Credit Suisse. 
Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse: On valves and controls, can you just remind us what share of sales is aftermarket short cycle sales over there and how much of the growth in that business is driven by share gain? And also, some pretty quick update on if you’re seeing any revenue synergies coming through, or any color on that front?
John Stauch : Roughly we would expect a normal cycle to be somewhere around 50% to 60% into what we call the installed base. And that’s mostly like for like replacement against whatever spec you won, for the most part. And then the rest would be a major expansion and/or some type of greenfield application. Obviously, when you’re on large project types of cycles, it probably shifts to more 40% in the installed and 60% elsewhere.  The second part of your question, on sales synergies, we continue to be able to take these 20 product platforms, now that we have the visibility, and those that are strong in energy, try to pull the rest with them. And we continue to be excited about the pull through opportunities that a leading product provider has to bring the rest of our product technologies through product. So we’re as excited about that opportunity as when we acquired [unintelligible].
Randall Hogan : All right, thank you very much.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Melissa, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Pentair Q4 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Lucas, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.
James C. Lucas: Thanks, Melissa, and welcome to Pentair's Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. We're glad you could join us. I'm Jim Lucas, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me today is Randy Hogan, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Stauch, our Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, we will provide details on our fourth quarter and full year 2013 performance, as well as our first quarter and full year 2014 outlook as outlined in this morning's release. Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as the risks outlined in Pentair's most recent 10-K and 10-Q, and today's release. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today, and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results. Today's webcast is accompanied by a presentation, which can be found in the Investors section of Pentair's website. We will reference these slides throughout our prepared remarks. All references today will be on an adjusted basis, unless otherwise indicated, for which the non-GAAP financials are reconciled in the Appendix of the presentation. We will be sure to reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Randy.
Randall J. Hogan: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. 2013 was very good for Pentair and its shareholders. We had a successful year 1 of integration, delivering 4% organic sales growth, 19% adjusted operating income growth, 170 basis points of margin expansion, adjusted 26% EPS growth and record free cash flow of $751 million. We feel we've clearly demonstrated the power of the Pentair Integrated Management System in delivering these results and we now look forward to year 2 of the new Pentair. Before I go through the results in detail, as has been our practice since the Flow Control merger, I want to note that we again will be discussing our operating results on an adjusted basis to better address the core operating performance of our businesses and will be referring to 2012 on a pro forma adjusted basis to provide a more accurate apples-to-apples comparison that includes Flow Control in the results. With that, let's turn to our fourth quarter performance on Slide 4. The fourth quarter was great, organic sales grew 11%, adjusted operating income was up 50%, operating margins expanded 350 basis points to 13% and EPS grew over 60%. We saw growth in 4 of our 5 verticals, with the exception being infrastructure, which is seeing continued headwinds in Australia. While we will discuss each of the segments in more detail, the bottom line is we ended 2013 on a very positive note and feel we're entering the new year in a stronger position than we have seen in the past several quarters, if not years. We completed just over $1 billion in share repurchases since the merger. And as we indicated last month, the board has authorized a new $1 billion repurchase program, since our current authorization has only $150 million remaining on it. We continue to build momentum with more positive outlook for the top line and expect to see strong drop-through on sales growth in addition to the productivity and synergies we've delivered and expect to continue to deliver. Now let's turn to Slide 5 for a performance review of our largest segment, Water & Fluid Solutions. Water & Fluid Solutions had organic sales growth of 8% and we've delivered double-digit growth if not for the ongoing headwinds in Australia. We expect tough comps in Australia to persist through the first half of 2014, as there was 1 nonrecurring project that shipped in the first half of 2013. But we continue to rightsize the cost structure, positioning this business for better times. During the fourth quarter, Water & Fluid Solutions sales in the Residential & Commercial vertical grew 9% and Food & Beverage was up 16%. Within Residential & Commercial, our North American Pool business ended 2013 with its third consecutive year of double-digit growth and it's finally started to get help from North American new pool construction and topped with the continued adoption of energy-efficient products. Our Residential Filtration business not only saw a continued growth in North America, but Europe returned to positive growth in the quarter. This is an encouraging sign as European Residential Filtration is one of the more profitable businesses in Water & Fluid Solutions. Within the Food & Beverage vertical, we saw a strong finish to the year in beverage systems, particularly with the continued adoption of our Beer Membrane Filtration systems by breweries around the globe. Food Service had a very good year, as we saw growth in serving our large install base in addition to adding new customers and global expansion. Agriculture grew 8% in the quarter and was up double digits for the third consecutive year. The right half of the page shows fourth quarter Water & Fluid Solutions operating profits and margins. Adjusted operating income grew 28% and operating margins expanded 190 basis points to 11.3%. This was shy of our forecast as mix was not as favorable as it has been in prior quarters. In summary, Water & Fluid Solutions ended 2013 on a positive note, with robust top line growth, strong operating margin expansion and solid overall performance despite a few tough headwinds. Now let's turn to Slide 6 for a review of our Valves & Controls segment performance. The fourth quarter performance in Valves & Controls was its best of the year, with sales up 20% organically, orders up 11% year-over-year, while backlog declined sequentially. In the quarter, we shipped the majority of a 0-margin project that was booked prior to the merger closing. There's still a small amount of this no-margin business scheduled to ship in the first half of 2014. Excluding that no-margin business, sales in the quarter were up 13%. Valves & Controls oil and gas and power businesses were both in excess of 20%, process grew 15% and mining was down modestly as this particular piece of the energy vertical faced difficult comps and a lack of new orders. As we continue to build focus on the install base, we saw the MRO business grow 15% and experienced mid single-digit growth in services. The right half of the page shows fourth quarter Valves & Controls operating profits and margins. Adjusted operating income nearly doubled in the quarter and margins expanded 450 basis points to 12.2%. If we've not shipped the 0-margin project in the quarter, the operating margins would have been at 13% as we've forecast. Margin improvement was helped in large part by the implementation of PIMS and strong execution during year 1 of the integration. The adoption of PIMS is spread throughout Valves & Controls, which is also evidenced by a 60% reduction in past due shipments. In summary, Valves & Controls made great progress in 2013. While the quarter-on-quarter growth rate shows some variability, the top line grew 5% for the year and operating margins expanded 250 basis points to 12.3%. It's very nice progress. Now let's move to Slide 7 for a look at the orders and backlog for Valves & Controls. As you can see on Slide 7, the Valves & Controls backlog is broken down in 4 key industries, 3 of which fall into our energy vertical: oil and gas; power and mining; and 1 in our industrial vertical, which is the process business. Backlog did show a modest decrease and ended the year just under $1.4 billion. Within the energy vertical, oil and gas and power showed robust orders growth, while the smaller mining business saw further declines in orders. Industrial process saw modest order growth in the quarter, as strength in North America was offset by continued weakness in Europe. We expect oil and gas global capital expenditures to be up in 2014 and key EPCs tell us they're more optimistic for projects in 2014, particularly LNG and North American pipelines. We expect power capital expenditures to be down in the U.S. and Europe, but we're seeing return of activity in fast-growth regions, including solid fourth quarter orders growth in China. Now let's move to Slide 8 for a review of Technical Solutions. Technical Solutions delivered fourth quarter sales growth of 6%, which represented the first year-over-year sales growth for the segment since the first quarter of 2012. North America was up mid single digits, while Europe was up double digits in both our Thermal Management and Equipment Protection businesses. The right half of the page shows fourth quarter Technical Solutions operating profits and margins. Technical Solutions delivered adjusted operating income growth of nearly 30% and operating margins expanded an impressive 380 basis points to 22%, which represents a record performance for the segment. Both Thermal Management and Equipment Protection businesses delivered operating margins north of 20%, which reflects strong adoption of PIMS within Thermal Management and strong contribution margins within Equipment Protection. Let's now turn to Slide 9 for a look at our full year results. For 2013, we have strong financial results across the board. For the full year, organic growth of 4% was encouraging given the absence of large project activity in a few of our businesses and an expected second half industrial recovery that did not fully materialize. Our adjusted operating income grew nearly 20% and our operating margins expanded 170 basis points to 12.6%, with 2 of our 3 segments expanding margins 200 basis points or better. Our adjusted EPS grew 26% and we generated record free cash flow of $751 million or 115% of net income. From a strategic standpoint, we're very pleased with the first year of integration in the building of our one Pentair culture. Many of the headwinds that we experienced in the first half of 2013 have dissipated and we're entering 2014 with encouraging signs for more consistency and top line growth while continuing to expect to deliver on productivity and synergies, positioning ourselves for another year of EPS growth in excess of 20%. Let's now turn to Slide 10 for a closer look at the total Pentair growth profile. The fourth quarter showed great top line performance as 4 of our 5 verticals delivered strong sales growth. Both Energy and Food & Beverage were up mid teens, with Industrial and Residential & Commercial grew almost 10% in the quarter. Infrastructure was the only vertical that posted a decline, as ongoing strength in North America break and fix pump business and recovering equipment protections European electronics business were offset by tough conditions in Australia. As has been the case throughout 2013, North America benefited from the ongoing residential recovery and the beginning of commercial and municipal recoveries. Canada continues to be slow with energy project delays, but we have not seen any cancellations. Western Europe was a bright spot in the fourth quarter with strong double-digit growth. This marked the third consecutive quarter of growth for us in Western Europe. While we remain cautious about this growth rate, the good news is that Europe does appear to have cleared the bottom. We saw improvements in our profitable European residential business. And as we mentioned previously, Equipment Protection has seen a recovery with its electronics customers. Fast-growth regions ended the year on a positive note, with very strong double-digit growth in the fourth quarter following what has been mixed results in the first 3 quarters of 2013. The Middle East and Africa led the way, with China also showing healthy growth. We have made strategic investments in the Middle East and Africa and we believe we will continue to see strong growth in those 2 regions. Latin America, excluding Brazil, also saw growth. Looking in our 5 verticals, we expect continued growth in 2014 in the 4 verticals that have been growing. We expect infrastructure to be flat in 2014 as the rate of decline continues to moderate following a near double-digit decline in 2013. Energy ended 2013 on a positive note. Oil and gas investments continue to grow around the globe and our fourth quarter orders, particularly in Valves & Controls, offer us confidence to expect low to mid single-digit growth within energy in 2014. Industrial also had a strong finish to 2013 and the recovery we saw in the fourth quarter in our key North American electrical distribution channel is encouraging entering 2014. We're also encouraged by the ongoing strength in quoting activity with North American process customers. Residential & Commercial is expected to remain a bright spot, led by North American residential. In addition to the strong growth we've seen in China residential the past 2 quarters, the stabilization of European residential is a positive sign and commercial is also seeing signs of improvement. We've discussed our mixed views on infrastructure earlier in this call and while Australia will have tough comps in the first half of 2014, our other infrastructure businesses are expected to continue to grow. Finally, Food & Beverage is expected to remain a great story for Pentair. After 3 straight years of double-digit gains in agriculture, we still expect some growth in spite of a slowdown in the U.S. Within Food Service, we believe we are well positioned with key customers that are expanding globally and we continue to serve our growing install base. Beverage systems have a healthy order book as we continue to see growth in beer and global dairy. Now please turn to Slide 11, labeled Summary. Before turning the call over to John to review our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2014, I wanted to offer a summary of why we are optimistic about Pentair's long-term prospects. Our strong performance in 2013 and successful first year of the new Pentair reinforces our strategy to put these 2 businesses together and is a testament to our ability to execute. With our 2 largest verticals, energy and industrial, appearing to have turned the corner, coupled with continued strength expected in Residential & Commercial and Food & Beverage, we're feeling better about our ability to deliver a more consistent top line growth in 2014. We have action plans in place to drive additional productivity goals in 2014 and our targeted top line is expected to yield strong drop-through to the bottom line. We remain committed to our goal of delivering $5 in EPS in 2015 while positioning Pentair to be the next great industrial company. With that, I'll turn the call over to John. John?
John L. Stauch: Thank you, Randy. Please turn to Slide #12, titled Q4 2013 Reported to Adjusted. As you would expect after a large merger of this size, we still had a few nonrecurring items in the fourth quarter that we wanted to provide some additional clarity around so you can better understand our adjusted operating performance. Restructuring in the fourth quarter totaled $62 million or $0.24 in EPS. The majority of the restructuring related to the elimination of the COO role and the combining of the GBUs that we recently announced. In addition, we also took steps to reduce our operating capacity, primarily in Europe, as well as look at our global G&A support coverage and reduce as necessary, especially in the areas of IT, finance and regional support. We also incurred $5 million or roughly $0.02 of EPS related to our proposed redomicile to Ireland. This included legal fees as well as one-time costs related to SEC filings. We also took the opportunity to further advance our global branding initiatives and we had $11 million non-cash brand impairment or $0.04 in EPS related to a brand reduction in our cooling business in Technical Solutions that we will no longer use. The other big adjustment at year end related to our move last year to a more preferable method of accounting for pension and postretirement benefits. We recognized a $63 million gain or $0.24 in EPS that related to a once-a-year mark-to-market adjustment. As a reminder, this is the annual adjustment that will come in the fourth quarter of every year related to the movement of discount rates. Finally, we had a small gain on a sale of business and a few adjustments to tax as we trued up the books at year end. Please turn to Slide #13, labeled Segment Dictionary. As we discussed in our investor event in Houston this last November, we have realigned our business from 7 GBUs to 5 GBUs. As a result, we will now be reporting in 4 reporting segments. Our Technical Solutions and Valves & Controls segments remain the same and will be both GBUs and reporting segments, but we'll now break out Water & Fluid Solutions in the 2 segments, Flow Technologies and Process Technologies. As a reminder, Flow Technologies combines our legacy flow business with our Australian water business and is both our new Flow Technologies GBU and reporting segment. The Process Technology segment is represented by our Filtration & Process and Aquatic Systems businesses. Our presentation includes a table in the appendix providing the new 4 reporting segments for each of the 4 quarters in 2013 to help with your models. We will now be updating our history for these reporting segments in the next several months and expect to get you 2012 adjusted pro forma results for these reporting segments, as well as key information such as verticals, geographical sales and channels by our Q1 2014 earnings release. We appreciate your patience. Please turn to Slide #14, labeled Q1 2014 Pentair Outlook. For the first quarter of 2014, we expect sales to be flat to up 2% to approximately $1.8 billion. Valves & Controls is anticipated to be flat to up modestly, as the first quarter is a seasonally slow period for the business and we are following record shipments in Q4, as well as the significant reduction in past due orders. Process Technologies is expected to grow 5% to 7% on continued strength in Filtration and in the North American Pool channel. Flow Technologies is expected to be down approximately 10%, mostly due to a tough comp in Australia due to FX and larger project headwinds. Finally, Technical Solutions is expected to grow modestly, again related to seasonality in the business related to global weather trends and also reflecting an improving North American industrial outlook. We are expecting adjusted operating income to grow nearly 15% and adjusted operating margins to expand 140 basis points to approximately 11.5%. Free cash flow is historically a usage in the first quarter, inline with what we have seen in the past. We're expecting the tax rate to be roughly 23.5%, net interest of approximately $17.5 million, and the share count to be around 200 million shares. Please turn to Slide #15, labeled Integration and Standardization Update. This slide has become standard work and it briefly brings you up to speed on our synergies by quarter and our forecasted synergies for the full year 2014. We ended our first year delivering $130 million of synergies, which was well ahead of our original forecast of $90 million. The adoption of PIMS has led to better-than-expected results with Lean and we continue to build the funnels in both Lean and sourcing that give us confidence in our goal to deliver once again in 2014. We exited 2013 in a $208 million annual run rate or nearly 70% of our $310 million synergy target. As a reminder, 2014 includes $20 million of operating model transformation, or OMT investments in Valves & Controls, that will drive operating income savings and an overall tax benefit due to the optimization of the global GBU structure. Please turn to Slide 16, labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. 2013 was a good free cash flow year for Pentair. For the full year 2013, we generated $751 million of free cash flow or 115% of net income. We made some progress on the working capital front with the legacy Flow Control businesses, particularly with inventory past dues in Valves & Controls. There are still plenty of room for improvement and we expect to do better in 2014. Ending debt was just under $2.6 billion or $2.4 billion on a net debt basis, inclusive of global cash on hand. In 2013, we returned over $900 million to share owners in the form of dividends and share repurchases. At the end of the year, we have approximately $150 million left under our initial $1.2 billion share buyback authorization. As a reminder, the board approved a new $1 billion authorization in December for further share buybacks. Please turn to my final slide, Slide #17, labeled Full Year 2014 Pentair Outlook. We are reiterating our full year guidance of $3.85 to $4 on approximately $7.7 billion in sales. Overall, revenue is expected to grow 3% to 5%. Valves & Controls is expected to grow 2% to 3%, as healthy backlogs in oil and gas and short cycle MRO business, along with expanding backlogs in industrial, helped to offset continued expected headwinds in mining. Power is better positioned, but we'd like to see orders turn into shipments before turning more optimistic. Process Technologies is expected to grow 5% to 7%, with continued strength in Aquatics, Beverage Systems, energy and an improving Residential & Commercial filtration business. Flow Technologies is anticipated to be down 1% to 3%, related principally to tough comps in Australia in the first half of the year related to FX and the lack of project activity in that business. Technical Solutions is expected to grow 3% to 5% as we are seeing further signs of the North American electrical distribution business improving and easier comps for our Thermal Management business. We do not expect much in the way of mega project activity in 2014. But as we have stated in the past, we will update accordingly at the appropriate time if any mega projects entered the backlog. Adjusted operating income is expected to expand to approximately $1.1 billion or 16% year-over-year increase. This does include $20 million of OMT investment, which is an important component of reducing the overall complexity of our Valves & Controls business and lower G&A while also contributing to long-term improvement in the overall tax rate of the Pentair enterprise. Excluding this investment, adjusted operating income growth will be close to 18% or in line with the 18% to 19% annual expectations we laid out during our announcement of the merger. Overall adjusted operating margins is expected to expand 150 basis points to 14.1%, which will mark a record performance for Pentair. We expect all 4 segments to contribute margin expansion of at least 100 basis points in 2014. Overall corporate costs are expected to be down slightly due to lower corporate integration costs. For the full year, we expect the tax rate to be around 23.5%, net interest expense to approximate $70 million and share count to be around 198.5 million, which is inclusive of our recently announced incremental share buyback program. We expect EPS to expand around 23% to $3.93, at the midpoint of the guidance range. We're expecting another strong free cash flow year of at least $850 million of free cash flow or greater than 105% of net income. Melissa, can you please open the lines for questions? Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of Nomura Securities.
Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: So you mentioned the pickup in North American industrial in the fourth quarter as being pretty encouraging. I mean, can you give a little more color where you saw that across the businesses and how you view the sustainability?
Randall J. Hogan: Well, the most important -- in North America, the most important business serving that market is our Hoffman-branded equipment protection business, which is the enclosure franchise in the North American electrical distribution industry. And we saw some good pickups there. And that -- they usually -- those are investments that usually come later in a project cycle. And it's a short-cycled business but sort of a long wave order pattern. So it's been dragging -- it's been lagging the ISM for a while and now we're beginning to see the pickups. So we would view it, even though it is short-cycled business, we would view that as a very encouraging sign. And as I mentioned, going into 2014, that we saw inventories being built by the channel.
Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Okay, great. That's helpful, unless John has anything to add, but that helps. On the Valves & Controls orders, I mean, they were -- I know you were shipping some past dues and you had the 0-margin backlog. But the orders, up 11%, were pretty strong. What's the timing like in terms of when you expect those to ship? And how do you feel about the margin in that backlog versus some of the stuff you're getting rid off?
Randall J. Hogan: Let me start with the second. We've put in place, we believe, better disciplines around the as-bid margins going out, so we feel good about the orders we're taking. In fact, we've passed on some orders because of the margins required. So we think that discipline has remained intact through that 11% growth. One of the reasons Valves & Controls in the first quarter, we don't expect a lot of growth, is those orders are really loading into the second half of 2014 and even a few into 2015. Which is, they're not huge projects but they're bigger projects, so they take a little bit longer time. What we call and I mentioned in the script, 15% growth in MRO, MRO is basically standard Valves & Controls that ship out of stock or with only minor modifications. And that was up 15%. That's the kind of stuff that we can book and turn in a 90-day kind of a window and that was up as well. But the 11% was really -- overall, was really driven by a lot of oil and gas that's going to ship later in the year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John (sic) [Josh] Pokrzywinski of MKM Partners.
Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division: So just on the 0-margin backlog first, I guess, are we done with that at this point? Or are there any lingering surprises that can still bleed out into 2014?
John L. Stauch: Two questions, but we think we're down with it. The project that we shipped in Q4 has a small remainder left in Q1, but it's very small. So we don't think we'll mention it as we ship in Q1. And to Randy's question -- or Randy's comments, I mean, we look at the margin and backlog, this was the only one of its type and we scrubbed that backlog prior to closing. And as Randy mentioned, this was an order book prior to the merger completed. So as of this type, we don't think there's any more in the backlog.
Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And then just on the reclass here, with the extra segment coming in. Should we think about that as starting to go align some of these businesses to the extent that you may want to get out of a few? I know you've talked about some non-core divestitures in the past. Are we looking at this as maybe an opportunity to bring that a little bit forward? Or is there anything beyond the just trying to get more detail on Australia.
Randall J. Hogan: Well, no. This isn't about Australia at all. I mean, this is about the continuing to build Pentair, we've made great leaps forward. We wanted to get into larger, manageable businesses, with the retirement of Mike Schrock, now those presidents report directly to me. So it's a matter of getting larger, if you will, fighting units in the officer suite and so that we can, one, optimize cost structure; but, two, really flow resources from our best -- our best resources to our best opportunities. So it has nothing to do with anything about divestitures or acquisitions.
Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then if I can just sneak in 1 last one. Just on the margin guidance by segment, obviously, the implied incrementals across the board vary a lot depending on what synergy you have baked in there. Flow especially has a pretty healthy uptick in margins with the well revenue and I understand the mix is an issue as well. Could you just maybe parse out what segments have more or less synergy capture in them? And to the extent that you have some numbers that you'd like to share, that would be helpful as well.
John L. Stauch: Yes. I think absent the headwind that we'll experience in Flow Technologies because of the Australian project and foreign exchange in Q1, what we're going to see is a nice, healthy roll forward of the Q4 synergies coming into Q1. If you recall last year, we roughly had about $10 million of synergies. We're exiting the year at a much higher rate, so we've gotten a really nice year-over-year carryforward from those synergies, primarily around the sourcing and the Lean savings, which are going to be more skewed to the businesses that were in the Flow Controls side, Josh.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: So I just want to take a very quick walk down the various moving parts for the first quarter profit guide. I guess, core volume, your sales are kind of 0 to 2. I don't really think that, that should be that big of a factor in your guide. Is price and inflation, are they -- is that still a negative? I think it was a negative this quarter. Is that still like a $15 million negative-ish price versus inflation?
John L. Stauch: Well, I mean, we still see modest inflation somewhere between 160 and 180 basis points. And we get good price on the install base and the distribution side of the business, which is roughly half of our business. And obviously, on the project side, there's not really a way to externally measure the price, but we're trying to make sure that we're getting the right bid rates to offset expected inflation that could build throughout the year.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Great. So the first quarter, is it negative? It's a -- say it's a negative in the first quarter, is what you're saying?
John L. Stauch: Slight negative, a little bit better.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. So then we're basically left with productivity and synergies, that kind of combined bucket. And you talked about the synergies being a pretty nice year-over-year compare. I mean, even at just a $52 million run rate, you've got $40 million kind of a loan locked-in, if you do make a little bit of progress. I mean, you should have a very nice number there. You did $80 million in the combined productivity and synergies in the fourth quarter year-over-year. Is there a lot of OMT coming in the first quarter? I'm just kind of -- it just seems like this productivity synergy number is significantly lower than where it was year-over-year in the fourth quarter.
John L. Stauch: Yes, I mean, I think you're doing the math right. We do have about $6.5 million to $7 million of OMT investment in Q1. We have started that project. It's ramping up. And that's the business process, reengineering of the overall enterprise at Valves & Controls, so that's a pretty healthy investment number. And then what we also see in Q1 is stock comp true-ups and things of nature, which goes into the FICA and expenses, that become a little heavier in Q1 than they are throughout the rest of the year.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. Is that a year-over-year impact? What's the year-over-year impact of that?
John L. Stauch: That's not as much of a year-over-year as it is versus a Q4 impact.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: So I mean basically, productivity and synergies alone this quarter drove a $0.30 year-over-year V, I don't really see a ton other than maybe stock comp to impact that, I mean, that gets you significantly higher than where you're guiding to for the first quarter on EPS.
John L. Stauch: Yes. And the only thing you're missing in that, Steve, is that we do get a different set of mix. Right? Because our Aquatic Systems business is going to be much stronger in the seasonal pieces of that. So there's an early buy -- sell-through in Q4. And then you're also going to see a thermal downtick from the cold kind of winter stocking months coming into Q1. So those are seasonably lower.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. So those are what impact productivity is what you're saying, year-over-year?
Randall J. Hogan: It's a mixed impact.
John L. Stauch: A slight mixed impact year-over-year, correct.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay, still seems reasonably conservative. Just one other question. What -- how do we think about normal seasonality in the core technical business, fourth quarter to first quarter? And then how bad is thermal going to be, fourth quarter to first quarter? Again, it just seems like Technical Solutions being down as much fourth quarter to first quarter, 450 to kind of 410, it seems like it's a more significant kind of seasonal fall off. Maybe that's just a new seasonality of thermal.
John L. Stauch: Yes. The seasonality there will be almost entirely Thermal for the drop-off.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: So how much do you think thermal is going to be down quarter-over-quarter?
John L. Stauch: Roughly $40 million to $50 million of revenue.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of Citi.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: One of the growth drivers for 2014 and hopefully beyond is going to be the impact of the uptick in resi and how that translates into pool, both new pool construction. And then -- so I was hoping you'd put some numbers around this. What's the early read? How do you track it? And then, you also comment on the energy savings piece for pool owners as they transition to like the IntelliFlo pump and where are you in that penetration so far?
Randall J. Hogan: Yes, let me start, then I'll turn it over to John. We -- our team in Aquatics has built an incredibly good model, where they track the install base, they track basically the replacement rate of same-same and then they do the upgrades on the energy side and we're going to start with that. Basically, when you take a look at the home install base, I think we're only -- we're still less than 10% penetrated of what we consider to be the install base that is ripe for switching to variable speed and get the energy savings. And that part of the question -- the energy savings can be as much as 90% on the pump. And in the pump, in areas where it's warm, which are -- it was minus 20 at my house this morning, so I have to think conceptually here. Where places that air-conditioning is more expensive than heat, the pool pump is the second largest user of electricity. So it's a huge opportunity, as you know, there's some over 30 utilities now that are rebating conversion to variable speed pump. And we have the leading solution in variable speed pumps. So we're not even 10% penetrated there. So we think that what we call our Eco Select set of products have an incredible future in terms of penetrating that. And now we have new pools construction, new pool construction. I don't have the numbers right at my fingertips, but it's up in California, it's up in Arizona, it's up in Florida. It's flattish in Texas, but Texas never really went down. So I mean -- and those are -- probably more than half of the pools in America are in just those 4 states. So I don't know if you'd add anything, John.
John L. Stauch: Yes, the only thing I'd tell you is that we track the pool permits and they are around about 9% to 10% of the new housing starts in the U.S., single-family housing starts. And we are definitely seeing an increase in pool permits and we're definitely excited about the incremental content and revenue that should be driven from those pool permits in the new construction side. There's a lag, as you know, but ultimately, we feel that's going to be a help to the market upside.
Randall J. Hogan: And one of the other ones, the pumps are also switching from incandescent to LED lights, which saves a lot of power. In fact, that's -- right now, that's a big conversion going on in commercial pools. And as you know, we have a nice position in controls and lighting for commercial pool as well, so it's -- I would say, it's all good in Aquatics.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And was there an impact on the early buy that you typically see in the fourth quarter?
Randall J. Hogan: Well, early buy was strong, which indicated -- and there wasn't anything exceptional about the early buy program. So it is indicative that the pool dealers and the distributors are expecting a good year.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And then last one for me and I'll still stay in the pool side, is if you had to gauge for 2014 the new product vitality of Pool, what percent of your revenues would come from products introduced in the last 3 years?
John L. Stauch: Almost 30%, Deane. It's our highest vitality index that we have currently. We're starting to build a nice pipeline in filtration process as well. But pool leads the way with the technology and the innovation. And we're seeing a lot of nice new product content coming through that business.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: So I guess in light of the 11% core growth here, I would've expected more margin coming through, even excluding the 0-margin backlog. And therefore, that mix headwind that you're talking about, I've got to believe it's a bigger deal or there was something else going on in the incrementals kind of x synergies that I'm just not getting here. So maybe where were you surprised, you're excluding that whole 0-margin backlog discussion, was it -- is it all mix, or is there something else going on around the portfolio? Or just a little more color there would be helpful.
John L. Stauch: I think it's a little bit of mix. I do also think that as you complete Q4, you look at distributor-dealer rebates, sales incentives, truing up of incentives related to overdrive for the year end sales. I do also think that there's always, when you have strong performance at the end of the year, things like warranty, E&O, et cetera, seem to become more of a discussion item.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay. And what gives you confidence, as you're sort of looking at guidance, therefore, in 2014 that your ability to forecast some of those things, I guess, is more maybe higher conviction?
John L. Stauch: It's a great question, it's the blue chip of our operating model right now, which is more predictable and consistent results. As you know, we're getting better in Valves & Controls, but we're still learning. And it really comes around standardization and process understanding. And that's part of what all Lean is about. And so I think we feel better today, but there still are a lot of ways to go from the predictability side. But I do think we understand it better. We know where our top-focused factories are and we've got our arms around how to improve it.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: And your biggest surprise positively on the volume front was where? I mean, obviously, there's a lot of positive numbers here but...
Randall J. Hogan: Valves & Controls. Valves & Controls.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Yes, but within Valves & Controls, which vertical or region was the most?
Randall J. Hogan: Oh, energy, oil and gas.
John L. Stauch: It was energy. Oil and gas and energy.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay. All right. Great. And then just finally, so I guess we're looking at a $10 million after-tax cost or something for that redomicile. I assume that's all in. And is it worth it at this point, in terms of what are you getting out of it, how should investors think about it?
John L. Stauch: Yes, it will be a little less than the 10 and we will have a better governance structure in our views. And we also do pick up a little incremental tax benefit on a go-forward basis associated with the opportunity to do things that we'll have in the U.K. versus what we had in Switzerland.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham of Jefferies.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: I just wanted to go into the restructuring and OMT cost a little bit. If you could maybe just answer 2 questions on the restructuring. That consolidation of -- to pull the presidents closer to you, Randy, could you kind of unbundle the $62 million a little bit? It just seems like a big number to do that. And my follow-up would be, which of the benefits from these expenses or how do the benefits from these expenses sort of accrete you? Which bucket, is it productivity or does it move you -- does it give you assurance on the 320?
Randall J. Hogan: Yes, let me start, then I'm going to turn it over to John with the specifics. What John mentioned, if you will, the delayering and the simplification of the organization as the first one, it's a relatively minor part of the $62 million. And just the leadership pieces is a small part. There was also structure underneath that, which is SG&A that came out, which had really less to do with the, if you will, the change in leadership structure and more to do with our view of what was required. We kept more cost in. We weren't -- we were careful not to break anything we didn't understand. We didn't want to do that in the merger, since this is a merger of equals. And so once we spent 1 year at it, we realized where we could be more efficient. So there was a tranche of that. And then there was a bunch of other pieces in it, too. So John, why don't you go through those pieces in a little more detail.
John L. Stauch: Yes, real quickly, Scott, just to frame it. The $62 million will yield close to $40 million in annualized savings when complete. I mean, obviously, we'll get maybe $30 million or $35 million of that in 2014 and then we'd have that annualized rate going into '15. As Randy mentioned, a lot of it was the structure associated with standardized global process around sourcing, manufacturing, IT, finance support, some regional structure alignment. And then we have a few small factories that were higher cost and some higher difficult -- or higher degree of difficulty areas to get after it and we had an opportunity to downsize a couple of those factors in Europe. And that's remained about half of the charge. And we feel like long term, that's going to position us in '15 and beyond for a much better operating structure. But it is part of the synergies, the 310, that we're going for. But at the same time, I think we feel like that funnel continues to grow and we're really focused on our end operating model and not a number related to a synergy.
Randall J. Hogan: And just to finish it out in the terms of the benefits of the change in structure. Right now, my focus is on building the best winning culture that we can. And to do that, I want to make sure that we have very, very tight alignment up and down the company, from John and I, through the presidents, all the way down. So to have 5 presidents who are now sitting at the table, talking to us directly about the opportunities and to get them to think not just about running Valves & Controls, get them thinking about being an officer within Pentair, thinking about how to optimize Pentair, that's a huge change. And it's a change that is going to be extraordinarily beneficial as we build Pentair to its next crescendo.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Okay, fair enough, on the 310, I said 320, I misspoke. But I guess my question would be, if you kind of said the 310 last call and then we have these restructuring charges, this call gives us all of these savings. That's a good chunk of change in savings. Is there a reason why the 310 didn't go up?
John L. Stauch: I think you should feel confident that we have a richer funnel to achieve it. And when we feel confident of flowing through the 310, we will definitely share that with you, Scott.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Fair enough, John. On the OMT, is that a productivity bucket or is that a synergy bucket as well?
John L. Stauch: It is long term both the single, biggest driver of the tax rate coming forward because we're creating a global structure around that Switzerland principle. But it's also the business getting off the 29 different disparate ERPs and 29 different processes that are run at 80 sales and distribution centers from, to getting 1 common model that optimizes the product design technology into the manufacture and delivery to the customer. So it's a major re-business engineering, which we think is going to yield value, both in delivery, quality, operations performance and G&A support structure. As I highlighted in Analyst Day, we try to drive about a 4% G&A target per GBU. Most of our GBUs are coming close to that number. We're still about 3.5 to 4 points higher in Valves & Controls. So this OMT is a big driver to getting that efficiency out.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Just a couple of follow-up questions. So just to understand, on Q4 versus Q1 year-over-year growth comparison, there was no pull back into Q4 from Q1, right? There were no timing issues in oil and gas or anything like that?
Randall J. Hogan: No, not that we're aware of.
Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And just as I think about sort of oil and gas outflow, you sort of stated that you still have not seen any megaprojects and that you will announce them when you see them. Can you give us, though, some color as to where the negotiations are headed, what does the timeline look? Just because the orders were just so strong in Q4 and I just want to understand what happens to this momentum going to the first half of the year? And I know you've said second half, but just what's going to happen in the first half? What are we going to see in terms of orders and revenues?
Randall J. Hogan: Well, just speaking about megaprojects, there are some large things in Canada that are still being looked at and worked on and there are certainly large developments to support oil and gas developments around the world. We just don't ever want to build -- we don't want to build plans counting on those things, that's why we want to be clear about them and we'll talk about them when they happen. We feel good about our position on them. But there are still a lot of other projects that are still big, $10 million, $15 million, they can still be big, but they're not what we would call megaprojects. And we see CapEx -- there were a lot of delays in the oil and gas industry, just deferrals, just things are going slower. And we saw a pick up in the fourth quarter, and we hope it's the beginning of what's going to be a sustained pick up, to yield probably an oil and gas spend in the mid 5-ish percent kind of range growth in 2014. We also saw some large power plant orders finally get placed that we've been working on for a year, over a year in China related to their new development program. And so that's -- that also helped.
Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: But it sounds like you don't have push-outs and delays you have seen last year, you just don't want to commit to anything this early, is that fair?
Randall J. Hogan: On megaprojects, yes. That's fair.
Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And just a follow-up, let me try to sneak one in. This earnings season has been very interesting in the sense that some companies, you're sort of not seeing a lot of evidence of a pick up. You guys are a lot more positive. Whether you guys generally come out on the pace of the global economic recovery and economic recovery in the U.S., what's your take?
Randall J. Hogan: Well, I think the U.S. -- I mean, we all would like to see the U.S., overall, we love to see GNP get up over 3%. And I think, I'm not an economist, but I think it's got a better shot at that because we're starting to see industrial come along and residential seems to be solid. And there's a lot of things positively moving in the U.S. The brightest change is -- I don't go to Davos, but coming out of Davos, it's pretty clear that people are feeling like Europe really has, I call it, clearing the bottom. Europe seems to have some mode of force going forward and that's a big deal to us. As I mentioned, it's one of our most profitable residential markets and it's also a great thermal market and we have a lot of operations there. So and our focus has been on where we can drive growth. I'm really pleased with our progress in Africa and the Middle East. And a lot of that is the initiatives that we're taking. So I think that, that will continue. And so I think we are more positive. I can't speak for why others aren't.
Operator: Your next question comes the line of Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Just as you split these process and flow segments, can you just talk about where -- what you think the long-term margin opportunities are in each of those businesses? I mean, Flow certainly seems like a pretty notable laggard as we look at it today.
John L. Stauch: Yes, I think Flow has opportunity on both sides, both the Australia and water business, which right now were in historically low revenue levels. That business has been mid 15%-ish margins when it gets to normalized shipping rates, it is pretty profitable when it gets to those levels, as an example. And then we still have opportunity as we build the infrastructure side and the engineered components of Flow Technologies, which is more mid-teens types of margins. So I think as both of those grow, you can see some significant ROS opportunity in Flow Technologies. When you look at Process Technologies, obviously, we've got a super high-performing Aquatics business and we've got a really high-growth Process Technologies filtration process business, which is starting to be gaining momentum. And we're starting to really see the benefit and power of Lean and sourcing activities driving that margin upward. So I, right now, always look at where we are opportunity-wise versus where we're sitting. And both of the businesses have significant opportunity to move forward.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And then just your qualitative commentary on industrial and some of the momentum just doesn't seem to point to 1% to 3% growth. So are there some headwinds we're not talking about? Or is that maybe clearly a source of upside as we move through the year and see this visibility continue?
John L. Stauch: As a vertical market for industrial, we grew nearly 10% in Q4, 9%. It is the only time this year we grew in industrial, globally. Right? So we had the easier comparison year-over-year. That pie makes up half of it. And then we saw about a mid-single-digit on a more normalized basis. So as we head to this year, we're cautiously optimistic that we're finally going to see the capital spending and the investments and the productivity that we thought would happen last year, Jeff. That's the way we're looking at it. So we're hoping to earn what we're forecasting. But I think right now, it feels appropriate.
Randall J. Hogan: Yes, just 1 quarter doesn't feel like a trend to us is basically, I guess, what the short answer would be. I'd rather plan a conservative and beat it than plan an aggressive and miss it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones of Stifel.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Just following up on a previous question about incremental margins, I know it was asked in Valves. The incremental margins in the fourth quarter on organic growth, so x the synergies and other stuff in there, was also pretty soft. And Randy, again, you talked about strong drop-through in 2014. Can you talk about maybe what held those incrementals down in the fourth quarter and what gives you confidence that it will improve in 2014?
Randall J. Hogan: I'll just say one thing. We talked a little bit earlier, when the growth to price is -- we had to true-up our sales incentives, our distribution incentives and some of our other reserves because we haven't been accruing at that rate because we didn't expect it. So part of that is just truing-up some things that were more than the quarter. But John, do you want to add anything to that?
John L. Stauch: Yes, I just want to say that I think there's 2 ways to look at it. I mean, one is if you take a look at the drop-through year-over-year on the incremental revenue, from 2012 to '13, I still think you're in the mid-40s of the conversion rate. When you take a look at it as the incremental versus forecast, you're going to see a little less of a drop-through. And some of that might be our conservatism on the way that we expected what the revenue should be and more confident on the income side. And then as Randy mentioned, we had some true-ups that we had to do on the incentive side.
Randall J. Hogan: We also in the Food & Beverage space, we shipped more systems than products. And the systems have lower margins. So there was, within the Process -- what we call the Process Technologies, or in the first quarters of Water & Fluid, there was some mix going against us there. But we still like those systems.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. Speaking about Food & Beverage, obviously been an area of real strength for you guys over the last year or 2, forecasting the growth rate to go down. Have we seen kind of the peak through the pipe on there? Is this 5% to 7% kind of what you would think of as a long-term growth rate for you guys in that area?
Randall J. Hogan: Yes. That's what we believe is maybe long term, could be more in the 6% to 8%, but 5% to 7% is close enough. We have double-digit growth. We had a lot of shipments in the membrane, the Beer Membrane Filtration business, the coal block. We had a lot of shipments this year. I don't know, if you go back and you look at 2012, we had a bunch of projects that we had won that just were delayed. We got what we thought we get in '13 and some of the things that got delayed from '12, we got those shipped. But still very positive trends in that industry. So we think it's -- high single-digits is a reasonable expectation for Food & Beverage. 2 things are happening. In the developed world, some of our newer technologies really offer opportunities for more sustainable food production, more energy-efficient food production, more environmentally-friendly food production. So we think we play into the capital spending in the developed world, which doesn't really need to pass Food & Beverage. And then of course, as we look at the middle class and building out the food manufacturing capability in dairy, in soft drinks and beer, that's why we're active in Africa, that's why we're active in Southeast Asia, these are places that all of these need to be built out. So and we believe we're -- we have great technology and great teams to do it.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: That's helpful. If I could just sneak one in on the balance sheet. Can you talk about where you are in terms of working capital in Valves & Controls and where you would target to get to and kind of what level of capital that still is to free up?
John L. Stauch: Right now, we're still sub-3 in a working capital returns basis in Valves & Controls. I mean, we believe we can be at least 5. As a company, we used to be closer to 6. So there's opportunity there and certainly, a key focus in 2014 and '15 is unlocking that cash value.
Randall J. Hogan: Well, the -- and the OMT project is a big piece of that. John mentioned, it's going to help our efficiency, it's going to help us be one Valves & Controls player to the customer. It's going to give us a huge benefit in terms of managing our inventories, our receivables, our payables, much, much more effectively.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: And if you did get from sub-3 just to say 5, what would that free up in terms of capital?
Randall J. Hogan: It'd free up enough money for me to buy another company.
John L. Stauch: Your figure of 5 would be 20% of sales. Today, we're well over 33% of sales. So 13% times the revenue basis will give you your mathematical opportunity there.
Operator: Your last question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg of Vertical Research.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Just following up on the working capital question, I mean, the 105% conversion for this year, are you assuming any progress on those initiatives? Or is it really just kind of the core business and any progress would be incremental?
John L. Stauch: I think that 105% does not yet anticipate substantial or significant working capital progress. I think when you take a look at the net operating profit after tax and you take a look at the amortization plus depreciation minus capital, you'll see there's not a significant improvement in working capital assumed in the 105%.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Then I would assume you would expect to get some of that progress this year.
John L. Stauch: Yes, it's a focus of ours.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Okay. And on the 0-margin revenue, can you just tell us how much was recognized in 2013? I think you said it will bleed a small amount into '14, but I'm just curious what the year-over-year would be.
John L. Stauch: There will be another $12 million of shipments to go on that particular project.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: And how much did you recognize in total in '13?
John L. Stauch: Roughly $35 million.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: $35 million. Okay. And actually just on the large projects side, so you talked about not incorporating it into the plans. We've seen a couple of -- I think we have 3 large ethane crackers in North America. We've had a large LNG plant authorized at Freeport, a couple of Canadian projects. 1 large Canadian project has been authorized. You talked about lead times for valve orders being between, I think, 12 and 36 months. I mean, these are particularly large projects. Would you -- I know you're not big in NIM, but conceptually, would you anticipate you will start seeing the orders start surfacing from some of these EPC awards?
Randall J. Hogan: Yes. I mean, the valve package usually goes out later in the -- later in those kind of projects. But you can count on us pursuing all those mentioned.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: So '14 will reflect some of that.
Randall J. Hogan: Orders.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: On the orders front, right.
John L. Stauch: There's been some significant analysis on these megaprojects that suggest that the delay time increases based upon how large the project is. There is often also a series of requotes that happen when they don't hit the price points, the target points. So we have to be patient. And as you know, Randy and I are extremely patient people. I think when it starts to unlock, I think maybe they'll be a little longer on the megas as far as the shipment rates or shipment timing. But overall, we should start to see that come through in the tail end of '14, heading aggressively into '15.
Randall J. Hogan: Well, the nice thing about the ones you mentioned, given a lot of them are in the U.S., we do feel some of the complexities around the large projects will be easier to manage on those U.S. -- the ethane crackers, LNG terminals, we like LNG plants.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Do you feel you're more competitively advantaged that these are domestically-based rather than international, or does that not matter too much?
Randall J. Hogan: Well, we have very -- we have global coverage. So we don't feel like we're disadvantaged anywhere in the world. Those applications are ones that we have particularly good quality offerings for.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Michelle, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Pentair Q3 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Lucas. Please go ahead, sir.
James C. Lucas: Thanks, Michelle, and welcome to Pentair's Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. We're glad you could join us. I'm Jim Lucas, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me today is Randy Hogan, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Stauch, our Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, we will provide details on our third quarter 2013 performance, as well as our fourth quarter and full year 2013 outlook as outlined in this morning's release. Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as the risks outlined in Pentair's most recent 10-K and 10-Q and today's release. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today, and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results. Today's webcast is accompanied by a presentation, which can be found in the Investors section of Pentair's website. We will reference these slides throughout our prepared remarks. All references today will be on an adjusted basis, unless otherwise indicated, for which the non-GAAP financials are reconciled in the Appendix of the presentation. We will be sure to reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. In recognition that there are other calls this morning, we will target to be done in an hour. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Randy.
Randall J. Hogan: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. It was on this call 1 year ago that we talked about a successful day 1 following our merger with Tyco's Flow Control business. Today, we can look back at a very successful year 1. The integration is ahead of schedule, and we again have seen synergies exceed our plan in the quarter and for the full year. Culturally, the 2 organizations are coming together as one Pentair. While there's still more to be done, we're pleased with our progress in this first year. We have clearly demonstrated the power of the Pentair Integrated Management System and delivering on the integration. Now we look forward to delivering year 2 as a new Pentair. Let me turn to our third quarter performance on Slide 3. Before I go through the results in detail, as has been our practice since the Flow Control merger, I want to note that we again will be discussing our operating results on an adjusted basis to better address the core operating performance of our businesses and referring to 2012 on a pro forma-adjusted basis to provide a more accurate apples-to-apples comparison that includes Flow Control in the results. With that, here are the numbers. The third quarter met our expectations on the bottom line as margins expanded 210 basis points to 13.6%. Price and productivity more than offset inflation. Mix was positive, and synergies read out better than expected. Our adjusted EPS grew 25% even though sales declined 1% organically. For the quarter, sales were $50 million below our expectations due primarily to weak results in Australia that were not only related to the local economy, but also suffered a significant FX headwind. While we were not pleased with the top line performance, we continue to see growth in many of our more profitable businesses, including stabilization in the North American electrical distribution channel. Residential continues to be a bright spot for us. Food & Beverage remains very strong, and encouragingly, we saw modest growth in Western Europe for the second consecutive quarter. We continue to build momentum on the elements within our control. And because of our strong PIMS execution, we're targeting double-digit EPS growth for the year. Now let's turn to Slide 4 for a performance review of our largest segment, Water & Fluid Solutions. Water & Fluid Solutions sales were up 1%, but improved 9% excluding the negative impact of the sharp decline that our Australian Water business experienced in the quarter. Sales in the Residential & Commercial vertical, which represent roughly 45% of the segment, grew 12% in the quarter as the North American residential recovery continued, and we saw growth in commercial channels. We again had double-digit sales gains in our Aquatics systems business while our Filtration & Process and Flow Technologies businesses also grew well. Europe showed a modest improvement in the quarter, and while we are not expecting a rapid rebound, we're at least seeing signs of stabilization at last. Our Infrastructure vertical, which accounts for nearly 20% of Water & Fluid Solutions sales, showed a sharp overall decline as Australian projects paused in 2013. In North America, we saw a strong double-digit growth as the break and fix pump business continues to improve. We also saw strong global Infrastructure pumps sales as a result of growth synergies generated by our global sales force selling the full range of Pentair products. While the global municipal markets remain challenged, we believe our sales growth is proof that our sales efforts and scale are yielding results. Global desalination opportunities are at a low level, not seen in over a decade. And while project activity remains very low, our win rate remain high as we secured 2 more significant orders in the quarter. Our Food & Beverage vertical, which accounts for roughly 1/5 of Water & Fluid Solutions sales, grew revenue 20% in the quarter. We saw double-digit sales gains in both beverage and Foodservice while agriculture sales continued to grow at a high single-digit rate, showing some moderation after strong growth the last couple of years. The right half of the page shows third quarter Water & Fluid Solutions operating profits and margins for the quarter. Water & Fluid Solutions adjusted operating margins improved 280 basis points to 13.4% as the benefits of productivity and price drove the expansion. Although our Australian Water business saw a sharp top line decline, the team there responded aggressively by rightsizing their cost structure and achieving margins that were flat. In addition, we made good progress with our recent repositioning actions. In summary, Water & Fluid Solutions delivered another strong quarter, driven by our Residential and Food & Beverage verticals masked somewhat by the tough market in Australia. Now let's turn to Slide 5 for review of our Valves & Controls segment performance. The third quarter performance in Valves & Controls again demonstrated the power of PIMS adoption. Lean implementation continues to go better than we planned, driving productivity and improvements in on-time delivery rates for the business. We made good progress in Valves & Controls reorganization efforts, and our clear focus on service has produced some early wins. In addition, we continue to be more disciplined in large projects as the margin and backlog continues to improve. Valves & Controls sales declined 1% in the quarter. It would have been up 1% if Australia were excluded. Oil & gas sales were flat in the quarter as we have seen many downstream customers defer annual maintenance shutdowns due to high activity. Mining sales were up 2% in the quarter as we continue to shift on a project in the Middle East. Power sales declined 10% as Europe remains weak and projects in China and India continue to be pushed out. Industrial grew 5% driven by MRO activities increases and growing investment by North American chemical customers. Many companies are taking advantage of lower input prices and adding U.S. capacity for the first time in quite a while. We will discuss orders and backlogs in further detail in just a moment. The right half of the page shows third quarter Valves & Controls operating profits and margins. Operating margins were up 190 basis points to 13.1%, owing to productivity improvements. We saw accelerated adoption of Lean enterprise, and synergies also contributed to the margin expansion. Additionally, more disciplined pricing helped margin expansion. Our focus on service and MRO has also helped drive margin improvements with mild single-digit growth across all key verticals. In summary, Valves & Controls faced a tough year-over-year comparison, but still delivered robust margin expansion. Now let's move to Slide 6 for a look at the orders and backlog for Valves & Controls. As you can see on Slide 6, the Valves & Controls backlog is broken down in 4 key industries, 3 of which fall into our Energy vertical, oil & gas, power and mining; and 1 in our Industrial vertical, which is the process business. Backlog was essentially flat overall and remained at a near-record level of $1.4 billion. Process saw a modest decline in its backlog, and orders remained weak due to tougher comps in Asia. We continue to see North American chemical activity as many manufacturers take advantage of lower natural gas prices. Within oil & gas, backlog remains strong globally and orders were down year-over-year as large projects activity continued to be delayed. We believe this seems to be more of a timing issue as quoting activity remained healthy. In addition, we have seen many refining customers defer annual maintenance as they are not shutting down and continue to run near full capacity. The power business saw a slight increase in order as activity in China picked up. Third quarter orders in mining decreased as expected, and we expect this small piece of our Valves & Controls business to continue to be weak. Now let's move to Slide 7 for a review of Technical Solutions. Sales for Technical Solutions declined 8% as our Thermal business not only faced a tough comparison due to a large project a year ago, but continued delays in Canadian project awards and slower European industrial sales accounted for the majority of the decline in the segment. Equipment Protection posted modest sales growth in the quarter as North American Industrial stabilized and we experienced growth in European electronic sales. Although Thermal experienced a sharp top line decline in the quarter, orders and backlog grew, reflecting our entering the seasonally strongest periods of the business. The right half of the page shows third quarter Technical Solutions operating profits and margins. Technical Solutions operating margins increased 240 basis points to 20.6% on positive combinations from price, productivity and mix. In addition, the adoption of PIMS within Thermal has continued to gain momentum, and Equipment Protection experienced strong contribution margins with the improvement seen in Europe during the quarter, as well as strong productivity overall. Let's now turn to Slide 8 for a closer look at growth year-to-date. Given the top line challenges that persist and slow economic recovery, we thought it would be helpful to provide an update on the trends we see in our key geographies in our 5 key verticals. In North America, U.S. has benefited from the continued improvement in residential, and we've also seen improvements in our Infrastructure break and fix business. Canada has been slower with a number of delayed projects in energy. We have not seen many cancellations. Western Europe is finally showing signs of stabilizing as many of our businesses that experienced a downturn early in the cycle are starting to see some volume growth. The last business to see the downturn, Thermal, is starting to see activity pick up as tougher comparisons begin to anniversary. Residential in Europe seems to be stabilizing, and we saw growth in commercial during the quarter. In addition, the European Equipment Protection business has returned to modest growth. Fast-growth regions remain mixed, but China's declines appear to be slowing and we continue to see growth in Africa, Southeast Asia and the Middle East. We talked in the past about opportunities that we see in the Middle East and we wanted to highlight a recent growth synergy. Earlier this year, we invested to localize our commercial pump line in the Middle East, utilizing the Valves & Controls plant in Sharjah. After only a few months, we are already booking orders and delivering pumps to serve buildings and other commercial applications there. We think these new regional product lines could add $25 million to $50 million in incremental sales over the next 5 years. So it's encouraging that we're off and running. Looking at our 5 verticals, we now expect Energy to be flat for the year compared to our prior forecast of modest growth. When looking at our backlogs and timing of shipments for the fourth quarter, we expect to see growth sequentially. We continue to expect Industrial to be down modestly for the year, but the stabilization we began to see later in the quarter -- second quarter has continued in line with our expectations. Further, the process backlog in Valves & Controls is expected to continue to improve based on the strong quoting activity we're seeing in North America. Residential & Commercial has been a bright spot all year, led by North American residential. While commercial is smaller contribution for us, we're seeing signs of improvement in both North America and Europe. European residential has also stabilized at long last, which means it is at least no longer getting worse as we wait for signs of further improvement. Our outlook for Infrastructure is now lower given the ongoing headwinds we expect in Australia, but we continue to expect a solid performance in North America. While the outlook for global desalination opportunities remain weak, we won a couple of jobs recently and our shift in investment from municipal to industrial are starting to pay dividends. Finally, Food & Beverage remains a great story. We're seeing strong gains in all 3 of our focus areas in the space. Beverage has been a great story all year, driven by our Beer Membrane Filtration growth, and our backlog remains strong. Foodservice is well positioned with key customers that are expanding globally. Agriculture again posted near double-digit gains, driven by demand in both irrigation and crop spray. We expect the growth rate to moderate, but for growth to continue in the fourth quarter. Let's now turn to Slide 9 for a year-to-date assessment and full year outlook. Our results through the first 9 months of 2013 met expectations as we've been able to over-deliver on synergies, productivity and price, which have offset some of the top line challenges we faced. We expect Australia to remain a headwind, but we continue to see solid backlogs in our longer-cycle businesses elsewhere. Europe is no longer a negative and we are experiencing growth in our more profitable businesses while driving standardization across the company GBUs. We continue to execute on the elements within our control and we expect operating margins to expand in excess of 150 basis points, putting us on track to deliver strong double-digit adjusted EPS growth. We've completed $875 million of our $1.2 billion authorized share repurchase program. And we expect our free cash flow to be greater than 100% net income conversion for the year. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.
John L. Stauch: Thank you, Randy. Please turn to Slide #10, titled Q4 2013 Pentair Outlook. As we close out the year, we're anticipating revenue and operating income for overall Pentair to be about the same in Q4 as it was in Q3. We are forecasting overall revenue to be about $1.8 billion, down slightly from Q3 and up 3% to 4% from Q4 of 2012. Water & Fluid Solutions revenue is expected to be up 2% to 4%, reflecting continued Australian headwinds in our Water transmission business, no improvement in the Australian dollar and continued strong performance in our Residential and Food & Beverage verticals. The shift in the fiscal year end had a negative impact in Q3 for Valves & Controls, but we believe it will help Q4 with expected sales growth of greater than 6% versus Q4 of 2012. Overall for Valves & Controls, we expect the seasonality of the quarterly revenue and income that we have delivered and are forecasting in 2013 to be the new pattern for their performance. Finally, we expect that Technical Solutions will deliver their first year-over-year growth quarter of 2013 as industrial headwinds are now lapped and year-over-year large project comparisons in our Thermal Management business are behind us. We are expecting strong adjusted operating income performance of around $242 million, down slightly from Q3 and up sharply from Q4 of 2012. We do want to remind you that last year's results included $20 million of transition costs associated with the merger with Flow Control. We believe operating income will expand over 45%; and operating margins are expected to be 13.4%, up 390 basis points, with strong contribution from all 3 reporting segments. You may have noticed in Q3 and in Q4 corporate costs are lower. This reflects our final knowledge of incremental costs that, as of Q3, are now being allocated into the appropriate reporting segment. The reported corp cost of approximately $25 million now reflect the appropriate ongoing corporate expectation. And finally, cash is important, and we expect to close out the year on a strong note and deliver the expected roughly $650 million of free cash flow for the year. Please turn to Slide #11 labeled Integration & Standardization Update. This slide has become standard work and it briefly brings you up to speed on our synergies by quarter and our forecasted synergies for the full year. Of particular note is that we are now anticipating realized synergies in 2013 to be about $120 million, reflecting the overdrive in Q3 and the expected uptick in Q4. The increase of our previous estimates is being driven by sourcing and Lean savings in Flow Control and is a result of building momentum around our proven PIMS operating system. This is obviously great news as we are now exiting the year on $168 million annual run rate or nearly 73% of our $230 million synergy target. What makes this performance even more impressive is that it does not yet take into consideration the significant synergies we still anticipate from Lean enterprise and our goal of reducing overall G&A from the current 8% of sales to the expected 6% of sales by 2015. All of those programs are still in investment mode, and we believe we will start to realize savings in 2014 and 2015. Please turn to Slide 12 labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. We had a very nice quarter as free cash flow was $206 million for the quarter, driven by over $173 million in net income and more disciplined working capital and capital spending policies. We still have substantial room for further improvement in our cash metrics in the legacy Flow Control businesses, and we are rolling out our receivable and payable policies and processes as well as directing many Lean projects towards targeting inventory reduction. Ending debt was under $2.6 billion while we delivered over $100 million of cash in the quarter back to share owners in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We have completed $875 million of our approved $1.2 billion in buybacks through the third quarter. Please turn to my final slide, Slide #13, labeled Full Year 2013 Pentair Outlook. For the full year, we are expecting $7.4 billion in revenue, up 1% to 2% organically year-over-year, reflecting near record bottom levels of projects in Australia, Canadian oil sands and EMEA, as well as the absorption of a global industrialization slowdown in slow, large greenfield sites globally, thus, giving us confidence in the prospects for accelerating organic growth into our 2014 and 2015 planning horizon. Overall operating income is expected to improve by nearly 20% versus 2012. And overall adjusted EPS at the $3.20 midpoint range will be up over 25% versus 2012. So one year into our merger with Flow Control, we feel like we have learned many things about the new businesses, introduced with speed our PIMS way of doing things and have seen 2 companies come together as a seamless one Pentair culture and we have a clear and achievable path to achieve our $5 of EPS target by 2015. With that, I will turn it back over to Randy who will summarize, and then we will open it up to questions.
Randall J. Hogan: Thanks, John. Please turn to Slide 14 labeled Summary. In closing, we delivered on our commitments year-to-date, and we remain well positioned to meet our 2013 full year goals. The top line has been a challenge this year with delays in large projects and a greater-than-anticipated headwind from Australia. But on the brighter side, mix remains favorable, and we continue to see growth in Residential and Food & Beverage where we do control our destiny. Our integration and standardization efforts continue to build momentum, and we now expect $120 million in synergies in 2013 versus our original target of $90 million for the year. We're pleased with the success of the integration so far. We realize that there is still a lot of work to be done, but the adoption of PIMS within the Flow Control businesses continues to exceed our expectation and we are adopting one Pentair culture. Finally, I'd like to thank Mike Schrock for being a great partner the past 15 years. Mike and I started at Pentair a week apart and he's been a great contributor to building our operating agenda and our transformation from a holding company to an operating company. With that, I'll ask the operator to open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: So I just want to talk about these projects. I mean, you guys have said several times that you're kind of contemplating limited large project activity. And how much visibility do you have on these things quarter-to-quarter? I mean, clearly, Australia has been weak for a lot of companies and maybe that was something that could have been contemplated on the second quarter guide. And then I guess for the fourth quarter, some of the stuff you're accelerating on your core for the fourth quarter, maybe you could just comment on why your visibility is any different. Are there projects that slipped into October that have already been booked? I mean, maybe just give us a little more comfort around why we won't repeat this issue in the fourth quarter that we did in the third on the revenue front. And then I have one other follow-up.
John L. Stauch: Yes, Steve, good question. And we'll tag team here, Randy and I. I think, when you take a look at Q3 versus forecast, in summary, we missed about $50 million in Australia. Half of that was actually currency, which we did not see coming, and 1/2 of that was roughly book and ship business that was expected in the quarter and now we don't expect that even in Q4. And we're anticipating that Australia becomes flat to the current levels in Q3 well into 2014, given the conditions there on mining and given the overall state of the economy. In Thermal, you notice the miss. On a year-over-year basis, it was large projects. We shipped a big Voyageur contract last year. We were not anticipating large projects in the quarter. It was actually Europe where they were the last to head into the decline mode. We have record backlogs in Europe and the projects started to -- or the ship dates on those book and ship businesses started to slip throughout Q3 into Q4. We've only put part of that into our forecast for Q4 and the rest of the uptick reflects what we think is the new normal seasonality coming out of Q3, which was the old fiscal year end for Tyco Flow and now reflecting the new year-end fiscal year end. And so a lot of these projects that would have been rushed to completion, if you will, in September on the order side, we now think have their normal completion in the Q4 timeframe. Randy, I don't know if you want...
Randall J. Hogan: Yes, the only thing I'd add, Steve, I'm much more focused on the bottom line than the top line, but we always focus -- we, obviously, want to get better at forecasting the top line. One of the things that John has it right, one of the things that we didn't know going into the third quarter was how much the shift from the third quarter closeout of the year to the fourth quarter closeout of the year would affect the behavior in the Flow Control businesses. And I think we saw some, I would call less aggressive closing of orders. John talked about sales. But in terms of orders, I think there was less aggressive closing out of orders in the quarter that we are, in fact, seeing close in the fourth quarter. So I think it was a learning quarter for us.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. So x ForEx, you guys think you have -- the chances of us sitting here in January and you guys talking about another revenue slip, you're highly confident in that?
John L. Stauch: Well, Steve, yes. I mean, 2 things. I mean, first of all, you know Randy and I both work around large-project backlog businesses, you should not miss large project forecasts. And so I want clarify that's not where we missed it because you have your backlog, you have your shippable backlog. And even if you expect a little bit of slippage, you put that into your estimates. This is knowledge about, I think, the fiscal year end the seasonality of these businesses. And overall, I think we were able to manage through it effectively. And if you look at the year's forecast, as a matter of fact, what we've done, we've had some strong quarters of growth and we've had lesser quarters of growth. And I think that reflects more of the choppy seasonality last year within the Flow Control businesses than it does a normalized seasonal pattern that you're seeing start to form here throughout 2013.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Right. Okay, that's totally fair. Just one last question on the productivity side. If I take your synergies and then I add up all the productivity and synergies that you reported for the quarters, productivity looked pretty strong at, like, $25 million. It was a pretty good quarter. Anything unusual? And I guess, the bridge, I would characterize it as kind of like productivity and cost saves x synergies. Anything unusual this quarter? Or you guys seem like you're getting really good base productivity out of the business.
John L. Stauch: Nothing unusual. I mean, one of our goals when we closed the merger was to make sure we're focusing on margin and backlog, especially in the Valves & Controls businesses. We've been very disciplined on the types of orders and types of jobs we're winning and I think that's starting to show in the margin expansion in that business. So I think it's not just about growing, it's about growing profitably. And I think you're seeing the effect of that.
Operator: Your next question comes from Deane Dray from Citi Research.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: On the fast-growth markets being down 8%, this is now the second quarter and likely some of this is still related to China, but if you could just separate out what the pressure is in terms of is it Food and Beverage, is it Infrastructure? How would you characterize the pressures there?
John L. Stauch: Yes, just a clarification. I mean, overall, fast-growth was up around 2% in the quarter, still not a great number. But overall for Pentair, it was plus 2. We did see clearly in Water & Fluid, we were down 8% and most of that really was India. And so I think, overall, we're seeing still strength in China in our product platform there. We're up 23% in the quarter in China. And where we were down in Water & Fluid, it was primarily India and a little bit of Middle East. And as Randy mentioned, I mean, there hasn't been a lot of desal programs going on in that region.
Randall J. Hogan: Yes, and it really is -- it's what we call the advance of water. It's the desal projects, it's the big wastewater projects that have been the net drag in fast-growth markets. Actually, beverage -- Food & Beverage has done very well.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And then on the increase in synergies, I might have missed this, but what was driving that additional $15 million in savings? And then is there more in the tank on this? Are there additional projects you can be doing? Is the $120 million to be a stretch? And do you have line of sight on all those projects?
John L. Stauch: Yes, Deane. I think the upside was clearly sourcing and Lean, which I mentioned in my comments. And I think we always knew we were going to get that. I mean, we have a great Lean and sourcing culture here. I think the upside coming forward will be the Lean enterprise, which is all the back office structures that we think we can get more synergies through. And we've been planning for that all this year. We didn't expect any of that to hit in 2013 and we're set up nicely now for 2014 and for savings related to those projects. So we feel really good about where we are in the synergy road map.
Randall J. Hogan: Yes, I'd just echo that and mention that the Lean is off to a great start. It's helping -- it's really helping delivery right now. But it takes a little while for Lean to hit productivity and the sourcing. The sourcing productivity has been really outstanding. And we think the funnel still looks good there for more.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Great. Just last question for me is the -- we're all trying to gauge and calibrate the seasonality in the new combined business. And it looks like it'll be some -- a little bit challenging here for the fourth quarter just in terms of identifying what's a seasonal trend versus some one-offs. So like making adjustments for Australia here. Yes, Tech Solutions got a little bit easier comps. But how would you frame the seasonal impact that is something that we would now be seeing on a go-forward basis?
John L. Stauch: Deane, I think no one is working harder on that than us. And I think we feel more knowledgeable today than we did a year ago. I mean, clearly, as I mentioned, if you looked at Flow Control's results last year, they were bouncing around a little bit. I think we feel very good about the seasonality being delivered in 2013 in the normal execution. And to your point, Thermal, which is -- likes cold weather is going to have a stronger Q4 in that its normal shipping pattern because of shipping ahead of the cold weather, the anticipated cold weather. So that's the only real seasonal business other than Australia, which will have a stronger Q2 historically.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Great. And then congratulations to Mike. He's had a great run.
John L. Stauch: Yes, absolutely.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mike Halloran from Robert W. Baird.
Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: So on the Valves side of the business, when you think about the order activity, backlog has been stable. Tough order quarter here. But it sounds like the quoting side of the Energy products and projects, in particular, still remains strong. So a couple of things there, one, maybe you could just talk about what the customers are saying today? What's driving some of the delays in getting the quoting through beyond just the timing with the calendar? And then what do you think the catalyst here is to start seeing a little bit more consistent order strength because not only you, but all your peer group, has been talking about strong order environment, or at least quoting environment, for a few quarters here but just haven't really got them to the finish line. So any color there would be great.
Randall J. Hogan: Yes, I would just say when we look and we talk to customers about their capital plans, which, obviously, the thing that drive the large projects, even the medium-sized projects for the oil & gas industry, the capital plans remain solid. And I would say not down, not up. Maybe slightly up, but not greatly up. And what they're doing is they're looking to save costs. For us, we're a valve supplier to large projects. So the valves are not a big part of those projects and there seems to be more intense conversations between the end customer and the E&P players who control the projects overall. So the activities are, I think, about trying to be more cost effective on the implementation of these projects. That's my read of it -- that's our read of it, not just mine but our team's read of it. But these projects are going to go forward. So a number of projects we saw in the Middle East, a number of projects we've seen in the power industry, they've sort of slipped into the right, which is a term I hate. But it's what we're seeing right now but not outright canceling, with the exception of a couple of really large projects that everyone knows have been canceled up in Canada that have been canceled before. We haven't seen any other cancellations.
Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: That makes sense. And then on the Residential side of the business, obviously very strong trends this quarter, healthy expectations for the fourth quarter. Any signs of cracks there or at least the incremental slowing in the residential end markets you deal with in North America?
John L. Stauch: I would just say, Mike, and I'll have Randy make some comment, we like the trend there. I mean, we were -- this high single-digit type of growth pace that we're on is a good place for us to do well and then to make money in. And I think, we would have been more concerned if we would have saw the huge spikes and the overbuying of the houses or the over-delivery of the housing permits. I mean, I think, we still feel we're in a healthy environment. Obviously, 6 years of decline now coming back relatively strong and our pace of activity is flowing through as we would expect it, pool with the high-end consumer and there we've had strength because of our energy content. Also, we haven't seen a huge impact in Residential Flow, as you know. That's more of a weather dependent, not a new housing start. But we're starting to see in the quarter, finally, the water filtration plays and the growth in that space.
Randall J. Hogan: Right. And particularly in Europe, I mean, where it has lagged. But with residential returning to a more stable environment in Europe, that bodes well for us further because that's an important market for us in the Residential Filtration business.
Operator: Your next question comes from Steven Winoker from Sanford Bernstein.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Just first one, check my math. On the price versus productivity side, I count $78 million listed for productivity/price and op income and roughly about $14 million on price on the sale side, which most of which drops through. So is your productivity-only number's closer to $60 million or $65 million?
John L. Stauch: Sorry, say that again, Steve?
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: I'm just -- what's your productivity-only operating income number, net of price?
John L. Stauch: Yes, it's about -- just about $55 million excluding -- well, $57 million excluding inflation.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay. But include just that productivity/price in op income that you've got...
John L. Stauch: It's about $70 million.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: $70 million, okay. And then on the -- on page -- on the Water & Fluid walk, you talked about $20 million of volume and sales, but 0 impact on the op income side from growth. What's going on there?
John L. Stauch: Well, that is net -- yes, it's the net impact of volume and foreign exchange and we dropped that through in op margin in that walk. And then the leverage of that or the lack of leverage comes in the productivity side of the equation.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay, great. And then, finally, just on the top line integration impact, you talked about the Middle East commercial pump line and getting the $25 million to $50 million of sales over 5 years and all that, but how do you know -- to what extent are you confident that all of these massive integration activities happening across the portfolio did not have a negative impact on your sales for this quarter?
Randall J. Hogan: Well, that's certainly something we talk to all our presidents about and the businesses and there is a lot of focus on cost structure. But we've been very selective in terms of hitting cost structure on the go-to-market side. Most of the structure has been on what I would call the G&A side and then manufacturing side and -- but we certainly are aware of that risk. We've also been -- I mean, I do think that our focus on profitable growth probably has kept us from having as high a top line as we might have. But frankly, I don't want any more projects that don't make money. So if that's all we're losing, I'm okay with that.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Well, the word project selectivity is used by some of your colleagues and the former -- the other Tyco. I mean, is that -- are you going through a pretty significant change in comp and other things for the sales force to impact that -- there's more profitable projects or...
Randall J. Hogan: Well, we have. We've got clear focus on that margin. The Valves & Controls business was reorganized into -- from an end-market focus, which was really focused on market share and there were measures on market share and in growing in each of the verticals. And now, we're focused on product line profitability and functional excellence. And so I do believe that, that change has been beneficial in terms of making sure that we are taking profitable projects. I can't comment on what the rest of Tyco is doing.
John L. Stauch: We can measure the margin and backlog, though, Steve, and that's the measure if that backlog is a more profitable backlog than it is today.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Just to close the loop on Valves & Controls orders, can you give us kind of the blended order, order rate and what the comp was for 3Q?
John L. Stauch: Meaning the -- you mean the total orders?
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Yes.
John L. Stauch: We got it by those 4 segments...
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: And while you're looking for that, I mean, I kind of blended, come up with down kind of high singles, low doubles. But I'm just trying to understand better because it seems like there's some fiscal year timing changes, some focus on profitability. What's really just kind of timing here in the order or maybe a tough comp versus your real fundamental weakness -- weakening in the business?
Randall J. Hogan: Let me talk about while John's looking it up, let me talk about just in general. The Flow Control businesses used to close out their fiscal year at the end of September, if you recall, that we moved to fourth quarter after taking over a year ago. If you recall, all those businesses had weak fourth quarters and they had spectacularly strong third quarters. And so this is our first time through that change and we'll see -- we'll see -- we expect that there was some orders that would have been booked maybe in -- with a different fiscal year in the third quarter that will get booked in the fourth quarter.
John L. Stauch: Yes, I mean, the actual, if you add it all up, you should be somewhere around $562 million to $565 million, Jeff, in total orders. And clearly...
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: And what was it last year?
John L. Stauch: Last year would have been, on the same basis, $636 million.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then...
John L. Stauch: As Randy reflected, they sequentially, from Q3 to Q4, dropped significantly well below $575 million in orders in Q4, reflecting a peak in Q3 and then a big drop in Q4. We're now expecting a more normalized pattern between Q3 and Q4 with a little uptick in Q4 versus Q3. So I think this is about the seasonality of the year end more than it is about an indication of what's going on in industry trends.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then just shifting gears to Aquatics and Food & Beverage, you guys have had just great growth there. And it sounds like quoting's pretty good in Food & Beverage, but to what extent do we start to worry about tough compares there?
Randall J. Hogan: Well, we haven't given 2014 guidance yet. But when we look at Aquatics and Food & Beverage in particular, with the exception of agriculture, which has had some benefits in the U.S. with some tax treatments and they're going to expire at the end of the year, which I think is going to slow down irrigation and maybe crop spray. With the Foodservice -- in Foodservice right now, we have a lot of momentum and globally we've had a lot of momentum. And then Food & Beverage, we have a great backlog in the beverage and dairy business. So I feel good about that. In terms of Aquatics, Aquatics, as you know, has controlled their own destiny for some time. And now on top of that, they've got growth in the end markets. I mean, they were growing for 3 years while the market was declining, and now on top of that, the market's going up and they continue to innovate. So I have great confidence in Aquatics growth.
John L. Stauch: I think -- just a follow-on, I think as we take a look forward on the Food & Beverage side, I would think about 1/2 of the year growth rate this year is what we would be anticipating next year with, as Randy said, ag being the tougher comps next year and the Food & Beverage and Foodservice side continuing to go forward. Clearly in Aquatic, we're not going to continue that rate of growth as well but high single digits is certainly something that we feel is achievable over the next several years.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brian Konigsberg from Vertical Research.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: I just wanted to touch about -- on the funnel. So you had mentioned again your finding more opportunities in all the different buckets that you're attacking. If you aggregated the last quarter's funnel, you're talking about $390 million. I'm sure you don't want to get in the habit of quantifying this, but I mean, has that increased meaningfully versus where you were at Q2, if you could give a little color there and maybe where it's coming from.
John L. Stauch: I think the way I would describe it is what I said in my script was -- in my comments was that we're clearly, as a company, sitting around 8% G&A and that's well higher than historically Pentair has ever been. 6% is our targeted G&A for 2015. If you take that 2-point times sales and you start adding that to the current synergies and assume that we'll continue to get sourcing and continue to get Lean rollout, we feel very good about our potential ability to continue to expand margins. We're cautious about providing the funnels because as we said, this is about productivity and synergies and we need both. And so we're really driving a rate of margin expansion through ensuring that we're getting from both sides of the Flow Control and legacy Pentair the right amount of margin expansion in gross margin and the operating expense leverage. So we're working both simultaneously and the only way we'd win is the bottom line. So we feel good about what pipeline we have.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Okay, fair enough. And just back to Valves & Controls orders, you had been talking about selectivity. I think last quarter, you talked about maybe 100 basis point improvement in margin and what's in your backlog versus kind of what you're reporting. Can you give us an update on kind of where that stands today?
John L. Stauch: That's still about accurate.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Okay. And then finally, also just on the process side of the business, so it sounds like U.S. still fairly solid with MRO work; China or Asia, a bit weak. But just more focusing on the U.S. side, so we've heard a couple of get ethane crackers get announced by some of the major chemical companies. I'm just curious, I'm sure you're going to be competing for those, when should we anticipate that order profile start to inflect higher for Pentair? I guess, question more is kind of where do you sit in the construction cycle and when do you start to see the benefits of these large projects getting off the ground?
Randall J. Hogan: Well, we have frame agreements with a lot of those customers already, so we have, if you will, we have a preferred or at least a right to bid on those. So we will work those with the customer if it gets spec-ed in immediately, even before they announce them usually. So you can bet we're working on them. They will award them typically after the EPC awards so...
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Right. So a couple of EPCs have been awarded. I mean, are you talking about a couple of quarters after? Or is it a year later? And how do you intend on actually recognizing the revenues? Is that going to be a percentage of completion or would that...
Randall J. Hogan: Generally, on Valves, we recognize them when we ship them so -- but they'll ship in -- there's multiple valves, so they ship in multiple orders. And right now, we feel good about the process industry in general, in chemicals in general in North America and -- because of those kind of large but also a lot of smaller projects that are going in there. I can't comment specifically on when I expect those to -- would ship if we win them.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Is it safe to say orders from these couple of projects that have recently been announced would be a '14 event? Or is it later than that?
Randall J. Hogan: If I tell you it's '14, it'll probably be '15. If I tell you it was '15, it'll probably be '14. So I'm not going to give you a date.
John L. Stauch: And Brian, those are not -- those are -- I mean, a large order for us is going to be in the 10 million to 20 million of valves range and that's a large, large order. So I mean, we're talking about series of $2 million to $5 million orders here and those are all the types of things that continue to add confidence to the growing industrial process side.
Randall J. Hogan: It is right to focus on it though because -- I mean, we're focused on it because, I mean, when they're putting in ethylene crackers, they're making long-term bets on an industry and the market for those monomer streams. So they're -- they're there and there will be other investments to go along with it. I actually think it's a new day for chemicals in America.
Operator: Your next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from MKM Partners.
Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division: Just a question on Valves & Controls and I know that some of the comments you made at your Analyst Day last year we don't get a sense of the shape of the growth that you outlined. But to pick on that specifically, you have a 5% CAGR over the planning horizon, leaving kind of an 8% CAGR over the next 2 years. Do you think some of these project deferrals can lead to that acceleration in the growth? And if that fails to happen, do you feel like you have the synergy pipeline to overdrive on that? I guess, the way my math works, if it ends up being more like that 5% for the next 2 years, you're going to need another, call it, $30 million in EBIT. Clearly, you guys are finding upside there. I just -- help us calibrate kind of the growth versus synergy offset here with '13 coming in wider on the top line?
Randall J. Hogan: Let me talk about it within the whole arc of this merger. I mean, originally when we first looked at the forecast of the Flow Control outlook, it was pretty high. We took it down, on what you're asking, the 5%. And then you're asking is if the 5% isn't there, what can we do? And I would tell you that, clearly, the orders, themselves, have not been consistent with what we would have anticipated 15 months ago. But having spent a year with the business, the opportunities for productivity are even better than I thought. So my answer would be and then we'll see what John -- my answer would if the volume isn't there, I'm still committed to get to 5% and I think we know the way.
John L. Stauch: Yes, and then -- I obviously agree with Randy because he's really demanding. And I'd say when you look at Slide 6 and you look at our percentage of our overall revenue in backlog and -- it feels, as we were talking about earlier, that industrial process is starting to pick up and industrial has been flat throughout most of the year. And if you look at other people's order rates there, it's been improving. That's really the one we need to move forward into a mid-single digits to be able to contribute that higher single-digit growth rate. And we're feeling good about the activity there and we're feeling good how that's starting to unfold. As you could see, there's a lot of focus on mining. But for our mining business, it's less than 10% of our overall sales. So the downturn there -- or the upturn doesn't move the needle the way industrial process does.
Randall J. Hogan: Right.
Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division: I mean, you could see mid- to high single-digit growth in that process business without turning? That's order of magnitude consistent with what they're able to do historically?
John L. Stauch: Correct.
Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then just one follow-up on the growth. Is it that these business need more investment -- I guess, stripping out the project timing things and these things happen especially in this macro environment, but do you feel like there's -- it's just more investment that's needed to get the growth? Is it a lack of opportunities for investments, so you guys are funding everything but there aren't enough ideas? Or are these businesses just more like grind it out than you originally anticipated? I guess, how do you...
Randall J. Hogan: One thing is we're not overreacting to the vagaries of the up and down. The standard deviation around orders is 10%, plus or minus, every quarter. So we're trying not to overreact to just the vagaries quarter-to-quarter. That said, we believe that we can do a better job of priority focus on growing the markets that are most -- growing in the markets that are most attractive. That may require us to fill in some product line gaps. We're not the strongest, for instance, upstream. We're not as strong upstream as we think we'd like to be, for example. But it's also to make sure that we're investing in the markets that are growing. We mentioned India was down. We need to be bigger in some of the markets. We want to be bigger in the Middle East. We want to be bigger in Africa. So it's both a geography focus and it's a product line priority. And that's what we're doing in the planning cycle now. We make sure that we're putting our best resources against those priority focuses.
Operator: Your next question comes from Scott Graham from Jefferies.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Congrats to Mike Schrock. I just really only have one question. And you guys have done a great job in increasing the synergies for '13 all year. And you're now expecting a nice little ramp in sales growth for each of the 3 segments in the fourth quarter. I was just wondering, are any of the synergies actually going back into the company, being reinvested to try to drive and make sure that top line growth acceleration, you're spending any of that toward sales?
John L. Stauch: Yes, Scott. I mean, I think, as Randy mentioned, it was a key focus of ours not to attack or go after the sales and marketing and the growth-related resource as a percentage of sales. We've held the percentage of sales, and in most cases, increased them. And so the focus has been on the Lean, the operations and also the back office driving the synergies and making sure that we're continuing to invest it. But as Randy mentioned earlier, now we're spending a lot of time making sure the money is being spent in the appropriate areas that can actually drive the most profitable growth and that's a big part of the 2014 planning activity.
Randall J. Hogan: And we've talked about some examples. I mentioned the investment we've made to localize commercial pumps in the Middle East, leveraging the Sharjah factory. We've invested even more than that in the Middle East. We've talked before about the investments we made to cross-sell valves in the Food & Beverage business. So some of the wins we've invested in MRO and that's up 6%, 7% in the quarter. So we're seeing results from the investments we made and we've talked about them.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: So essentially, what I think I hear is that your -- the combination of the spending and easier comps, some of these timing issues we've talked about in a couple of businesses, you feel good about those fourth quarter sales expectations by segment?
Randall J. Hogan: I learned under a master to never be comfortable with the forecast. We're committed to the forecast.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: That's a good answer. I actually have a second question I just thought of and it's kind of a piggyback off the last question. If I recall correctly at the end of the Analyst Meeting last year, one of the things that I think you said very clearly, John, was that, hey, we don't have a crystal ball. We don't know what the top line looks like. It is our goal. We're committed to 5% growth. But if it doesn't happen, we're still confident in making the $5 number. I know you just kind of said the same thing, but it's just really a combination, not just of the synergies to get there, but you could also kind of pull the share buyback leverage to get there as well if you come a little short of that 5%, right?
John L. Stauch: Absolutely. And Scott, think what you're hearing from Randy and I today is we've had a year now to look at these businesses and understand what was in the core, what was in the base. You look at some of the projects that have come out in Australia, you look at some of the megas that were there in Thermal that are no longer there, primarily the Voyageur project, and we take a look at where we are in the base and the core growth rate in the base and it more than reflects what we want to on an ongoing basis. So we feel we're coming off of this base, knowing what's in there and the ability to grow organically, we feel very good with that and the cost structure to achieve our commitments.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Rose from Wedbush Securities.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: A couple follow-up questions. In the guidance, I mean, you've had some divestitures in the first half of the year, are we thinking about potentially more rationalization of businesses? And I mean, I imagine they are small, but how should we think about that in terms of the guidance? Generally, that's not reflected in the guidance, but it should impact your top line, nevertheless, is that fair?
John L. Stauch: Yes, we're not reflecting any of that at the moment. And we would feel it would be our problem to absorb and deal with that as well.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Okay. So we can assume that if there are any divestitures, that won't be really be an excuse for the lower top line unless they're sizable?
John L. Stauch: Correct.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Okay. And within the guidance, I think this has been addressed before by others here, but you have the headwind from Sandy. It's not a meaningful headwind for you, but it's factored in your business. Are there other headwinds that we should think about in the fourth quarter that may not have been highlighted?
John L. Stauch: I think we feel like we learned a little bit about the Australian dollar in the quarter. And I think we've got that forecasted to not recover. And at some point, if a currency goes even much weaker, it should help its ability to export out. So right now, as of this date, there's nothing that we can factor in. But we're not weather forecasters either.
Operator: Your next question comes from Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Randy, you mentioned some of the areas of opportunity where you have product line gaps. And with the Tyco integration kind of pulling forward quite a bit and going real well, I just wonder if you could update us on the timeline of your appetite for getting back to funding some bolt-ons in that area.
Randall J. Hogan: Well, we were active in the marketplace, looking at the different opportunities and we want to be as disciplined as we have always been, which is we start with what fits our strategy, so the product line gaps are, I'm not going to comment about specific ones, but the product line gaps are our key starting point for that. We got to make sure that we're disciplined in terms of the financials and that we continue to hew to the promises we made to shareholders in terms of our stock buyback program and the agencies and our overall capital plan. So I wouldn't predict as to when we might announce any kind of bolt-on.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Okay, but it sounds like you're ready to go?
Randall J. Hogan: Yes, if the right thing came along.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then just looking at next year, I think we have $85 million cost benefits from the 2Q restructuring this year, maybe $60 million to $80 million incremental synergies. Is that drop-through completely independent of growth if that should remain elusive?
John L. Stauch: That should be completely dropped through, correct. I mean, obviously, we have to manage inflation and those types of things. But that's why we're showing that chart the way we're showing it is that run rate should be incremental even on flat growth.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brian Drab from William Blair.
Brian Drab - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: First question, just on the order outlook. If we look at Slide 6 and you're thinking about the fourth quarter and taking into account everything that we've talked about so far in this call with the fiscal year-end situation, can you give us kind of a sense for these 4 end market outlooks in terms of order growth? What's this going to look like in the fourth quarter? Will we be up in orders in each of these end markets?
Randall J. Hogan: I think I mentioned we don't expect mining to go up. Power, we're seeing activity in power, but that's been sliding sideways. I think, overall, we expect orders will be up from the third quarter.
John L. Stauch: That's correct. And I think industrial process and oil & gas is where we'd expect them to go up. And as Randy mentioned, mining's likely to be down and power is likely to be flattish. Now you ask us to split hairs on a $2.5 billion business. So it's not something we usually do, is provide prospective orders by vertical market. But right now, that's indicative of what markets we think will continue to expand.
Brian Drab - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay, yes. I'm just trying to make sure I understand the pieces that get to the aggregate order growth because we're looking at -- I'm just trying to reconcile a few things that were said this morning. It looked like on what is Slide 8 that you're expecting the fourth quarter to be better in the Energy and Industrial verticals in terms of revenue growth and you're expecting Valves & Controls -- and that, obviously, has a lot of bearing on Valves & Controls, expecting Valves & Controls to be up 6% in the fourth quarter. And you've had those order headwinds lately but then you made the comment, John, about 2014 returning to an acceleration in organic revenue growth. So I'm just trying to -- that would require, it seems to me, a fourth quarter recovery in orders?
Randall J. Hogan: Yes. Just remember, Brian, the backlog page there just applies to Valves & Controls. Most of our Industrial is booked and shipped. It's not the -- it doesn't run really through a backlog number. That's where the Equipment Protection business is. That's where, frankly, a lot of Valves & Controls and Thermal is, too.
John L. Stauch: And I said in my comments, in 2012, in Energy and Thermal, there was a Voyageur project in which we anticipated in the beginning of the year having that Voyageur project continuing within '13. That project, as Randy mentioned, is canceled. So the last year-over-year headwind in Thermal Energy related to projects was in Q3. And that's a big piece of the turnaround as you look at Q4 and full year.
Brian Drab - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay, great. And that's kind of a segue to my last question here. Yes, of course, we're aware that Voyageur was canceled. But we, of course, knew that coming into this period and it looks like the guidance for Technical Solutions was flat to down slightly. The legacy Pentair business did well. Thermal Controls, you saw some projects delayed or can you give any more granularity there in terms of was that several projects, one larger project...
John L. Stauch: There was some project, book-and-ship Industrial in Europe. Record backlogs and the shipment timing was delayed from Q3 into Q4.
Brian Drab - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: But you mentioned oil sands here for -- within Thermal Controls.
Randall J. Hogan: Voyageur was oil sands, right? Industrial oil sands has nothing to do with Europe.
Brian Drab - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. I just want to be clear then. When you say oil sands, you're talking only about the Voyageur project, nothing incremental to what we already knew going into the quarter?
John L. Stauch: That's correct, that's correct.
Brian Drab - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And MRO in the oil sands was solid?
John L. Stauch: Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from Garik Shmois from Longbow Research.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: I have a question on mix. I called out some favorable mix benefit on the op income line, particularly in Water and Tech Solutions in the quarter. Just wondering, as you look in the 4Q guide, you've got very good incremental margin expansion. I recognize part of that is seasonality, part of that is continued productivity. But how much of a mix benefit do you continue to expect into the fourth quarter? Maybe how sustainable is that as you look out to 2014?
John L. Stauch: We think it's sustainable because what turned down substantially was a lower-margin Australian business, which is on the lower end of the margin within Water & Fluid. So our results in Q3 reflect that. And in Q4 and beyond, we don't have any recovery in that product line anticipated due to the economy there. In Thermal, as we mentioned, it was the impact of larger projects, which are still nicely profitable but nowhere near the drop-through of the pure product shipments. Again, not planning any large project activity in the near term as well.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. And then just as a quick follow-up, can you remind us how much of the percent of sales Australia represents for you?
John L. Stauch: Australia, on a full year basis for 2012, was about $1 billion, just under $1 billion of total revenue within the overall Pentair. And in Q3, it represented just under $200 million. So we've -- we're down about $50 million, as I mentioned, year-over-year. So it kind of gives you the rate of change.
Operator: And your final question comes from Hamzah Mazari from Credit Suisse.
Hamzah Mazari - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Just a question on the aftermarket business in Tyco valve. You spoke about an increased focus on service. Maybe if you could give us a sense of how that business is running? Is it up mid-single digit? What's the growth look like there? And then how much of that business is aftermarket now? Is it still around 35%, 40%?
Randall J. Hogan: Well, first, for everybody, it's no longer Tyco valves. It's Pentair Valves.
Hamzah Mazari - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Sorry, Pentair Valves.
Randall J. Hogan: Anyhow, the parts and service business, which is a focus for us, a greater focus, and it was up between 5% and 7% pretty much across all verticals. We sort of look at that as service and parts MRO. So interestingly, on the service side, a lot of the services is done on other people's valves. We think that's a nice growth area with this keener focus on the service side. So I would expect it to continue at that kind of a range.
John L. Stauch: I think it has an effect in MRO and you'll hear this from others as well. I think when the refineries run full out as they did in the quarter, it does delay some of the MRO spending. But overall, you're right to think about 55-ish percent is the installed base for us and that continues to do nicely.
Randall J. Hogan: Yes, right.
Hamzah Mazari - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Great. And just to follow up. On the Technical Solutions side of the business, it seems like margins there are close to peak. But in fact, it seems like mix is potentially negative to you right now. I know there's been some re-segmentation post the Tyco transaction. But could you talk about how you feel about margins going forward in that business? I know you've done a lot historically on the channel and operationally and on the cost side to get margins up in that business.
Randall J. Hogan: Well, mix was actually positive in the Technical Solutions segment because there was more product sales and less big projects, right? I mean, the big projects have lower margin, so that was a positive mix in the quarter. I never believe a margin should be -- is at peak. I mean, I think it's the fact that we booked -- it's over 20% this quarter proves that. I think other people in the past have said it's an 18 peak or is a 19 peak and now we're over 20. So I would say there is no peak.
John L. Stauch: And to follow on to Randy, I think we're still as optimistic. I mean, I believe and Randy has been -- has this experience, too, great businesses get even greater and they see more. And this our business that's been after Lean for the longest period of time. And we continue to think that the margins will expand from here.
Randall J. Hogan: All right. Thank you, all. And operator, if you could give the replay, please. Thank you, all, for your attention.
Operator: Thank you, everyone. As said, there will be a replay of this call and it will be available today, October 22, 2013, at 12:30 p.m. and will run until November 22, 2013.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Tracy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Pentair Q2 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I'll now introduce -- turn the call over to Mr. Jim Lucas, VP, Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.
James C. Lucas: Thanks, Tracy. And welcome to Pentair's Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. We're glad you could join us. I'm Jim Lucas, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me today is Randy Hogan, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Stauch, our Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, we will provide details on our second quarter 2013 performance, as well as our third quarter and full year 2013 outlook as outlined in this morning's release. Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as the risks outlined in Pentair's most recent 10-K and 10-Q and today's release. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today, and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results. Today's webcast is accompanied by a presentation, which could be found in the Investors section of Pentair's website. We will reference these slides throughout our prepared remarks. All references today will be on an adjusted basis, unless otherwise indicated, for which the non-GAAP financials are reconciled in the Appendix of the presentation. We will be sure to reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. In recognition that there are other calls this morning, we will target to be done in an hour. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Randy.
Randall J. Hogan: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with our second quarter performance, which is on Slide 3 of the deck. Pentair's second quarter was strong for many reasons. We were very pleased with our 4% core growth in the quarter and saw 2 of our 3 segments grow, which highlights our narrowly diversified portfolios balance. All 3 segments drove operating margin expansion greater than 100 basis points, and Water & Fluid Solutions achieved a 15% operating margin, a record for that segment. Our adjusted EPS came in at the high end of our guidance. It has been 9 months since we closed the flow control merger, and every day we see further support for the rationale of the deal. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on the synergy targets we've outlined given Pentair's proven track record of execution and the actions we continue to identify to drive our success. This is important since many of our end markets around the globe are sending mixed signals ranging from sluggish and pessimistic to moderate optimism. Our continued North America residential recovery, strength in Food & Beverage, and steadiness in Energy, is helping counterbalance the ongoing headwinds in Industrial, where many had anticipated a second half acceleration does not appear to be materializing. Before I go through the second quarter results in detail, I want to note that we will be discussing our operating results on an adjusted basis to better address the core operating performance of our businesses, and referring to 2012 on a pro forma adjusted basis to provide a more accurate apples-to-apples comparison that includes flow control in the results. With that, here are the numbers. As I mentioned a moment ago, second quarter revenue grew 4% on an organic basis with foreign exchange neutral in the quarter. Adjusted operating income grew 13%, while adjusted operating margins increased 120 basis points to 13.7% as price and productivity once again more than offset inflation. Adjusted EPS grew 19% year-over-year to $0.92, which came in slightly higher than our expected range. Free cash flow for the quarter was $331 million, which is greater than what we generated for all of 2012. And we expect to deliver full year free cash flow greater than 100% of net income once again. We continue to build momentum on the elements within our control, and we see opportunities to deliver double-digit EPS growth, even as we wait for better economic conditions around the globe. Now let's turn to Slide 4 for a performance review of our largest segment, Water & Fluid Solutions. Water & Fluid Solutions sales were up 8% on a core basis, made up of 7% volume growth and 1% of price. Sales in the Residential & Commercial vertical, which represents roughly half of the segment, grew 8% in the quarter, as the North American residential recovery continued. We once again saw a double-digit sales gain in our Aquatics business and our Filtration and Flow businesses also performed very well. The European residential market remained sluggish, but the North American market is more than offsetting this continued weakness. Our Food & Beverage vertical, which accounts for nearly 1/5 of Water & Fluid Solutions sales, grew revenue 25% in the quarter with agriculture, beverage and foodservice all delivering strong double-digit gains. Our Infrastructure vertical, which accounts for nearly 20% of Water & Fluid Solutions sales, was up modestly, as our North American break and fix business continue to shift from its backlog. And we're, at long last, seeing signs of stabilization in our European business, particularly with desal customers in the Middle East. The right half of the page shows second quarter Water & Fluid Solutions operating profits and margins for the quarter. Water & Fluid Solutions adjusted operating margins improved 120 basis points and hit a record 15% as the benefits the productivity and price drove the expansion. With the North American residential recovery gaining momentum, we again saw a strong drop through to the bottom line as a result of the cost structure we built during the prolonged housing downturn. In addition, we made good progress with our recent repositioning actions, which have begun to show benefit, too. In summary, Water & Fluid Solutions delivered a second consecutive strong quarter, driven by our Residential and Food & Beverage verticals. Now let's turn to Slide 5 for a review of our Valves & Controls segment performance. The second quarter performance in Valves & Controls is beginning to show the power of PIMS adoption. Lean implementation continues to go better than we had anticipated, and we saw further improvements in on-time delivery rates for the business. We've made good progress in Valves & Controls reorganization moves, and our clear focus on service has produced some nice wins. In addition, we continue to be more disciplined in pursuing large projects, as evidenced by improving margin in backlog. Also in the second quarter, we're encouraged that backlogs remain near-record levels and orders grew. We continue to expect to deliver low-single-digit growth for the full year based on our backlog and shipment schedules. After our top line decline in the first quarter, Valves & Controls sales grew 4% in the second quarter driven by volume, as FX and price were both flat. Oil and gas and mining sales both increased at a low-double-digit rate, while power sales were flat and industrial process sales declined modestly. We also saw a strong growth in service across Valves & Controls, but the top line at low-double digits and MRO growing in a mid-single digit range. We'll discuss orders and backlogs in further detail in just a moment. The right half of the page shows second quarter Valves & Controls operating profits and margins. Operating margins were up 160 basis points to 13.5%, owing to productivity improvements. We've seen broad adoption of PIMS, particularly in Lean enterprises, and synergies are also contributing to the margin expansion. As we discussed last quarter, we have deployed 8 senior operating leaders to help accelerate the deployment of Lean and over 10,000 PIMS e-learning modules have been completed by over 4,000 Valves & Controls employees. In addition, over 1,000 Valves & Controls employees have participated in PIMS growth training already. In summary, Valves & Controls growth in second quarter followed a modest contraction last quarter, highlighting that there may be some quarter-to-quarter variability around the timing of shipments, but our long-term outlook in this segment remained quite positive. Now let's move to Slide 6 for a look of the orders and backlog for Valves & Controls. As you can see on Slide 6, the Valves & Controls backlog is broken down in 4 key industries, 3 of which fall into our energy vertical: Oil and gas, power and then mining, and one in our industrial vertical, which is the process business. Backlog was essentially flat overall and remains at a near-record level of $1.4 billion. Process saw a small decline in its backlog, while orders grew. There continues to be some slowness in the Asia Pacific region, but North American quoting activity has picked up as a result of projects aimed to take advantage of inexpensive North American natural gas. Within oil and gas, backlog remains strong globally and orders grew 10% after declining in the first quarter. The power business saw a decline in orders against a tough comparison, but backlog remains strong and we still expect the second half to show some growth in power shipments. Second quarter orders in mining increased as a large project was booked, but the near-term outlook on the overall industry remains challenged. Mining backlog remains at a record level with many projects scheduled to ship through the remainder of the year. Now let's move to Slide 7 for the review of Technical Solutions. Sales for the segment declined 4% for the quarter led by another double-digit decrease in Infrastructure, consisting largely of Datacom, telecom and networking, which remains weak, particularly in Europe. Industrial sales declined 2% as many customers continue to delay capital spending. After seeing daily industrial order rates improved in April and May, we saw a decline in June. It's too early to tell if this is a further destocking of customers further lowering their capital spend, but the outlook for industrial remains less than favorable. Energy sales were down 9% as our Thermal Management business saw continued delays with megaprojects, mostly in Canada. The right half of the page shows second quarter Technical Solutions operating profits and margins. Technical Solutions operating margin increased 200 basis points to 17.6%, owing the positive contributions from price, productivity and mix, which offset inflation in the quarter. As we've seen in the past few quarters, Technical Solutions' profitable business grew, while the lower margin Infrastructure business declined. We expect the top line to remain pressured in Technical Solutions, as an anticipated acceleration in second half industrial activity does not appear to be materializing. However, we anticipate further margin improvement as mix remains favorable and standardization efforts continue to gain momentum. Let's now turn to Slide 8 for a closer look at Pentair's growth in the first half. Given the top line challenges that persist and continued mix of economic signs, we thought it would be helpful to provide an update on the trends in our key geographies in our 5 key verticals. The U.S. has been a bright spot in the first half as the long-awaited North American residential recovery gains momentum. We've also seen improvements in our Infrastructure break and fix business, where backlogs remained steady for over 4 quarters. Canada has been slower with a number of delayed projects in Energy, but we've not seen many cancellations. Western Europe continues to send mix signals, but we saw modest growth in the second quarter after several quarters of decline. While the European Residential & Commercial business remains weak, we've seen strength in Food & Beverage and are starting to see signs of stabilization in Infrastructure, or at least tougher comps flattening out. Fast growth regions have also been mixed with China declining, Southeast Asia and Latin America growing at a double-digit rate and the Middle East showing nice gains. Looking within our 5 verticals, we still expect Energy sales to grow at a low-single-digit rate for the full year. Based on our backlogs, we see second half growth in oil and gas, power and mining. As we alluded to earlier in our Valves & Controls discussion, Energy will be the vertical with the most lumpiness due to project shipment timing. Industrial has been a wild card all year and the anticipated second half acceleration does not appear to be materializing. The process business in Valves & Controls as backlog has shift, but the shorter cycle Technical Solution business continues to see customers pull their purse strings tight. Residential & Commercial is finally a bright spot, which we don't get tired of saying that after a 6-year downturn that we've suffered in North American residential. While there is some second half seasonality that should contribute to the growth rate moderating, we still expect mid-single-digit growth in Residential & Commercial for the full year. We have yet to see much in the way of recovery in commercial construction, so we expect sales of residential customers to continue to drive the top line in this vertical. Infrastructure sales have been tracking as expected for the year with the rate of decline moderating, while sales in Communications customers within Technical Solutions remains weak. We've seen Water & Fluid Solutions sales in North America post respectable growth, and European sales appear to be stabilizing after an 18-month contraction. Finally, Food & Beverage remains a great story. We're seeing strong gains in all 3 of our focus areas in this space. Agriculture continues to post near double-digit gains, driven by demand in both irrigation and crop spray. Beverage is seeing strong demand, particularly within the beer industry. And Foodservice is having a good year as the business is well positioned with key customers that are expanding globally. Now let's turn to Slide 9 for an update on our guidance. We're tightening our 2013 EPS guidance to a range of $3.15 to $3.25 from a range of $3.10 to $3.30. We've seen positives during the first half, such as better productivity and synergies, but the outlook for the top line remains murky. In particular, the lack of second half in acceleration in Industrial, as well as FX becoming a headwind, has led us to bring down the top end of our range by $0.05. At the same time, the elements within our control give us the confidence to raise the lower end of the range by $0.05. Now let's turn to Slide 10 for first half recap and full year outlook. We delivered on our first half expectations as our proven operating disciplines help to offset the ongoing external challenges on the top line. As we enter the second half, we've seen signs that Europe is finally stabilizing but don't see that as a signal that it's returning to growth. We expect price to continue to offset inflation, synergies continue to move ahead of our initial expectations and our record backlog to contribute to growth in the second half. As mentioned previously, the top line will also be negatively impacted by FX translation in the second half, which in addition to the small divestiture that occurred at the end of the first quarter, has led us to trim our revenue forecast by 1 point. In the meantime, we continue to execute on the elements within our control and we expect operating margins to expand in excess of 150 basis points, putting us on track to deliver strong double-digit adjusted EPS growth. We've completed $825 million of our $1.2 billion authorized share repurchase program and we expect our free cash flow to be greater than 100% net income conversion for the year once again. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.
John L. Stauch: Thank you, Randy. Please turn to Slide #11 titled Q3 2013 Pentair Outlook. For Q3, we are introducing guidance of $1.9 billion in revenue, around $245 million of operating income or about 13% ROS, and adjusted EPS of $0.83 to $0.87. There are a couple of meaningful assumptions built into this estimate. The first assumption is that what we do not see any sizable acceleration in global industrial shipments and that the current sluggish trends continue. The second assumption takes into account that we are expecting some shift in revenue from Q3 into Q4 in the legacy Flow Control businesses as we change our fiscal year end from September to December to align with the Pentair fiscal year end. Inclusive of these 2 events, we expect Q3 revenue will increase 1% to 2% for Pentair, with Water & Fluid up around 3% to 4%, inclusive of a couple of points of year-over-year project headwinds in the Australian pipe services business. We expect Valves & Controls revenue to increase around 1%, inclusive of an estimated 2 to 3 points of shifted revenue from Q3 to Q4 due to the change in fiscal year end. And finally, we are forecasting Technical Solutions revenue down about 1% as we continue to experience a more subdued industrial recovery than previously anticipated and delays in larger projects within the oil sands at Canada. We expect to begin to see a more pronounced expansion of operating margins across all segments as synergies accelerate, especially with contributions from sourcing and Lean and easier year-over-year comparisons. Overall, we expect adjusted EPS to be up greater than 20% with the tax rate still hovering around 25%, in line with the original guidance, an interest of around $16 million and share count of around 202 million. Please turn to Slide #12, labeled Quarterly Linearity of Earnings, where I will describe briefly our view of the back half EPS estimates. On the top part of the page, we have laid out the 2011 and 2012 pro forma Q2 to Q3 operating income change and the 2013 forecasted Q2 to Q3 expectation. As you can see, Q3 of 2013 is expected to follow the same pattern as 2012. On the bottom, we have laid out some of the assumptions and shared with you our most seasonally affected businesses and their typical best to worst quarters. We hope you find this information helpful. Please turn to Slide 13, where I will spend a few moments on our expectations for synergies and the internal funnels that help fuel our confidence. On the top left-hand side of Page 13, you could see our expected sourcing savings, our 2015 goal is $20 million. By the end of 2013, we will have realized 50% of our goal and have a growing funnel of projects. We have shared with you that we have been conservative in our sourcing expectation due to the fact that there is both expected base performance and expected synergies that are required. We feel we have a solid sourcing foundation and global commodity teams that have been expanded into our new businesses and we are seeing great success in many global commodities, a few that we have listed for you, and across all major processes. We are very confident that we will exceed expectations and are muting our external goals only because we are not able to predict the inflation headwinds that may be ahead of us and the impact that it could have on our results. On the lower left, we have shared with you our goals for Lean savings. We are targeting $45 million by 2015 and are forecasting that we will be around 100 -- or $10 million by the end of 2013. Again, fairly conservative expectations given our track record, our internal talent and our processes that are now embedded in the new businesses. Our internal goal is $115 million, which would yield $1 million in savings per plant over a 3-year horizon, well below our experience. Again, these savings are needed for both base performance and synergies, so we are guarding against double counting and false victory by keeping our expectations lower. On the top of Page 14, we have shared our external expectations for back-office standardization and repositioning. Our repositioning actions have already yielded an expected $85 million in savings for 2013, but we are just beginning the journey of simplifying the businesses to reduce waste and improve the customer experience. We are targeting internally a 2%-plus reduction in overall G&A, driven by efficiency of reduced complexity and standard working processes in the areas of ERP systems, data centers, legal entities, IT applications and accounting and payroll centers. A few of our businesses are well down the path in this journey and the others will catch up. Doing this correctly and swiftly will allow us to make acquisitions in the future in our best growth platforms, which should be immediately accretive due to these efforts. And the last bucket we have listed is our operating income expectations from expected revenue synergies. We are forecasting no net contribution in 2013, as most of our significant progress has gone to the funding the next wave of initiatives and investments in fast growth regions. Our current funnel of opportunities in recent wins are sample of the enthusiasm that is growing within our businesses for collaborating and sharing opportunities to enhance overall revenue but more importantly, to satisfy our key customer needs. A few examples include: Recent wins in Brazil, where Thermal Management used a local equipment protection facility to secure a $5 million order where local content was required; an example of the systems business in Australia specifying Pentair membranes in all of their latest wins around water treatment; and the Valves & Controls business partnering with our Energy business in filtration and process around oil filtration capabilities; and finally, continued success with over $10 million of orders so far this year secured in Food & Beverage by expanding the breadth of products sold to existing customers. Overall, we are on track to deliver our 2013 synergy targets and have 60% of the 2015 synergy secured and are accelerating the pipeline every day with new ideas. Please turn to Slide 15, while I briefly touch on the synergies by quarter. This slide has become standard and it briefly brings you up to speed on our synergies by quarter realized and our forecasted synergies for Q3, Q4 and the full year. We delivered $29 million in synergies in Q2 versus a forecast of $25 million. The upside was from more cost takeout and we are pleased that help drive results to the upside of our Q2 guidance. As we head into the back half of the year, we will begin to see the sourcing and Lean savings accelerate as it begins to work through inventory and into the P&L. For the full year, we are updating our synergy expectation to $105 million from $100 million, reflecting the Q2 beat. This should provide an exit rate of $140 million plus in annualized savings for 2014, or 60% of the 2015 target of $230 million. Please turn to Slide 16 labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. We had a very nice quarter as free cash flow was $331 million for the quarter, driven by over $80 million in working capital improvement. We still have substantial room for further improvement in our cash metrics in the legacy flow control businesses, and we are rolling out our receivable and payable policies and processes to them, as well as directing many Lean projects towards targeted inventory reduction. On the debt side, we ended at $2.7 billion outstanding debt as we accelerated $343 million of share buybacks into the quarter. We have now completed $875 million of our targeted $1.2 billion of authorized share purchases. We are expecting $650 million of free cash flow for the full year. When we complete the final balance sheet adjustments in Q3, we'll bring back the measurement of ROIC into our cash metrics page as we are keenly aware of the importance of that key measurement. Please turn to my final slide, Slide #17, labeled Full Year 2013 Pentair Outlook. For the full year, we are expecting $7.5 billion in revenue. As Randy mentioned earlier, this is on track excluding the impacts of the Aspen motors divestiture and an anticipated headwind from FX in the second half. This will drive organic sales growth for the year of greater than 3%, with a 5% to 6% growth in Water & Fluid Solutions, inclusive of pipe and services project headwinds; 1% to 2% organic growth in Valves & Controls; and flat to 1% growth in Technical Solutions. Overall, operating margins are expected to increase 160 basis points to 12.5%, and overall EPS is expected to be up greater than 25% at the midpoint of the range. With that, I will turn it back over to Randy who will summarize and then we will open up for questions. Randy?
Randall J. Hogan: Thanks, John. My summary, my last page is on Slide 18. In closing, we delivered on our first half commitments and we will remain well positioned to meet our 2013 full year goals. While the anticipated second half acceleration in Industrial and a growing FX headwinds have dampened our top line expectations, we continue to see strength in North American residential and Food & Beverage in addition to backlog in Energy that remain strong. Our integration and standardization efforts continue to build momentum and we now expect $105 million in synergies in 2013 versus our original target of $90 million. We're pleased with the success of the integration so far and realize that there is still a lot of work to be done, but the adoption of PIMS within the Flow Control businesses continues to exceed our expectations as we evolve into one Pentair. Thank you, and operator, can we please take our first question?
Operator: Your first question is from Michael Halloran with Robert W. Baird.
Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: So could you just dig in a little bit to the Food & Beverage strength, and specifically what areas you're seeing it in? And also, if there's any tie-in to some of the things that you're doing with Tyco on the Food & Beverage side and any of the revenue synergies there that might be developing?
Randall J. Hogan: Sure. In what we call Food & Beverage, we have 3 focus areas. One is agriculture, where we have 2 positions, which is basically irrigation, largely North American-related and then crop spray, which is on tractor, on equipment spray technologies, that is actually a global business. We have what we call our beverage business, which is supporting the manufacturers, if you will, of Food & Beverage. And then we have the Foodservice business, predominately our Everpure brand that supports the restaurants and other foodservice players. All 3 of those businesses grew double digit. Irrigation has been -- irrigation and crop spray has been a strong focus of ours, and that growth is coming in North America and is the strength of the farm communities, essentially it's driving those, as well as the nice global initiatives with some of the winning OEMs. If you recall last year in the beverage side, basically dairy and soda and beer, last year was a tougher year where the projects we're in -- we were working on a lot of projects but they weren't shipment. This year, we won a lot of those and they're doing very well. Dairy in North America is very strong, as well as beer. Not so much in the developed markets, but in the developing markets, particularly Africa and Southeast Asia, the beer industry is growing very rapidly. And we have leading technologies in that arena. Also in that arena is where we are getting the synergies. John mentioned $10 million of orders to date because of the synergistic offerings we have between our membrane technologies, our hygienic valves and the broad valve line that came from Tyco, and that's where the $10 million win. So the synergies are helping there. And then finally, Foodservice. We are the strategic partner for the leaders and we have a lot of very state-of-the-art systems that they're adopting as standards. And as they grow globally, we're winning with them. So that's been a focus of ours for a long time, as you know since 2003 actually, when we bought Everpure. And it's nice to see it all working.
Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: And then the follow-up on the order side for the Valve business. Could you maybe just talk a little bit about the underlying momentum you're seeing there on the quoting and the bidding side? And what your team is saying for how they expect some of that to materialize as you get to the back half of the year and specifically, in the energy and power-oriented end markets?
Randall J. Hogan: Ill provide some texture for your and then John can add in. One of the things we've seen is fewer larger projects and a lot more smaller projects. That's reading out in service volume, it's reading out in MRO. And as we've said, we've seen more process bidding in the U.S. as capital, particularly for the chemical industry, cap spending in North America versus other areas has been rising. So we're seeing bidding activity there. I mentioned oil and gas is strong but lumpy quarter-to-quarter. And it's mostly upstream activity that we're involved in. There's a lot of midstream activity, but that's an area, I think, where we need to grow share. And then power, where we're the leader, we have a decent backlog. There's lots of activity in the developing world, we'd like to some of that to break free to shift. So John, if you'd add anything.
John L. Stauch: No. I think you covered it. I think, I'll just add to Randy's point, that I think it's not as predictable as certainly our business and we would like, but we're still seeing nice orders and we're still experiencing right now, record backlog.
Randall J. Hogan: Yes. One thing I'd say is the new organization that has been put in place has really clarified and simplified some of the decision-making there, so we're -- I mentioned in the script that we're seeing an improvement in the margin and backlog. We felt to shift some what I would call ugly projects that we've taken with more revenue in mind than margin. That's the process that's been fixed. But we still have to mind some of that through the backlog into sales over the rest of the balance of the year.
Operator: Your next question is from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: So I just want -- just to be clear on Valves & Controls, is the shift that you're seeing 3Q to 4Q more because of the organizational change or because of projects moving around?
John L. Stauch: We think it's this simple, Jeff. I mean they had a Q3 fiscal year end and as you know, there is always a push for incentives and to ship as anything you can and book as many orders as you can by the end of whatever your fiscal year end is. The natural year end in this business, because it's a capital spending across an annual cycle, would normally be the Q4.
Randall J. Hogan: It would be the calendar Q4 like all the customers.
John L. Stauch: So what we're anticipating is that we will see a likely revenues that might have been accelerated into Q3, follow their natural course of action and likely land in Q4.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then in Water, it looks like you're calling for core growth kind of in line with the first half or maybe a little bit lower, yet the comps are a lot easier in the second half versus what you went against in the first half. So is that, again, timing of shipments in some of this Food & Beverage stuff or are you seeing some deceleration in some of those businesses into the second half?
John L. Stauch: No. We're seeing strength across all of the -- what would be the legacy Pentair Water businesses. The only area that we have a little bit of headwind, Jeff, is we picked up a Water business in Australia, which is part of the Flow Control businesses. And there is a lack of projects in the backlog right now, primarily because most of the mining projects are being pushed into next year. So we don't have -- so we had a year-over-year headwind, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, relative to that item, and everything else is continued strength.
Operator: Your next question is from Josh Pokrzywinski with MKM Partners.
Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division: Just to begin again on the Food & Beverage and the visibility there. I mean, it seems like that was a bit of maybe an unexpected tailwind this quarter, at least, versus what you had in first quarter '13. You're kind of doubling the growth rate through the balance of the year. And I think for such a small business, in the grand scheme of things, to add, I think on the consolidated basis, the point to full year growth. I'm just trying to understand, does visibility take you through the end of the year? Are there a chance -- is there a chance that you could get more project push and pull there quarter-by-quarter? Obviously, people are still grappling with the seasonality and I think so much volatility in the small business, any color there would be helpful.
Randall J. Hogan: Sure. Because of the range of different areas we're in, some of them are fairly short cycle. The irrigation business is sold through distribution and it's a shorter cycle business in North America versus the brewery business, which is -- we've got those scheduled out a number of quarters. We've got good visibility in that. So it's really kind of a mix. When you think of -- when I think about the strategy that's informed everything we've done to focus our company on going after the billions of new middle class people and the demands they're going to drive, this has been a big focus. And I wouldn't say that -- and certainly, 25% growth in this segment was a little probably higher than we would have forecast, and I'd like to get to used to forecasting that, but I don't think we forecasted that business for the second half, have we, John?
John L. Stauch: No.
Randall J. Hogan: The same rate.
John L. Stauch: Mid-teens.
Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division: Got you. That's helpful. And then just on the synergies. I think I asked last quarter as well, it's probably a little too early. But any more color you can provide on what the bridge may look like between the $105 million in synergies this year and the $230 million in 2015? And how we should think about 2014 as the bridge between 2?
John L. Stauch: Yes. I think I mentioned in my remarks, we're at $105 million and we're exiting at $140 million plus. The plus would mean that we expect to realize $140 million of synergies from the exit rate of Q4, there, Josh. Plus, if you take a look into the financials, we also took some incremental restructuring initiatives this quarter, which will not likely benefit us until 2014. Obviously, we want to get as much as quickly as possible for 2 reasons. One is we want to make sure that, that's the tailwind for us and the second reason is we're driving the standardization across the GBUs for if and when we can do acquisitions again that they can become synergistic and quickly accretive. So there's a push to get that as sooner rather than later as far as the total synergies. And by the way, there's no governor on what the total synergies can be. And as we were trying to hint, we've got a clear pipeline that should take us higher than the $230 million that we're driving to.
Operator: Your next question is from Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: First question on the Page 20 of the reconciliation, you do mention the restructuring. It looks like you're saying it's complete for the year. Why is it 0 for 3Q and 4Q?
John L. Stauch: We don't have anything quantified at the moment, Steve. It doesn't mean we wouldn't continue to look at opportunities. I mean, I think every time we meet and learn more about these businesses we see more opportunity around the corner. And definitely if we're going to see a flatter industrial cycle over the horizon, we'll likely go back for more. But right now we don't have anything quantified and we don't have any specific projects in the pipeline.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Even in getting to that full $230 million number?
John L. Stauch: Yes. I mean, I think in the $230 million, I mean our goal would be if we look at '14 and certainly in '15, we've set aside what we call this integration standardization team budget and we should be able to handle annual restructuring within that context as we drive to the '14 and '15 numbers.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay. And then second question on your margin breakout, you had 20 points on volume leverage, 260 price productivity mix and 160 offset on inflation. With 4% growth and even looking at minus 4 in Technical Solutions, I would have thought my math on a higher fixed cost base would have gotten me a slightly more significant margin on the volume side. And then maybe just give us a sense for productivity within that price productivity mix, just a little bit of breakout there to get a sense for what's really happening as a result of operations as opposed to sort of pricing or mix?
John L. Stauch: Yes. I think all your math is accurate. So the only 2 items that I would bring some color to, which were negative mix impacts or negative productivity is we were down double-digit in our Residential & Commercial EMEA business, that's a highly profitable business for us. So that's inclusive on that negative productivity or negative volume impact, Steve. And then the second one is, some of these beverage projects, these large systems that we are putting into the new breweries do bring through a little bit lower margin than when we get the replacement membranes through those systems. So those would be the only 2 things that I would add in addition to the math that you went through.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Jefferies.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: One question, one follow-up as requested. What's your confidence, Randy, in being able to sustain positive price for the rest of the year?
Randall J. Hogan: One of the measures we always do when we talk about being in business where we can pull our own destinies, one of the proof positives of that is your ability to get some price. In our businesses that go through distribution, which are a lot of the ones that are growing right now, the Foodservice business, the Residential business, the irrigation business, the Aquatics business, through distribution, it's good structure, there's been no changes in competitive dynamics that would indicate to me that we shouldn't be able to sustain price there. The area that's always -- it's difficult to calculate price is in the project area. So in the project area, Food & Beverage, and the larger bids in Valves & Controls and Thermal, what we look there is that's why we're tracking margin in backlog. It's hard to say whether it's price, but the important thing is to get margin. So I feel good about our disciplines around price and I feel confident in our focus on price.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Great. The follow-up question is probably more for John. John, the productivity target, forgetting about the synergies, but over and above that, the productivity target of 100 basis points per year in each side, the Pentair side and the Tyco side, has that changed at all? Are you tracking along the 100 basis points of your core block-and-tackle type of productivity in each business?
John L. Stauch: Yes. Scott, I mean, I think we're looking at about 160 basis points a year and we went public saying about 80 basis points a year from core and 80 basis points from the synergies and standardization. And against that 80, I'd say absolutely. And I think we feel like there's more on the court, too. I mean if we get more revenue growth or see more quarters of 4% and above, we should be inching that base higher than what we're targeting because volume leverage is a very powerful thing.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Yes. Fair enough. You always did say roughly 100, I think that you're probably rounding up, so 80. So it's on track, nothing has changed?
John L. Stauch: No.
Operator: Your next question is from Deane Dray with Citi Research.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: On North American water, maybe give us some color regarding some of the dynamics and product lines, this is one of the wettest periods that the Northeast certainly has seen in years, was there an impact? I know it's a lower margin on the sump pump side, and maybe comment how the spring selling season in full went?
Randall J. Hogan: The wet North East in particular was -- it slowed Aquatics a little bit, but not much. And it's certainly was a benefit in our Flow Technologies business. They had strong -- they had good double-digit mid-teens kind of growth, largely driven by flood-related Residential & Commercial spending. Interesting aside, right now, globally, we have about 50 projects that we're working on, on flood protection. And these are large projects, obviously, more along the lines of what we've done in New Orleans and other places like that, in The Netherlands. So flood continues to be the good focus for ours. But Aquatics, our market share position and because of our leadership and technology and innovation in Aquatics, we do really well within a lot of pools, and that's the South. So they were less impacted by -- they actually had a slow start to weather-wise in the South, but it wasn't quite as impactful as -- if we had just been focused in the Northeast.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And what was Aquatics year-over-year?
Randall J. Hogan: In the quarter?
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Yes.
John L. Stauch: We're up high-teens. And just to add to Randy's, and I think this was in his remarks. I mean, the North American residential segment as a whole grew low-double digits. So we saw that strength and clearly we had some easier comparisons on retail, in flow, and so those were up very, very strong. And even Filtration and Processes, Water softener market was up nearly 5%, which that's only the second quarter in a row now that we've seen that growth and that's a later cycle.
Randall J. Hogan: Yes. It's a later cycle recovery kind of product line. But I mean, yes, North America, I mentioned in the script that Residential & Commercial was up 8%, that was Europe down. So North America resi itself was up 12% to 14% overall in the quarter.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Great. And then a follow-up on Page 13, when you go through the key internal funnel, the $115 million. There's a line in there with a checkmark that says Pentair experience has been on a factory greater than $2 million in savings. And you've made a reference to the $1 million assumption, and I remember that was from the initial Tyco facilities. You're just showing that -- I'm trying to reconcile the $2 million, $2 million is what you've gotten previously in sort of the PIMS initiatives and showing that the $1 million assumption is conservative, is that...
John L. Stauch: It's obviously an average, but yes -- you can read into it that, that is below our experience level and we'd be disappointed if we only achieved that result.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: All right. That's helpful. And just lastly, the buybacks in the quarter that pace, do you expect to be able to continue that pace carried into next year?
John L. Stauch: I don't think it will be that pace. We haven't figured out what we're going to do yet, but we felt that it made sense to accelerate the buybacks given what we are looking at in the acquisition funnel and...
Randall J. Hogan: And the good cash flow.
John L. Stauch: And the good cash flow that we had. Obviously, we'll take a look at what Q2 and Q3 and the remainder of the segments look like, look at it at the appropriate time.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: But you have the authorization and the cash flow to support that level if you wanted, though?
Randall J. Hogan: Yes, to the $1.2 million.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Credit Suisse.
Hamzah Mazari - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Randy, I was hoping you could give some more color on the second half industrial reacceleration not materializing. I assume that's broad-based? And any particular regions where it's worse than expectation? And also any views on further destocking and what you're seeing in July?
Randall J. Hogan: Sure. Let me parse it between the different segments. In the process area of Valves & Controls, we actually see some decent order activity and it's largely in the chemical arena and largely because of the low energy cost we talked about. Our second half assumption is around our Hoffman brand, the profitable juggernaut, if you will, of our Technical Products business, was that we would see the same kind of continuation in order rates. And as we mentioned, June went down. I wish we had better visibility and that's also through distribution. Right now, we just don't see the capital spending breaking out. So what we had was, we had a very profitable segment, a very profitable product line in Hoffman, where we didn't feel comfortable that we had the visibility on the base towards -- to continue with that base assumption that we'd see Industrial up 3% to 5% in the second half. So that's really what it is. I don't think that there's been a major draw down. We don't think there's been a major drawdown in inventory. We have really good visibility on our inventory in the channel. The thing that I've asked our business to do is find out we can see publicly which distributors are performing and we have a few peers left that we can track in terms of their growth. And seeing if we have been active enough in managing our distribution coverage to make sure that we are getting the add back where markets are growing. And that's an area where I'm not yet comfortable. We have adequate recovery, I'd say in the Bakken or some others that should be growing.
Hamzah Mazari - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. That's very helpful. And just the follow-up would be on the Valves business. Could you give some color on what you're seeing on the aftermarket side for the Valves business? Some of your peer group is seeing some deferred maintenance still amongst customers, are you seeing that or it seems like your business is doing better on share gain? Any color there?
Randall J. Hogan: I don't know if it's that we're in different segments than our peers. But right now, as I mentioned, our service business is up, MRO is up. Now we have a strong focus on it. One of the beauties of the new organization is the clarity of focus we're getting on different areas and the teams rallying together really nicely. They really are running it as one valves team. And in particular, actually, we see the opposite in mining. We see a lot of the activity, particularly in Australia, moving since capital is down, we're seeing maintenance up, which makes sense right now. If you're not replacing equipment, you've got to maintain the equipment you've got. So I think it really depends on where your exposure is as to what you're seeing -- since mining, we've had a lot of focus on where we're losing -- where we're not seeing large projects, focusing a lot on smaller projects. And I think that helped us in MRO and I hope with share gain, but I don't know enough about the business yet to be confident in saying it is or not.
John L. Stauch: Just to follow-up on Randy's point real quickly. I mean, I think where we're seeing deferrals is in the larger projects. Then we continue to see those larger projects, as many of our other peers have said, being pushed out now. Now Randy and I were also talking that in the industrial space, the capital is at an all-time borrowing rates low, IRR is a really high on putting capital to work. And with the threat of increasing interest rates, at what particular point in time are we going to see that breakthrough, that's not in our forecast right now. But that's what we're monitoring and keeping an eye on.
Operator: Your next question is from Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: John, I think you had mentioned, there was a question previously by Steve talking about the conversion of the core business and you highlighted the Water & Fluid component. But actually, the Valves & Controls piece, it looks like the core conversion was fairly modest as well. Maybe can you address that? Was there something unusual in the quarter? And maybe how do we think about normalized conversion rates in that, excluding productivity and price and others?
John L. Stauch: Yes. I think Randy mentioned this earlier. We do have a few larger projects that are in the backlog that are working their way through, and they will probably be working their way through Q2, Q3 and Q4. Those were won previously. And as Randy also mentioned earlier, we've changed our focus to be more of making sure that we've got a better insight into what the margin backlog is. And quite frankly, our margin backlog is higher now, so that bodes well for the future. But what we've got is a little bit of the shipment that we still have to get.
Randall J. Hogan: It's like heartburn.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Okay, I got it.
Randall J. Hogan: We're working through the system.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: I see. And then actually, you mentioned FX, a headwind in the second half of the year. That just seems kind of contrary to what we see with the Europe for sure. I mean, why is that a headwind? Are there other significant exposures we should be thinking about for Pentair's business?
John L. Stauch: Yes. Two particular currencies. One is the Australian dollar, which is a big piece of this on $1 billion or so of Australian business we have in both Valves & Controls, the legacy Pentair businesses and also the flow or the pipe and systems business was inside of legacy flow. And the second currency would be the euro. And we did do this forecast at about $1.29. I do recognize that, that's slightly below where the current euro-dollar is. This was factored on about $1.29.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Can I slip one more, a quick one in? You mentioned process actually it's good in North America because of net gas, but Asia, I think the second quarter in a row you said it was weak, maybe you could touch on the trends there and all...
Randall J. Hogan: Well, it's really China. I mean, China for Valves & Controls and processes is down. And it's the slower capital spending that's going on there. We have a pretty substantial business there in Valves & Controls. And the rest of Southeast Asia is good. So it's really specific to China that's flowing. I mean, and I think everyone is talking about that.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Do you think China is actually pulling back because of the build in North America or is just an issue of the internal funding mechanisms?
Randall J. Hogan: I think it has more to do with just the general slowing of industrial activity there and them getting overshot. Most -- I think, every industry always puts in too much. When the growth rate changes, you really -- you have a bunch of capacity that gets put online that you don't need as soon as you thought. I mean it was true in the power industry in the U.S. and basically every -- happened to the pulp and paper industry over time, but I digress.
Operator: Your next question is from Garik Shmois with Longbow Research.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Actually a follow-up to the last question on China and the fast-growth markets in the back half of the year. It was up 2% year-to-date for fast growth overall. Just wondering what your expectations are for the second half of the year in those regions?
John L. Stauch: Yes. And I'd say we've got it closer to high-single digits in Q3 and Q4. And I think the main reason for that, as Randy mentioned earlier, some of our fast-growth region volume is more project-oriented or related to where the orders in the backlog and the timing of that backlog is. So we do have forecasted higher single digits for fast-growth regions in total for the second half of the year.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. And those would be non-China markets, I'd assume, is that correct?
John L. Stauch: Well, China would be a part of that as well. I mean one of the markets in China that's big for is power. And we've been building the backlog and throughout the last 3 or 4 quarters, and we do expect those projects to ship in the second half.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. And then just lastly, just on the full year guidance. First half of the year, you had exceeded your midpoint both quarters and you maintained the midpoint for the full year guidance, albeit narrowing the range. I can appreciate that you have more conservative revenue outlook that you cited because of the divestiture, plus FX. It seems like industrial is slowing a little bit, but Water does appear to be accelerating. Just wondering if you could walk us through your thinking on maintaining the guidance despite the strong first half of the year?
Randall J. Hogan: Yes. I would say it's less conservatism and it's more experientially-based. We always know it can go well. But we always know stuff goes wrong. And since we don't know what's going to go wrong, we're twice bitten, one shy. Once bitten, twice shy.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brian Drab with William Blair.
Brian Drab - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: I think it was mentioned that some of the projects in backlog, some of your businesses are at lower margin than average and some are at higher margin, I think John just mentioned. Can you give us a sense for what the average margin of orders and backlog is relative to the 13.7% that you did this quarter?
John L. Stauch: I can tell you that the standard margin in backlog is about 1 point higher in the outlook than it will shift. So if I take a look at 2014 and beyond, it's about 1 point higher than what we'll finish shipping in 2013. And it's related to 3 or 4 larger projects or one about what, 18 months ago, Randy? And those projects are at a very, very low margin. And as Randy mentioned, we've changed that behavior to be more margin-focused, and so I think we have a richer more favorable backlog as we go forward.
Brian Drab - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. Great. And then the legacy Tyco thermal controls business, I know it's about 10% of your sales after the merger, I believe. You mentioned some delays in that business, but are you seeing cancellations, is the oil sands business slowing? And what does the pipeline look like there?
Randall J. Hogan: Yes. We referenced Canada. It is the oil sands that have slowed down and we had impact there in the quarter. Year-over-year, there was a really large shipment in the oil sands a year ago that wasn't in the number this year. That was the big Energy down, if you will, in that business. That business has done a nice job growing the smaller businesses though, and nice improvements in profitability in that. So we think most of those progress will go. And when they go, we'll do fine. But in the meantime, we'll grow elsewhere.
Brian Drab - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: So growth in that business over the next 18 months or how is the pipeline?
John L. Stauch: Yes. Just to remind everybody, what we did was we did go in and pro forma the financials for the thermal business, excluding megaprojects or large projects. So our forecast and the way we're looking at it is primarily base projects and product shipments. And as Randy mentioned, we believe we can grow mid to single digits at that business. And then these particular large projects that we're talking about, they would be phenomenal to have. But we don't have to have them in the way you described it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Rose with Wedbush.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Just a follow-up to the -- a couple of follow-ups but to the last question. Just to be a little bit clearer on the Canadian business and the expectation for thermal. Did that imply we don't have any major projects coming in through the third quarter on a year-over-year basis?
John L. Stauch: That's correct, yes. There is no major projects in our Q3 or Q4 outlook.
Randall J. Hogan: One of the things that, and this is actually kind of fun, one of the things that we're doing as we come to be one Pentair is really to establish a set of principles around how we build the business and forecast it. And anything that we really don't control our own destiny, have really high visibility, let's put those above the forecast. And that's where the philosophy of these megaprojects that John just talk about it came from. We love them when they have it. But we're going to build a business were that's more than gravy. On top of...
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: I can appreciate there's a lot of legacy business that you did not have. And if we look at the Australian business, what was the drag on that business? And was the pipe business profitable in the quarter?
John L. Stauch: Yes. It's actually a very profitable piece of the overall business. It's just that there is not a lot of large projects in the backlog and/or in the shipments now. And as you know, the business can cycle up and down from, call it, 10%-ish margins to 20%, 25% at the peak. So towards the bottom of that assumption. And we think there's a political situation that's got to unwind itself as far as the tax on the mining groups. And as that unwinds, we're hopeful that the future is a lot better than the current environment that we're participating in.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: And to be clear, that's a component of why you expect the Water & Fluid Solutions to step down in terms of year-over-year growth?
John L. Stauch: That's correct.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Just to follow-up on that, the synergy and funnel comments. Would you -- I mean as you identified this additional funnel opportunities, is that something you think of as upside in '14 and 15? Or upside beyond '15'?
John L. Stauch: Well, Jeff, I think not to confuse you, but here's the way to look at it. When we look at the sourcing in Lean, there's both a base and a synergy. And as we've said before, it's hard to track what truly is a synergy sometimes versus what's the base expectation. So we have productivity funnels. We need those productivity funnels, and we've driving gross margin and making sure that volume is leveraged appropriately. Clearly, when we look at the operating margin of Pentair and we look at the operating margin of our businesses, there's a substantial amount of opportunity between where we are and where our benchmark peer groups will be at. And we're not going to lose sight of that opportunity and what we're really trying to do and Randy was talking to me yesterday, we have to drive the business models. And that business model creates that opportunity and these are rich pipelines, but I think they're going to continue to get richer as we go forward.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay. But the $230 million is what's in your $5 number?
John L. Stauch: That's correct.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: And so the 160 over is upside opportunity?
John L. Stauch: It would be if all realized, correct.
Randall J. Hogan: All realized below the base, yes. The point, Jeff, is that -- and you can even think about the $105 million versus the $90 million as higher yield of either productivity or synergies. And frankly, I mean, different because what we want to do is build business plans in each of these segments that incorporate both, right. And that's victory. That's only victory if it reads out at the bottom line. So we can't have higher synergies and lower productivity or vice versa. So that's the way we think about it. And that's what John was describing.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Steven Winoker from Sanford Bernstein.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Randy, we had spoken over the last 6 months about you getting to the point in June or July where you expect to arrive at some conclusions with regard to several of the businesses that might fit better with other owners. How has that thinking progressed in the current environment? How should we think about that going forward?
Randall J. Hogan: Well, right now, we never don't think about that and you're right, I did say, I always put things out 6 months, that's probably what I did when I said that. But we're always looking at how things that -- right now, we're going through a process in our strategy where we're looking at dozens and dozens of platforms and looking at the priorities. And at the end of that process, we'll decide where we are. But in particular, a lot of people asked about Australia. As we've gotten into Australia, we look at it we're sort of at the bottom of a cycle in terms of mining and domestic water spending. So we're finding some nice synergies and we're finding some people who are really buying into what we're doing in Pentair, we've taken some cost structure out. So I think it's a better business than I might have thought going in. All right. Thank you all. And operator, could you give the feedback or the call back number? Thanks.
Operator: Thank you for joining today, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call. And for replay, the number that you would need to dial, okay, it looks like this call wasn't set up with an encore record line.
Randall J. Hogan: It's in the press release. Thank you all.
John L. Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Okay. Thank you very much. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Shelley, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Pentair Q1 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Jim Lucas, you may begin your conference.
James C. Lucas: Thanks, Shelley, and welcome to Pentair's first quarter 2013 earnings conference call. We're glad you could join us. I'm Jim Lucas, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me today is Randy Hogan, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Stauch, our Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, we will provide details on our first quarter 2013 performance as well as our second quarter and full year 2013 outlook, as outlined in this morning's release. Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as the risks outlined in Pentair's 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, and today's release. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today, and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results. Today's webcast is accompanied by a presentation, which can be found in the Investors section of Pentair's website. We will reference these slides throughout our prepared remarks. All references today will be on an adjusted basis, unless otherwise indicated, for which the non-GAAP financials are reconciled in the Appendix of the presentation. We will be sure to reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. In recognition that there are other calls this morning, we will target it to be done in 1 hour.[Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Randy. Randy?
Randall J. Hogan: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with our first quarter performance on Slide 3. This marks the second quarter for Pentair since we successfully closed our merger with Flow Control at the end of September last year. I want to note straightaway we're very pleased with the progress we've made on integration and the momentum we've been building. Before I go through the first quarter results in detail, I want to note that we will be discussing our operating results on an adjusted basis to better address the core operating performance of our businesses and referring to 2012 on a pro forma adjusted basis to provide a more accurate apples-to-apples comparison that includes Flow Control in the results. You will find reconciliations of this for overall Pentair and the segments in the appendix at the end of the presentation. With that, here are the numbers: First quarter revenue grew 1% on an organic basis but was flat as FX was a 1% headwind. Adjusted operating income grew 4%, while adjusted operating margins increased 40 basis points to 10.1%, as price and productivity once again more than offset inflation. Adjusted EPS grew 7% year-over-year, coming in slightly higher than our expected range at $0.58. Free cash flow for the quarter was a usage of $29 million, in line with our seasonal timing. We believe we're on track to deliver full year free cash flow of greater than 1% of net income once again. The top line and adjusted operating income were in line with our prior guidance. We made good progress in executing the action plans to deliver the $90 million in synergies we outlined in November, and John will discuss that we've now increased synergy expectations to $100 million for the full year. In addition, we completed $140 million in share repurchases, and we delivered a 25% tax rate in the first quarter. So overall, we are underway at flank speed. Now let's turn to Slide 4 for our performance review on our largest segment, Water & Fluid Solutions. Water & Fluid Solutions sales were up 5% on a core basis, and FX was a 1% headwind. As a reminder, Water & Fluid Solutions represents the legacy water segment for Pentair plus the Water & Environmental Systems, or WES, business from Flow Control. Overall, we saw strong volume and price growth, which more than offset the FX headwind. The residential and commercial vertical, which represents roughly half of the segment, grew 10% in the quarter as the North American residential recovery continued. We saw double-digit gains in our aquatics business, which is hard for us to imagine here in Minneapolis, given we just got a foot of snow last week and more snow last night. Growth was very good given that Western Europe continues to be a challenge, particularly due to distributors maintaining lean inventory and levels -- lean inventory levels and minimal order activity through the start of the year. In food and beverage, which accounts for nearly 1/5 of Water & Fluid Solutions, sales grew 17% in the quarter, led by solid double-digit growth in agriculture and several beverage projects that were postponed at the end of 2012 shipped during the first quarter. We won our second major beverage project that combines hygienic valves from our legacy Water & Fluid business and industrial valves from our new Valves & Controls business. This is another example of how we are starting to see some winds in combining the 2 portfolios. We continue to look for strength in beverage based on our project backlog, and agriculture is well positioned entering the spring selling season. Infrastructure, which is nearly 20% of Water & Fluid Solutions, was down 10% in the quarter as Europe continues to be miserable. On a positive note, our North American municipal backlog continues to grow, and bidding activity remained healthy. The right half of the page shows fourth quarter Water & Fluid Solutions operating profits and margins. Water & Fluid Solutions adjusted operating margins improved 90 basis points to 10.6% on the benefits of productivity, price and mix. With the North American residential recovery gaining momentum, we saw a strong drop-through to the bottom line as we have realigned the cost structure in the last several years during the prolonged downturn in this important market. In addition, we made good progress with our repositioning actions, which should begin to read through. In summary, Water & Fluid Solutions began 2013 strong. With the actions taken to embed PIMS in this segment and the tailwinds in North American residential and food and beverage, Water & Fluid Solutions is in a good position to continue its momentum on operating margin expansion in 2013. Now let's turn to Slide 5 for a review of our Valves & Controls segment performance. This is the second quarter for Pentair's newest segment, Valves & Controls, and we're quite pleased with the progress we're making. We've been actively engaged with Valves & Controls leadership and are leveraging their deep knowledge of the business. We're tweaking the strategy to focus more clearly on profitable and sustainable growth, which was not always achieved in the past, since the business had growth rates through the cycle that exceeded the industry but margins that have been below industry peers. To unlock the margin potential we see in Valves & Controls, we're taking a disciplined approach by driving PIMS combined with a simpler, more focused service-led organization. The commercial organization is renewing its focus on development of the MRO services business, as well as being more selective in pursuing large profitable projects. Looking at first quarter results, we are encouraged that backlogs remains near record levels and shippable backlog grew 17% sequentially, setting us up nicely for low single-digit growth for the full year. Markets were choppy, reflecting the overall economic environment. The 4% top line decline is not reflective of the overall business trends. Oil and gas had a very difficult year-over-year comparison. And power is yet to begin shipping; it's now growing backlog. Plus, Asia has seen a slowdown in spending in process markets. Our book to bill was 1.1 at the end of the first quarter, portending a return to top line growth in the second quarter. We will discuss orders and backlog in further detail in just a moment. The right half of the page shows fourth quarter Valves & Controls operating profits and margins. Valves & Controls operating margins were up 10 basis points to 10.1%, owing to price and productivity improvements. We've seen broad adoption of PIMS, particularly in the enterprise, and we've seen momentum building on integration synergies that should help drive further margin expansion. We've deployed 8 senior operating leaders to help accelerate the deployment of Lean, and over 10,000 e-learning PIMS modules have been completed by over 4,000 Valves & Controls employees. In addition, over 1,000 Valves & Controls employees have participated in our PIMS growth tools training. In summary, Valves & Controls first quarter saw a tough year-over-year comparison, but the fundamentals for this business remain intact and our integration and standardization efforts made good progress, particularly with regard to training on PIMS. Now let's move to Slide 6 for a look at the orders and backlog for Valves & Controls. As you can see on Slide 6, the Valves & Controls backlog is broken down in 4 key industries, 3 of which fall into our energy vertical -- oil and gas, power and mining -- and one in our industrial vertical, which is the process business. Backlog grew 1% to a near record $1.4 billion. Within oil and gas, backlog remains strong globally, despite a slight decline from record Q4 levels. Orders declined at a high single-digit rate due to project delays and a tough year-over-year comparison. The Power business saw a high single-digit increase in orders, so we expect to see sales growth return in power in the second half. Mining, one of the smallest pieces of Valves & Controls, saw a steep double-digit decline in orders following strong orders in the fourth quarter. However, mining backlog remains at record levels, with projects scheduled to ship through the remainder of the year. Finally, backlog within process saw a healthy increase, while orders remained flat year-over-year. Process has seen shipping delays in Asia, but the strong backlog points to top line growth as the year progresses. We knew this business would have some quarter-to-quarter lumpiness, but we remain encouraged by the growing backlog, particularly the 17% growth in the shippable backlog from the first quarter to the second quarter. The organization has been simplified, the team has brought a new discipline to pursuing large projects, and we're very pleased with the adoption of PIMS throughout all of Valves & Controls. Now let's move to Slide 7 for a review of Technical Solutions. Technical Solutions comprises Pentair's legacy equipment protection business and Flow Control's thermal management business. Sales through the segment declined 3% for the quarter, led by a nearly 20% decrease in infrastructure, consisting largely of datacom, telecom and networking, which remain weak, particularly in Europe. Industrial declined 2% as inventory destocking continued for much of equipment protection customers. Energy was up 4% as thermal delivered strong product sales in the quarter. The right half of the page shows fourth quarter Technical Solutions, operating profits and margins. Technical Solutions operating margins increased 230 basis points to 17%, owing to positive contributions from price, productivity and mix, which helped mitigate inflation headwinds in the quarter. As we've seen in the past few quarters, Technical Solutions is growing its profitable business, while the lower margin infrastructure business is where the declines are occurring. While we expect the top line to remain pressured in Technical Solutions, we'd expect further margin improvement as mix remains favorable and standardization gains momentum. Let's now turn to Slide 8 for an overall market trend update. Given the top line challenges that persist and the mix signs we're all seeing, we thought it would be very helpful to provide an update on trends on our 5 key verticals as we see them. Looking around the verticals, Pentair remains well aligned to serve key global megatrends, and we expect to see growth as the year progresses. Within Energy, we still expect low single-digit growth for the full year. The first quarter saw a modest contraction as Valves & Controls faced a tough year-over-year comp. But our backlog provides visibility that growth [ph] accelerating in the second quarter and into the second half. In particular, power orders will continue to grow and should begin shipping in the second half. Industrial remains mixed globally, but we continue to expect modest growth for the full year. We've seen daily orders rates improving within our Technical Solutions business, and again, backlog and Valves & Controls within the process markets points to an acceleration in the growth rate and the declines we saw in the first quarter. Residential and commercial has finally evolved into a much improved story. While Europe has not shown signs of recovering, the North American residential market has clearly strengthened. This should contribute nicely to Water & Fluid Solutions margins this year, given the amount of cost we've taken out of this segment and the strong drop-through to the bottom line we should experience as the North American recovery continues. For the year, we still expect mid to high single-digit growth in the residential and commercial vertical. Infrastructure is the one vertical that we expect to be down for the full year, which is likely not a surprise given the current state of municipal financing around the globe. While we do not expect much improvement in the datacom, telecom and networking markets within Europe, we have started to see some hints of bidding activity on the water side. Within North America, our municipal backlog has shown strength in the last 5 quarters and bidding activity was strong in the first quarter. Overall, we'd expect the infrastructure to be down mid-single digits for the full year. Food and beverage, which is our smallest vertical, continues to justify our unique focus. Agriculture has shown consistent high single digit to low double-digit growth for several years now, and we would expect ongoing gains to be made as we continue to invest in this space. On the beverage side of the business, we not only saw delayed projects from the fourth quarter shipped in the first quarter, but more important, backlog continues to grow. Overall, we expect high single-digit growth for food and beverage for the full year. Now let's turn to Slide 9 for a summary of our first quarter. While markets remain mixed, we believe our diverse portfolio positions us well for the future. As we've highlighted on the previous slide, we're expecting growth to accelerate as the year progresses following a modest top line showing in the first quarter. We're executing on our commitment in the first quarter, and the integration of Flow Control continues to gain momentum. We completed all of our planned repositioning actions, and standardization roadmaps are being developed and implemented throughout the organization. As we progress with the integration of Flow Control and gain more visibility, we are raising our 2013 synergy expectations to $100 million. Our first quarter performance positions us to deliver on our 2013 commitments, which John will expand upon. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.
John L. Stauch: Thank you, Randy. Please turn to Slide #10, labeled Q2 2013 Pentair Outlook. For Q2, we are initiating revenue guidance of up 3% to 4%. We expect the revenue contribution to remain mixed and, again, led by Water & Fluid, which should be up 5% to 7%. We continue to see high single-digit growth in our North American residential market, which represents approximately 20% of overall Pentair sales and nearly 45% of Water & Fluid sales. Valves & Controls should turn modestly positive in the quarter as near record level backlog, 17% growth in shippable backlog versus Q1, and an easier comparison year-over-year produce revenue expectations of up 1% to 3% for the second quarter. Technical Solutions is still expected to be down year-over-year, as mid-single-digit growth in Thermal Management is not enough to offset continued headwinds in equipment protection. Although average daily sales rates in orders in equipment protection are improving, we do not expect to cross over into year-over-year growth until the third quarter. We're expecting operating income to grow 12% year-over-year and operating margins to expand greater than 100 basis points as standardization and synergy benefits continue to accelerate. Water & Fluid Solutions margins are expected to exceed 15.5%, further evidence of our success in driving PIMS and Lean throughout our businesses. EPS is expected to be up around 17% to $0.88 to $0.91 per share with a tax rate of roughly 25%, interest of roughly $18.5 million and total weighted average shares around 205 million. Q2 is a seasonally strong cash flow quarter for Pentair, and we expect cash to exceed 125% of net income for the quarter. Please turn to Slide #11 labeled Q1 to Q2 Seasonality. For those that have followed Pentair for some time, you know that our second quarter is seasonally our strongest quarter of the year. In the new Pentair, we're expecting the pattern to continue, with the difference being that we expect less of a fall-off in Q3 and Q4 with the inclusion of Valves & Controls and Thermal Management, which both have fairly strong back half as a standard rhythm. Our contribution from our global residential businesses is what drives this Q2 pattern, as the Q2 season is when our distributors and partners ramp up to serve the seasonal demand. The top half of Slide 11 shows you how the normalized seasonality plays out. This would be for the pro forma 2011 and for pro forma 2012. In addition to that normalized pattern, we feel this year, we'll see an incremental bump due to an acceleration of the North American residential market, a larger shippable backlog in Valves & Controls, and specific projects within Water & Fluid infrastructure. On the operating income side, we expect to experience a nice drop-through on incremental revenue, which is really leveraged in our factories and on our operating costs. The Q2 seasonal shipments are usually quite profitable, and volume through these factories should produce a rich mix of profit. In addition to the normalized profit opportunity, we expect a lower mix of profit on the incremental project shipped in Q2, but we also expect at least $15 million more in synergy and standardization benefit versus the first quarter as we continue to ramp up the repositioning savings in specific projects that are driving through the integration and standardization team that we have deployed. So bottom line, we feel confident that our normalized pattern will continue, and we expect to see a very strong Q2 result. Please turn to Slide #12 labeled Integration and Standardization update. For Q1, we exceeded our modest cost takeout goal. This was a big piece of us exceeding our EPS goal and was especially helpful due to the slight shortfall in Valves & Controls revenue. For the full year, we know that we must continue to overdrive the synergies and standardization benefits to help ensure that we could continue to absorb revenue softness if it happens again. For the full year, we are updating our total integration and standardization benefit to at least $100 million for 2013. $80 million of this is coming from cost or repositioning actions that have already been taken, and $20 million of this is coming from expected Lean and sourcing benefits that are already in the pipeline. And actions are expected to read out throughout the second, third and fourth quarters. We continue to fill the productivity pipeline and are getting great winds in sourcing projects -- our stock, castings and electronics on the direct side; and shipping, renegotiating product services and global energy treasure hunts on the indirect side, which have already yielded an expected savings of a $40 million annual run rate. Our Lean projects, especially in legacy Flow Control sites, are accelerating as well. We have trained over 6,000 people and have built great momentum. A few of the examples are our strategy deployment, transformation planning and scorecards, which have helped build the robust Lean savings pipeline. In addition to these efforts, we're also driving Lean enterprise and standardization of ERP platforms, reduction of accounting entities, payroll centers, payable centers and receivable organizations, which are all intended to drive simplicity and a better customer and employee experience while driving significant savings throughout the organization. We have all of these projects and incremental hoppers [ph] and are in the process of creating a master plan for Pentair that will be the main fuel for 2014 and 2015 synergies. Overall, we are very confident in our progress and believe that further upside will provide further contingency in the wake of uncertain overall global markets. Please turn to Slide #13. For Q1, we delivered cash flow slightly ahead of forecast but with still a seasonal usage of $29 million. This was lower than historical usage levels in Q1 at Pentair, but we still feel we can improve on this and generate cash in every quarter of the year. With capital expenditures at 125% of depreciation, we're still investing heavily in the overall efficiency of our factories and systems and have to ensure that we continue to put creativity ahead of capital, especially in our new Flow Control businesses. Total depreciation and amortization of $320 million, plus approximately $30 million of noncash stock compensation, provides a pretty nice cushion for net income to cash and one which we believe we could take advantage of as we start to significantly generate cash flow to pay off debt, accelerate buybacks, put the capital work in the form of acquisitions in our best-performing businesses. We expect debt levels to remain around $2.6 billion, flat with year-end and we are anticipating having utilized or purchased $825 million of the approved $1.2 billion of buyback by the end of 2013. Please turn to my last slide, Slide #14. I will keep this pretty brief so we will have time for your specific questions. Even with some choppiness in some end markets, we're keeping our overall full year outlook consistent with our previous forecast. Sales, operating income, operating margins, net income and EPS are all the same. While some markets like industrial, municipal and energy give us some cause for concern, we have seen other markets like food and beverage, agriculture and North American residential show great signs of resiliency. We'll be evaluating our market outlooks and performance in Q2, and we'll update the full year, if necessary, after we conclude our seasonally important quarter. With that, I will turn it back to Randy. Randy?
Randall J. Hogan: Thanks, John. And if could turn to Page 15. We'll go through a few of the things John just covered, just to wrap it up before questions. What I thought I'd say in closing is that the first quarter really does position us well to deliver on our 2013 commitments. The top line remains mixed. We have strong backlogs in energy and food and beverage, and we continue to see strengthening in the North American residential market. As we stated earlier, the residential recovery brings with it strong drop through to the bottom line given the prolonged downturn we experienced, the process improvements we've made, and the amount of cost we've taken out of the business over the last 6 years. Our integration and standardization efforts continue to build momentum. And we now expect $100 million in synergies versus our prior target of $90 million. We're pleased that the adoption PIMS throughout the Flow Control businesses, has exceeded our initial expectations and we're happy with the creation of the new Pentair. With that, operator, we'll take our first question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Graham from Jefferies.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: I was just wondering. Last quarter, you gave us a really cool number. And what it was, was, that you said that by -- when you had reported at that time, you had identified 75% of the $90 million of synergies. And I was just kind of wondering if you can kind of give us a similar number updated for the first quarter on the $100 million.
John L. Stauch: Yes, I'd say that the $100 million is 100% identified, Scott.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Great. The other question was kind of simple. I know that you're seeing kind of a choppy energy market. I was wondering, could you tell us what your percent of sales, energy-wise -- and specifically, oil and gas is what I'm referring to -- is North America versus rest of world?
Randall J. Hogan: I don't have that right at my fingertips.
John L. Stauch: No, Scott, I don't know if I have that on top of my fingertips. Because I think there's a breakdown in 2 categories. And our Thermal business deal with a lot of what's going on in the oil sands, which would be up in Canada. And then our global Valves & Controls business is pretty spread across the entire globe, as far as oil and gas. I can certainly...
Randall J. Hogan: And equipment protection is skewed. The energy is skewed to the U.S.
John L. Stauch: But it's probably a good number to know, and we'll see if we can do that.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Well, I guess maybe more succinctly, are you sensing that the choppiness in the orders that you're seeing is more of a function of the North American markets or the rest of the world?
John L. Stauch: I mean, I think what we're seeing is, and it's probably the spread and certainly what's going on within the relative oil and gas, either Brent or West Texas, and then how that compares with what's going on in the oil sands. We're seeing a pause, if you will, in some of those large projects as that all plays out. But we still are seeing a healthy capacity expansion with oil and gas.
Randall J. Hogan: And I'd say it is skewed to a little more softness here. The Middle East, Southeast Asia, that remains strong. But again, we skew because of the legacy Pentair. We skew to more in the North America.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg from Vertical Research.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Just -- so on synergies. So you raised the targets for 2013. You kept $230 million by 2015. It feels as though you've identified almost incremental savings rather than more of a pull-forward. Is there a reason to believe that it is a pull-forward rather than an incremental? Or maybe you can just touch on that.
John L. Stauch: I think we're very confident in what we can see through 2013. And obviously, the businesses probably have a number greater than what I shared with you. We believe and have always believed that there's opportunities to increase the $230 million. And right now, we're trying to close the gap on what we need for 2014 and ensure that we've got the $230 million and then we'd drive for upsides beyond the $230 million.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Okay. And just back on the Valves & Controls project work, just -- I know that's a business you guys were trying to get your hands around. Had you guys taken a look at the backlog that's existed within Valves & Controls? A lot of the pump players, well, on the pump side, who were selling into a lot of the same projects, particularly in the Middle East over the last couple of years, have experienced a lot of margin pressure that has kind of played out. But I believe that the Valves are really a leader in the sales cycle. I was curious, as you kind of look at the backlog on the Valves & Controls side, do you anticipate that you are going to be realizing some low-margin, lower margin than normal backlog within that business that might mask some improvements from operations that's kind of yet to bleed through. Can you touch on that, please?
Randall J. Hogan: Yes, on that subject, one of the things that we've done and I'm really impressed with the Valve leadership team that's come aboard, I mean, the legacy Valve leadership team. As we've focused on the strategy and simplified the organization, one of the things that, that team identified and we certainly supported, was more discipline around bidding projects with good margin. They had -- there was probably $25 million worth of sales we could have had in the quarter, but we didn't bid it because the margins weren't very good. So we think that over time that discipline is going to lead to a better margin in the backlog. There's a few projects in the backlog which have low margins that we know will read out. Some of them read out in the first quarter, maybe a couple read out in the second quarter. But we think that the team has really got their arms around it well and the disciplines are already improved.
John L. Stauch: So it's a metric -- just to follow up on what Randy said, it's a metric that we've scrubbed, we can basically measure. And it's one that we've actually asked the business to expect a lower outcome, as Randy mentioned, as we work through making sure we've got all the right cost initiatives in place.
Randall J. Hogan: Yes, it's not just about shares. It's about profitable growth, so that's the discipline that they have in place there.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Halloran from Robert W. Baird.
Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: So just on the Valves side. Could you talk about what the quoting and bidding activity looks like and then also maybe provide a full unit order number? I know you gave it by the 4 pieces, but I'm also curious if you could give the overall one.
John L. Stauch: Yes, I mean, overall orders in Valves & Controls, were up about 3% sequentially versus Q4, so that's a metric that we're keeping our eyes on how we're doing as we kind of look through the quarters there.
Randall J. Hogan: And the book to bill we gave, the 1.1, was overall.
John L. Stauch: And you know for us in the quarter, the overall trade orders are right around $600 million overall.
Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. But the quoting and bidding activity side of things, how does that look and what are the customers seeing there?
John L. Stauch: I think you've to go by segment. And as Randy mentioned, I mean, I think oil and gas is in the -- what we would -- I don't know if we call it a pause, but there's a lot of projects that are out there. And the timing of those projects feel like they're a little bit slipping. But the projects...
Randall J. Hogan: But the activity level is still pretty good.
John L. Stauch: It's still pretty good.
Randall J. Hogan: Yes. Mining is way off.
John L. Stauch: Mining is starting to taper off. Process and power are starting to get better.
Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Makes sense. And then, the follow-up from me is a follow-up from Scott's question on the -- how much of the $100 million is visible at this point? I know the repositioning actions have already been completed in the first quarter. Is that the same for the sourcing in the Lean side as well, that the actions have been completed and it's just going to take time to materialize? Or are the actions and the work still in front of you?
Randall J. Hogan: The actions are fairly visible. And the way those work is, as you get productivity in sourcing, it has to go through the balance sheet. So you don't get it right away. So against that $20 million of, I think it was sourcing, you could imagine that at a run rate basis. An annualized run rate basis is or going to be twice that.
John L. Stauch: What we're guarding against, Mike -- I mean, if I gave you the raw number, it would be substantially higher. But what Randy and I want to make sure that we have is that you don't want -- there's a productivity column and then what we synergy and standardization column. And we've got to make sure the productivity column stays positive as well.
Randall J. Hogan: And we don't duplicate.
John L. Stauch: And we're not putting everything into the synergy or standardization efforts because we needed the holistic number to read out.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray from Citi Research.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I might have missed this, but could you clarify on the backlog when you're now highlighting the shippable backlog being up 17%, will that be a number that we'll be able to back into or that you'll provide on a go-forward basis? And then when you talk about what's shippable for the second quarter, what's the mix look like? Because you've got no sense of what's going to be coming through for the second quarter. But what's the implied margin there?
John L. Stauch: Yes, Deane. As we got through Q1, the business started to share with us kind of the way we need to think about shippable backlog, especially as you take a look at how they performed last Q1, and then if you look at their last Q2, there was a different Valves & Controls. So the shippable backlog is a number that we feel is meaningful, which means, if you could ship everything to the dates that are in the system, that's what you'd ship to. Now obviously, projects move back and forth. It is a number that we think is meaningful, and therefore, probably a number we will share with you on a regular basis. Within there, Randy highlighted there are a couple of projects in the oil and gas area that will ship at lower margins, which I've called out in that seasonality bridge that we did in one of the slides. But overall, I mean, we're starting to build a pretty healthy backlog because as we get power and process into the backlog, those traditionally have higher margins than what we've experienced in oil and gas and mining.
Randall J. Hogan: So think the 17% in the dialogue we're having with the team is very helpful. It's 17% -- going into the second quarter that number was 17% higher than it was going in the first quarter. And we missed shipping a little bit from where we thought we'd be in the first quarter. So it gives us more confidence that we'll hit the number we expect in the second quarter. That's how we use it.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Great. And then, maybe just in terms of the upside versus our expectations on North American residential, maybe you can kind of take us through the next layer of detail on North American pull. Were there any special promotions? Is there -- was there an early buy? And what's your sense of inventory in the channel?
Randall J. Hogan: Well, I think we might have mentioned this in the last phone -- on the fourth quarter call, that early buy was as strong as we ever saw it. Some of that certainly shipped in the first quarter. But frankly, the regular buy was strong, given how bad the weather has been. It's not just been bad here. It's been bad in a lot of the areas, cooler spring, later start to the season. So the strength we're seeing in that aquatics business is really quite encouraging, and the industry is quite buoyant, pun intended. Then the pool builds are up.
John L. Stauch: Pool builds are up. We saw our first quarter of positive revenue growth in our valves and tanks in the water softener market. And we're continuing to see pretty nice sales now in the residential components of Flow. And we have a little bit of flooding, which is happening right now, which is always also usually a pretty good indication for that business.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois from Longbow Research.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: The first question is just with respect to food and bev. You saw some demand in the first quarter from projects that were delayed the end of last year, providing a nice bump in revenues. So has a lot of that pent-up demand been worked through in 1Q? Or are we expecting to see some additional project shipments because of the delays that you saw at the end of last year?
Randall J. Hogan: No, those I think were specific delays as some of the companies got concerned about -- I wouldn't want to blame it on the uncertainty or on the election, but there seemed to be a lot of clogged capital at the end of the year last year and some of that broke loose. But the bidding activity has remained strong, and the food and beverage business is a growth business globally. And we have some -- we have a really good position and some unique technologies, not just in beer but in soft drinks and CO2 recovery. And we've picked up a couple, as we mentioned, last time, we picked up another big, multimillion-dollar project because we have the broader scope now for the industrial valves with the hygienic valves and the filtration system. So we did get that benefit in the first quarter of the delayed projects, but the backlog is actually up.
John L. Stauch: And just to add on to what Randy said, I mean, we've always been strong in beer and certainly, our Beer Membrane is a product that's specced into a lot of global breweries, and those breweries are in places like Africa and Vietnam and Malaysia, and there's a huge growth regarding that. But the product that was in alpha and beta state test in 2011 and '12 was our CO2 recovery system. And for 2013, we'll have shipments in excess of $25 million on that product, and that product is becoming a standard product.
Randall J. Hogan: Which is up 10x.
John L. Stauch: Which is up 10x. And we're seeing some substantial revenue and income coming through on those particular projects.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. That's good to hear. And then, I guess, just switching on price cost, if you could provide your view as you look out over the next 3 quarters of the year, where that stands. You made some nice improvements in the first quarter. Are you anticipating any cost pressures from raw materials moving forward, or any benefits in it?
Randall J. Hogan: When we look at the activity in the mining segment, we think that that's a good indicator that there's not going to be a lot of commodity pressure, not a lot of commodity pricing pressure. So we don't think inflation goes higher from here. Employee raises are higher than they were, but we think we have that well managed. But John, I don't know if you'd add.
John L. Stauch: No, I'd agree with that. The pricing is somewhere, going to be greater than 100 basis points, and we think we can do better there. I think our new businesses from Flow Control are starting to put in some of the same price disciplines that we've had in legacy Pentair. And we continue to think we'll make progress throughout this year and into next year.
Randall J. Hogan: And if I could add. John mentioned earlier that we want to make sure we don't double comp between base productivity plus the synergistic activities. And in one way we've done -- that one reason we're able to raise that is that those 2 buckets perform well. And when they perform well in the first quarter, it's usually -- it's a good sign for the year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker from Sanford Bernstein.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Just looking at Page 3 again, if you could, that 220 points of price productivity and mix, you've referenced it a little bit, but I'd love to get a bit more detail here on the productivity angle versus the mix side. You just talked about pricing. So what was the real productivity side of this? And you mentioned the 2 buckets. I want to get a sense, given how important this is to the story, just give us a sense for the real productivity improvement, if you could.
John L. Stauch: Sure. I mean, I think, first of all, if you take a look at where we were with price in the quarter, total Pentair, we got about a point price. One of the things that's netted in productivity is mix. Mix was about a negative 30 to 40 basis points. Inflation was about a negative 1.5-ish percent, Steve. And then on the productivity side, we were net $3 million to $4 million beyond what we said we got in the IST component, or the synergies. And that was inclusive of, if you noticed, a higher corporate spend, which is partially a quarterly timing. We always spend a little bit more in Q1 because of just certain fees that come in, in Q1 versus the rest of the year. But we also we're continuing to invest in what we're doing on the tax rate, what we needed to do around the suite [ph] structure and what we need to do to ensure that we're spending and investing in what the businesses are driving, to drive the standardization activity. So when Randy mentioned that we feel good about where we are in Q1, that's in light of incremental investment as well to drive the back half synergies.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay, all right. And then when you look at Valves & Controls, I visited a number of those plants before you took them over, and I often thought of them as the gift that should keep on giving as you keep looking for repo and other opportunities to lean them out and drive efficiency. What kind of -- what are you starting? Now that it's a couple of quarters, what are you seeing operationally as you're getting to know these plants and the supply chain associated with them?
Randall J. Hogan: Well, as you know because you've been in the plants, Valves & Control is a great product, great quality, like the people a lot, too much complexity and too much differences between plants. So as I mentioned, we've put into 8 full-time operating leaders, basically, if you will, Lean aficionados from legacy Pentair over into the business. They've been very well accepted into the team, and if anything, they're being drawn on even more than I would have hoped. We identified the 3 most underperforming factories, and we've replaced the plant managers in all 3. And we have Lean rangers that we flowed locally from -- in other words, European -- from European Lean rangers from legacy Pentair to the European plants, same in the U.S., same in Latin America, in order to drive the basics of Lean and start driving that common language that we know is going to help simplify. The opportunity in delivery is enormous. It's not in this industry. Valves & Controls is not an industry that is known for their on-time delivery. We have very ambitious targets. If you recall or followed us long enough to know that in our aquatics business, we used to have deliveries that -- I hate to say it, but we're frequently below 60% on time. And now, they're over 95% on time. It's one of the reasons that we keep gaining market share there. Valves & Controls isn't that bad. It's not below 60%. But it's -- as an industry, it's not great. That drives a lot of waste in terms of inventory. That drives a lot of waste in terms of customer planning. It drives a lot of waste in terms of plant planning. And so, we know it works. We know Lean works, and Lean is the way we're going to simplify the business, and so that's our approach to it. And our goal, it took us 10 years to get Pentair where it is, and I want to be able to get Valves & Controls there in 3. But 10 years was hunt and peck. We have a plan now. So it's ambitious, but I think the team is up to it. I'm very impressed with the Valves & Controls team.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Pokrzywinski from MKM Partners.
Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division: Can we just talk first about the ramp in IST as we head into '14? I guess with visibility into that $100 million at 100%, presumably, you have some level of visibility into a bridge between the $100 million and the $230 million.
Randall J. Hogan: Yes.
Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division: And I guess, how much would you say you have on what kind of number, order of magnitude for '14? I understand that it's still early but I guess, any way to help calibrate whether it's a half-step jump from the $100 million all the way up, or if we get an accelerated realization? Just any kind of color there I think would be helpful.
John L. Stauch: Yes, so, Josh, the number I feel obviously best about, from a number perspective, is obviously the repositioning and the restructuring numbers because they're -- when people leave, those costs permanently leave the organization, and that was incremental to anything we were doing at Pentair. So that's an $80 million benefit this year, and that's well over $100 million next year, given the timing when those people are leaving. So 100% confidence on that number, and it's a known trackable number that doesn't get tied up between this productivity expectation and the synergy. To give you a number, the synergy targets for 2013 around the sourcing and Lean exceed $40 million versus what we're saying is $20 million. And they have to work their way through inventory and they have to work their way through the P&L. And we've got to make sure that they're incremental to what would have been in the base plans anyway. When you take a look at that number from '14, and it probably shouldn't be a surprise, lean builds momentum. And as Randy was talking about when we did this deal, having 100 factories all signed up to $1 million of Lean benefit or $100 million, is not a number that would be insurmountable. So everybody has internal stretch targets that they're driving to around those ranges, and so when you look at the productivity decks and the synergy decks, it's very encouraging. That being said, those same people would've been working on base productivity. So we want to make sure that we're not double counting the synergies in lieu of what we would've got in base productivity anyway. And that's why we're a little bit more conservative and cautious on our outlook. And as I think we get through these and we look at the examples I gave you, bar stock, and negotiations that are in the rack, [ph] those are all real. And as we get more and more confident on what's actually a permanent cost out, we'll certainly share that, and then we can have more confidence on what the '14 and '15 numbers will be.
Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division: Okay. I think that's helpful. And then just one clarifying point, maybe you touched on in the prepared remarks, the $825 million in buyback that you're signed up for this year, I noticed that the share count at 205 million looks like either that is very second half or even fourth quarter biased. Is that a new number? I know the 205 million is unchanged, but I'm just trying to understand: is there an element of conservatism or just very late positioning of that buyback in the year?
John L. Stauch: It's actually accelerated from our original views, and we're definitely planning now to have everything complete by the end of '14 and we'd only have $375 million to go next year. As you know, if our debt levels allow, it's in our best interest to do it sooner rather than later. And so we're...
Randall J. Hogan: But where we are is where we planned to be at this point. We accelerated before, as John just said, and we announced that last quarter. And we did the $140 million in this quarter, which is about what we thought we would do. And we thought we'd do more in the middle of the year, in the second half. One reason is, we're disciplined about cash flow, and we didn't know what our first quarter cash flow was going to look like because the Pentair legacy typically was a big sucking sound on cash in the first quarter, and it the minus $80 million or so last year. So we wanted to see what the new -- so we did what we planned to do.
Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division: Okay, so $825 million is not a new number, quarter-over-quarter?
John L. Stauch: No, no. Just sharing where we are as a status update, Josh.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Just on Thermal, can you -- as you look at -- do you expect the mix dynamic to continue, i.e. the infrastructure stays weak, and the other businesses continue? And then you made the comment on oil and gas in a kind of a pause in order of quoting activity. Is that more of a Valves & Controls comment, or does that flow over to Thermal as well?
John L. Stauch: I'll take the first half. I think, when you look at technical solutions, I mean you take thermal and you take equipment protection. Thermal had a great quarter. And our technical -- or our equipment protection businesses is struggling through 2 markets, infrastructure and a slower industrial vertical. Our comparisons in equipment protection get easier in the second half of the year, and we're also focused on the food and beverage market, the energy market and an opportunity for our products to be in those spaces. As far as the Thermal into the oil and gas markets, we're really specifically in the cold weather climates or areas where we see a desert-like environment, where heating is necessary in the process. And those projects are enormous, but they're also dependent on certain price points. And that's what we're constantly monitoring in that side of the business.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: So have you seen slowing in the quoting activity in that side of the business?
John L. Stauch: We've seen a lumpiness, meaning, we -- [indiscernible] was a project that was canceled in its entirety.
Randall J. Hogan: Which we had -- the project we had worked on.
John L. Stauch: We had worked on that. Now there's another project that's starting to come up in its place, which will be in a different location. And then there's large projects or a series of large projects in Canada that are obviously dependent on where the oil spreads are. So, yes, these are slowed, no doubt about it.
Randall J. Hogan: They're slow off what I would call our high expectations, but I think the business will still do well. One area that slowed in the first quarter, and for the Thermal business, is that they're fairly large in Scandinavian countries for snowmelt and in commercial and residential. And Scandinavia had been a bright spot in Europe, in Western Europe in terms of growth, and we've actually seen even Scandinavia slow down now, which is more of a -- that's a comment that I would draw across all of Europe, not just what we saw on Thermal, but it's a good measure for it.
John L. Stauch: So Jeff, just to follow up. I mean, one of the reasons we went back and restated the pro forma as we did without the projects in it, for these solutions, as when those larger projects come, those should be nice incremental upside for Pentair.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: And the mid-single-digit growth you see in that business, is that x the big project comp?
John L. Stauch: Yes.
Randall J. Hogan: It's over the pro forma baseline that we set out.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: I'm just wondering about the Europe linearity, if there's anything curious there, or if you'd even call it may be stable at this point, just kind of an overall complexion.
Randall J. Hogan: I would love it to be linear and flat. I would not really lie. It's really a mixed bag. We've seen our equipment protection business, things they bottomed out. Residential seems to be finding new plateaus on our further downward slide. And so I don't really have a lot of faith that we've seen the bottom yet in the U.S. And even in Eastern Europe, which had been pretty robust, even that is feeling a little softer than it did, at least, when I look at orders. So, we factored all that into our outlook and that is piece -- a piece of the mix look. Middle East remains strong. Latin America is not bad. So it's really interesting. And I saw and read in an article over the weekend that the U.S. is the new fast-growth market. From those words to God's ears, I hope that's true. But certainly, the place we're seeing the best growth is U.S. residential right now
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then just wondering on your acquisition pipeline appetite and how you're thinking about here, and the range of deal sizes that you might be open to, considering the share repurchase commitments.
John L. Stauch: Yes, I mean, I think it goes down to what businesses are operating in a high level and have great standardization and are prepared for acquisitions and a couple of those that we said are -- certainly, our aquatics systems business, especially around aquaculture and thermal management right now, as areas that we'd like to put more effort behind, and eventually, Valves & Controls. But that being said, right now, we're focused on what we're doing on integration and things that we do, in lieu of what we're doing on the buyback, would have to be incremental to what the buyback would yield. So I don't think we're feeling like we're missing out on anything at the moment at all. We're certainly making sure that our pipelines are robust, that we're prepared, we're ready to answer, but we think our plan right now is the right plan.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Crédit Suisse.
Hamzah Mazari - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I just had 2 quick clarification questions. Number one, is there any change in Q2 on infrastructure and industrial end markets versus Q1, or is it more of the same? And second clarification, did you guys say that you guys are front-loading the buyback, is that right?
Randall J. Hogan: Well, we said in the last quarter, the multi-year stock buyback, we accelerated, but we announced that 6 months ago. We said that basically, we were going to move everything up about a year, so that's not new news. And we've been going according to plan since then. So the acceleration was the stock buyback we did in the fourth quarter, and that was the acceleration. The rest is -- and everything else pulled up the same way. In terms of industrial, we saw -- we've seen an increase in daily order rates in our core equipment protection, industrial and as we mentioned, Valves & Controls and other big processes within industrial. We've seen that stabilize, so I wouldn't say we expect industrial to be stronger in the second quarter, meaningfully stronger than in the first quarter. But certainly by the second half, we'd expect that, as we said in the outlook. And what was the other -- Hamzah, what was the other question?
Hamzah Mazari - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: On the infrastructure side, any change there?
Randall J. Hogan: Oh, yes. Infrastructure, in general -- in infrastructure, we obviously put water projects but we also put the telecom projects and rail projects and the like. And they just -- it seems to be challenged everywhere. We mentioned that our backlog has been staying at a fairly high level for us in the U.S. in water. But I wouldn't read that broadly because we're a niche player in that. We play, we work strong and we seem to be doing okay in it, but it's not real huge growth for us. It's just a bright spot in what I would call generally a global infrastructure slowdown. The RO projects and the large water products in the rest of the world are just not breaking free.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Drab from William Blair.
Brian Drab - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Just first, a quick question on the tax rate. You mentioned that you hit the 25% level. The effective tax rate you reported was 28%. Is the difference there just this divestiture of ad spend or is something else going on there?
John L. Stauch: Yes, the 25% reflects what we think the full year ongoing rate will be, and the difference are those things related to either the asset sales or one-time impacts, the true-ups related to the overall Pentair structure.
Brian Drab - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: And in the first quarter, the adjusted tax rate was 25%, did I hear that correctly?
John L. Stauch: That is correct, correct. That's what I also think the full year will be. Correct.
Brian Drab - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: And then on the residential side, you mentioned -- you made a couple of comments on how the residential filtration, residential pump business is doing. Can you talk a little bit more, maybe a little bit more specifics, on how those businesses grew in the first quarter, what the order rates were?
Randall J. Hogan: As I mentioned, aquatics was double-digit.
Brian Drab - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: And in aquatics, I think -- and I don't want to make you repeat yourself in aquatics, but I'm looking more on the filtration and pump side.
Randall J. Hogan: Yes, filtration and pump in North America only or globally?
Brian Drab - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: North America, given it's weighted towards that market. And if you have any global comments, that would be great.
John L. Stauch: We had high single digits in residential in our Flow business. And as I mentioned earlier, we're just slightly positive in our filtration -- or our tanks and valves. And then in our filtration platform, we were high single digits.
Randall J. Hogan: Operator, how many questions are there left because we're at the hour?
Operator: There are 2.
Randall J. Hogan: Okay, we'll take those 2 and then wrap up.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Rose from Wedbush.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: A follow-up question on -- maybe a little point of clarification on the restructuring charge in the $28 million. Can you walk us through the buckets for that? And expectations for restructuring charges in Q2 and how that drives your cost saving goals?
John L. Stauch: Yes, so where we are right now, the $28 million concludes everything that would get us to the $80 million for '13 and then that slightly higher than the $100 million that I mentioned on an ongoing rate. And we would expect, if we could, to do a little bit more in Q2. And we're looking for everything because the inventory step-up in the backlog and the customer amortization concludes the end of Q2.
Randall J. Hogan: For [indiscernible].
John L. Stauch: And as we said, in Q3 and Q4, we'd expect to have a gap reported number, and that be consistent with adjusted. So any incremental restructuring would be assumed to be an incremental benefit to synergies and/or to next year's synergy numbers.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: So to be clear, if we do to see any more restructurings in Q2, that means the synergy target for the $100 million target goes up?
John L. Stauch: It could be the $100 million, or it could be next year's 14 [ph] depending on the timing of the projects.
Randall J. Hogan: Yes, I think about it in terms of the $230 million that we put out as the overall target.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Okay, and then was this largely severance? Footprint reduction? Can you kind of break it down?
John L. Stauch: Primarily, G&A structure, severance and tweaking of our structures as it relates to the models that Randy is trying to drive across the globe.
Operator: And your final question comes from the line of Chip Moore.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division: For the energy-related business overall, could you give us a sense how that breaks down upstream, versus downstream, oil versus gas and then also the relative mix for mining and power?
John L. Stauch: Well, that's a big question. I think if we -- let me take the second half of that first, because it's an easier knowable answer. If we take a look at where we are from oil and gas, just north of $800-ish million, $825 million in total for Pentair. Power is roughly just north of $425 million for us. Mining is in the low 200s, and that would be in the Valves & Controls space. And if we looked at the total portfolio, we've always said we're pretty diverse from the Valves & Controls standpoint, so we're about 1/3 upstream, we're about 1/3 mid, and 1/3 downstream, plus or minus a little bit on that equation for 2012, and those are '12 numbers.
Randall J. Hogan: All right. Thank you, all, for your attention, and we'll be talking. Operator, can you give the replay information and we'll sign off. Operator?
Operator: If you'd like to listen to the replay of the conference, you can dial (800) 585-8637 or (855) 859-2056, and it will be in until the 23rd of May for you to listen to.
Randall J. Hogan: Thank you, all.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Don, and I will be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Pentair Q4 2012 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Mr. Jim Lucas, you may begin your conference, sir.
Jim Lucas: All right. Thanks, Don. And welcome to Pentair's fourth quarter 2012 earnings conference call. We're glad you could join us today. I'm Jim Lucas, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me today is Randy Hogan, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Stauch, our Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, we will provide details on our fourth quarter and full year 2012 performance, as well as our first quarter and full year 2013 outlook as outlined in this morning’s release. Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as the risks outlined in Pentair's 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, and today's release. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today, and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results. Today's webcast is accompanied by a presentation, which can be found in the Investors section of Pentair's website. We will reference these slides throughout our prepared remarks. All references today will be on an adjusted basis, unless otherwise indicated, for which the non-GAAP financials are reconciled in the appendix of the presentation. We will be sure to reserve time for questions-and-answers after our prepared remarks and recognition there are other call this morning we will target to be done in just about an hour. With that, I’d like to request that you limit your questions to one and follow up, and get back in the queue for further questions, so that everyone has an opportunity to ask their questions. I will now turn the call over to Randy.
Randy Hogan: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with our fourth quarter performance which is on slide three. This marks the first quarter for Pentair since we successfully closed our merger with Flow Control at the end of September last year. As you saw in this morning’s press release, there are quite a number of moving pieces with the size of its merger. Our objective is to give you needed insights into our company, so we will provide detail on how the merger cost impact the fourth quarter results, and John will cover some of the larger one-time events in his prepared remarks. I will discuss our operating results on an adjusted basis to better address the core operating performance of our businesses. Before I begin to discuss the fourth quarter results in detail, I want to spend the moment explaining why the numbers are presented in the manner they are. For the full company results, the fourth quarter of 2012 includes Flow Control’s results combined with Pentair, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2011 which includes of course only Pentair results. As we discuss the segment results, however, we will present the results on a pro forma adjusted basis as if the results were on apples-to-apples comparative basis. You will find reconciliations of this for the segments in the appendix at the end of the presentation. With that here are the numbers. Fourth quarter revenue increased 103% on a reported basis, but excluding the impact of Flow Control and FX core revenue was flat in the quarter. Adjusted operating income grew 59%, while adjusted operating margins contracted 240 basis points to 8.5%. Majority of the margin compression relates to transition costs incurred during the quarter, which we discussed in detail on our Investor Day in November. As a reminder these transition costs includes such things like branding and signage, packaging, inventory and warranty adjustments. Adjusted EPS came in as expected with the decrease 16% year-over-year due to the impact of the deal, particularly the doubling in the share count from the comparable period one year ago. Adjusted free cash flow for the year was over $300 million and exceeded 100% of adjusted net income again. The topline and adjusted operating income were in line with our prior guidance. We make good progress in building the action plans to deliver the $90 million in synergies we outlined in November. In addition, the first $400 million of our share repurchase will be completed by the end of January. So, overall, we’re underway as expected. Now, let’s turn to slide four review of Water & Fluid Solutions segment performance. Water & Fluid Solutions sales were up 1% as reported and on organic basis since FX was only a modest headwind in the quarter. As a reminder, Water & Fluid Solutions represents the legacy water segment for Pentair plus the West business from Flow Control. Overall, price delivered the growth in the quarter as volumes were flat. The residential commercial vertical which represents roughly half of the segment grew 2% in the quarter as we are seeing continued signs of our North American residential recovery. While the growth in the fourth quarter in North American was modest, distributor inventory levels are relatively low and overall demand seems to be getting healthier. Western Europe continued to be a challenge, particularly due to distributors maintaining lean inventory levels and having minimal order activity at the end of the year. Within Food & Beverage which accounts for approximately 15% of Water & Fluid Solutions, we saw continued low single-digit growth in the food service sector, while several beverage projects were postponed at the end of year as many of our customers were watching their capital spending at the end of the year. Infrastructure, which is nearly 25% of Water & Fluid Solutions was down 3% in the quarter as an absence of global desalination projects has hampered our European infrastructure business. In the U.S., however, we have continued to see healthy gains in our backlog, which was up 5% in the fourth quarter following double-digit growth in the prior two quarters As a reminder, we’ve not seen much of a rebound in project activity but the break and fix category continues to improve. We believe our strong backlog position in North American infrastructure bodes well for growth in the first half of 2013. The right half of the page shows fourth quarter Water & Fluid operating profits and margins. Water and Fluid adjusted operating margins contracted 250 basis points to 7.5%, as we accelerated transition costs in the fourth quarter to position us better as this year begins. Absent the transition costs in the quarter, price and productivity continued to offset inflation. In summary, Water and Fluid Solutions exited 2012 with some potential tailwinds emerging in North American Residential and infrastructure, and we expect the actions taken in the fourth quarter will put the segment in a good position to build momentum on operating margin expansion in 2013. Now, I’ll turn to slide five for review of our Valves & Controls segment performance. This is the first quarter for Pentair’s Valves & Controls segment. Overall, we are pleased with the results delivered, following the strong last quarter’s part of Tyco and their first quarter’s part of Pentair. Revenue grew 3% organically on solid volume gains. The energy vertical grew 2% mostly on strength in oil and gas. Within the industrial vertical, the top line was up modestly as several projects were delayed, which was a recurring theme we saw in many of our project related businesses in the fourth quarter. We’ve not seen any cancellations, but as I mentioned when discussing water, customers seem to be holding on tightly with our capital in the fourth quarter. And we would expect many of these projects to resume in the first half of 2013. The right half of the page shows fourth quarter Valves & Controls operating profits and margins. Valves & Controls operating margins were down 40 basis points to 7.6%, owing to mix and the acceleration on transition costs that were mentioned at the beginning of my remarks this morning. In summary, Valves & Controls first quarter as part of Pentair went well as the fundamentals for their business remain intact and the integration and standardization efforts made good progress, particularly with regards to training on PIMS. Now, let’s move to slide six for look at the orders and backlog for Valves & Controls. Not only is this our first quarter with Valves & Controls as a segment, but this also marks our first time discussing orders and backlogs for the segment. As you can see on slide six, the Valves & Controls backlog is broken down in four key markets, three of which formed were energy vertical, oil and gas, power and mining and one our industrial vertical which is the process business. Backlog grew 2% to a near record $1.4 billion. With oil and gas, backlog remained strong globally but orders declined to the mid-teens rate due to project delays and a tough year-over-year comparison. Mining, one of small piece of Valves & Controls saw strong double-digit growth in orders. The power business saw decline in orders, but the outlook there points to a pickup globally as 2013 progresses. Finally, backlog within process remain relatively steady, our orders grew modestly. Now, let’s move to slide seven for a review of Technical Solutions. Technical Solutions comprises Pentair’s legacy equipment protection business and Flow Controls Thermal Management business. Sales for the segment grew 1%, led by strength in energy and seasonal strengths with Thermal Management business, as distributor stocking occurs prior to the weather getting really cold. Industrial declined 1%, as inventory destocking continued for many of equipment protections customers. In addition, this quarter mark the end of a large project within Thermal Management. The right half of the page shows fourth quarter Technical Solutions’ operating profits and margins. Technical Solutions operating margins were flat at 17.4%, owing to positive contributions from price, productivity and mix which helped mitigate transition costs in the quarter. While we expect the top line to remain challenge in industrial, it remains good runway in margins and we expect overall improvement in Technical Solution as the year progresses. Now, let’s turn to slide eight. For the full-year 2012, sales grew 28% on a reported basis largely due to the contribution from Flow Controls for all of the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating margins contracted 60 basis points for the full-year to 11.1%, as the aforementioned transition costs in the fourth quarter were spent to help better position our businesses to deliver on our targets in 2013. Adjusted EPS were relatively flat for the full year given the dilutive impact of the share count doubling, following our transformational acquisition of Flow Control. For the full-year, adjusted free cash flow as I mentioned earlier was just over $300 million and exceeded 100% of net income. We believe the strong backlog in Valves & Controls and Water and Fluid Solutions infrastructure business are encouraging entering 2013. Further, we believe continued strength in global energy and a rebound in North American Residential also offer positive indications for growth to accelerate as 2013 progresses. Now, let’s turn to slide nine. This slide is a comparison of the top line growth components in 2012 on a pro forma basis, as both Pentair and Flow Control have been together for the entire year and what we expect the growth components to be in 2013. As you can see, we are expecting a little less contribution from volume in 2013, but FX should be less of a headwind and we are anticipating some top line synergies to begin to be realized in this New Year. Overall, the growth components remained similar from 2012 to 2013. On slide 10, we wanted to offer a similar look at operating income growth as we presented on the prior slide, when looking at the top line growth components. The key takeaway in this slide is that we expect our base businesses would be up for the full year, but the real boost will come as we deliver on our targeted $90 million of synergies. The result is well over a 100 basis points of anticipated margin expansion as synergies read out. Now, let’s move to slide 11 where we discuss our 2013 expectations. In November at our Investor Day, we laid out our initial expectations for 2013, which we are affirming today. For the full-year 2013, we are expecting sales to be up 3% to 5% to approximately $7.6 billion. As mentioned previously, energy and North American Residential are two of the verticals where we see continued positive trends. Fast growth regions are still growing, and we are excited about several areas such as the Middle East where our presence has grown as a result of bringing these two organizations together. Well, we expect Western Europe will remain a challenge, we should see some easing on the foreign exchange headwinds from 2012. We continued to target $950 million in adjusted operating income and roughly 20% growth in adjusted operating margins approaching 12.5%, driven in large part by the fourth quarter repositioning actions and the synergies we’ve discussed both at the Investor Day and in today's call. As highlighted in the prior slide, we expect our base businesses position to deliver near double-digit operating income growth and synergies will drive additional upside. Our adjusted EPS guidance remains in a range of $3.10 to $3.30, or 22% to 30% growth for the full year. In addition to strong operating income growth, we are forecasting a 25% tax rate and continued benefit from our share repurchase activities. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.
John Stauch: Thank you, Randy. Please turn to slide number 12, labeled reported to adjusted 2012 items. As result of the merger and integration activities, Q4 and full-year 2012 results include a little bit of noise. Therefore, we want to provide some additional clarity around those items so you can better understand our adjusted operating performance. As a reminder, as Randy mentioned earlier, the key financial numbers by quarter and by reporting segments are included in the press release for 2011 and 2012, excluding the impact of these items. Our adjusted EPS for 2012, which reflects three quarters of Legacy Pentair alone plus one quarter including Legacy Pentair and the Flow Control acquisition were $2.39 for the year. Acquisition related costs, which include deal costs, customer backlog and inventory step-up, plus a few other items for a loss of a $1.41 per share. This was in line with our previous estimates. I would like to remind you that we expect the inventory step-up and customer backlog to continue to the first two quarters of 2013. Restructuring totaled $0.35 of EPS with the majority coming in Q4. To date, we have identified approximately 85% of our expected $75 million of repositioning actions for 2013. And we expect to take a few more actions in Q1 that we’re closing the gap under 2013 expected benefit. These actions will primarily be around functional standardization and back-office consolidations. The next item to discuss relates to trade name impairments associated with our brand migration strategy and greatly reducing many of the complications that occur by trying to maintain numerous brands. Many with limited perceived value yet require a lot of cost for growth and maintaining. This is a non-cash charge and we are happy to be carrying these smaller brands in our portfolio as we accelerate -- happy not to be carrying these smaller brands in our portfolio as we accelerate our marketing and branding efforts around fewer and more impactful brands. During the fourth quarter of 2012, we elected to change to a more preferable method of accounting for pension and post-retirement benefits. Historically, we recognized actuarial gains and losses annually as a component of stockholders equity, amortizing them into operating results over future periods. We will now immediately recognize these gains and losses and operating results in the year in which they occur. These gains and losses will be measured annually as of December 31st and will be recorded in the fourth quarter of each year. For the fourth quarter of 2012, the company recorded charge of $142 million for actuarial losses. This change in accounting principal will be applied retrospectively. The impact of prior periods is summarized to the schedule attached to press release. This was done in conjunction with a pre-funding of $193 million to our U.S. pension plans and moving to a risk mitigating investment strategy within the plan. We are now fully funded in U.S. domestic plans which has currently invested 92% in fixed returns. We believe that based on current borrowing rates the transformational deal we did and the importance of removing the uncertainty to our employees and retirees, this was the appropriate time to implement this change. With this now behind us and allows us to focus on what we do best, running the company. And finally, the last major adjustment was the extinguishment of the private placement and public bonds that allows us to create more advantageous capital and tax structure while completing the merger. While all these adjustments drive us through important GAAP loss for 2012, they were combined with completing an exceptional merger with flow control, and we believe all position us nicely for the future. Please turn to slide number 13, labeled integration and standardization update. Let me start by reiterating that we're definitely on track to realize the expected $90 million in synergies for 2013. Please focus on the left side of the chart. We’re trying to give you perspective of how we will realize these synergies throughout the year. A couple of key points in this slide, first, the anticipated savings ramped throughout the year for a couple of reasons. One, because of the way the operational synergies need to flow through inventory, they're not expected to be realized until the second half of this year. And two, even though the majority of notifications to employees on the repositioning have taken place, most of those employees will not be leaving the organization until the end of the first quarter and into the second quarter. Additionally, we are celebrating some investments in the first quarter of 2013 around tax planning, small manufacturing plants and building closures and ERP consolidations. These actions have a little bit of headwind, net of savings within the first quarter. However, you can see that we expect our exhibit in Q4 to give us a nice acceleration into the first couple quarters of 2014. Please turn to slide number 14, labeled balance sheet and cash flow. Being mindful of time and wanting to leave enough for your questions, I would just hit a few of the highlights on this cash flow page. First, obviously a large adjustment of $339 million, this is detailed in the lower left section of the slide and consistent with the adjustment to EPS that I shared with you earlier. Second, our current debt level of $2.5 billion was exactly where we thought it would be and is inclusive of approximately $330 million of stock buybacks executed in the fourth quarter. As of today, we are approximately $260 million of cash on hand, mostly located in foreign entities. It will be focused on efforts to utilize this cash more effectively in 2013 and ‘14. Please turn to slide number 15, labeled Q1 2013 Pentair outlook. Now, on to the first quarter of 2013, where the focus will turn to execution of our committed goals. You will probably need a little time to absorb the pro forma numbers that we have included to better understand the new seasonality of the company. We've excluded from the pro forma numbers three main items. First, we’ve removed all sanctioned country, revenue and profits from the base of 2011 and 2012 for Valves & Controls to provide a better year-over-year comparison. This excluded revenue was associated with sales produced by an acquisition completed by Valves & Controls in 2011. These jobs were delivered upon until shipments for these customers were declined prior to the closure of the deal. This result in substantial charges to income in Q3 of 2012 and we have moved all impacts of that from the results. Second, we have restated all the segments for corporate allocations and new depreciation and amortization, consistent with 2013 and forward expectations and assumed corporate cost in 2011 and 2012 to be equal to the Pentair go-forward cost in 2013. We've also moved any large projects or jobs and divestitures that have no shipments in 2013 and beyond and technical solutions for clear comparisons of organic revenue growth in the future. And third, we have adjusted the tax rate in 2011 and 2012 at the expected 25% rate for 2013 and put the share count in 2011 and 2012 at 214.5 million shares, which was the share count on the date of closure. We hope you find the way we’ve restated the numbers to be helpful in focusing on our operating performance and removing the noise. So after all that, we expect Q1 sales will approximately be $1.8 billion for the total company, which would be up around 1% year-over-year in an organic basis. We expect Valves & Controls sales will be up slightly compared to the first quarter last year where they were up over 20% year-over-year. Water and fluid solutions should get some tailwind help from North American residential and other recovering markets. And technical solutions is still navigating choppy markets after difficult end to 2012. We remain cautious about our markets in the start of the year and feel that operationally there's a lot for us still to learn about the new businesses. We believe this approach helps us focus on what we can control cost and hopefully markets deliver sales upside in 2013. We expect adjusted operating income will be up slightly versus 2012 pro forma, reflecting that we have about $10 million of headwinds associated with the items I mentioned earlier regarding cost to get the synergies and only around $5 million of expected synergies to be realized in Q1. Overall, adjusted operating margin should be above flat and adjusted EPS should be flat to up slightly on a pro forma basis. We’re expecting interest to be between $18 million and $19 million and we are expecting the average share count in the quarter to reflect 207 million shares. The tax rate as I mentioned should be around 25% for the full year and quarter. Please turn to slide number 16 labeled full year 2013 Pentair outlook. For the year, our expectations are consistent with what we told you at our November Analyst Day. Our revenue outlook growth assumptions remain up 3% to 4%. However, we might notice that the overall revenue is slightly lower reflecting removal of the large job and divestitures shipped or sold in 2012 and ‘11. The $790 million of pro forma in 2012 adjusted operating income is consistent with the starting point we share with you at the analyst meeting. It means we need to deliver about $160 million of operating income year-over-year to hit our $950 million commitment. As Randy mentioned, this is about $70 million from the base consistent with 2012 pro forma performance and $90 million of synergies, of which $75 million is expected from repositioning actions that are already complete or will be completed by Q1 of 2013. We are affirming our full year 2013 just the EPS range of $3.10 to $3.30 and we are focused on delivering detail growth action plans to demonstrate a higher level of organic growth and detail productivity plans to not only meet 2013 expectations, but we will continue to invest and deliver on our $5 goal for 2015. Please turn to my last slide, slide number 17 labeled Q4 2012 Summary. We closed out Q4 as expected, markets were sluggish but we plan for that. We executed against our commitments and believe we are well-positioned to deliver going forward. Hence will be the way we ensure consistency around organic growth, productivity, standardization and common values and language in the larger company, it will give us a stability around actions and culture required to know that we are delivering consistent high-performing and repetitive results. Standardization of the back office is requirement to reduce complexity and simplify and improve the customer and employees experience. We're well on our way to roadmaps and we are encouraged by the early progress in the first quarter as a combined company. I will now turn it back to Randy. Randy?
Randy Hogan: Thanks, John. Please turn to slide 18 labeled also summary. To close, let me tell you why we are better position entering 2013 just to wrap everything up. While the fourth quarter had a lot of moving pieces resulting from the acquisition. We are also busy accelerating actions in the quarter to deliver cost benefits and grow synergies in 2013, and we’re really on track. PIMS adoption by Flow Control has exceeded our expectations today and we see a lot of opportunities improve in areas such as delivery and cost, but also driving working capital improvements. We continue to see some win shifts and some tailwinds emerge particularly in North American residential market where the peers were no longer bouncing along the bottom after six of that and now rebounding at a moderate pace. Infrastructures grown its backlog and we continue to see strength in energy and food and beverage. Our balance sheet remains strong and our focus in the near-term will be on share repurchase and dividends, some businesses we have such as aquatics and thermal management, which are already well down the standardization path. We are in the right to grow through bolt-on acquisitions. As other business units progressed on the standardization path, they too will have bolt-on acquisitions re-enter their mix. But the principal focus in 2013 for the whole company is delivering on our and executing our plan for integration, standardization and growth, and as always, we’re going to remain discipline in our capital allocation strategies. So operator, we are ready for questions. So -- take the first.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Jefferies.
Randy Hogan: Good morning, Scott.
Scott Graham - Jefferies: Hey. Good morning.
Randy Hogan: Yeah.
Scott Graham - Jefferies: Just a one question and one follow-up, you guys made a comment about the power market, kind of being sluggish right now, but expecting an improvement as the year progresses? Could you give us little bit of more color on why you think that? And then I have one quick follow-up?
Randy Hogan: Yeah. In power -- and power is an important market particularly for Valves & Controls. And there was a real slowdown in building a power plant and they are big in Asia and they are big all over the world. And we are seeing an increase in activity, bidding activity in that space which gives us some encouragement.
Scott Graham - Jefferies: Okay. Great. And you indicated that the some of the branding and other transition costs that you were accelerate in the fourth quarter? Did that come in as expected as you indicated on your from your Analyst meeting and your last quarter guidance?
Randy Hogan: Yeah, Scott, it did.
Scott Graham - Jefferies: Very good. Thanks.
Randy Hogan: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital.
Randy Hogan: Hey, Jeff.
Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital: Hi. Can you hear me?
John Stauch: Yeah. We can.
Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital: So, I just want to understand this pension change a little bit better. What’s kind of the annual cost savings and what’s kind of reflected in your ‘13 guidance around that change?
John Stauch: Yeah. Jeff, let me just step back. I mean, as you know when you do a large merger like we did, these losses are put to purchase accounting on the target company and we were doing accounting acquire. So we were going to take all the market-to-market and put it in purchase accounting for Tyco. It seemed like a logical thing to do and we entered Analyst Meeting, we were going to do this and in conjunction with putting those losses behind us, we have fully funded the plan and moved to a fixed strategy. So, as we look at ‘13 guidance on a go-forward basis, it always reflected the benefit of this. Now, I can't predict what it would be or wouldn’t be, Jeff, because I don't know how the market gains were worked out and what that positive or negative was. So, Legacy Pentair on an annual basis, we were looking somewhere maybe around $7 million, $8 million operating income a year of headwinds associated with these.
Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital: Okay. So the guidance is unchanged because you were contemplating that. But what’s kind of the year-to-year delta of the change?
John Stauch: It’s just hard to say. I mean, I would have said the $7 million to $8 million is reflective. But maybe what we might have avoided in the short run. But as the benefits pick up, we also avoid the benefits in the long run. So really don't know how to predict that.
Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital: Okay.
John Stauch: So the change was becoming affective, we are fully bonded, removed to fix whichever relatively small adjustment every year that we take into mark-to-market because we no longer are subject to the uncertainty related to the investments within the plan.
Randy Hogan: But that was intact with anyone, yeah.
Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital: Okay. That's helpful. And then just quickly on the growth rates, you are looking for 1% growth in the first quarter and 4% in the full year. And I understand the cadence on the cost savings. But I mean on the top line, what are you seeing that give you confidence in kind of this reacceleration as we move through the year versus the weaker 1Q?
Randy Hogan: Yeah. Well, fourth quarter was -- we saw 4,000 projects, we saw some strength in our residential but not all of it. So we are more cautious. That’s the one reason where we see 1% in the first quarter, as we don’t think it’s just a throwing a switch from the fourth quarter and first quarter as the projects blew up. But we haven’t seen cancelations. And there is really good fundamental growth in the economy and particular in residential. And so as I said, we think energy, particularly oil and gas looks good. We think North America Residential looks good. In the food and beverage space, we saw a lot of projects that just got delayed and whether it’s fiscal cliff or whatever reason, companies -- they didn’t cancel these projects, they just delayed them. So as the world gets little more certain, we think that they may be coming back and we’ll welcome when they do.
Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital: Okay. Thanks, guys.
John Stauch: Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Thanks. Good morning.
John Stauch: Hey, Chris. Good morning.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Just one more on the pension being fully funded, that sounds great. I think you said 90% kind of fixed income in the composition. I’m wondering if that's -- the returns on that are enough to maintain fully funded status.
John Stauch: It’s certainly a great question. Once we get to 100%, we hope it will be and really what we are dealing with is that your discount rate movement should reflect the bond purchases, Chris. And then I mean, we’ve done our best to try to hedge it but you can never be 100%.
Randy Hogan: And to match it’s certainly not possible. With interest rates where they are today, it was just a great time to borrow the money and to fund it. And our employees, we had a lot of questions becoming a Swiss company and technically Tyco buying Pentair, lot of our employees were retirees asking questions about what about my pension. So it’s a nice improvement in the employee relations too.
John Stauch: And, Chris, as you know it doesn’t affect you on a rating agency basis. And I think what we didn’t want to do is have to manage this as a potential cut or benefit into the earnings stream going forward. And I think now it allows us to focus on the operational performance of the business and deliver on the $5 per share that would drive into in 2015, and the way that I think you would expect us to.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Okay. And the transitional costs, call that a couple hundred basis points gets $35 million or so. So pertaining to that, just wondering if we could allocate those dollars roughly by segment, and is the transitional costs all accounted for now in the fourth quarter.
John Stauch: Yeah. We try to get as many of them into Q4 as possible. I mean, I don't know if we can ever be certain that we included it all, but I can tell you we will mentioned it to you in Q1, meaning the businesses what they couldn’t get into Q4 have absorbed them and their plans for next year. They are broken out in the back, Chris, but I will say that I don't think in those numbers, we fully captured all the thermal and Valves & Controls because I don't think they were aware of the process in which kind of we look at, what’s in their results versus what’s in corporate. But they are focused on branding, primarily. They were focused on things related to our confidence level on customer collections, and also our ability to think of potential warranty issues and to address those and that makes up a majority of it. And as I mentioned before, you can see the difference in the back.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Okay. Great. And you said you won't be calling them out going forward, John.
John Stauch: It would not be my inspection. It would not be Randy and ours intention to share with you transition costs in Q1.
Randy Hogan: We want to get -- we want to get back to -- I mean our whole objective here was to get as quickly to a normal base of well operating companies. So we’ll just get back to being an operating company and as quickly as possible.
John Stauch: So, Chris, just to remind you, this was signed exchange on Tyco. This was accelerating the migration away from the Tyco packaging the brands. This was addressing within the Legacy Pentair water business. The small brands that weren’t funding anymore, and that’s what we got after. And we gave our businesses a six-month head start to try to get all that behind them and it’s our intention and view, that that's done.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Okay. And then lastly, I think you're intending about $20 million more restructuring in the first quarter. Restructuring is very small in the fourth for Valves & Controls, so is that that where kind of the first quarter charge is likely to locate?
John Stauch: Without calling a particular segment out, I think there is more potential cost structure which really was a result of where the cost were between corporate and the segments. And we believe on the functional standardization journey, there’s opportunities there.  The other areas that we are finishing and completing our fast growth market alignment and deciding what sales office and what region will best be serving the overall Pentair, and we see an opportunity around real estate consolidations and the likes in those regions that we also expect to get completed during Q1.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Great. Thanks for the color.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.
Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein: Thanks and good morning.
Randy Hogan: Hey, Steve.
Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein: Hey. Just first question. So, I guess you hate your hundred day plan on January 9th, right. That was the intention and I’m reading the words and your dialogue about the benefits, the lean and sourcing benefits delayed to second half. Just give me a sense for what was delayed in tech as expected and what was not expected?
Randy Hogan: Let me address the narrow part of that question and get back to the broader one. Basically, at anytime you have, we have very low turns in our new businesses. And anytime you have any kind of labor saving, anything that goes through cost of goods sold has to go through inventory. So actions taken don’t show up. If you have four turns, you kind of wait at least the quarter. If you got two turns you get to wait six months before if something -- before a cost benefit flows through to the P&L. That’s number one.
Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein: That shouldn’t be a surprise, right. Randy?
Randy Hogan: No.
Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein: That part was not a surprise.
Randy Hogan: That’s why we are on track to hit our 90.
Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein: Yeah. Okay.
Randy Hogan: Basically, as I look at it halfway through the year, we actually we did better on financing, we did better on -- we are in better shape on tax, we are in great shape on corporate costs. We got a lot of momentum on that 90, I think 75 and the 90s really in hand already and the other 15 we know, we know how to get. So, I wouldn’t want anyone to think that we think we delayed on anything because I don’t believe we are.
Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein: And then the broader question, I guess is that addressing sort of as you step back and look at your hundred day plan?
John Stauch: Steve, I mean just to reiterate what Randy said, I mean I always had the sourcing and the lean savings back end loaded in the plan. And then the other thing that’s earlier in the year is we do have a couple of small plant closures that we are working on, which as you know provides a small headwind. And the tax rate is very important to us, especially for ’15. So we are going to spend the investment required in the first half for this year to position ourselves for making sure that we realize that lower Swiss tax rate long-term. Other than that from a timing perspective, everything as Randy said is on track and we control the destiny on the cost out on the repositioning and we feel good about it.
Randy Hogan: Everything in our control is on track or ahead. The only thing that isn’t good as I would like would be the end markets.
Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein: Right. And to that point, your price productivity and mix ended up 40 basis points less in volume and inflation on the out margin impact, right. And I was trying to reconcile that with the growth number of $3 million up, so it’s all FX I take it on the volume side or just maybe help a little bit. As you think about volume and inflation being offset by price productivity and mix, maybe go into the components a little bit, that might have been a little more than you thought.
John Stauch: Yeah. I mean I think some of that productivity is being distorted by a little of the transition costs, Steve. I think going forward, we do think inflation continues to be sub to in the first part of the year, first half of the year and then just gets slightly above 2% in the back half of the year. We are planning on about a point of growth, a point of price I’m sorry for the full year. I think we hope to do better than that. I mean, if we get more MRO activity in the Valves & Controls business and more standard product in thermal, I think we will do better than that. It is the projects that tend to compress the pricing. So, I think we are in line with what we are saying and I think what we were saying, and what Randy is sharing with you is that there is a piece that we can control. And we’re pedal to the metal on that, doing everything we can and then some to make sure that we send the right message internally around cost control, making sure we get the repositioning done and making sure the market alignment is lined up. We are hopeful the markets are better. And there is reason in the business units for them to believe that they are. We would just like to make sure it's guaranteed versus something we are planning for and that does come.
Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein: Maybe just sneak one last thing. On the business unit portfolio side, as you look at the new portfolio when you are considering not just where you'll add bolt-ons overtime as the business units earn it as you’d point out. On the flip side, with that maybe calling out the specific units, are you actively pursuing processes or early-stage processes in terms of pruning the portfolio where it makes sense?
Randy Hogan: Yeah. I think we mentioned at the Investor Day that we actually -- we talked to all the businesses. The level of materiality for our business is $50 million bucks now. If it can't be $50 million or more than I really don’t want to waste any strategic or capital interest on them. So that’s part of our strategic review this year. There is a couple that we have underway now, smaller business $20 million, $30 million that are in process of being sold now. And I expect that once we get our full round of strategy reviews through with the seven business units that we may identify some more.
Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein: Okay. Great. I will pass it on. Thanks.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research: May be just first. I know you guys…
John Stauch: Brian, how are you?
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research: I’m good. How are you doing, guys? Just question on, now, that you guys have a quarter under your belt, you guys are able to kind of dive into the businesses and go to market more as a cohesive brand and whatever you attempt, you may do that. Maybe you could talk about the early indications of abilities to cross sell where you’re seeing the opportunities, anything that submerged to date or things that might be more of a challenge than you previously expected.
Randy Hogan: Well, we've identified and we talked before about food and beverage product line where we sold a combination of the Pentair legacy products in food and beverage along with some keystone valves and there was a real win-win. I mean, we ended up getting twice as much volume on that project. Maybe they would've done one separately but for sure there were one together. And so in that -- in those process industries like food and beverage, there is some real good -- and I would call them right now they are project work. We don't yet have -- and this is the next step to put in a process, so that that happens regularly. So that gets into who gets the sales credit, how is the gig covered, all of that. That’s work that they actually talk least and the growth team will be working along with each of the GBUs. We think energy is another place where we see some good cross-selling. We’ve got some leads in process technologies, basically separation technologies as a result of the Valves & Controls people. Again some early wins and how do we institutionalize those in terms of profits. So that’s -- I think we validated that there is a lot of cross-selling opportunities, some exciting cross-selling opportunities in the Middle East as well around what I would call middle-easternized products from the Far East that would be a capability we have there, we can be launching. And so again it’s taking those ideas and institutionalizing them to drive the growth, that’s our focus.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research: Got you. And John, if I could just ask real quickly, just on FX. So you guys actually reduced the expected headwind for ‘13 but you still see it as a one-point challenge to revenues. I mean, with the €135, why do you expect to see an FX headwind at all. I would've thought it would be a tailwind at this point?
John Stauch: Yeah. Just to clarify, it rounds to 1, it’s actually 50 basis points and all we do is take the euro as one of the currencies at the end of the period and forecast it forward. And you're right, I mean the euro won't be that much of a tailwind. There were times when we’re slightly higher than that but there is other currencies in the portfolio being $2 billion exposed to fast growth markets. There is other currency fluctuations that make up of the remainder of that 50 basis points that we’re referring to.
Randy Hogan: 600 plus Australian dollars.
John Stauch: It was lot more modest than last year and right now a huge headwind as we had in the year at this particular position?
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research: And if I could ask, just sneak one more quick one and I know you guys talked about pension and talked about the funding and the employee relations but I mean, what interest rates are actually starting to creep up here. I mean, you just split a $192 million funding that back up. I mean why wouldn’t you just want to grow out of that?
John Stauch: Well, I think that that is a strategy. We certainly considered it. I mean there are other points in the scenario especially over the last three years that you could have looked back and said that same thing and it didn’t exactly go in your favor. But I want to remind everybody the really reason we did it is, half the company which was Tyco, we were going to have to adopt this anyway by putting it into purchase accounting. And then we get into a situation of trying to create a path where everybody's on the same plans. Everybody is in the same position, there is no favoritism within how we look at those plans and its just make sense to adopt moving forward. The other thing is in putting branding behind us, putting the restructuring behind us, now pension is behind us and it's not something that this company needs to concern itself with anymore on these North American domestic plans and certainly not something our shareowner has to think from year to year is that going to be a tailwind or benefit. I don’t think any of us can predict where that’s going to go. If the interest rates going to go up like you're right and our returns are going to go up, I mean those are natural hedges to other things that occur, right. So this is all part of a constant look at what’s the appropriate capital allocation strategy for the company. And if you think about it, we had a whole back $200 million of any form of investment to cover this from the way the rating agencies looked at it any way. So that was what I think on that money. So when you’re not earning anything on cash, it seems a lot easier to fund it, put that headwind behind you and move on with what we feel we do best, which is the operation results of the company.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research: Got you. Thank you very much guys.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with MKM Partners.
John Stauch: Hey, Josh.
Josh Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners: Hi. Good morning, guys. Just a couple of clarification questions here. First in the analyst day presentation, you guys talked about share count at 203 million squiggle for the year and now worth 205 million. Is that -- am I missing any kind of offsetting guidance or is that just kind of a bias now that maybe a couple of pennies lower in the range?
John Stauch: I think our range is still intact with that. I mean, obviously those are the types of puts and take that are going to occur. We can't predict what the buybacks are going to be. We’re still on pace to buyback the 400 million in addition to what we bought before. And there is going to be fluctuations on what the purchase impact is and where the share price puts the dilution. But all the assumptions are the same other than the math that creates what the end point is, Josh.
Josh Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners: Okay. That’s fair. And then just -- can you walk me through the progression and technical solutions, obviously, exiting the year at a pretty healthy margin rate given where you’re planning on starting. How should we think about the cadence of that and then as we look out into, I’ll say, 2014 but pick any normalized year. Is that -- should that be more linear going forward?
John Stauch: Yeah, I think, I mean, first of all Pentair had a seasonality that I think our shareowners and certainly us get used to. And being 40% exposed in North American residential in legacy Pentair, we saw a pretty big kick up in Q2. And we still have that same amount of money into less percentage of the company, so Q2 will be a season that continues. What we’ve learned about the new business is sort of as follows. I mean, Valves & Controls are the capital dependent business and their strong quarters are in the second half of the operating year as those capital expenses of their customers and as Randy mentioned get agreed upon and then get less.
Randy Hogan: One thing, I’ll add though in this capital, it comes in tens of thousands of transaction.
John Stauch: Sure. And so it’s a lots of these projects. So they’ll tend to be more backend loaded, Josh. And that plays on the seasonality. Thermal, which is a business that we love, has a very strong Q3 and Q4 in our system and that’s primarily because they are weather dependent and they stock up the distribution channel and there is a seasonality in that business. And finally valves which is the other business we acquired in Australian market. And as we know the seasons in Australia are different than what they are here in the United States. So I don’t think we picked up anything that helps our Q1 seasonality. We certainly picked up businesses that helped Q2 and Q3 and Q4. And I think that needs to be understood and as I mentioned earlier, we’ve got a timing of the repositioning savings in the way we have to recognize the sourcing benefits that we know as Randy mentioned. We’ll have to flow through inventory and those tend to be backend loaded here.
Josh Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners: Got you. Understood. And then just one last one, on inflation, I know, it came up on the analyst day but it’s looking like a pretty big year-to-year drag in '13. I’m sorry, if you already addressed this. How much of that is kind of material cost versus employee inflation that you can see coming?
John Stauch: Yeah, I mean, we are annualizing somewhere around three-ish percentage on employee costs and that varies by country and region obviously and areas like China and India are seeing enormous inflation. But overall that’s what the employee base is. I think we have planned material inflation somewhere in the 1.5% to 2% range that is slightly higher than we’d been experiencing and realizing and candidly who knows, right. I mean, I think this is the way we plan for it and then we go out in every negotiation we deal with individually. There is an expectation that there will be modest inflation in the back half of the year higher than what we experienced in the first half.
Randy Hogan: As the economy
John Stauch: As the economy does better.
Josh Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners: Sure. But I would imagine the offset to that though is that price is probably a little bit better as well?
John Stauch: It’s probably.
Josh Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners: It seems like the -- at least the cycle so far, however you want to define a cycle, I guess, that the upside surprise is that price has done a lot better job offsetting inflation than maybe it did in the past.
Randy Hogan: That’s true. That’s correct.
John Stauch: Josh, the other thing I would say is I think Randy and I and hopefully you guys who give us credibility for this. They are very faster learners but there is lot to learn about the new businesses. And we need to understand them, we need to understand their patterns. We need understand the commitment levels, the project execution, the timing in delays and that’s in our particular outlook as well.
Josh Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners: Understood. Appreciate. Thanks guys.
John Stauch: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with Citi Research.
Deane Dray - Citi Research: Thank you. Good morning. 
John Stauch: Good morning, Deane.
Randy Hogan: Good morning, Deane.
Deane Dray - Citi Research : There's been a lot of questions about the pension move. I just maybe I missed this, but is this the same international pension standard that Honeywell moved to four years ago?
John Stauch: It is.
Deane Dray - Citi Research: Okay. Great. Because from our perspective, the timing on this seems right for you guys. In fact, you are fully funded, that is a big plus. And this whole move to going to fixed in the assets is the move that everyone else is trying to get done. So kudos to you to having done this now and the timing looks right. And just a couple of operating questions for me. This is the typical time that we would be asking about pool, but I'll say it in Aquatech’s. What is the early buy? Was there any activity there? And you made a comment about inventories being low, but just if you could flesh out those comments, please.
Randy Hogan: I think the inventory comment -- pool, Aquatech’s is doing quite well, had a quiet good early by, which I think portends well for the season. The comment about inventory is really looking at the pump in the filtration channels. Those are the ones that we’ve been looking for some rebound in residential. Haven’t quiet seen it in pump yet but see it now in filtration and treatment. So there was, what those inventory comments were about -- and I don’t know John how we fill about the channel and pool.
John Stauch: I mean I think we fill good, Deane. I mean, as Randy mentioned, I mean it grew double-digit again in 2012, Aquatech’s did. They had a -- in fact, they regularly buy and I think the overall pool channel feels fairly optimistic about mid-to-high single digit growth again next year. It is affluent buyer and these are warm weather states where it’s almost a must to buy them. So I think that part of the industry we feel really good about. As we’re tracking housing starts and as Randy mentioned on filtration pump, we’re mindful of urban build versus more rural and suburban and the impact that has on well and water softening components. At the same time, we still have a significant opportunity of point to use filtration that comes with all purchase.
Randy Hogan: The exciting thing for Aquatech’s is, it looks like certainly Florida and Arizona, two of the biggest pool markets in the country and two of the markets that were slammed the most in the housing downturn are beginning recovery which means that will be on top of the innovation -- the innovation thrust that has been driving the growth in that business. So we feel good about that and about where they are in aquaculture as well.
Deane Dray - Citi Research: Hey. That’s all good to hear. And then maybe I missed this in earlier comments, but what was the impact from the Sandy storm, specifically on both the sub pumps and the retail side, some of the bigger dewatering pumps? And can you quantify what the impact was?
John Stauch: Yeah. I’ll be specific to the pumps because it’s the only place we can really measure and track it. But we thought we saw $10 million to $12 million optic on the pumps that we sell into the North East on revenue. As you know Deane, those are under highest margin pumps but it was nice to see some lift and so that’s kind of how we framed it.
Deane Dray - Citi Research: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Credit Suisse.
Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse: Good morning. Thank you. Just hade one question, on the Valves & Controls business, do you guys have a sense of how much better the margin profile is of what you’re currently booking in that business versus maybe a year ago and maybe if you could also address how much of that business you think is after market. Any color you can give would be helpful? Thanks
John Stauch: Yeah. I mean, I think this well known at the bookings and the large orders in oil and gas across the industry don't bring the margin that rest of the segmentation as Randy mentioned bring. So as those become less of a component in the overall backlog, the overall margin should get better. But there is still future margin pressure from the large oil and gas jobs that that have been booked in the past and were mindful of that in measuring to that. The MRO activity is picking up and it represents when we think about after-market service and book and ship business that represents right around 50% of the overall shipments within a year.
Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Drab with William Blair.
Brian Drab - William Blair: Good morning.
John Stauch: Hey Brian.
Randy Hogan: Good morning.
Brian Drab - William Blair: Just a question on the revision of the 2012 revenue, so looks like originally we’re expecting 7.5, any revise that this 7.3 roughly and the fourth quarter was in line. So you said, you excluded some big projects, may be I missed but can you give a little more detail around which segments those projects we’re in?
John Stauch: Yeah. And again this is a pro forma but I don’t want you have to dig through it. But there is a large project in technical solutions north of $100 million that shipped in ‘11 and ‘12, which we removed. There is no shipments planned for that project at all in ‘13 or any large projects in ‘13 for that matter. We also removed divestitures and technical solutions that will make up the delta that you're seeing. And then in the Valves & Controls side, it was primarily just related to as I mentioned earlier the sanctioned country revenue
Randy Hogan: And disposition.
John Stauch: And one disposition.
Brian Drab - William Blair: Okay. Okay. On the technical solution side, that wasn't in the legacy business was it? That was in the Thermal Control business? 
Randy Hogan: No it’s in thermal.
John Stauch: It’s in the thermal side.
Brian Drab - William Blair: So I just -- I'm curious as to what -- how you can -- why you had to adjust for that business typically is the business where you’re going to see large projects. It’s just the inherent in the nature of that businesses, isn’t it?
John Stauch: Yeah. I mean but I think as they comment as they’re large. I mean obviously we will share what they are and what we’re doing with. I mean I think the other.
Randy Hogan: We’re not in a position to talked about that project. We were involved in it and anything going forward, we will be able to talk about it.
John Stauch: And we just didn’t want to mention fourth quarters in a row, I mean.
Brian Drab - William Blair: Yeah. Okay.
John Stauch: We would have to stay without these projects here though it was, so inability of looking at the pro forma numbers. We also took out the operate income associate with those project as well. So that we would be able to concentrate on the revenue required to hit the targets and therefore the conversion on the operating income side.
Brian Drab - William Blair: Okay. And then I just one other thing that I may have missed your discussions but the inventory step-up and customer backlog, your forecast for the fourth quarter at one point was $80 million, came in at 180, if I’m looking at the numbers correctly is it. Can you talk about that change and maybe categorizing different?
John Stauch: Yeah. I think there might be categorizing more differences there. I mean I think the 180 -- there is a higher degree of impact on Valves & Controls. As you know, we have to take all the projects and basically strip all the margin out of all those and that one came in a little bit higher and that makes up most of the component of that change.
Brian Drab - William Blair: Okay. I follow-up more. Thank you.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois with Longbow Research.
John Stauch: Hi Gary.
Garik Shmois - Longbow Research: Hi. Thanks. Just a couple of real quick housekeeping question for me. Can you provide me an update as to much new U.S. residential now represents for your business?
John Stauch: Roughly 20% of combined revenue.
Garik Shmois - Longbow Research: That will new residential as opposed to…
John Stauch: I’m sorry. That will probably closer to 5%.
Garik Shmois - Longbow Research: 5%. Okay. Thank you.
John Stauch: 5% or less.
Garik Shmois - Longbow Research: And then just a question on the buybacks. You are on track for $400 million through the end of January. I'm just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on how you are viewing buybacks through 2013, maybe the cadence of buybacks as you move through the year. Is it going to be more seasonal in line with cash flow or could it be more linear?
John Stauch: The way we are thinking about is more value average, so probably doing it more ratably over the year, it’s planned here and what I think is likely.
Garik Shmois - Longbow Research: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Rose with Wedbush Securities.
David Rose - Wedbush Securities: Good morning. This is actually a follow-up to a prior question on the inventory. If you could, my understanding was the inventory and backlog would be amortized through Q3 in 2014 respectively, backlog through 2014. And given the increase in backlog for Q4, how does that dynamic change then? I understand the call that you are now going to be finished by Q2, the step-up and the backlog.
John Stauch: That’s our goal, yes. I mean, we are trying to aggressively get it all out and get it behind us on the first half of 2013. I mean, we’ll update you if we feel there is a leakage in the Q3 right now but the real issue is to try to put the noise behind us and look on to the numbers that represents the full drop to the EPS.
David Rose - Wedbush Securities: Was there any inventory obsolescence that we saw in the fourth quarter then?
John Stauch: Yeah. There was a little bit of that.
David Rose - Wedbush Securities: Ballpark, I mean, was it meaningful?
John Stauch: $3-ish million, probably.
David Rose - Wedbush Securities: Okay. And then lastly, if you could on the fast growth markets that, you have some pretty bold numbers compared to what historically you’ve been excited about. So maybe you can provide a little bit of more color in terms of did the dynamics within those fast growth markets Latin America, China, India, yeah, what are we…
John Stauch: I think we think we have significant opportunity, we are focusing on six fast growth regions and if you kind of go around and you think of Latin America. I think we are being a little bit more modest is, Randy has given direction to the team and we are actively working to have higher levels of sustainable revenue growth around large more impactful projects and/or product lines.
Randy Hogan: Yeah. Initiatives.
John Stauch: Initiatives, and I think what we’ll see is, a focus and a prioritization on those particular vertical markets some of it Randy highlighted energy, power, mining, oil and gas, industrial process, where we think we can bring an aggregated sale to the end customer base and begin to position ourselves into a lot more of a sustainable business model, then some of where we have gone with a particular product and there has been not a follow on localization of that product, so I think we are going to see a lot of strategy work done here in ’13 and I think we positioned our fast growth markets, there still be a contributor, but we want to be profitably contributing and I think we have the ability under the Pentair sales offices to do so.
Randy Hogan: I would just add, we the numbers right now are the summary of what did you say, they are not saying not about what market back ideas are and that’s a big objective as we put these businesses together in the fast growth region. We have 2600 employees now in China. Where do we want to be in China, I mean, would that kind of scale, we are further along actually in the Middle East on that thinking, we are probably enough 1500 employees, and we are further along there and we -- clearly the opportunity China and Southeast Asia seeing. So we haven’t really -- the numbers not yet informed by our strategic intent.
David Rose - Wedbush Securities: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is a follow up question from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital.
Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital: Hi, guys. Just to be clear on the guidance change on revenues, so that the $100 million lower revenue, I guess the $7.6 versus $7.7, that’s purely a function of prior year comps?
John Stauch: Yeah. The year-over-year expectations are the same, and obviously as we dug in and got to know some of the components of the revenue, Jeff, there is clearly some revenue that will be primarily at the divestitures and the sanctioned country. And then as we mentioned earlier, we stripped the large project out. The numbers are there with and without it and you guys can certainly look at it, however, you feel it best serves you. We just did as we wanted to focus on going forward and talking about the cadence of building the revenue and growing. We want to make sure you had the basis to what you are launching from.
Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital: Okay. But if you kind of applied the 30%, 35% incremental to that, what’s kind of offsetting that within the unchanged guidance?
John Stauch: I don’t think there is a lot there other than some of the components of that revenue were all that profitable, which I don’t think the 30%, 35% will reflect all of that. And I think one of the things as I mentioned that we’ve taken out is also the 20-ish million dollar impact of the sanctioned country write-offs associated with no longer providing those products to their customers and I think that changes the base a little bit there too, Jeff.
Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital: Okay. Thanks, guys.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Randy Hogan: All right. Thank you.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. We will now turn it back over to our presenters for any closing remarks.
Randy Hogan: Okay. Thank you. I think we are done. So you can give them the calling numbers. Thank you all for listening.
Operator: And this concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Sasha, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Pentair Q3 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to our host, Mr. Jim Lucas, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may go ahead.
James C. Lucas: Thanks, Sasha, and welcome to Pentair's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. We're glad you could join us. I'm Jim Lucas, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me today is Randy Hogan, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Stauch, our Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, we will provide details on our third quarter 2012 performance, as well as some color on the early days of our merger with Tyco's Flow Control business that closed on September 28, as outlined in this morning's release. Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as the risks outlined in Pentair's 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, and today's release. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today, and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results. Today's webcast is accompanied by a presentation, which can be found in the Investors section of Pentair's website. We will reference these slides throughout our prepared remarks. All references today will be on an adjusted basis, unless otherwise indicated, for which the non-GAAP financials are reconciled in the appendix of the presentation. We will be sure to reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to Randy.
Randall J. Hogan: Thanks, Jim. And good morning, everyone. Before we discuss our third quarter results, I want to extend our thoughts and prayers to those who have been affected by the devastation from Hurricane Sandy. We know that a large portion of those participating in the call have been directly impacted by Sandy, and we hope for a quick recovery for each of you and everyone else affected. On Slide 3, let me begin the Pentair discussion by sharing some thoughts following the successful closing at the end of the third quarter of our merger with Tyco's Flow Control business. 4 weeks ago, we successfully completed the first step in an exciting new journey for Pentair. By combining Pentair and Tyco's Flow Control businesses, we've strengthened our leadership positions in the markets we serve. And by all accounts, Day 1 of the new Pentair was a great success, with all businesses and functions reporting smooth transitions. Consistent with our initial discussions around the deal, we begun $400 million in share repurchases and have authorization for the other $800 million in place already. We also announced the increase in our first quarter 2013 dividend, and as a result, 2013 will mark our 37th consecutive year of increasing our dividend. We continue to spend a significant amount of time visiting employees around the world. We visited over 30 of the Flow Control sites and seen approximately 25% of our new employees. I'm extremely impressed with the tremendous talent we have and are now 30,000 person-strong organization. Together, we have even more capabilities to go after expanded growth opportunities and aggressively pursue efficiencies. Integration activities, which led to the success of Day 1, were exciting. But they were just the beginning. The real work has just started. Let me share with you how we're moving forward. First, it's imperative that our 8 Global Business Units drive strong business performance to achieve their operating and financial targets. Additionally, each of these business units is pursuing growth and cost synergies that align with the vision and expectations inherent in our merger. Each business unit is developing robust project funnels to ensure we realize strong synergy capture, not only over the next 100 days but through 2013, 2014 and 2015. The integration and standardization team, or IST for short, will continue to drive Pentair-wide program management of synergy capture and the rollout of our standardization initiative. The IST was designed and built to be an ongoing organization, not just the team to get us through Day 1. The IST will drive critical standardization programs, which involve taking the best practices from both organizations to create one enterprise-wide standard. One example is the Pentair Integrated Management System, and of course, rolling out the Lean Enterprise element of PIMS throughout the entire organization. Nearly 10% of the Flow Control employees have taken part in Lean Enterprise training already. In addition, functions in finance, HR, legal, compliance, marketing and communications will be implementing standardization programs as well. With the 8 business units working in close connection with the IST, we're gaining even more confidence in the synergy targets we communicated over 6 months ago, when the transaction was first announced. And by driving PIMS and functional standardizations through our organization, we will have the operating processes to ensure consistent and strong performance. While we're in the early stages of looking at revenue synergies, we've seen some examples that we're very excited about. Whether it is leveraging Flow Control's strong relationships and energy, or Pentair's reach into the global food and beverage channel, we look forward to sharing more about these opportunities, as our teams come together and identify how to leverage the new combined company for growth. We have a tremendous company with extremely talented people. I've seen in my many visits around the company that our Win Right culture is being exhibited everyday. With a successful Day 1 behind us, we now have a significant work to do to ensure we meet and exceed the commitments we have made to our employees, our customers and our shareholders. Now let's turn to Slide 4 to discuss legacy Pentair's third quarter results. The third quarter marks the last quarter for legacy Pentair as the transaction closed on the final day of the quarter. The key point that I want to make about our core business is that the third quarter, once again, demonstrated our strong operating performance as seen by a 7% improvement in adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin expansion of 110 basis points to 12.4%, driven by strong price and productivity. Sales declined 3% on a reported basis owing to FX translation headwinds as volume and price grew 1% in the quarter. We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.64 cents, up 10% from $0.58 cents, and at the top of our range before including a $0.01 benefit from a favorable tax rate. Unfavorable foreign currency translation continues to mask our strong pricing, and we continue to see volume gains in many verticals such as Industrial, Agriculture, Pool and Energy. There are headwinds that remain, including in telecom, Western Europe and China, but overall, fast growth region sales were up low double-digits in local currencies as the Middle East, Latin America and India are seeing strength, showing our investments continue to pay off in these regions. Despite constrained volume gains due to the market headwinds, we continue to see strong productivity. Further, our pricing is gaining momentum and lower material inflation is allowing those pricing actions to flow more quickly to the bottom line. We delivered $62 million in free cash flow during the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $203 million, and putting us well on our way to convert more than 100% of net income to free cash flow once again, something we've done consistently over the last 12 years. All in, we delivered another quarter of solid operating performance with well-executed productivity initiatives, good price realization and continued growth investments. This great execution comes on top of the momentous effort expended in finalizing this transformational merger, while delivering on our legacy business targets. Now let's turn to Slide 5 for a review of our Water & Fluid Solutions segment performance. Water & Fluid Solutions sales declined 1% on a reported basis, increasing 2% when excluding the negative impact of FX. Despite the flat volume, we delivered 2 points of price in the quarter, consistent with what we have seen in the past few quarters. Excluding FX, Aquatic Systems delivered 7% sales growth. Treatment/Process grew 6%, and Flow Technologies declined modestly, owing to tough year-over-year comparisons. Let me begin with Aquatic Systems, where once again we saw another great performance. Sales were up 7% in the quarter, reflecting continued share gains and good pricing. Aquatic Systems ended their pool season with inventories in good shape and continued pricing momentum. Building off good secular trends around sustainability, efficiency and automation, we continued to see strong gains in sales of our IntelliFlo pumps, up 7% in the quarter and nearly 30% year-to-date, as well as in heat pumps, which grew 41% in the quarter and are up a comparable amount year-to-date. The gains are not just coming on the residential side of Pool, as we saw almost 20% growth in our commercial business the quarter. We continue to expand coverage and penetration, growing our dealer base over 10% year-to-date. Within Treatment/Process, water purification sales grew 6% year-over-year on local currency, comparable to the growth rate experienced last quarter. Fast growth region sales continue to grow at double-digit rates, with India up 60% on expanded coverage and added new products. In contrast, sales in the U.S. were up only modestly and Europe was relatively flat, largely in line with our expectations and continuing the trend we saw in the first half of the year. We discussed the pending launch of our industry-changing innovation, Hybrid DI, which combines the benefits of reverse osmosis filtration with those of a water softener, using capacitive electrodes to remove hardness and total dissolved solids from water without employing salt. The Hybrid DI is shipping for field trials and there continues to be growing interest in this new technology, particularly with commercial customers. We continue to see signs of strength among our filtration and purification systems businesses, while our water treatment valves and tanks business is showing signs of bouncing off the bottom in North America and stabilizing in Western Europe. Within North America, we're seeing share gains due to improved delivery performance and more feet on the street. Last quarter, we discussed the U.S.A. builder, alpha test, as part of our rapid growth process. This program targets a select group of homebuilders that are growing in areas such as Denver, Houston, San Antonio and Tampa. We've seen great success early on with 70% -- 75% close rates versus 30% with our traditional programs. As we look forward, we expect to triple the size of this initiative by the end of next year. Water purification continues to make progress towards our next proof of concept, as this business has driven PIMS throughout the entire GBU. And despite the ongoing challenges resulting from a depressed residential market these past 6 years, the team has continued to improve operationally, driving gains in delivery and productivity, and resulting in dramatic improvements in operating margins and ROIC, and equally important, supporting investments in innovation and global expansion. In the other part of Treatment/Process, which is process technologies, that business grew top line 5% on an organic basis, as continued gains in Energy were partially offset by delayed projects in both water and beverage. We are now past the 1-year anniversary of our acquisition of CPT, and we continue to focus on the integrations and standardization efforts within process technologies. The beverage business, while experiencing some project delays during the quarter, is setting up nicely to end the year with several expected shipments. As we brought together Pentair and Flow Control, we've already experienced an early win in the food and beverage space. A major beverage company has combined its purchase of hygienic valves from Pentair and food process valves from our new Valves & Controls business. While this is just one example, it illustrates the breadth of the combined product portfolio and strength of our brands. Finally, let me discuss our Flow Technologies business, where sales declined 3% in local currencies during the quarter. While our residential pump business had a tough comp in the third quarter, with the absence of any major weather-related activities, we continued to see strength in our agriculture business and growth in our municipal and Industrial backlogs. Agriculture saw its growth moderate to high single-digits, as there were some impact to buying patterns in September from the drought experienced in much of the country over the summer. The outlook for our agriculture business remains strong entering next year. We highlighted last quarter that our municipal business experienced an uptick in orders and backlog, and the third quarter saw that trend continue. We've seen our municipal backlog grow for the last 5 quarters and our year-to-date backlog is up 14% compared, and at the levels last seen in 2010. The growth in our municipal backlog is signaling some increase in sales in this vertical starting in the fourth quarter and into the first half of 2013. Based on what we've seen, it does not appear that municipal market itself is bottom, but we're seeing signs of activity in the traditional break and fix category and it appears that our investments in customer service the past couple of years may be contributing to our order's success. The right half of the page show second quarter Water & Fluid operating profits and margins. Water & Fluid adjusted operating margins increased 60 basis points to 11.6% in the quarter. Successful pricing actions and strong productivity helped to offset inflation in foreign exchange headwinds. And we continue to make progress at CPT as the adoption of PIMS has contributed to improvements in quality, delivery and cost. In summary, the Water & Fluid Solutions segment has experienced a number of headwinds in 2012. We have continued making investments and we are seeing improvements in key markets, such as North American residential, which bodes well for 2013. Now let's move to Slide 6 for a review of Technical Solutions. Technical Solutions, by the way, is the new name of the segment, so we've gone to that now. This is still the Technical Products business you know. Technical Solutions remains a bifurcated story with the top line, once again, showing a modest decline, down 2.5% in local currencies, while robust price and productivity contributed to operating margins exceeding 20% for the second consecutive quarter. While the Datacom and telecom markets experienced over 20% sales declines each, Industrial continues to grow albeit at a moderating pace. General Electronics showed gains in the quarter, and other markets, such as security and defense and Medical, are also experiencing some growth. Enclosures & Cabinets, which represents nearly 60% of Technical Solutions, grew sales 2% in the quarter, as strong pricing help mitigate small volume declines. As mentioned previously, growth in Industrial continued to be a beacon of light for the top line in Technical Solutions, as the group continues to identify opportunities to expand in the catalog channels, where new distributors continue to be added. We continue to make good progress in building out our stainless steel watershed enclosures, particularly within the food and beverage vertical. For example, a major food producer has spec-ed in [ph] these enclosures into all equipment and wash-down areas in an effort to reduce the risk of contamination. Cooling, approximately 10% of Technical Solutions sales was flat this quarter, following mid single-digit growth last quarter. The sequential decrease in the growth rate was due to slower communications markets. While cooling is a smaller piece of Technical Solutions today, we continue to see attractive long-term growth characteristics for this business, and are investing accordingly as we tailor product design to meet local needs, localize production and train fast growth region sales teams to expand globally. In North America, we continue to build out our MRO strategy and have launched a couple of alpha tests as part of our rapid growth process to test ideas there. Systems & Solutions, approximately 20% of Technical Solutions sales, has seen the sharpest decline this year, and that trend continued in the third quarter as a result of the greater than 20% declines experienced in the Datacom and telecom markets. While we expect the top line to remain challenged for Technical Solutions exiting 2012, we continue to invest in new products and global expansion, while driving price and productivity to grow operating income. Let us now turn to Slide 7. Before we look at the new Pentair, we want to assure you that the legacy Pentair business remains on track towards our previously communicated expectation for the full year. In the fourth quarter, we will continue to see the top line challenges and headwinds that we've experienced this year, such as the challenging Western Europe markets and the shrinkage in Datacom and telecom markets. Counterbalancing these challenges however, we are seeing growing backlogs in our municipal business and beverage, and beverage is entering its typically strongest season for shipments. In local currencies, we have seen ongoing strength in fast growth regions with the exception of China, and we expect this trend to continue. As demonstrated by our strong price contribution in the first 3 quarters of the year, pricing is a discipline at Pentair and a trend we expect to continue. Operating margins have benefited from price and productivity, 2 elements within our control. We have seen some moderation on the inflation front, which has helped, but we continue to drive productivity. For legacy Pentair, we are on track to deliver adjusted operating margin expansion of 80 basis points for the year and low double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Now let's turn to Slide 8. In summary, our legacy business performed in line with our expectations, and we successfully closed our transformational merger with Tyco's Flow Control business. This year has not been without challenges, but we continue to demonstrate our ability to drive strong operating performance through elements within our control. We are doing this while still investing in the long term, as evidenced by our continued expansion into new areas such as Energy and agriculture and a strong new product pipeline like Hybrid DI. In addition, we're starting to see some tailwinds emerge as we begin to look ahead to next year. Energy and agriculture remain areas of growth for us. But at long last, we're seeing signs of a long-awaited improvement in the North American residential market. As mentioned previously, municipal is seeing good growth in its backlog, which is a sign that another long beleaguered market is showing some signs of bouncing off the bottom. We've seen great execution led by PIMS, as evidenced by our strong margin performance. The integration of Flow Control is well under way, as we have our corporate structure in place. We've identified projects for over half of our sourcing targets, and we have quickly identified revenue synergies, opportunities in Energy and food and beverage. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.
John L. Stauch: Thank you, Randy. Please turn to Slide #9, labeled Q4 2012 Legacy Pentair Outlook. We want to share with you what we anticipate our fourth quarter results were going to be in the base Pentair business, so that you have an indication of how we feel we'll be exiting 2012, and how we are setting ourselves up in the base to deliver within our legacy portfolio. We expect sales of approximately $890 million, or up about 2% to 3% versus 2011, inclusive of currency, and up 4% to 5%, excluding the impact of currency. Water & Fluid sales are expected to be up around 3% to 4%, driven by accelerating CPT performance and easier year-over-year comparisons regarding foreign exchange and distributor stocks in our water purification business. Excluding the impact of FX, sales are expected to be up 5% to 6%. Trends in Technical Solutions are expected to remain consistent with third quarter results, reflecting lower capital spending and cautiousness in the channels regarding uncertainties related to fiscal cliff and the overall economy. Sales in Technical Solutions are expected to be down 3% with FX, having less of a headwind year-over-year versus Q3 results. Excluding FX, Technical Solutions revenue is expected to be roughly flat with last year in the fourth quarter. Legacy operating income is expected to be around $106 million or up around 11% to 13% versus the fourth quarter of last year. Adjusted operating margins are expected to be around 12% for all of legacy Pentair, up 90 basis points year-over-year. Operating margins for Water & Fluid Solutions should approximate 12.5%, and Technical Solutions margins should be around 17%. Price and productivity continue to be the theme, and execution utilizing our Pentair Integrated Management System continues to build momentum and deliver consistent operating results. Adjusted EPS for legacy Pentair is anticipated to be up double-digit year-over-year, with the estimated adjusted tax rate in line with previous expectations of around 28% to 29%. Interest of around $16 million and a share count of around 102 million. Legacy Pentair adjusted EPS would be expected at roughly $0.62 for the fourth quarter, putting us in the middle of our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $2.70 to $2.76. Cash flow, once again, would have exceeded 100% of net income. While the overall economy has clearly softened, solid productivity and disciplined investments have allowed us to continue to meet expectations for Pentair. Please turn to Slide #10, labeled Full Year 2012 Legacy Pentair Outlook. Again, we thought it would be helpful to share with you the projected legacy Pentair results for the full year. We are expecting revenue of around $3.6 billion, or up about 3% versus 2011. We expect operating income to be around $445 million or up greater than 10% year-over-year, and operating margins to be around 12.5%, or up about 80 basis points versus full year 2011 margins. We anticipate achieving 12.5% margins in Water & Fluid Solutions even as we continue to integrate last year's acquisition of CPT, demonstrating the power of the PIMS operating model, and the commitment to functional excellence and standardization throughout all of our Water & Fluid businesses. The commitment to Lean Enterprise is paying dividends and giving us a lot of confidence in further margin expansion, as well as utilizing these same tools across all of the new Flow Control entities. We expect Technical Solutions margins will be just north of 19% as we continue to benefit from price, productivity and PIMS. Legacy Pentair adjusted EPS, as I previously mentioned, is expected to come in at the midpoint of the previous guidance range of $2.70 to $2.76, or up 13% versus full year 2011. Again, excluding the impact of deal costs, we expect cash flow to easily exceed more than 100% of net income. Please turn to Slide #11, labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. Cash flow for legacy Pentair this year remains strong. And our recent debt and revolver offerings are in place, giving us a healthy capital structure heading into 2013. The current debt levels in Q3 do not reflect the previously announced and completed redemption of the private placement debt funded by borrowings under the revolver capacity, which will yield an even better overall interest rate and give us a better balance between fixed and variable debt. We have worked hard at improving our #1 metric, ROIC, and at the end of the third quarter, we knocked on the door of double-digit ROIC again, and under the legacy Pentair, would have easily cleared it on the way to our longer-term goal of 15%. Obviously, the inclusion of the Flow Control entities will give us a lower short-term result, but we expect it will provide ample opportunity for us to expand ROIC rapidly to achieve our goals. Please turn to my last slide, labeled Q4 2012 Pentair Outlook. This slide is an attempt to give you an initial snapshot of the combined new Pentair fourth quarter outlook. We expect the Flow Control acquisition to add nearly $900 million of revenue to the fourth quarter, driving our revenue to nearly $1.8 billion. This would be up, obviously, greater than 100%, versus our $866 million of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2011. We anticipate the Flow Control businesses will add about $100 million of operating income to the fourth quarter, prior to the expected incremental amortization of $23 million related to the deal. Also, we anticipate roughly $5 million per quarter of incremental corporate costs, and roughly $5 million per quarter related to the investment in the integration and standardization team, which consists of roughly 40 full-time members, ensuring that we realize the expected GBU-based operating synergies. Also included in the fourth quarter projection are roughly $25 million of expected onetime transition costs. These costs relate to the acceleration of sign changes, painting of service trucks, brand migration, getting the single images in standard software and PCs, ensuring that we are leveraging global contracts related to indirect spend, and finally, LEAN training in the businesses. We are inheriting a new record backlog in the Valves & Controls business and coming off a record performance in the thermal business. We are integrating these businesses at a very good time for Pentair. The Australian water business has undergone significant restructuring throughout 2011 and continues to improve its performance despite a challenged economy related to its primary market, mining. We are confident that these businesses understand their respective strategies that are aligned on their expectations regarding standardization opportunities. We feel good, as Randy mentioned, about how we have started, the people that are coming with the businesses and their excitement about the value that standardization of PIMS can have on their businesses. As we comment in the bottom right-hand corner around the EPS assumptions, currently, there are many moving pieces. A few of those will be the outstanding shares, currently at approximately 250 million shares on a fully diluted basis, and the tax rate, which is estimated at around 30%. Both of these will improve as we head into 2013. The shares will be reduced by the already-in-motion $400 million buyback program, and the tax rate will improve when we implement the tax strategies related to our new Swiss-based structure. We are initiating guidance for adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter at $0.40 to $0.45. However, this result is not reflective of the earning power we expect in 2013 and beyond. We are excited to share with you our outlook for 2013 on November 27, and we will be prepared to provide you the appropriate pro forma information, including segment, vertical and geographical revenue, and respective growth outlooks. We will also provide you with a detailed update around our cost synergies, detailed cost-out plans, how we plan to implement PIMS across the enterprise, our actions for fast growth markets, and an early look at revenue synergies, and finally, all of the details related to capital structure assumptions and why we are confident in our goal of $5 per share for 2015. I would now like to turn the call back to Randy for some closing comments before we take your questions. Randy?
Randall J. Hogan: Thank you, John. Please turn to Slide #13, labeled Summary. To close, it was a very busy quarter for Pentair. But just as important, it is a quarter that marked the beginning of the latest chapter in our company's history. Our third quarter base performance met our expectations, as we continue to navigate through a challenging top line environment and highlighted the price and productivity, are truly hallmarks of Pentair's operational discipline. Day 1 execution went smoother than expected, and that has allowed us to accelerate some of the integration and standardization efforts. We've already completed our corporate staffing, we've identified over half of our sourcing target, and our teams are making progress in changing signs, websites, brand transitions, to name just a few. We continue to get more excited about the potential for revenue synergies, based on some early reads we have seen. Pentair has been on the journey with PIMS for well over a decade, and we're excited about expanding PIMS to the new Flow Control GBUs. We have already trained 10% of the Flow Control employees in Lean Enterprise. And that's a good beginning. We remain on track to deliver legacy Pentair 2012 results. We're also starting to see some market tailwinds emerge, particularly in the North American residential market where it appears we are no longer just bouncing along the bottom, but are now rebounding albeit at a moderate pace. We begun to see signs of a similar rebound in commercial markets. Municipal has grown its backlog, and we continue to see strength in Energy and Agriculture. We'll be hosting our 2012 Investor and Analyst Day on November 27 in New York, at which time, we will look forward to sharing our optimism regarding synergies, in addition to providing more detailed guidance for 2013, for the new Pentair. Operator, we can take questions now.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steven Winoker [ph].
Unknown Analyst: I actually want to start, on behalf of everybody, all the families that were affected by Sandy, including my own, a thank you guys for postponing the earnings call for a couple of days. It definitely helps and I appreciate it. Let's see, first question, just if you guys can give us some color on, again, on the Tyco Flow Control portion in terms of your thoughts for fourth quarter. You're talking about $900 million, and I think you were referring to the fourth quarter. And if that's true, it's certainly a little bit lower than I thought, orders. The last time I was looking at orders, you were leading us to believe, for the fourth quarter. So can you talk a little bit about the front log or -- and the backlog, which I know the backlog is up a bit and I'm not sure if that's order-driven or just shipment deferral or what, maybe a little more color around that would be really helpful.
John L. Stauch: Yes, Steve, a couple of things. This is John. First of all, yes, I mean, I think you know that revenue guidance is our view of kind of where the business is going. We haven't had the opportunity, but we will be, in the next 30 days, just scrubbing the backlog, understanding all those order takes, and be able to be very confident in what we see. Relying on what was provided though, and this was a company responsible for providing the same types of guidelines and the same types of systems we do, it is a near record backlog in Valves & Controls. It continues to build orders, at probably the mid single-digit rate growth, and we're very optimistic that we're getting to set a pretty good time in the Energy cycle. Also in the Q4 numbers, we've put in, as I mentioned in my script, about $25 million of transition costs associated with the things that Randy and I were mentioning. We want to accelerate and start in January 1, with great momentum on what we're going to do with the new Pentair. And there's also about $8 million to $10 million of costs in the base numbers of Flow Control related to the segment costs, which will go into the GBU, coming to corporate will be eliminated. So I think when you take that out and you put the share count and tax rate back to where we had -- where we think it'll be at the start of next year, you'll get close basically neutral to what would have been the Pentair guidance. There's a lot of moving pieces in Q4. We don't know what purchase accounting in final is, we don't know what the amortization is, and we've got a lot of things and a lot of work left in the next 30 days.
Randall J. Hogan: But we will soon.
John L. Stauch: But we will soon.
Randall J. Hogan: The other thing that's going on, they were on a September fiscal, and we're shifting the Flow Control over to the calendar fiscal that Pentair has been on traditionally. So this is kind of a stub quarter. And so I don't think that there's -- there's certainly nothing in the outlook that shows any kind of discontinuous change in their sales rate.
Unknown Analyst: Okay. And so the op income comment on Page 12, that talked about the New D&A, Corp, IST, those are all showing up in reported op income, but you'll back them out of adjusted, correct?
John L. Stauch: Well, those are actually all in adjusted, Steve. Some of those reflect what the full year run rates would be on an ongoing basis. And obviously, we're ramping up to those numbers.
Randall J. Hogan: And I think, just to be clear, the things that were in the script, John's script, those are ongoing, the 5 and the -- the $5 million of corporate add, the $5 million of IST, but what isn't is, is the $35 million or so, right, of additional costs that is just sort of transitional-related. Taken down, we're changing all the signs and some of this one-off intense training that's going on around LEAN, et cetera. That will -- that is not sustaining.
John L. Stauch: Actually, those are hitting adjusted results.
Unknown Analyst: Okay. So the fourth quarter impact of those items, can you tell us what that is, then?
Randall J. Hogan: Roughly $35 million in aggregate.
Unknown Analyst: Okay, great. And then -- and maybe just a quick comment. I'll leave it to others for the other things, but just Sandy, just what's the sort of net -- what are you expecting for an impact on the company?
Randall J. Hogan: Our focus right now is to chip everything that everyone asks for and it impacts our residential pump business. That's where we see the impact the most. And as we said, through the first 3 quarters, we had no weather-related sales. So we will see what it is. But I mean, our focus is on shipping right now and that with expediting and all, we haven't really tried to quantify a financial impact yet.
Unknown Analyst: But Randy, could you talk about like with -- it's part of a business that's X% of the company?
Randall J. Hogan: Well, there's probably -- there's probably $10 million of extra sales that are going to happen, and maybe more, and what -- I just don't know what the profit will be on that because we're expedite -- we spooled [ph] up our plants and we're shipping out all the inventory we have, so our focus is on getting the pumps there and we're in a position to do it. So...
John L. Stauch: The good news, Steve, is we do ramp-up for the anticipated weather seasons. We had a lot of inventory to be able to ship and the downside is it's a 20%-ish margin and you're dividing by 200 million shares, so I mean...
Randall J. Hogan: And we're expediting shipment because we're trying to get them there.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari.
Hamzah Mazari - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: The first question is just on pricing. You guys are doing a good job pushing that through. Maybe speak about your confidence level and continuing to push price given the demand environment you're seeing out there. You spoke of pricing discipline, maybe you ought to speak to how much of your product is less commoditized where you can really get pricing through?
Randall J. Hogan: Well, one of the reasons that we have good pricing disciplines is we sell a lot on the Pentair side, and about 80% of what we sold, we sold through distribution. And most distribution is priced in a virtuous way. And so we expect that to continue. There's some of that on the Flow Control side, but there's also a lot of premium products and a lot of specification activity on that side. So we'd like to bring some of those pricing disciplines over to Flow Control. And it's one of the training activities that we have going on. But the ability to get price to stick is a function of market discipline. So we think we're in good businesses. So that's -- those are the kind of businesses where you can get price. And John, you want to add anything?
John L. Stauch: No, I agree with Randy. I think we got to remember, there's $1.5 billion installed base on the Flow Control side, with, as Randy mentioned, premium products. That's where the biggest opportunity in the short run would be, is making sure that we're pricing those effectively and we're not entering into discussions with customers, packaged between the installed base and the new opportunities. And I think we break that out, and think about its installed base, and treating that more like what we do in the Pentair side.
Randall J. Hogan: Project service.
John L. Stauch: Right, project service, and then looking at the original equipment or the brand new orders, differently, I think that's the biggest opportunity.
Hamzah Mazari - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Got you. And then just a question on the Water business. How much of that business right now for you, just that segment, is replacement or consumables? And then maybe just speak about your leverage to the U.S. housing market recovery. It seems like you're beginning to see that in your numbers. Do you think there's a lag that needs to happen, or we're just coming off of a small base here, and yours already seeing some of that?
Randall J. Hogan: Well, in -- for the whole new Pentair, residential is still 20% of our sales, and the U.S. is probably 12% out of the total, right? So it's over 50% of the -- a little higher, 15 -- okay, 15% of -- between 12% and 15% of total new Pentair sales. So we still have a substantial exposure to that market. There is always a lag -- and where we're seeing the residential improvement is things -- for instance, we talked about the flood-related SKUs that are getting shipped now, those we didn't see anything. The place we saw them was in the pumps that are related to building out subdivisions and those -- or in the water softener area we mentioned. Those are the places we're beginning to see the signs of stabilization, or return to normal. But we do see a lag on that, particularly on, well, really on the pump side and on the filtration side. It is going to be 6 months to a year.
Hamzah Mazari - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Got you. And just last question for me. On the Tyco merger, you talked about some of the revenue synergies that you're beginning to see already. When do you think you'll be in a position to sort of give an order of magnitude of what you think that number could look like or maybe more detail? Is that on the analyst day or is that more on next year?
Randall J. Hogan: Yes, our intent is to talk in more detail just about -- not just about the idea of synergies, but give you some specific examples of ones that are being worked. What we did in the pre -- the reason -- what we've done prior to close is we had a Clean team looking at revenue, we had a Clean team looking sourcing. And so we've been able -- we've hit the ground running as we look at some of those. And we'll -- we have to get permission to use as a case study, the one that I referenced in my -- we don't have permission from the customer yet to talk about it, so -- but we intend to on this 27th. And so we'll give you specific examples and then also how we'll go after it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Barry.
Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I actually wanted to circle back to the discussion about the 4Q EBIT for the Flow business. If you start in your buildup with what I think is about $105 million even before considering amortization or corporate cost bias, et cetera, the $105 million on the $910 million that I think you're expecting for revenue is about 11.5% operating margin, which seems kind of low versus where the business has been tracking. I think Tyco is even guiding to a 14% margin in this current quarter. And so I'm just wondering is that conservatism, some seasonality or [indiscernible] seasonal stronger quarter?
John L. Stauch: I think if you take a look at the $900 million and you average somewhere around a 13%-ish margin, that's where we see it coming in on prior. And as Randy mentioned, we are doing a lot of things in those businesses to accelerate getting to January 1 in a very clean position as the new Pentair. So I think you're seeing a red hit really on those businesses.
Randall J. Hogan: The other thing is we're shifting it to talk about it on the basis that we talk about it. And it's probably about 100 basis point difference between corporate cost, and we push more cost down, I think, than Tyco did. I'm not sure about that but...
John L. Stauch: Does that answer your question, Rob?
Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Yes. So okay, the $105 million where you started your buildup is your segment disclosure basis, which is different from the way Tyco was disclosing at the segment level and maybe that delta is worth about 100 basis points of margin?
Randall J. Hogan: That's correct. Yes, yes.
Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. Yes, perfect. No, that's very helpful. I was wondering also if you could just dig a little bit into the Flow business and give a little color on, I think the 2 main pieces in there are your legacy Resi Flow and Engineered Flow. So was the Engineered Flow business kind of down a fair amount this quarter and the Resi Flow up? Any color directionally there would be helpful.
Randall J. Hogan: Well, the Resi Flow was actually down because there was no weather-related activities in the third quarter. But there's good trends in the Residential Flow. And there's actually good trends in the Engineered Flow side. I referenced in my script that customer service has improved and that's why we think we're getting higher wins. Frankly, I'm not sure it's the market. I think we're correcting some -- now that we've combined them, we frankly are having better focus on execution. And our deliveries have improved, our overdue backlog is down and as a result, I think we're winning more. So that's what's helping in the Engineered Flow side.
Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Got you. So in the quarter though, both were down maybe a little bit? Is that fair?
Randall J. Hogan: Yes, yes.
Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: So -- and when you' talk about them, your backlog building, I mean, we've been having very easy comps here for a while with -- off a low base. I mean, would you expect to see some pretty substantial growth then when that backlog starts converting to revenue just even the -- in a base off of which we're starting?
John L. Stauch: Yes. I mean, I think we're feeling good about plus 15% to 19-ish percent growth in backlog. And as we start to ship that, as you mentioned, we get some pretty easy comparisons. So I think the tailwinds for Flow are set nicely as we head into 2013.
Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Yes. Is that what your expectation would be for that flight, is kind of mid- to high teens growth off those easy comps?
John L. Stauch: Well, I mean in that section of the business, I think your mid-single-digits growth for Flow is the way we probably look at next year.
Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Got you. And then just finally on the Technical Products business or Technical Solutions business, I know you talked a little bit about mix. I assume that's in that product price bar. I was wondering, are you actually kind of on an apples-to-apples basis raising price or is a lot of that kind of productivity priced tailwind coming from the mix? I know I think the telecom stuff is lower margin.
John L. Stauch: We are getting price increases. That's one big piece of the component that Randy mentioned. And the other one is as we're challenged in the Datacom and telecom, that was fairly low-margin business. And what's still growing is in the North American Industrial segment, which is very high margins. So we're getting a margin lift from losing the revenue in the areas that are low and gaining it in the areas that are high.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Mike Wherley.
Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: Could you talk a little bit about the sourcing where you said you already found like 1/2 of the target? And I was just wondering if that's on track, with what you were thinking you'd see already or if that's ahead of pace?
John L. Stauch: It's ahead. I think we felt that we gave a reasonable estimate out there with about $60 million. And just to remind everyone, that was about $40 million of indirect and $20 million of direct. Just from experiences, previously, it takes a while to get to direct because you got to turn the existing inventory levels, you got to re-quote everything, got to redesign some things. So when we take a look at where we're at now, we're slightly ahead of schedule and feeling good about the incremental pipeline that we have. I think if you think about the nature of these businesses, there's some natural purchasing points where if you think about the valves purchases overall and the benefit that, that can have to Pentair, and you think what we do on the Pentair side, the benefit it can have over the Valves & Controls and the thermal side. So we feel very good about where we're at and we're building the commodity organizations to make sure we go after and get it.
Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then on the North American rebound, I mean, obviously, you're being pretty cautious about that rebound. But how do you feel differently about that versus 3 months ago? Like what have you seen to sort of reinforce your thinking there?
John L. Stauch: We love the data. I think all of the indications of the data mirror up to what we're feeling and hearing as optimism in the channel. I think each of our thirds of the business that we play in the North America residential, and as Randy mentioned, we have a Flow component, we have a Water Purification component and we have a Pool component, all 3 play into the industry different. And now I'm going to have Randy add some color, but I think what we need is in each of those elements, obviously, warm weather build certainly helps the Pool business. Urban sales are delayed and when we see the Water Purifications go in, and that's where a lot of the new housing starts have been more in the urban centers. And when we get more rural builds, we get both Flow products, which are bringing the water to the homes, and we also get the Purification plays. Randy, on the rural?
Randall J. Hogan: Yes, I mean, the more rural, the greater the Flow intensity. A rural home would have 5 pumps in it, a multifamily would have less than 1 per unit. So it really depends on how it comes forward. As John said, the data is very promising. The orders are slow in coming. But we look at housing sales because as money goes into houses, that's when people fix their water softeners. That's when people add filtration systems. That's really good for the Filtration business. And then on the pump side, it's either break or fix or it's new homes. That basically drives that. And then Pool is, well, Pool's been growing despite the fact that new pools aren't being built. So there -- as Sun Belt housing picks up again, the Pool business will pick up again. And we don't think that, that we'll diminish at all the greater content and the sustainable trend going to a variable speed and higher levels of control and elimination of chlorine, et cetera. All these trends that we're -- that our business are leaders in.
John L. Stauch: But we clearly think that this is a high single digit growth over the next several years. And we believe that if you take the drought-related SKUs out of 2012, and obviously, some of that will level off with the shipments that Randy mentioned in Q4, we're going to be at that level this year.
Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: All right. That's very helpful. If you could just give a little bit of commentary on what you're seeing in China, that would be -- that's my last question.
Randall J. Hogan: It's interesting. In China, that hurt both Tech products and our Water Purification business the most, Water Purification, where we've enjoyed a lot of growth in our Residential Filtration business as we serve China. As you know, what's happened with China housing, that slowed down. So that's pretty much flat. And some of the telecom and Datacom downturn is actually in China. So....
John L. Stauch: We did grow high single digits in Q3 in China, which is the first quarter this year that we saw that type of growth.
Randall J. Hogan: But that's not -- that's coming from process and industry as opposed to a hit.
John L. Stauch: Okay?
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Just as pertains to the legacy Pentair, what's the level of restructuring you're anticipating in the fourth quarter?
John L. Stauch: Legacy Pentair? I think I don't have the exact number on that, Chris. I can tell you that we're looking at taking a fairly sizable cost out action as we head into 2013, and we're looking at somewhere around $60 million to $75 million of cost out that we want and that's consistent with what we said. We're looking at those actions, about 50% on the Pentair side and 50% on the new Flow Control businesses. So that's our targets right now and working to the actual details, but that kind of helps quantify it. And we look at $0.50 on the dollar from a cost perspective. That's a reasonable estimate at the moment.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Okay. And what you do on each side kind of takes into consideration the other side and how they fit together, I take it?
John L. Stauch: Yes, there's obviously areas will come together like fast-growth markets, where we look to have one common -- face the market on a Pentair and there's obviously some back-office consolidation opportunities there. That would be a kind of a cross company view. Clearly, some of the systems that we put in across the entire enterprise would be a cross company view. And then it's really about the standardization opportunity in each GBU or each business. And those are just as abundant on the Water & Fluid side at Pentair as it is on the valves and control side of Flow Control. And obviously, we're looking to maximize payback here Chris so...
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Right. Right. And then just on the food and -- or the beverage sale synergy that you already got, maybe as an anecdotal, it could be used to -- so we can get a complexion on the revenue synergy opportunity. And do you look at that as a life of program type of win? Because the customers, it's a long-term relationship or annualized. Could you add some -- just complexion on this particular one?
Randall J. Hogan: Well, I mean, in this particular case, we're talking about a $2 million win becoming a $4 million win. It was double that and it's relationships that should go beyond the project. But it'll still be, as they build out, it will become a standard approach, we would hope. Not that they won't compete big projects every time, but...
John L. Stauch: It was a great space for the customer as far as going forward and offering the different valves between the 2 different units, which we're allowed to capture more of the share, right? So we make, on the CPT side, some very high-end valves. But we sometimes pass it up, some of the other...
Randall J. Hogan: No, we -- yes, we don't even make some of it. So...
John L. Stauch: We don't even make the...
Randall J. Hogan: And vice versa, the Valves & Controls valve, they don't -- they didn't qualify with this customer, so...
John L. Stauch: Right. It was a nice complementary, our product set we're able to offer the customer.
Randall J. Hogan: That's the equipment ones. The equipment ones are the Pentair one.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I saw some good news coming from Pentair this morning here and it takes me to the first question is, you set some ambitious goals back in March about cost synergies, revenue synergies, the $5 dollar earnings power in 2015, $0.40 cents of accretion in 2013. And here we are today, you got the deal closed and you're reaffirming what a lot of people thought were very ambitious targets, especially considering the macro has worsened. So maybe, Randy, I know we're going to wait until November 27 to get some more details, but just if you could take some broadbrush commentary, macro top line was weaker but sounds like you're a lot more enthusiastic about your cost synergies. But if you could just step us through those issues, that would be helpful.
Randall J. Hogan: As we -- and it's a great question because the reason we affirm what we said is because we -- the macro is worse, and we'll talk about this on a lot more detail. But you can expect us to come back with a more moderate outlook for what the markets are going to do for us. But we feel better about the synergies that we can drive and bring home. And it's really that. It's really the fact that we believe more strongly that the synergies are going to read out. We have more insights into them. So even though the top line in the -- is going to be lower, the bottom line should be still a reasonable goal for us to deliver to shareholders. And it's -- the revenue synergies are becoming more real. As we get belly-to-belly, I mean, this job we talked about, not just impressive that the client sought this out, but the fact that these 2 teams came together the first time they met and made it happen. Pretty -- it was something that we're very proud of. And then -- so it's really those things. Yes, remember, when we set those goals, it was basically top-to-top dialogue between 6 people on their side and 6 people on our side. So there was a, I would say, a proper scaling of how it would all come together then. And now, while the pieces will be different, we still think the objectives are good.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And one of the surprises from us was, and we heard John speak about this at our Citi Industrial Conference, is the complexity that Tyco arrived with. And maybe just a comment about the ERP systems. Originally -- I thought the number was 37?
Randall J. Hogan: Yes, I mean, actually, we -- as I mentioned, we've been out to see 30 -- we've been out to 30 of the facilities, the Flow Control facilities. And these are high-quality facilities. These are operating people and we're having a really good time getting to know the businesses. But the investments and -- Tyco knew this. I mean, a lot of the investments, if you will, hadn't been gotten to a lot of the investments required to eliminate some of the complexity. When I go around the Valves & Controls, it feels like walking around Enclosures 14 years ago to me. It -- all that promise and too much complexity. They have 43 factories, 37 ERPs, incredibly strong brands, great quality, people that are embracing PIMS faster than -- not just in Valves & Controls, but I was in Redwood City last week and touring that. It's a Raychem facility, that's in Thermal Management. And there were folks from our Pool. They're LEAN rangers from our Moorpark Pool facility, were up there working with them, doing 5S [ph] Kaizens. It's just really exciting to see these kind of -- the way the teams come together. Yes, it's honeymoon and I'm a CEO and all CEOs are optimists, so -- but nevertheless, I look at Valves & Controls and I'd say that there -- whatever there, 12%, 13%, Enclosures was at 9% in 1998, a profitability of 9%. Now it's 20%. And it won't take us 14 years for this. We know how to do it now. Well, I mean that's kind of why I'm optimistic. Not kind of -- that is why I'm optimistic.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: That's good to hear and we'll hear more color on the 27th. And I know we're running to the top of the hour here. Just a couple other questions on the hurricane cleanup with -- you commented that it was mostly where you're shipping the sump pumps, that's the Residential side. And this is, obviously, not a Katrina event with New Orleans and a lot of the bigger pumps that were involved there. But is there anything beyond on the dewatering side beyond the residential pumps that...
Randall J. Hogan: We -- yes, we have -- they have combined sewer and rainwater systems over there. And I think we're in about -- of the main 18 or 19 stations in New York City, I think we have the pumps in 16 or 17 of them. So we expect those pumps are working away right now to help pump out the city. And ultimately, what that would mean in terms of follow-on service, or parts, I don't know. The -- and I'm sure we have other pumps that are flown through our distribution side as the larger pumps, split case pumps, whatever, going into service right now. I don't have as good a window on that right now.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And then just last one on the buybacks, John, can you just give us some color about the amount -- I know that was the as planned, but just in terms of how active you expect to be in the market?
John L. Stauch: Yes, the first 400 million was placed in and we're obviously subject to rules around average trading volumes or whatever, so you can assume that, that's being done on some type of average basis over the first 4 months, which would be October through January. As it pertains to the remaining 800 million on approval, I'm obviously will be in a position to share more of that with you later. But obviously, we would like to get the capital structure in line as rapidly as our debt levels allow us to.
Randall J. Hogan: So I think we have 7 more, so we'll do our best to be brief with the answers. But I'd like to get through all the 7 questions if we could.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Just kind of a follow-up on the first question from Deane. This might be a small nuance, but you were saying that you're still confident in $5 by 2015. Before, you were saying $5 plus. Is there anything to read into that or is that really just kind of...
Randall J. Hogan: No. That's a nuance beyond my intent. No.
John L. Stauch: The goal is to hit $5 and hopefully, things will allow us to do better.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Okay. Great. And just on -- most of my questions have been answered, but just on the municipal side. So it sounds like the break and fix component is really kind of driving the opportunity going forward. But maybe just talk about the capital project side. It sounds like that might still be pretty weak in the near term, but I'm curious of your expectation as far as some bigger projects that may be building up in the pipeline [indiscernible]?
Randall J. Hogan: We continue to invest in gaining position in the infrastructure space outside of -- outside the United States and we have a decent position in process technologies in that. We've seen some slowdowns in projects there. But we'd like to grow our share in pumps. And we think one of the opportunities synergistically between -- in the new Pentair is larger pumps in Australia, which is a nice market; large pumps in the Middle East, which is a nice market. So we -- we're -- that's one of the synergies that we are exploring right now. But the U.S. still remains -- it -- I submit until the U.S. government and local governments are able to put more money into water, it's a break and fix world. And it's been that way for 40 years and it's going to be that way until something changes. And I don't think that is going to happen anytime soon.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Okay. I do have a lot -- more questions here. I just want -- if I could sneak one last in. Just on the North American Resi, is it your expectation that the Pool business will be the last to benefit from an increase in residential activity and maybe changing buying patterns from consumers? Maybe just a quick comment on that would be good.
John L. Stauch: No, actually, I think that's the one we're probably the most confident in because we've done a lot new product content in there, drive energy efficiency. And what we've said constantly is the pool builder or the pool owner today tends to be on the higher end or more affluent buyer. And most of those pools are purchased more cash base. And you're looking at about a 10% new pool permits to the housing starts number because just the way the patterns get built. So I actually think that's the one we're most confident in. The ones that we have to do a little bit more work with, which we're still confident in, are the rural versus urban builds and how that impacts our particular sales into those housing.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski.
Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division: Just I don't know if you guys went over this already, but I wanted to make sure what you guys were specifically looking for on an organic basis. So inclusive -- I'm sorry, exclusive of currency or Tyco in the fourth quarter, just so we're on the same page.
John L. Stauch: Josh, I did everything not to give you that number and I don't feel comfortable giving you that number right now, and I will give you that on November 27 because there are things like acquisitions, divestitures, those types of components that I would need to do a full reconciliation on to share that with you. I think you can look at organic order trend rates and sort of where we were in prior quarters and get a pretty good indication that we don't see things are slowing.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Drab.
Brian Drab - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: This is Brian Drab. So just one question for you. Can you -- you raised the guidance for the operating margin for 2012 and you talked about some of those issues, but can you kind of rank order the things that are impacting that? Obviously, better performance than expected in the third quarter on margins, but product mix, steel cost and other commodities coming down, productivity initiatives, which is most important to talk about...
Randall J. Hogan: You're talking about legacy Pentair business.
Brian Drab - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: In the legacy Pentair business, yes.
John L. Stauch: We really have a seasonality that's fairly predictable and normal, and it kind of falls around the fact that you take a look at equipment protection or Technical Solutions, there's a couple less weeks of buying due to the Christmas holiday and kind of how the season unfolds. So it's just a little bit less contribution on top of the fact that this is the only reason that, that margin really turns downward. In the legacy Water -- and Fluid businesses, it's more of just where the contribution is coming from in terms of the seasonality. And we do really well in the North American residential side. And that season begins to end throughout Q3. It's a little trend, so I think you see in the margin expansion year-over-year, it's generally in line.
Brian Drab - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. And then your forecast for revenue growth, you gave the overall number. Can you give me what you're expecting for organic in the fourth quarter for the legacy Pentair business?
John L. Stauch: Legacy Pentair business, I think we've shared that but I'll be read it here. It's...
Brian Drab - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: I just see on the slide, you have 3% for legacy Pentair.
John L. Stauch: Correct.
Brian Drab - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: And I may have missed it if you gave the breakdown between FX and organic.
John L. Stauch: FX is a couple of points.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: This is a really well-done earnings presentation, the handout. So everything is very clear. A couple of things though. I just have sort of just a couple of these little items here in the operating income on Page 12. Could you tell us what the incremental amortization of intangibles is for the fourth quarter? For the [indiscernible] of the deal?
John L. Stauch: Yes, it's -- that's $23 million that you see on the -- under the op income. The majority of that is the incremental amortization.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay. So like $18 million to $20 million or...
John L. Stauch: No, no, no. That's like $22 million to $23 million.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: $22 million, really? Okay.
John L. Stauch: Yes. Well, the depreciation remains in the business because most of those -- most of the depreciation isn't really adjusted because of the timing. Yes, and what happens is all of the other...
Randall J. Hogan: And within their base, that's the incremental.
John L. Stauch: This is incremental. All the other assets get revalued and that becomes the incremental amortization.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: All right, all right. Yes, that makes sense. Okay. And then the $10 million of New Corp and IST, are you saying that, that's Tyco Flow corporate expenditures that we should expect in the fourth quarter?
John L. Stauch: No, we would expect to add -- yes. On an ongoing rate next year, we would expect $20 million incremental IST cost and roughly $20 million of incremental Corp cost that would come into Pentair primarily around tax, treasury and the addition of other functions to support the new Swiss structure. And so that's a full run rate is what that's expecting. And then there is some segment cost, which I mentioned is still in that contribution from Flow Control, which should be part of the business unit operation synergies over time.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Right. But that's going to be rolled up into the segments, right?
John L. Stauch: That's correct.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Yes, I'm talking about just the corporate piece of Tyco Flow. That's what this number is, right, the $10 million?
John L. Stauch: Yes, yes.
Randall J. Hogan: The way to think about it is, it's incremental to Pentair corporate.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Yes, exactly, exactly. So last question is this. If you would take a step back and look at the Pentair legacy business with the talk that you have on the muni, the Resi and how well the Technical Products business is holding up, plus your typical margin expansion initiatives, it seems to suggest that 2013 Pentair's legacy earnings would rise based on where we stand today. Would you agree with that statement?
John L. Stauch: I agree it would rise. I know where you're going with this, Scott. I'm not -- I don't know what the legacy EPS guidance for next year would be, but I think we would expect some growth, absolutely.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey.
Brett L. Linzey - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Could you just touch on the 4Q tax rate of 30%? You suggest in the release, it doesn't reflect some of the tax saving synergies and the strategies. I mean, is this just more timing or have expectations changed from your initial expectations there?
John L. Stauch: It's totally timing right now. The biggest piece of the reduction will come in the form of a debt pushdown structure. And once we choose that interest rate to push down at, we are locking in for a long term on that interest rate. And obviously, we want to choose that carefully. So we will have it in place, we'll be ready to fully go, but we're trying to get to the right answer for the ongoing Pentair.
Brett L. Linzey - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay. And we should expect by 1Q, that should be pushed down and it should normalize to that kind of 25% rate?
John L. Stauch: That's correct.
Randall J. Hogan: By January 1. By January 1.
Brett L. Linzey - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Sure, January 1. Okay. And then, I guess, the last question. Just on the cost synergies, you pointed to $40 million you've been able to achieve thus far. I mean, were you able to parse that out into different buckets? And then, I guess, how does that compare to your initial expectations?
John L. Stauch: I mean just to remind you, the corporate cost that we were receiving in Tyco Flow was more of a $2 billion standalone. And we were able to do this deal before most of those people were put in place, which is good news for the people and good news for us. So we're really adding to the Pentair corporate cost, and you'll see those there as about $40 million of incremental cost that we expect to put in.
Randall J. Hogan: Versus the $85 million to the $100 million that they were going to add.
Randall J. Hogan: So we really realized the entire corporate synergy, if you will, already.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of David Rose.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: The last 2 questions hit on line, but maybe we can clarify a little bit on the $40 million integration corporate investments. We're talking about $5 million each per quarter for corporate and ITS. You also have the $25 million piece. So the $10 million per quarter accounts for the $40 million. But was the $25 million onetime branding cost part of your $40 million integration corporate investment that you've outlined in the earlier presentations? Or is that something relatively new?
John L. Stauch: I wouldn't say it's new. I think it was something that normally would've been done over time. We're trying to get as much as possible behind us before we hit the ground on January 1. So we're taking a look at every single one of those decisions in the context of the IST and saying, how do we feel about this brand, how do we feel about the investments, how do we feel about the marketing, what we're doing, and accelerating those decisions as quickly as possible.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Now part of the $40 million includes in the ITS and over time, I would imagine that declines after the first year or 2. Is that fair?
Randall J. Hogan: Yes. The way we've thought about it is sort of it will fall off after maybe a couple of years, start falling off by the end of '15. It should be pretty much integrated into other things, I would think.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Okay, fair. And then lastly, on the tax issue, you put out in the slide presentation, day 1 savings, 24% to 26%. I understand that there are some debt pushdown that you have to do. Is there anything else that could potentially change the tax rate guidance that might delay things a bit or increase the taxes?
John L. Stauch: The tax is based upon what is the ongoing rate of Tyco Flow, and the rate that we're experiencing is slightly higher than what we would have anticipated. At the same time, the synergies, the tax synergies that we're going after at this point exceed what we originally thought. So at this particular point in time, I am pretty confident with the 25%. And we're also confident that long term, we can get closer to 20% or below 20% like most Swiss-based companies. And those things will require from the 25% on down, incremental strategic actions beyond the debt pushdown. And we're prioritizing those right now because a lot of those align perfectly with what the business wants to do anyway around driving functional excellence or headquartering in certain locations. So I feel right now, we're on pace to do what we said.
David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Okay. And the debt pushdown, are we talking about additional legal costs associated with this?
John L. Stauch: No, no, no.
Randall J. Hogan: No, It's just choose and go.
John L. Stauch: Yes, the interest rate is lower than what we would've anticipated. And we want to make sure whatever interest rate we choose and put in, we can live with for the next 10 years.
Randall J. Hogan: Last question.
Operator: And your last question comes from the line of Garik Shmois.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Just my question is on Western Europe, just real quick. It's been soft here for quite some time, but I believe you said that it's stabilizing. I know that you started to see declines on a year-over-year basis last year. So are we -- should we think about Western Europe as stabilizing off of this lower base or is it truly stabilizing?
John L. Stauch: Well, I think it's stabilizing off our lower base.
Randall J. Hogan: Yes, it's not recovering.
John L. Stauch: We, on a volume basis, were down low single digits in Q3. And that compares to being down double digits in Q1 and Q2. So we're starting to anniversary some of the easier comparisons and we're not expecting it to get much better. I mean, we're flattish in Q4. But we saw a pretty steady correction or pretty sharp correction, I should say, last Q4, primarily in Water Purification. And right now, we're not feeling that level of distributor destocking that we saw last year. And that's why we feel fairly comfortable to say it's stabilizing. I don't think it's recovering. I don't think we're trying to...
Randall J. Hogan: Well, and the things where, really, we saw a decline was Germany. In our Technical Products and our Flow Technologies business, Germany is a really important market. And so Germany went late into this decline, but they're in it. So -- and I'm not sure Germany has bottomed yet.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. And you've done a good job getting pricing. Can you talk about pricing in Western Europe, Germany, if you saw incremental pressure here over the last quarter?
John L. Stauch: Nothing material. I mean, I think, keep in mind that these are fairly local purchases with pretty steady channels. And I don't think people are chasing volume right now. So I think you're seeing the pricing in line with what we've seen prior, in line with expectations.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. And then just a last question on that. Just as you look at the new Pentair, what does Western Europe make up as a total?
John L. Stauch: 20% to 25% of new Pentair.
Randall J. Hogan: All right. Thank you, all. And operator, begin the replay. Thanks for your attention.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call, and you may now disconnect.

Operator: My name is Katie and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Pentair Q2 2012 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker’s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. I’d now like to turn the call over to Jim Lucas, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Mr. Lucas.
Jim Lucas: Thanks, Katie and welcome to Pentair’s second quarter 2012 earnings conference call. We’re glad you could join us. I’m Jim Lucas, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me today is Randy Hogan, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and John Stauch our Chief Financial Officer. Today’s call we will provide details on our second quarter 2012 performance, as well as our full year 2012 outlook as outlined in this morning’s release. Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company’s anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as the risks outlined in Pentair’s 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2011 and today’s release. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results. Today’s webcast is accompanied by a presentation which can be found in the investor’s section of Pentair’s website. We will reference these slides throughout the prepared remarks. All references today will be on an adjusted basis unless otherwise indicated, for which the non-GAAP financials are reconciled in the appendix of the presentation. I would like to also point out that the third quarter and full year outlook does not include any future impact related to the pending Tyco Flow deal that we announced on March 28 as stated in this morning’s release. We will be sure to reserve time for questions-and-answers after our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to Randy.
Randy Hogan: Thanks, Jim and welcome. And good morning to everybody. Let me begin with second quarter results as shown on slide three. We had another strong operating performance in the quarter driven by our focus on the three Ps that we can control. PIMS, price and productivity. We grew sales 3% on a reported basis. We drove operating profits up 11% expanding adjusted operating margins by 100 basis points and we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.83, which is up 11%. While a combination of unfavorable foreign currency translation, continued softness in Western Europe, and the last quarter of an end-of-life telecom project tempered top line growth, we saw continued strength in many of the sectors we serve. Industrial, agriculture, pool and energy all contributed solid gains in the quarter and we saw strong pricing across the portfolio with total price favorable by 2.4%. Fast growth region sales were slower but still grew faster than overall Pentair. We continue to expect double-digit growth for the full year in fast growth regions as we execute our expansion plans. Adjusted margins increased 100 basis points to 14.3% in the second quarter as we continue to drive greater productivity and execute the pricing actions to offset material inflation while funding growth investments. While we have seen some easing in commodity inflation, our pricing initiatives remain sound. In the second quarter, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.83 compared to the $0.75 in the prior year driven by our strong operational execution in the quarter, which helps somewhat mitigate the areas out of our control, such as softer Western European volumes and continued headwinds from foreign currency. On cash flow, we saw the seasonal rebound in free cash of $222 million in the second quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to 140 million, putting us well on our way to converting more than 100% of net income to free cash flow, something we’ve done consistently eight out of the last 10 years. As Western Europe continues to be a headwind and uncertainty persists, we accelerated several repositioning actions during the quarter. This is not dissimilar to the approach we’ve taken during other challenging times in the past. All in, we delivered another quarter of solid operating performance with well executed productivity initiatives, good price realization, while continuing our growth investments, which we believe position us well for the balance of 2012 and beyond. Now, let’s turn to slide four for a review of our Water & Fluid Solutions segment performance. Water & Fluid Solutions sales grew 7% year-over-year in the quarter largely driven by the CPT acquisition, which added $40 million in sales. Excluding CPT, Water & Fluid sales grew 3% in local currency as price realization remains favorable. Aquatic Systems delivered solid results in its seasonally strongest quarter and treatment process continues to benefit from a strong backlog and a healthy pipeline of new product introductions. Let me begin with the flow business, where sales were essentially flat in the quarter, an improvement from the decline seen in the first quarter. The business continues to see softness in residential pumps through the absence of any major weather related activity this year. Municipal was flat, but the project business saw a healthy, double digit increase in orders and the backlog continues to build, signaling some increases in sales in this vertical starting in the fourth quarter this year and into the first half of 2013. We are not prepared to call a bottom in Municipal, but we are seeing signs of stabilization and an increase in quoting activity in the traditional break and fix activity, which may signal a return to more normal demand. Agriculture grew at a mid-teens rate in the quarter, as we continue to see strong share gains in this vertical. The integration of Nijhuis into Flow is progressing nicely. Cross training of the sales force is well along and we’ve begun to combine product offerings in some verticals, such as Fire. In the first quarter, we mentioned several joint sales calls that have made – that we’ve made and this continued into the second quarter, most recently in Canada to promote the new fish friendly pump. Within Treatment and Process water purification sales grew 4% year-over-year in local currency. Fast growth region sales continued to grow at double-digit rates, with India doubling once again on expanded coverage and added new products. In contrast, sales in the U.S. were up modestly and Europe was relatively flat, largely in line with our expectations. Importantly we did see U.S. inventory levels stabilize and Europe distributors some sentiment improved from the October and November low points. New product launches remain on track, including our industry changing innovation Hybrid DI, which combines the benefits of reverse osmosis filtration with those of a water softener using capacitive electrodes to remove hardness and total dissolved solids from the water, all without employing any salt. In addition to residential use, this groundbreaking system could be used in a wide range of applications, including in hotels and restaurants and the broader commercial sector. We’re very excited about all these applications and look forward to winning a lot. As part of our rapid growth process, we’ve had some success with programs first introduced in China and then launched globally. Most recently we’ve begun our USA Builder initiative that targets a select group of builders that are still growing in areas such as Denver, Houston, San Antonio and even Tampa. This is based off a program that we had success with in China targeting large housing complexes. The USA builder initiative has had some early wins and we’re looking to expand into other regions entering next year. In China, we recently launched the POU Homespring product, which is exceeding our initial expectations. This product has been well received in China and we’re looking to roll this out globally later this year. Both of these initiatives, the Builder program and the Homespring product, demonstrate our ability to not only develop programs locally in fast growth regions, specifically China in this case, but to also take this knowledge and transfer it globally. In the other part of Treatment and Process, process technology sales were up 29%, or up 3% including CPT and a 6% foreign exchange headwind. Advanced Water Systems and Energy both grew double digits in the quarter. Within Advanced Water Systems we continue to see growth in desalination through the distribution channel along with some project work. Energy grew double digit once again. We continue to pursue larger system sales and penetrate new applications within refineries and natural gas production, while growing recurring revenue and maintaining above average margins. Our second quarter performance once again demonstrated the great strides we are making with our Polarex Extractive Separation Systems. Our technology and systems expertise provide alternatives to conventional natural gas treatment methods at a fraction of the cost with better efficiency and a much better environmental footprint. We secured several new orders in the quarter, which highlights the growing acceptance of this technology. Food Service remains steady as we expand into new customers, such as convenience stores. We reached the one-year anniversary with CPT in mid-May, so only half of the results were included in acquisitions during the quarter. CPT added $35 million in acquired sales in Q2 contributing to both flow and treatment process. Backlog grew once again, particularly in beverage, which we believe sets us up nicely for 2013. Process Technologies had several strategic wins during the quarter. First, we’ve established a framework agreement with the major brewer for all filtration projects through 2015 including BMF projects underway in England and China. We continue to win contracts for dairy applications as well. Next we won our single largest code line order to date for a desal project in Saudi Arabia. Finally, we won a large membrane systems order in France and see opportunities to expand our global Anaerobic MBR reach in the future. Turning to Aquatic systems, once again it was another great performance. Sales were up 8% in the quarter, reflecting continued share gains and good pricing. Growth fundamentals remain strong in Pool with continued investment and significant installed base growing energy rebates and good secular trends around sustainability, efficiency and automation. As result, in IntelliFlo pump sales remained impressive growing another 30% in the quarter. We continue to expand coverage and penetration adding another 132 dealers in the quarter and add new products to the lineup, such as the IntelliZone Ozone Generator system that helps sanitize pool water and reduce chlorine use by as much as 50%. The right half of the page shows second quarter Water & Fluid operating profit margins. Water & Fluid adjusted operating margins increased 50 basis points to 14.7% in the quarter. Successful pricing actions and strong productivity helped to offset persistent inflation and we continue to make progress at CPT as the adoption of PIMS has contributed to improvements in quality, delivery and cost. Overall, I’m very pleased with the Water & Fluid segment performance this quarter. Now, let’s move to slide five for a review of Technical Products. Technical Product’s sales were down modestly compared to prior year in local currency, while adjusted operating profits grew 5%. Price realization was good, but volumes were down year-over-year due to an expected end-of-life telecom project. This is the last quarter of that particular project headwind. Even with the reported sales decline, Technical Products delivered 11% operating income growth and adjusted operating margins expanded 290 basis points to 20.2%. This marks another record margin performance for the segment. We believe we are well positioned to deliver the expected 100 plus basis point margin expansion in 2012 as pricing initiated in March reads through along with continued productivity, repositioning benefits and better growth in the second half. In our focus verticals Industrial, Energy and Infrastructure, we grew sales a combined 5% globally and 9% in North America in the quarter as we fill in our global product portfolio, add coverage, particularly in Energy, and launch our new accelerate program that highlights better lead times and ease of doing business. This quarter we also launched PCF stainless steel wall mount enclosure line, which was designed and produced in China. This targets petrochem, pharmaceutical, and food and beverage applications. In contrast, Communications, which accounts for roughly 19% of sales was down nearly 30%, reflecting the anticipated negative impact from the end-of-life program as well as softness overall in telecommunications orders. Cooling was up 6% excluding FX, and continues to be a key focus as we expand coverage in innovation globally. This quarter we launched a Direct Air Cooling System, an energy efficient cooling platform for electronics. This new systems offers flexible effective heat removal for outdoor enclosures. Looking ahead, we have an exciting innovation calendar in Cooling with the expected launch of a compact cooling offering, added controller and communication capabilities and expanded offerings specifically for fast growth regions. We are also seeing early successes of integrated cabinet and cooling solutions, for example a tow-way project in Brazil with each controller requiring three cabinets plus a cooling unit. This is in the testing phase now, but we see great potential for it after the testing phase is over. Fast-growth region technical product sales grew 8% in local currencies as we add distribution and expand our product portfolio to meet local needs. In China, sales improved quarter-over-quarter with some stabilization, and importantly good traction on our distribution expansion efforts, adding nearly 20 more distributors this quarter and yielding 30% sales growth through distribution. In Latin America, Tech Products largest fast growth region, sales were up nearly 20% in local currency with infrastructure a bright spot. Middle East, albeit small today, was up 17% in the quarter. I believe we’ve only just begun to see the benefits of our expanded distribution and product offerings in fast-growth regions for Tech Products. Bottom line, in Technical Products is that while volumes are more challenged in the second half of the year, we continue to invest in new products and global expansion, while driving productivity and Lean to grow operating profits and advance margins. Let’s now turn to slide six. Now that we’re past the halfway point for the year, I wanted to spend a few moments updating you on our key geographies and verticals. Starting with our largest region, the U.S. and Canada, year-to-date sales were up 5% if we exclude the previously mentioned end of life telecom contracts in tech products. Industrial, Agriculture and Energy have been the three strongest sectors. And while we are seeing some moderation in Industrial, Agriculture remains strong. And we’re making good inroads into energy, which is growing off a smaller base. Western Europe remains an important area and we have not been immune to the challenges throughout the region. Excluding FX translation, volume were down 8% in the first half. While we anticipate translation headwinds to continue, the rate of decline in volumes appears to be moderating in Europe. Within fast growth regions, there are several moving pieces. China was flat on an organic basis in the first half of the total enterprise, but we saw over 20% growth in other key regions such as the Middle East, Latin America and India. As I mentioned previously, Industrial and Ag – agriculture – aquaculture are up double digits year-to-date. We have seen modest gains in Commercial and Infrastructure and Residential has been flat. While we continue to bounce along the bottom in Residential and Commercial, Infrastructure recently had seen some pick up in orders and backlog. Our investments in strategic growth platforms continue to pay dividends in the form of increased orders. Energy, water reuse, industrialization, and agriculture are all areas where Pentair is positioned in the new, new world. Let’s turn to slide seven for a look forward at the second half of the year. After posting 5% top line growth in the first half, with acquisition contributing from CPT, we would expect modest reported top line growth in the second half as FX translation remains a headwind. We are not alone in this, but we are focused on elements within our control. For example, our strong price contribution in the first half is not a short-term phenomena and we have strong price actions carrying through into the back half of the year. In addition, improving backlogs in Municipal and Beverage portend an improvement for these verticals. Fast growth remains on track for double-digit growth this year even as China’s growth has been muted. Operating margins have benefited from price and productivity, two of the elements within our control. We’ve seen some moderation on the inflation crunch, which has helped and we continue to drive productivity. Given the ongoing challenges with the macro environment we did accelerate some repositioning spending in the quarter. Overall, we are on track to deliver adjusted operating margin expansion of 100 basis points and double-digit EPS growth for the year. Before I wrap up my comments, on slide eight I would like to provide an update on our announcement – announced merger with Tyco Flow Control. We continue to be excited about the merger announced at the end of March. We believe this transaction is a great strategic fit increasing our global presence and exposure to high growth and attractive sectors. Let me first provide an update on the transaction timeline, what we’ve done in the last 118 days and what’s still to come. From a regulatory perspective we received U.S. and EU clearance with regulatory filings underway in other foreign jurisdictions. We’ve established an Integrated Planning Management office, led by a proven Pentair executive, which is fully staffed with a team of 40 functional and business unit team leaders to drive the global integration planning. These initial integration planning efforts will be critical as we ramp up towards the expected close at the end of September. We filed a preliminary proxy statement and Form S-4 for SEC review, which is progressing. Still to come are a few more foreign regulatory approvals, and of course Pentair and Tyco International shareholder approvals. As we work through regulatory approvals and SEC filings we are limited in further commenting on the transaction, but we wanted to provide an update on what we’ve accomplished to-date. Now let’s turn to slide nine. In summary we’re off to a solid start. First half was not without its challenges, nor will be the second half. But we continue to demonstrate our ability to drive strong operating performance through the elements within our control. We are doing this while still investing in the long-term as evidenced by our continued expansion into new areas, such as energy and agriculture, and a strong new pipeline like with the Hybrid DI. We are well aligned with the biggest mega trends that, I believe, are driving the world today and in the future. The population and wealth growth of what we call the new, new world will continue putting incredible pressure and demands on food, water, energy and industrial infrastructure. From CPT to the transformational Tyco Flow deal, we continue to better position Pentair to serve this new world. In addition, we remain committed to organic investments for growth in serving these attractive trends, sustaining higher R&D investments to deliver customers what they need, including better efficiency, sustainability, automation and safety. With that, I’ll turn the call over to John.
John Stauch: Thank you, Randy. Please turn to slide number 10, labeled first half and full year operating margins. Let me begin on the left hand side of the chart. As Randy mentioned previously, we expanded Pentair adjusted operating margin by 100 basis points in the second quarter versus last year. Tech Products led the way with 290 basis points of margin expansion, while Water delivered 50 basis points of expansion. Adjusting for the last quarter of the CPT acquisition headwind, which was 70 basis points, Water delivered around 120 basis points of margin expansion. Both Water and Technical Products benefited from acceleration of PIMS and Lean initiatives, proactive pricing actions, lower raw material costs, value engineering efforts, prioritized investments and previously taken repositioning actions. We continue to focus on four wall accountability and we are raising the expectations of the plants and businesses and they are responding with thoughtful projects that are yielding significant results. Also a benefit in the quarter in both segment were more significant contributions in income from fast growth regions. Our efforts to localize sales, marketing, engineering, sourcing and manufacturing in these regions is being rewarded. As we look at the full year expectations for 2012, we see most of the trends from Q2 remaining consistent into the second half of the year. We expect the top-line contribution to be a little lighter than previously anticipated due to FX translation, not just in Europe, but also in Brazil, Canada and India back to the U.S. dollar. While the top-line impact of FX was nearly 27 million in the second quarter, the estimated impact of the bottom-line was only about $0.02 of EPS due to the fact that we benefited from transactional FX, in some cases, as well as we were proactive in taking out costs in most regions affected. For the full year, the impact of FX on year-over-year basis is forecasted around $90 million or about 2.5 points of top-line impact. In addition to FX, Western Europe represents just under 15% of our overall revenue. In total, we are now forecasting Western European volumes to be down around 6% to 7% for the full year affecting the top line for Pentair by just under a point. While China has received a lot of attention for slowing, and no doubt it has, we continue to make progress in fast growth regions with year-to-date revenue in total fast growth, up just over 20%, and anticipated to grow 20% for the year and finish greater than 20% of Pentair’s total revenue base. We still believe fast growth regions long-term are the right place to be positioned, and while one or two geographies every year may not experience double digit growth, because of our product offering, lower share position and investments locally; we believe we are well positioned to grow double digit and fast growth as a whole for the next several years. So, in summary for operating margins, we have done nicely for the first half. We expect Europe and China to be sluggish into the second half, FX to continue as a headwind, price to be maintained, and raw material inflation to be moderate. We feel we can control our own destiny and deliver a second half and full year operating performance, while we anticipate the closing and integration of the Tyco Flow businesses. Please turn to slide number 11, labeled balance sheet and cash flow. We had a strong cash flow quarter, as anticipated. We delivered $222 million in cash flow for the quarter, which is about $40 million more cash than we delivered in the second quarter of 2011. Working capital was strong, as is typical in our second quarter, which is when we collect unreceivables from the early buy season in our pool business. Net debt ended the second quarter at about $1.35 billion slightly better than forecasted. It’s setting us up nicely for the anticipated closing of our proposed merger with Tyco Flow. ROIC improved to 9.3%, still below our long-term expectations of 15%, but on pace for double digit by the end of the year. Please turn to slide number 12, labeled third quarter Pentair outlook. Our third quarter Pentair outlook assumes that the overall economy does not get much better. Volume growth in Europe in the second quarter was down about 10%, which was consistent with the first quarter. Sequentially the second quarter is about the same as the first quarter, so it did not really deteriorate. It just did not get better. Our forecast for the third and fourth quarter assumes the same general global economic picture with the only deterioration, a moderating North American industrial outlook as capital spending tightens. With that as a backdrop, we expect third quarter sales to be up around 1% to 3% organically or close to up 3% to 5%, excluding the impact of 2 to 3 points of FX headwind. Increases in volume are expected in Water, where CPT is now contributing to organic sales and a healthy backlog of global industrial projects related to CO2 recovery and Beer Membrane filtration systems, as well as water reuse projects for large industrial customers. Also accelerating are energy separation projects, aquaculture applications, and global agriculture systems. Easier comparisons in Europe will also help Water, primarily in the water purification business. Order trends and building backlog in municipal infrastructure should result in revenue growth in that segment in the second half, versus declines in the first half. For technical products we expect top line growth to continue to be challenging as North American industrial revenue expansion slows from plus 7% in the first half of the year to plus 3% to 4% for the second half of the year, as well as datacom, communications, and general electronics globally experiencing close to double-digit declines on lower capital investment. European headwinds are expected to continue through the third quarter and should ease a little as we close out the year. Overall, Pentair adjusted operating income, before any impact of the Tyco Flow merger, is expected to be up 4% to 8%, and adjusted operating margins should be up around 60 basis points year-over-year as productivity continues to contribute to bottom line expansion. Overall adjusted EPS is expected to be between $0.61 to $0.63, reflecting lower contributions, as is normal, from Aquatics due to the end of season sell-through and the typical impact of Western European shutdowns for the month of August. Third quarter performance should set us up nicely for closing out the year and achieving our full year expectations. Please turn to my last slide, labeled full year 2012 outlook. For the full year, we have tweaked our guidance by raising the bottom of the range by a nickel to $2.70, reflecting second quarter performance and our current outlook for the second half. We have adjusted the top end of the range to $2.76 from $2.80, reflecting impact from FX. Overall, our new adjusted EPS outlook is $2.70 to $2.76, reflecting a full year EPS expansion of 12% to 15%. Driven by top line expansion of four to five points, and overall margin expansion about 70 basis points, or around 100 basis points excluding impact of CPT, and in line with our productivity expectations and previous performance history. Free cash flow is expected to exceed 100% of net income and be greater than 270 million for the year. Katie, can we please take our first question?
Operator: Absolutely. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg from Vertical Research. Your line is now open.
Jim Lucas: Brian?
Randy Hogan: We cannot hear you, Brian.
John Stauch: Brian?
Operator: Mr. Konigsberg, if your line is on mute, would you please un-mute.
Brian Konigsberg – Vertical Research: Can you hear me? Hello?
Randy Hogan: Yes, we can now.
Brian Konigsberg – Vertical Research: Okay. Sorry about that.
Randy Hogan: No problem.
Brian Konigsberg – Vertical Research: Just first question on Technical Products, great quarter. Margins at 20%, I think that is a record from what I could tell. I’m just curious, with the volumes under a bit of pressure, what are the chances you get push back from your distributor base asking for a price concessions, given that also some of the commodities are seeing some relief.
Randy Hogan: There is always a risk of that in major project settings. But one of the great things about the structure of our industry is when you sell through distribution the prices kind of roll through. We don’t do surcharging. Everything goes into the base. So we always assume that in our – that there will be some erosion due to the larger projects. But in terms of the flow business, stuff that really just flows through distribution, it’s a virtuous situation. Distributors benefit from price increases as well.
Brian Konigsberg – Vertical Research: Got it. And just moving over to Europe, what gives you confidence that you should see stabilization in the second half of the year? And I think you made a comment that the weakening Euro is spurring a little bit of a demand. Can you maybe just give some color on how much benefit you are seeing from that and what do you expect in the second half?
Randy Hogan: Yes. The biggest factor in the second half for Europe is that a lot of our European business saw the decline last year, saw some precipitous declines in the third and fourth quarter. So the comps are easier. So we are not saying that things get better. We just said that year-over-year it doesn’t look as bad, I would say the biggest factor there. That’s particularly true in Water Purification. And you want to talk about the lower Euro helps our exports, right?
John Stauch: Yeah. I mean – we are not yet at a point where the Euro is low enough where I think we see the benefit. I mean, when we saw it under 120 last time, we saw a pretty significant pick up in exports. So we’re not calling for that or planning for that in the second half. But we do buy projects or buy products from Europe and we are absolutely seeing a transactional benefit of purchasing, drives for instance, and our IntelliFlo pumps come from Europe. And we also cross ship and sell into the U.S. technical products. So I think we’ve got the foreign exchange, although it’s a headline on the top line. I think we’ve got it managed on the cost position well. And just to reiterate what Randy said, I mean, we’re not looking for a pick up. Matter of fact, Q3 will be down sequentially as normal because of the August shut down, which is typical in Europe. And then as Randy mentioned, starting in September of last year, we saw a significant decline in our water businesses. So I think we’ve framed it appropriately and obviously we’re not looking for a pick up.
Randy Hogan: And if I could just add one more thing, China and Europe or Western Europe are pretty light, I mean, Western Europe is the largest – a very large export market for China, which is affecting China. And a lot of the European exports, particularly the German exports, go into China to help drive manufacturing investment, or to support manufacturing investment. So weaker China, even with a lower Euro, it doesn’t mean that there will be a huge demand increase for European – for the OEMs that we serve in Europe. So anyway that’s the way we’re thinking about it.
Brian Konigsberg – Vertical Research: Great. Thank you very much.
Randy Hogan: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Brett Lindsay – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Hi, good morning, this is Brett Lindsay stepping in for Jeff.
Randy Hogan: Hey, Brett.
Brett Lindsay – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Hey, just on the restructuring plans, which businesses in the quarter were most impacted from some of these initiatives weighted between Water and Technical Products?
John Stauch: Yes. We took, if you think about it, it’s a third roughly in Tech Products where we took some actions in Europe based upon proactively assessing where the volumes were at. And two thirds of it would be Water and we again more heavily weighted to Europe and the sense of rightsizing the volume on anticipated lower demand.
Brett Lindsay – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. And then you mentioned in your comments about moderation in North America. Could you just talk in a little bit more detail around the puts and takes domestically where you might be seeing signs of deceleration within the business?
Randy Hogan: Yes. Industrial is the place where we are seeing deceleration and which we see a little bit in the Water and more in Tech Products. At the same time we think Residential, and Municipal, and Commercial have – we see some encouraging signs in that. Not huge volume necessarily. But certainly as we mentioned in Municipal, we expect to see actually an increase in volume sales in the fourth quarter. But some of the programs that we have in Residential I think are quite promising to help us drive growth and Residential is clearly coming off the bottom now.
John Stauch: I mean, just to put some context there. I mean, we are really saying that high single-digits in North American industrial slows to 3 to 4 points of growth, which I think is a probably more normalized long term growth rate. In Residential, if you really look at it, we’ve got two businesses Water Purification and our Pool business that are in the high single-digits and we’ve been impacted on the retail side of flood related products to the tune of down 30% year-over-year. So, we have seen a recovery in the Residential in two of our three businesses. And we’re expecting those year-over-year comparisons in the retail side to mitigate at some point here, and I think you’ll see the residential growth start to accelerate.
Brett Lindsay – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay, great. I’ll get back in queue. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Hamzah Mazari – Credit Suisse: Good morning. Thank you. The first question...
Randy Hogan: Hi.
Hamzah Mazari – Credit Suisse: Hey. The first question is just on repositioning actions and spend. Maybe if you could talk about get into some more detail on what are some of the actions you are taking? How much are you spending there? And how that ramps up through the balance of the year?
Randy Hogan: Yeah. If you look at the two charts, you can see the $7 million on the Water chart and the $3 million, and it’s really – it’s all about people. It’s basically to pay for the reduction in force, which is as you know more expensive in Europe. But we expect, John, the benefits would start reading out fairly quickly.
John Stauch: Yeah. Q3, Q4 next year and think of the pay back being 40% to 50% of the expected reduction. I think – to put it in context, we look at delivering the long-term goals with the type of merger is delivering the base. Making sure that the synergies are additive to that base and then our bolt-on acquisitions would be additive to those numbers and think of this as securing the base in wake of what is now a slightly slower Europe than expected, and making sure that we’re staying out ahead of the cost actions to stay competitive.
Hamzah Mazari – Credit Suisse: All right. And just on the Tyco deal, you know that deal obviously closes in Q3. But maybe if you could share when you think you will be in a position to talk more in detail on revenue synergies and sort of the top-line opportunity out of that deal. I know you’ve already highlighted the cost side.
Randy Hogan: Yeah. We –as we’ve been allowed – to the extent we’ve been able to work together and get into the details we still feel very good about our plan, we still feel very good about the strategy. What I’d like to – what we are planning to doing is bringing the teams from both sides together as soon after closing – like that first week. And then probably back to you in terms of – in terms of detailed guidance and then probably have an analyst meeting probably pull it into November-December somewhere in there where we will bring everyone together and we’ll go through things in detail.
Hamzah Mazari – Credit Suisse: Great. And just the last question. On weather, maybe if you could remind us on how that’s impacted your business this year. You mentioned the flood side, flood being slower. Maybe any other businesses where you saw pull forward due to weather or any other impact as we think about your business next year?
Randy Hogan: In terms of the – as you know the Pool business got off to an early season in the first quarter, the first quarter was – it came out like we thought. The first quarter was stronger and we got the 8% growth in the second quarter here and as we look at the first half it was just what we thought it would be. So we feel good about that. We had floods both in Europe and in the U.S. in the spring last year, in 2011, and didn’t have either this year. So, I don’t John how much is...
John Stauch: I mean, our flood related SKUs, put in context, are down 30% year-over-year. So that gives you a context. I mean, it’s hitting our Water business by roughly 2 to 3 points on a year-over-year basis. We don’t have any anticipated weather in the second half. We’re not weather forecasters here. So we’ve kept things consistent with where they’ve been sequentially.
Randy Hogan: Price sold pumps in Minnesota this morning, early this afternoon. They had three inches of rain this morning.
Hamzah Mazari – Credit Suisse: All right. Perfect. That’s good color. I appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois from Longbow Research. Your line is now open.
Garik Shmois – Longbow Research: Thank you. Just wondering if you can give us a little bit more color on how the sales trends progressed as you moved through the second quarter, April, May and June, that would be helpful.
John Stauch: We track them all along, I mean, we didn’t see any different or uniqueness. June finished fairly strong. April and May were consistent with what our expectations were. So as far as color, I mean, we anticipated some challenges and things played out pretty much as expected except for the currency and Europe not getting better versus Q1.
Garik Shmois – Longbow Research: Okay. So there wasn’t any market deceleration as you moved through the second quarter.
John Stauch: Not as we see it.
Garik Shmois – Longbow Research: Great. And then just secondly, you identified a number of new projects looking out over the next several years. As a result of CPT, the desal project in Saudi Arabia. I was wondering if you can maybe put some numbers around these new project opportunities, maybe on annual basis, anticipated revenue growth just so we can get an idea of the order of magnitude that we’re looking at from these projects that you’ve highlighted.
John Stauch: I’ll just give you the numbers piece first and then I’ll let Randy kind of fill in the color. I mean, we’ve got a really growing robust backlog in our CPT related project businesses. And as we mentioned on the last several calls we’ve been in the transition of moving away from the muni projects, except for desel where we have a really nice product offering, and transitioning into more water reuse and CO2 recovery and Beer Membrane filtration industrial side. We are targeting north of 10% growth on what is now north of $300 million annual basis and you should think of the backlog or the project deck being multiple times that as you would expect leakage in that project and the push out of the projects. So that gives you an idea of what we are targeting and kind of where our backlog is. And I will let Randy put in the color where we...
Randy Hogan: Yes. And the way I like to think about it is we bought CPT to have double-digit growth, $240 million in sales, that double-digit growth would be $24 million a year. I think a lot of that is from the new applications and it’s in the $20 million to $30 million range. We are making a lot of progress in Dairy. We were making a lot of progress in as – we mentioned – we mentioned a framework agreement, which is kind of interesting it’s the same sort of approach that Tyco Flow Control uses in the energy side using big frame agreements to look at multiyear relationships. We see some real opportunities to do that in food and beverage. We see some real opportunities to do that in what I would call industrial water. So and that’s where, as John mentioned, water reuse. Water reuse is – we have the technology. We have systems. We believe water reuse. We just look at the droughts and look at the issues being caused by lack of water. People – the industrials are going to be the first people that are serious about taking care of water, so we really see that technology being useful there. So I think about it in terms of $20 million to $30 million kind of a growth a year. On top of that, I believe there is at least that – there is another $20 million or so that’s in the water purification area. That’s why we focus so much on the filtration side. We are very – I’m very bullish on Hybrid DI. I think, I said before it’s not an iPad, but we’re going to work like hell to make it one. It really can be a game changer in terms of Residential and Commercial.
Garik Shmois – Longbow Research: Okay, great. Thank you for the color.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Barry from UBS. Your line is now open.
Robert Barry – UBS: Hi, guys, good morning.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Randy Hogan: Good morning.
Robert Barry – UBS: Question on the Technical Products margins. Is that communications revenue that’s been weak especially low margin?
John Stauch: Yes.
Randy Hogan: Yes.
John Stauch: There is a mix benefit, no doubt about it.
Robert Barry – UBS: I guess that was my question, I’m trying to unpack like where in the walk the mix comes in, is it under productivity price, and how big is it?
Randy Hogan: It would show up in productivity, yeah.
John Stauch: If I was estimating it, you can’t be precise on that, but I would say it’s anywhere from 70 to 80 basis points of mixed benefit. If you think of it in areas that we’ve been challenged, I mean, our European businesses don’t have the margins that our North American business does in Technical Products. And the communications side, which is OEM and project related work, especially towards the tail end of those projects where the volumes aren’t where they used to be, tend to be very low margin.
Robert Barry – UBS: Got you. So it sounds like there is still some room that you’re actually raising price on kind of a like-for-like product basis?
Randy Hogan: Yeah. There was definitely price and there was definitely productivity. And that was 270 basis points...
John Stauch: 220 net.
Randy Hogan: To 220 net. You take out the 80 and we’re still up 140. So price plus...
John Stauch: It’s 290 minus 80 would be about 210 and that would reflect the ongoing price.
Robert Barry – UBS: And then I just wanted...
John Stauch: But I think – just to follow up on that. I mean, one of the things Randy is challenging this business for sometime about is, we don’t need to continue to chase these large telecommunication businesses. So as we build the factories and start to fill the international locations, we’re looking more for that steady margin, industrial energy and infrastructure.
Randy Hogan: And that’s what exciting about when you see we are adding 20 distributors in China and we are getting 30% distribution growth in China. That telecom project that we are finally getting out of was one we took back during the financial crisis to fill the factory. I mean, so this is what happens when you don’t have lane discipline, and by the way we were on board with that decision at that time.
Robert Barry – UBS: Yeah. So it’s not like – it’s a benefit that unwinds?
Randy Hogan: Correct. Right.
Robert Barry – UBS: Yeah. And I just also just wanted to follow-up on Pool and you touched on it little bit earlier. The growth decelerated quarter-to-quarter still good, but decelerated a lot versus a much easier comp. I mean – and you also had that deal, I think the Brazil acquisition in there. I’m curious how much that added and how you are thinking about Pool given the deceleration from quarter-to-quarter.
John Stauch: Brazil was a rounding error, Rob. I mean, with the time you take to add in the revenue less the foreign exchange in the Real, I mean, maybe less than a $1 million.
Randy Hogan: (Inaudible) the inventory...
John Stauch: We are just getting it up and then we’ve got an inventory impact. Yeah, I mean, I think it’s hard to call upper-single digit 8% growth in a business that’s not seeing an increase in installed base, and our Pool permits today are 80% or down 80% from where they were at the peak. So we are not seeing a substantial amount of increase in Pool builds, but we are seeing an increase in content from the energy efficiency line that we are adding.
Randy Hogan: Yeah. The point about the good secular trends that I talked about in my script remains true. I mean, it actually as housing stabilizes particularly as the Florida market has stabilized and houses start to turn and people start fixing their pools. I’m not worried about Pool at all.
Robert Barry – UBS: Yeah, do you think the second quarter growth is (inaudible).
John Stauch: Well, as I said, I kind of looked at the first quarter as the weather was so good that had to be – couldn’t continue that we thought there was (inaudible) from second quarter. We planned, we thought that way and in fact it was. So we kind of look at the first half and say, yeah, it was about like we thought it should be.
Robert Barry – UBS: Got you. Okay. Thank you.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray from Citi Research. Your line is now open.
Deane Dray – Citi Research: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Deane Dray – Citi Research: And also best wishes to Jim and his new role. First question on the Pool, just to follow-up on Rob’s questions on the Pool side, in adding these new dealers, was there any channel fill benefit that was meaningful in the quarter?
Randy Hogan: Not really. Our dealers are really pool builders and so they basically pull through Pool Corp or whatever distributor they work with, as they do a service on a pool, rebuild or build an actual pool. So there aren’t that many of them that stock and they are particularly – the ones we added are smaller ones, so they particularly don’t really stock.
John Stauch: But we do look at it as way to gain more content in the overall market Deane, and so we hope that that has a sustainable impact on the growth rate long-term.
Deane Dray – Citi Research: And then do you have a sense of how much the – some of these green products, the IntelliFlo, have contributed to the top line. And just if you kind of parse out what the year-over-year is? How much of that are these green products?
Randy Hogan: The IntelliFlo grew 30% in the quarter. It’s now...
John Stauch: 35% of the overall...
Randy Hogan: The whole Eco Select product line, all of what we call the green Eco Select bottom line is 35% of our growth, and it’s been growing at least twice the rate of the overall business. So it’s been a big part of it.
John Stauch: And Deane, just as we shared with you or shared with everyone earlier, the overall market is not growing. So we definitely think that this Eco Select line is helping us grow double-digit, high single-digits in what is not necessarily a robust market.
Deane Dray – Citi Research: Great. And then over on the CPT side, it sounds as though you have got some new products or some new business on the beverage side in China. So we were at the Singapore water tradeshow a few weeks ago and there was a lot of buzz about what the opportunities are for CPT in China, and specifically on the beverage side. So how does that business look? Are you displacing competitors there? Or is it just better distribution into China? Just give us an update if you could?
Randy Hogan: I think it’s the advancement of the technology as they continue to build out what I would call more world class food and beverage capability. As you know, their dairy business is going through quite a cathartic change and so bringing in more world class technology is where we see it. Also, Beer Membranes versus the (inaudible) approach and getting these relationships with these brewers and these dairies are really the opportunities. I think less of it as takeaway as terms of just getting the growth.
Deane Dray – Citi Research: Great. And then I might have missed this, but on the repositioning actions, can you comment on what the payback period is? If you’re doing this in Europe, typically that’s a little bit more extended than North America. But what can you quantify the payback?
John Stauch: Yeah. It’s about 4 million to 5 million total payback. And we expect it to start – annually – so we expect to start within Q3, Q4, so (inaudible).
Deane Dray – Citi Research: So we would start seeing the savings in what quarter?
John Stauch: Starting in Q3.
Deane Dray – Citi Research: Of this year?
John Stauch: Yes.
Deane Dray – Citi Research: Okay. Thank you.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Wherley from Janney Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Mike Wherley – Janney Capital Markets: Good morning, guys. I was just wondering, if you could give us a little more detail on what you’re seeing in muni, you said that you’re getting some improvements there, and I just wonder if you could give a little bit more detail.
John Stauch: Yeah. Let me, just give the first piece and then I’ll let Randy share with you. For the first half of the year to put in context, our overall global infrastructure in muni was down about 5% to 7% year-over-year, and so what we’re now – sales. So now what we’re heading into is a growing backlog in order rate in which we think that at least is not negative in the back half of the year.
Randy Hogan: When we look at it, we look at orders when we look at backlog. The backlog is actually up 32% as we exit the quarter versus a year ago, which is good. And the first half orders are up 6%. The second quarter was up 20%. So – and if we look at – if you will, the quote activity right now, it’s up over two times. So, we view that as all good signs. We secured everything that’s in order. We secured and we know when that ships, that’s why we feel like the fourth quarter we’ll be up in municipal and the first half of next year. So as I said, is this another dead cat bounce in this market? And that’s why we’re not saying it’s – we feel good about it, but I am not calling the bottom yet.
Mike Wherley – Janney Capital Markets: Do you – what do you attribute this big pick up to? I mean, do you think that these cities have just put this off too long?
Randy Hogan: No. I view it as break and fix. What happened was the stimulus – we are – this is primarily in the pump business and it’s primarily North America. We are making progress outside North America in this business, but the big changes – the stimulus package that the government –U.S. government had pulled ahead a bunch of investments. It basically paid for stuff and as soon as that money ran out, everything stopped. And then what happens is in the municipal world – I mean, our strategy has always been in municipal in U.S. is a break and fix world. It’s not – they’ve never priced to the point where they do what we would call state-of-the-art kind of investment and maintenance. They just don’t price water that way in the U.S. So what they do is when things break they fix it. And so it’s a break and fix world and they can only put that off for so long. So that’s what we believe is – they pulled ahead of a bunch of stuff when the U.S. government was paying and then it stopped, and now they can’t put it off any more.
Mike Wherley – Janney Capital Markets: Okay. Thanks a lot guys.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Drab from William Blair. Your line is now open.
Randy Hogan: Hey, Brian.
Brian Drab – William Blair: Good morning. I just have one question at this point. On the Ag space, can you talk a little bit more about that business? And Randy said you’re gaining share there at 13% growth. What’s that market then growing and as secondary question, are you seeing any pressure on that business given some of the restrictions around irrigation given the drought?
Randy Hogan: The answer to the second question is yes. In certain areas of the Midwest, which are big irrigation areas, there are some restrictions, which haven’t read through to our order rate yet, but could do. Although it could favor more wells, well pumps as opposed to surface water pumps. The reason we think the business is up maybe around 10, so up around 13. We think the share gain – we know that we have added distributors and we’re up a lot with those distributors in some areas in the Midwest where we’re frankly under penetrated and under covered in the Midwest and Texas. We’ve also raised our service levels in California so we know our order rate there is very good. So those are the sources of why we feel good about the share gain because we can see it in different regions where we’ve had lower market share.
Brian Drab – William Blair: Okay. And roughly what is the revenue in that business quarterly at this point?
John Stauch: It represents about 5% to 6% of our overall Pentair revenues.
Brian Drab – William Blair: Of total company rev.
John Stauch: Correct.
Brian Drab – William Blair: Okay. All right. Thank you.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham from Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Scott Graham – Jefferies: Good morning.
John Stauch: Hey, Scott.
Scott Graham – Jefferies: Just wanted to see if you would share with us kind of the same type of analysis that you just did on muni with respect to resi. Maybe kind of how orders progress during the quarter? What are you seeing out there because there is a lot of distribution out there? What are your distributors telling you? Resi looks like it’s picking up in some of the macro data, but is it starting to pick up in your business as well?
John Stauch: As I mentioned earlier, Scott, I will break into the three components and think of this as roughly a third, a third, a third. You know, a third being our water purification business, which is seeing definitely a pickup in orders and shipments in North American residential. And I would put that more in the mid- to high single-digit range. Pool as we mentioned earlier experienced double-digit for the first half and eight in the Q2 and we have it in sort of the 5% to 7% range for the rest of the year. Now that is a season that starts to dwindle off here, so it’s not really an indicator. And then we are experiencing this headwind in the flood side of residential flow, but if you take the pump business that goes into well, which benefits from the drought season, again, we are seeing an uptick in the orders somewhere in that 5% to 7% range. So definitely movement in residential, certainly a long way from the top, but starting to feel like we are seeing some recovery.
Scott Graham – Jefferies: True. And I probably should have been more specific on that. The water purification business is certainly the one that’s certainly most intriguing. That is a little bit of a higher margin business for you as well, is that correct than some of your other businesses in water?
John Stauch: Correct.
Randy Hogan: Correct.
Scott Graham – Jefferies: Okay. Very good. That’s all I had. Thank you.
John Stauch: Thank you, Scott.

Jim Lucas: Any questions left, operator?
Operator: Yes, we do have a few more questions.
Jim Lucas: Okay, Katie.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Randy Hogan: Hi, Chris.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer: Hey. Wanted to look at reuse from a high level, a couple years ago you talked about the Twins stadium installation as a reference site. We’re hearing about a lot of new regulations in fracking, you mentioned industrial reuse. Can you comment on the market opportunity you see there and the traction that you’re seeing?
Randy Hogan: Yeah. I mean, we are very small in fracking, but we have had a win there in terms of pumps and treatment. We are working on gaining better access to that market because we do have technology. The big opportunities we see are where we are strong in food and beverage. Where we can get – we can reduce there – that’s one of the exciting parts of dairy is to actually reduce their water use. And the other one is in the produced water area, again and that’s regarding fracking when this stuff comes back up, it’s taking that water and cleaning it and reusing it. That’s a very promising area for us.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer: Great. Thank you.
Randy Hogan: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Rose from Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.
David Rose – Wedbush Securities: Good morning. Most of my questions have been asked. I do have a follow-up on CPT. Just trying to get a better idea of sort of the pricing discipline and overall discipline when you put in CPT and what we can expect for margin improvement in 2013, given that you have a lot of system orders in place, you start to benefit from the consumable side at some point. Do we see any benefit in pricing discipline to some of the actions you’ve taken at Lean? And then three, any benefit from consumable sales in 2013 or ‘14? And as a corollary to all of this, is there any distraction from Tyco’s merger as it relates to the integration process with CPT.
Randy Hogan: Let me start with that one, because I didn’t put this in the script. But I’m very proud of how well the Pentair team has stayed focused on execution, while all of this other work is going on in terms of the Tyco integration. It’s very impressive and I thank everybody at Pentair for the great job they have done with that. There will be a time when there is going to be more. Right now we don’t have a lot of discussions going on for legal reasons between go-to-market sides of the Tyco and the Pentair, because that has to wait until proper regulatory approvals. So there will be a time when there is going to be more of that and we are very watchful to make sure we don’t take our eye either off the Tyco core business or the Pentair core business. That’s why, as John said, that’s why our focus is on firming up our core. In terms of CPT, we have instituted different pricing mechanisms in pricing. There was an approach to basically make money on the membrane and sell the system at cost and just make the money on the membrane. We don’t take that approach. We want to make money on the systems too and so we winning with better pricing, so that’s going to read through as we ship those. And in terms of productivity, some of the restructuring we did actually is related to CPT as we’ve gotten to the point where Lean is having an impact. We either fill the factories with additional business or we take costs out, so some of the repositioning is actually related to CPT, so we can get some of the benefits from Lean to actually go to the bottom-line. I don’t know John if you want to...
John Stauch: Yeah. I would just add. I mean, to answer your question, I think of it is 200 to 250 basis points a year for the next couple of years, and that’s both from the integration of the back office, the pricing disciplines that Randy mentioned, the better positioning of products into industrial versus muni. And then just a lot of the Lean activities that are really starting to read out and as they embrace it.
David Rose – Wedbush Securities: Okay. Thanks. And then lastly, can you provide us with the backlog figure for CPT? You did I think in the last quarter.
Randy Hogan: I don’t have that right here.
John Stauch: I don’t have it with me either.
David Rose – Wedbush Securities: Okay. Well, I can follow-up afterwards.
John Stauch: I will follow up with you off-line.
David Rose – Wedbush Securities: Okay. Thank you both.
Randy Hogan: Thank you.
Operator: We have no further questions in queue. I’ll turn the call back over to the presenters.
Randy Hogan: All right. Thank you very much. There will be a call-in number, do you have the call-in number, operator?
Operator: I sure do. The playback for this call will be made available to you on July 25, 2012 at 5:00 P.M. Eastern. So to access that recording please dial 855-859-2059 or 404-537-3406 and enter the conference ID.

Operator: Good morning, my name is Simon, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Pentair Q1 2012 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks, there will be a question and answer session. (Operator Instructions).  Ms. Zawoyski, you may begin your conference. 
Sara Zawoyski: Thanks, Simon, and welcome to Pentair's Q1 2012 earnings conference call. We're glad you could join us. I'm Sara Zawoyski, Head of Investor Relations, and with me today is Randy Hogan, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Stauch, our Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, we will provide details on our Q1 2012 performance as well as our full-year 2012 outlook, as outlined in this morning's release. Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as the risks outlined in Pentair's 10-K for the quarter ended December 31, 2011, and today's release. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today, and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results. Today's webcast is accompanied by a presentation, which can be found in the Investors section of Pentair's website. We will reference these slides throughout our prepared remarks. All references today will be on an adjusted basis unless otherwise indicated, for which non-GAAP financials are reconciled in the appendix of the presentation. I’d like to also point out that the Q2 and full-year outlook does not include any future impact related to the pending Tyco Flow deal that we announced on March 28, as stated in this morning’s release. And we’ll be sure to reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. With that, Randy. 
Randy Hogan: Thanks, Sara, and good morning, everyone. Before we get in to the Q1 Pentair performance, I’d like to touch on the announced merger with the Tyco Flow Control, beginning with a quick refresher on Slide 3.  We’re very excited about the proposed Tyco Flow Control merger announced at the end of March. We believe this transaction is a great strategic fit, increasing our global presence and exposure to high-growth attractive sectors.  We’re confident in achieving our previously-announced financial targets, making the transaction very compelling, with $200 million of expected operational cost synergies and enhanced growth prospects and a stronger balance sheet. By any measure, the new Pentair will be a stronger company with exciting platforms for future growth and substantial value creation opportunities for all stakeholders. Let me provide an update on the transaction timeline, what we’ve been up to in the last 26 days, and what’s still to come.  From a regulatory perspective, we completed the HSR filing last week, and now we’re in a waiting period with several other regulatory filings under way in foreign jurisdictions.  We’ve established a integration management office and announced Todd Gleason, a proven Pentair executive, who many of you know, to drive a global integration planning, reporting directly to me. He will lead a team of approximately 25 to 40, functional and business unit team leaders, including those from Tyco Flow Control, once the transaction closes. These initial integration planning efforts will be critical as we ramp up towards the expected close at the end of September. From a business reporting structure, our intent is to add the three Tyco Flow businesses, led by their current business leaders, to Pentair’s existing five businesses, and report these eight global business units, or GBUs, in three segments. The three segments are Equipment Protection, Flow Control, and Water and Fluid.  Importantly, the GBU leaders will be focusing on, and held accountable for their business unit performance, while the integration team will work closely with them, and with corporate to help ensure we achieve these synergies.  Shortly, we’ll be filing the preliminary proxy statement in Form F-4 for SEC review. This will contain more detailed information regarding the transaction and the filings expected by early May. Still to come, our other customary regulatory approvals, mainly foreign, and of course, Pentair and Tyco International shareholder approvals.  So we’re off to a good start in the planning for the pending combination with Tyco’s Flow Control business. As we work through these regulatory approvals and SEC filings, we’re limited in further commenting on the transaction. So we’d ask you to keep your questions focused on today’s main topic, our Q1 performance and outlook for the year. Now let me turn to the focus of this morning’s call; Pentair’s first quarter performance, and let’s start on Slide 4.  The operating performance was solid in the quarter; we grew sales 9%, expanded adjusted operating margins, drove operating profits up 10%, and delivered adjusted EPS of $0.64, which was up 23%.  While lower flood-related pump sales and further weakness in Western Europe tempered top-line growth in the quarter by roughly 4 points, we saw continued strength in many of the sectors we serve; industrial, agricultural, energy and pool, we’re all up double-digits in the quarter, with new products and expanded coverage helping propel our growth. Fast growth region sales were off to a slower start, but still grew faster than the overall Pentair. We continue to expect double-digit growth for the full-year in fast-growth regions, as we execute and have success with our growth plans. Margins increased another 20 basis points to 11.3% in the first quarter, better than we planned, even if sales were not. Our teams did a nice job driving greater productivity and executing pricing actions to offset material inflation and fund growth investments. I’m particularly proud of our Reynosa, Mexico operations team, who was recently recognized with a silver medallion Shingo prize award, that’s like the Nobel prize for top lean enterprise companies. It’s a great award.  In Q1, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.64 compared to the $0.52 in the prior year, reflecting solid operating performance across both segments, along with an unforecasted $0.07 tax-related benefit, which is the main driver of our updated earnings outlook for 2012.  On cash flow, we reported a net cash usage, as is typical in our first quarter, but we’re on track to convert more 100% of net income to free cash flow, something we’ve done consistently eight out of the last ten years.  All in, we delivered another quarter of solid operating performance with well-executed productivity initiatives, good price realization, and continued growth investments, which we believe positions us well for growth in 2012 and beyond. Now let’s turn to Slide 5 for a review of our Water and Fluid Solution segment performance. Water and Fluid Solution sales grew 14% year-over-year in the quarter, largely driven by the CPT acquisition, which added $68 million in sales. Excluding CPT, Water and Fluid sales grew 2% in local currency. Price realization was good, up 2%. Growth was impressive in Pool and Process Technologies, but lower flood related pump sales in a weaker Western Europe, tempered top-line growth in the quarter by roughly 5 points in this segment. As we announced early this year, we repositioned our Water business to better capture the CPT cost synergies, address the realities in the developed markets and support global growth. We combined our two flow businesses, Residential and Engineered Flow in to one business, which we now call Flow Technologies, and aligned our other businesses under Treatment and Process, that includes Water Purification and Process Technologies, and Aquatics, the new name for pool.  I’ll go through each starting with the newly-combined Flow business. In Flow, sales decreased 3%, or 8% excluding CPT and foreign exchange. Due to a unseasonably dry winter and start to spring, flood-related residential pumps were down an estimated $15 million year-over-year. Additionally, as expected, municipal project pump sales remain soft, down roughly $10 million versus prior year. The remainder of the Pump portfolio performed well, with agricultural equipment sales up over 20% in the quarter and good growth in our commercial, fire and HVAC pumps.  We’re seeing early successes of a broader integrated global pump portfolio. We’re increasing penetration and distribution in places like South America and South East Asia, and winning new orders through combined Pentair CPT sales efforts, in Qatar, Romania, and Kuwait for example, all helping to boost pump backlog over 12% from year end. I believe we’ve only just begun to see the benefits of our combined sales coverage, technology platforms and product portfolios in Flow Technologies. Within treatment and process, water purification sales were flat year-over-year in local currency. Fast growth region sales continued to grow at double digits, with India more than doubling again, as we expanded coverage and added new products.  In contrast, sales in developed regions were down 6% in the quarter, largely in line with our expectations, as channel and discretionary pressures in residential softer components continued. Importantly, we did see U.S. inventory levels stabilize in European distributor sentiment improve from the October and November low points.  New product launches remain on track, including a new treatment valve in Q2, and our industry changing innovation, Hybrid DI. This product, Hybrid DI, is scheduled for a limited launch in late June, with a broader launch in Q3. The Hybrid DI innovation system combines the benefits of reverse osmosis, or RO filtration, with those of a water softener, using compasitive DI innovation to remove hardness and total dissolve solids from water, all without employing salt. In addition to residential use, this ground breaking system can be used in a wide range of applications, including at hotels and restaurants, and the broader commercial sector. We’re excited about all these applications for this new product. In process technologies, sales were up 97%, were up 12% excluding CPT, and 14% excluding foreign exchange. Across the board, energy, food service, and advanced water systems, all posted double-digit growth in the quarter. Within Advanced Water Systems, we continue to see nice growth and desalination through the distribution channel, along with some project work.  Food service has steadily added to sales each quarter as we grow with channel distribution partners and restaurant chains, especially the multinationals. We also continue to expand reach, globally and within key verticals, for example growing in Turkey, and adding new customers in convenience stores. Most notably, system sales and energy grew an impressive 41% in the quarter, as we pursue larger system sales, penetrate new applications within refineries and gas production, while growing recurring revenue and maintaining above average margins. Our Q1 performance demonstrates the great strides we’re making with our Polar X extractive separation system. This is the product that we took from the refining industry and are now applying in gas development.  Our technology and system expertise provide alternatives to conventional natural gas treatment method, including [inaudible] at a fraction of the cost with better efficiency and superior environmental performance. While we see plenty of growth potential here, we believe dehydration could be what’s next for our separation technology in the gas production stream. On the acquisition front, CPT added $68 million in sales in Q1, contributing to both Flow and Treatment Process. While less than expected, due largely to a weaker Western Europe, backlog was strong and growing, in fact it was up some 50% from year end, which we believe sets up, sets us up nicely for 2013. One of our focus areas has been growing CPT sales in the U.S. These sales doubled in the first quarter as we increased penetration in dairy, beverage and water markets. We also have some exciting innovations with both our Megablock and Anaerobic-MBR solutions, now both in the marketplace. As we shared last quarter, we’re also developing a new technology platform around Hollow-Fiber nanometer Filtration. That improves performance, uses less energy and reduces the footprint compared to the usually applied RO solution. The first targeted application is the removal of silica from water in high-purity applications. While not set to launch full scale until the end of 2012, we’ve already won several projects in India, where many water sources have high mineral content, and the removal of colloid silica is critical for high purity applications. And in fast-growth regions, we won our largest order ever in Brazil with a strategic win in beverage selling a broad array of our product solutions, along with a recurring service contract. We continue to make great progress leveraging the CPT technology and cross selling opportunities in pump infiltration while driving more profitable growth. Turning to our Aquatic Systems business, we had another great performance. Sales were up 18% in the quarter, reflecting continued share gain, innovation, and good pricing, and likely some benefit from the good weather. Growth fundamentals remain strong in pool, with continued investment, a significant installed base, growing energy rebates, and good secular trims around sustainability, efficiency and automation.  Our Eco-Select products continue to far outpace the industry growing over 40% in Q1. Leading the way were impressive IntelliFlo pump sales, which were up over 50% in the quarter. We continue to expand coverage in penetration, adding another 150 dealers in the quarter, and add new products to the lineup, such as the newly-launched automated residential cleaning system that is more energy and cost efficient. In addition, we recently completed the acquisition of Sibrape, a $20 million pool manufacturer and distributor in Brazil. With our innovation leadership and Sibrape’s critical dealer relationships throughout Brazil and South America, we’re poised to accelerate sales and strengthen our position in this important region. Share gain, targeted international expansion, and innovation investments, continue to drive great growth in our pool business. Aquatic shows that momentum is a beautiful thing. The right half of the page shows Q1 water and fluid operating profits in margin. Water and fluid operating margins decreased 20 basis points at 10.8% in the quarter, reflecting lower CPT margins. Successful pricing actions and strong productivity help to offset persistent inflation, while CPT seasonality negatively impacted margins by roughly 100 basis points. As we reach the first anniversary of the CPT acquisition, mid-Q2, we expect year-over-year improvements in CPT margins, giving our focus on lean and synergistic cost takeouts. With lean leaders now in all of the CPT sites, we’re making great progress, with 20% higher salt capacities in many of the plants, and improved sourcing cost already. Overall, I’m very pleased with the water and fluid segment performance for this quarter. Now let’s move to Slide 6 for a review of Technical Products. Technical Product sales were roughly flat to prior year and local currency, while operating profits grew 5%. Price realization was good, but volumes were down year-over-year, largely due to two factors, softer-than-anticipated Western European sales, and an expected end-of-life Telecom project. Communications, which accounts for nearly 20% of technical product sales, was down 23% in the quarter, with more than half of the decline resulting from the Telecom program going end of life, and the rest due to challenging market dynamics.  Virtually all of the other verticals we serve continue to grow, with industrial and energy up double-digits, and commercial and infrastructure up mid-single digits. Cooling, a key growth initiative for Technical Products, grew an impressive 22% in the quarter, as we expand coverage and penetration with new products. In the quarter, we also had a nice win in the rapidly growing electric vehicle market, with a German energy company supplying Smart car charging stations. Like Water, Technical Products also saw fast-growth region sales slow in the quarter. We do expect sequential improvement in Q2 and a stronger back half helped by new localized production in Mexico and Brazil along with higher cooling orders in China.  Even with flat sales, technical products grew operating profit 5% and expanded margins another 110 basis points to 18.6%. This marks our record margin performance for any quarter for this business.  We believe we are well positioned to deliver the expected 100-plus basis point margin expansion in 2012 as pricing initiated in March reads through along with continued productivity, repositioning benefits and better growth.  Bottom line in technical products is we continue to see nice growth in the core and drive productivity in lean to grow operating profits and advance margins.  Now let’s turn to Slide 7. For our standard work, detail of free cash flow are on the left of the slide and a summary of our debit levels are on the right.  On cash flow, we reported net cash usage of $82 million, as is typical in the first quarter, and continue to target another year of great-than-100% of net income conversions before deal costs. On dividends, we returned approximately $22 million to shareholders through dividends with an annual payout ratio of 32%. We continue to make steady progress on ROIC, which is shown on the bottom right hand section of the slide. Return on invested capital increased nicely from year end, up 40 basis points to 9.4%. Our goal continues to be driving ROIC back into double digits.  Now let’s turn to Slide 8. In sum, we’re off to a solid start. We entered the year with the realistic view of the topline challenges, recognizing these realities, we were proactive in our repositioning efforts and leverage on productivity while remaining committed to new product and growth investments.  In turn, price realization was good and operating performance was great, putting us on track to deliver our full-year operating profit target.  We continue to meaningfully advance our strategy, expanding in new products, solutions and markets that directly align with the biggest mega trends that I believe are driving the world today and in the future. The population of wealth growth, or what we call the New, New World, is putting incredible pressure and demands on food, water, energy and industrial infrastructure. From [inaudible] to the transformational Tyco Flow deal, we continue to better position Pentair to serve this new world.  In addition, we remain committed to organic investments for growth in serving these attractive trends, sustaining a higher R&D level to deliver customers what they need including better efficiency, sustainability, automation and safety.  With that recap of Q1, let’s turn to Slide 9 for a look forward at our sales growth expectations. As you saw in the release this morning, we remain well on track to deliver our full-year operating profit targets. We’ve adjusted our full-year revenue assumptions a bit to reflect more modest growth and flow and a tougher Western Europe probably offset by a stronger pool performance.  Again, beginning with flow, we now expect organic topline growth in the low single digits, reflecting the lower Q1 flood-related sales. All other assumptions are largely unchanged from where we saw things as we began the year, including a healthy replacement market in Residential Pumps, increasing contributions from Agriculture, and continued weakness in Large Project Municipal sales through 2012.  In Treatment and Process, we continue to expect strong high-single digit growth with leading technologies and expanding applications in Beverage, Energy and Advanced Water Systems, there’s some exciting product launches for the back half of 2012.  In Aquatic, we now expect roughly 10% growth in 2012, up from the mid-to-high single digit growth expectations. Continued success of our Eco-Select product line, dealer gains and pricing actions are yielding great results.  Although small today, we’re making great inroads in Aquaculture, attending trade shows around the world, including one next week in Australia. And taking another step in thought leadership with Pentair sponsoring and leading a two-day conference on circulation aquaculture systems.  These efforts in Aquaculture meaningfully expand our address to global market, from $3 billion in pools to an estimated $5 billion including Aquaculture, giving real meaning to our newly renamed Aquatic Systems business.  In Technical Products, we now expect topline growth in the 2 to 4% range versus 4 to 6%, entirely related to Western Europe. We continue to see growth in key sectors; Industrial, Energy and Infrastructure and expect fast-growth regions to accelerate in Q2 in the back half as we expand our global cooling mission into Latin America and execute our in-region four-region plan for China, replacing the lost telecom project in the U.S. with products and solutions serving the regional needs.  In sum, we continue to see nice growth in our best businesses and Pens continues to deliver, or as I like to say, ring the bell.  With that, I’ll call it up – I’ll turn it over to John. John? 
John Stauch: Thanks, Randy. Please turn to Slide 10, labeled Operating Margin Expectations. We’re starting off 2012 nicely. With 20 basis points of overall expansion, despite roughly 70 basis points of headwind from our soon-to-be anniversary CPT acquisition.  For the year, we expect overall margins to expand 50 to 80 basis points inclusive of CPT. Lean discipline and productivity enhancements, along with some repositioning savings lead margins higher in Q1, all while continuing to invest more in R&D, technology and selling and marketing growth initiatives.  Roughly 3 million of repositioning savings was delivered in the quarter, in line with our expectations and keeping us on track for over $20 million of full-year savings. As a reminder, this equates to approximately 1/3 of the top end of the net productivity range we are assuming for the year, which gives us a higher level of confidence in our operating targets while helping us fuel future growth.  Our price cost dynamic improved in the quarter with broad-based pricing of 1.3% offsetting material inflation. For the full year, we continue to expect pricing from approximately 150 to 200 basis points as we fully realize the benefit of Q1 and early Q2 pricing actions. We continue to expect material inflation in 2012, but much more moderate than the plus-4.8% last year.  Another key enabler of our margin expansion will be improving CPT margins as we anniversary the CPT acquisition mid-Q2, along with volume leverage, we are driving material sourcing savings, lean transformation and a tighter profit focus to increase profitability.  As demonstrated in Q1, we’ll continue to prioritize and pace our investments with productivity funding, R&D and sales and marketing investments critical to driving share gains and delivering long-term sustainable growth.  On margins, we’re off to a great start in Q1 with ramping productivity, repositioning savings and pricing benefit expected to drive further margin expansion as the year progresses.  Please turn to Slide 11, labeled Q2 Outlook. For Q2, we expect Water and Fluid revenue to be up approximately 10% compared to the prior year quarter with Technical Products flat to down 2%, reflecting lower Western Europe sales and the remaining end-of-life Telecom project. This puts total Pentair revenue up 6 to 8%, including the contribution from CPT of approximately four points, or roughly $40 million in sales.  We expect operating income to grow 7 to 12%, which equates to operating margins of between 13.5 to 14%, above the Q2 2011 margin of 13.3%.  We expect water and fluid margins to be modestly better than prior year’s adjusted 14.2% at roughly 14.5%.  We expect Technical Products margins to expand another 100 basis points at roughly 18.5%.  Below the line, we expect interest expense to be about $3 million higher in Q2 of this year versus Q2, 2011 as we anniversary the CPT acquisition mid-quarter and a tax rate between 28 and 29%.  Overall, we expect earnings per share in the quarter to be between $0.79 and $0.82, which equals growth of 5 to 9% over last year.  We are expecting cash flow of $180 million as we move towards free cash flow conversion of greater than 100% of net income for the year.  Please note that if you turn to my last slides, slide number 12, labeled Full Year 2012 Pentair Outlook, that both the second quarter and full-year outlook do not include any future impact from the pending merger with Tyco International’s Flow Control business, including the acquisition and acquisition-related costs as discussed earlier in the call.  For the full-year 2012, we are updating our previous revenue guidance to reflect the Q1 performance but importantly, maintaining our full-year operating profit targets and raising our full-year earnings outlook. We now expect revenues to be up 6 to 8% to about $3.7 billion, reflecting a weaker Western Europe and the first quarter weather related sales shortfall.  Our operating income guidance range of $445 million to $470 million remains unchanged with the strong start in Q1 lead by increased productivity, better price cost performance and prioritization of key global investments. This operating performance should yield 50 to 80 basis points of margin expansion in 2012.  We continue to expect another solid year of EPS growth with earnings per share at 2.65 to 2.80, up 10 to 16%, which reflects the first quarter results and a modestly higher diluted share count.  We expect free cash flow in 2012 to be at least 100% of that income. Furthermore, we are still targeting a greater-than-60 basis point increase in ROIC by the end of 2012 as we drive to improve returns for our shareholders.  Now, let me turn it back over to Randy for the summary on Slide 13. 
Randy Hogan: Thanks, John. The start of the year showed great Pens execution and nice growth in our business. Growth in initiatives are yielding results with increasing contributions from Agriculture, Energy and Industrial Process where we’ve been investing in innovation from global capabilities. Greater productivity and operating efficiencies should fuel continued margin expansion. A key measure of progress and execution is ROIC, which is fast approaching double digits, a significant mark for Pentair.  We believe we’re well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable profitable growth in 2012. With that, we’ll be happy to take your questions. Simon, could you come back on and open the line? 
Operator:  (Operator instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Credit Suisse, your line is open.
Hamzah Mazari – Credit Suisse:  Good morning, thank you. The first question is just on revenue – on your revenue expectations. I’m just trying to understand, you know, how much of this was timing and how much is incremental weakness in Europe and some of your other markets because, you know, guidance isn’t really changing but it seems like the moving parts are. So I’m just trying to better understand that.
John Stauch :  Let me start with the flood-related piece. As Randy mentioned in his comments, it was about $15 million. If we go back six, seven years, we average anywhere in the flood SKUs in Q1 between 45 and $50 million. We were close to the $30 million level and obviously that’s related to the lack of snow and the lack of melt.  I just remind you that that’s retail related, primarily, and it doesn’t come with huge margins. So even though it’s a headline as far as the sales, you know, it was something we were able to handle within the operating income performance.  As Randy mentioned, we were able five points lighter in Europe. You know, for us that was 15 million-ish and most of that was in Technical Products versus forecast. Again, not one of our higher-margin product lines, but those two things, as we move throughout the year, the flood is unique to Q1. I mean, there is a mild flood season that occurs in Q3 from hurricanes, but that’s not of the magnitude that we see in Q1. And Europe gets easier on a year-over-year comparison basis, you know, as Q1, to Q2, 3 and 4 last year was on a downward slide. So these year-over-year headwinds get a little easier for us to handle.  And finally, we were a little bit off in fast growth, but a little bit of that was strategic in the sense that we were identifying that some of our sales and products into those products were finding them way back into Europe and North America, as normal, in distribution businesses. So we adjusted our SKUs and our product lines reflect that. And we, once again, know that that corrects itself at Q2. So, you know, as you kind of look at the Q1 headline growth and we look at those trends in Q2 to Q4 we see the flood turning around completely and the Europe piece easing and the fast growth accelerating.
Hamzah Mazari – Credit Suisse:  All right, that’s very helpful. And then on your North American residential businesses, maybe if you could comment on where you think we are in the cycle there. I know we’ve been in a downturn for a while. It seems like the pool business is doing well, [inaudible] filtration may be mixed. You know, how much of that business is replacement versus new? Are you seeing a turn there? Anything you can give us color on in that business.
Randy Hogan:  We think, basically, it’s over 80%, it’s all replacement now. You know, and we characterize it as [inaudible] on the bottom. As we think about U.S. residential from our perspective there’s three different market drivers. If you take a look at what’s driving pool, it’s the fact that people that have homes or in homes or even if they’re buying homes and they maintain their pool and because of the innovated products we have to save energy, to save chemicals, it’s a really compelling economic justification and there’s over 30 utilities now that are rebating upgrades of those products.  So it’s really innovations in a market that has money. That’s what’s driving pool and so, you know, there is an increase we’ve seen at the markets of some pools builts, which is nice. But I think it’s really the innovation and the demographics of continued growth in the south where people have pools is – we’re back to that.  Then there’s the, what I would call the, flow business, it really is more related to replacement, it’s probably closer to 90% replacement right now. We’ve, for us – for ourselves, you know, we had a few years of lost market share and that was corrected in 2011 and we had slight uptick and I think we’re in a very good position now in residential flow.  Admittedly we do have a weather affect that we just talked about. And then finally there on the filtration side, that really does tie – the water softener business and the filtration ties closer to what I would call a discretionary spend in a house or a housing start related, which is why we see that softener affect right now. And we weren’t counting on a turnaround right there, that’s why that business actually performed well versus expectations in the first quarter despite the fact that sales were down. And we’re introducing innovations there that could really change the game with Hybrid DI.  So we weren’t counting on a residential recovery in 2012, and I would say we were right about that, even though housing prices look like they at least, the last report they were stabilizing. You know, it is the more stable market today, but we’re, again, not counting on a big step up from housing starts this year. Nevertheless, we think all three of the businesses we have in residential are going to perform well this year.
Hamzah Mazari – Credit Suisse: All right that’s very helpful, appreciate it, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with Citigroup, your line is open.
Deane Dray – Citigroup:  Thank you, good morning. As we get ready to anniversary CPT, you called out a couple of interesting data points in terms of the performance in the quarter and I wanted to start first with doubling U.S. sales, and that was the big opportunities since CPT had lost their distributor. And so now, just kind of refresh us on the go-to market strategy and when you say double sales, is that a channel fill or you’re actually getting a sell through?
Randy Hogan:  It’s mostly project business. So let me just back up, Deane. CPT had lost earlier basically their market partner in Ionics when GE bought them, which really took them out of the water space. We’ve had some modest success in the U.S. in the water space, but right now the water spending is still pretty low. The real driver that we’ve picked up is in dairy and beverage. And what we did is we took the sales force and we really focused it and said, it’s a direct sale, it’s a project sales business, it’s selling, you know, a whole array of products that we have from the valves to MBR’s to CO2 recovery to diagnostic equipment. And by focusing the team there and then beefing up that team and really building better strategic relationships, our hit rate is going up and it’s exciting. You know we’ve talked about the Anaerobic MBR plant, we’ve got to go down there and take some folks down there, which we’re really excited about. But we’ve had some great wins in the brewing industry and we have more than we expect. So it’s really – what I would call it, it’s really more technical selling and investing and focusing on the food and beverage side. And we’re improving the relationships on the water side. We’ve had a couple nice winds, but again the market rate there is not really recovered and it will be tough until municipalities have built a little bit better cash flow.
Deane Dray – Citigroup:  And the backlog being up 50%, I don’t really – you don’t think of CPT as a big like longer-recycle backlog business. Is this related to project timing, can you size that for us please?
Randy Hogan:  Well, we think, and you know certainly going forward we’re going to talk more about backlog and more about origin sales. They are more of a – they do sell cartridges, you know, they sell membranes but a lot of them get sold in projects. And so I would say over half of their business is longer cycle.  They were a little disappointing in sales in the quarter but on orders they blew it out. So we’re talking about right now just on the filtration side, them going from 100 to $150 million in backlog, which is a meaningful level of backlog improvement. And then we took the smaller pump piece and put it with flow technology and that’s up, as I said earlier; those are up 12% in orders even though the sales are flat. We’re going to talk more about that.
Deane Dray- Citigroup:  Great, any update on the endocrine inhibitor, the new products that you talked about earlier in the – last year? 
Randy Hogan:  Yes, you know, we talked earlier about the Phase I of the nanofilters, which is focused on Silica and, you know, we caught Alpha. So we’ve got an Alpha launch on that and that’s where we’re, you know, we’ve sold these products in India and we’ll have a Beta launch which is the next step before the full commercial launch because it is a technical sale in the third quarter.  We’ll also have – the next phase is focused on color and clarity, and that product will launch by the first quarter of next year. And then the endocrine, which is the most technically advance, we’ll have that in what we would call Alpha test in the first quarter of 2013. So we’re going in that sequence as we have talked about before. And we like the Silica application but the commercial opportunities in color and clarity and endocrine disruptors are much bigger. So we’re keenly focused on getting there.
Deane Dray – Citigroup:  That’s great to hear. And just last question for me if I could. One of the things we learned in our visit to Aquatech last fall is your focus on building skidded systems as opposed to selling individual pumps is, just refresh us, where is that – is that business in the treatment process side of water, how big are the skidded systems today, and a little bit about the engineering know how in putting those together.
Randy Hogan:  Right, as you know we were in that business before we bought CPT. And one of the things we wanted to do – let me answer your question. It’s largely on the water side. So it’s water treatment and it could be both for drinking water and for wastewater. So largely, those are the skid systems. We do some systems work as well in food and beverage and some of those are skidded, but the ones we’ve talked about and showed were largely on the water and wastewater side.  So what we’ve done is we’re focused on trying to drive to more of a manufacturing standard on these skidded systems so that we have standard products and we’ve raised the content of the product.  As I said, the water business has been slower than the food and beverage business but we’re making progress in terms of improving the margins in that business and importantly, skids aside, we’re also focused on building straight X-Flow membrane sales to other people that play in that space, which I’m very encouraged in, which while they’re still brand at X-Flow, is along the lines of the strategy to try and improve our private label branding, if you will. 
Deane Dray – Citigroup:  Great, thank you.
Randy Hogan:  Thanks, Deane.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Jim Lucas with Janney Capital Markets, your line is open.
Jim Lucas – Janney Capital Markets:  Thanks, good morning, all. 
Randy Hogan: Good morning, Jim. Bigger picture question, you know, if you look at the first year of owning CPT as the integration has gone along can you talk about lessons learned, both the pros and the cons in terms of Pentair having this long history of being an inquisitive company, just what you taken away from CPT integration process.
Randy Hogan:  My first – the first thing I’d say is, I really do believe we’re getting to the point where applying Pens to business as standard work. I’m really – we’ve raised – I toured two factories and they both gave me capital plans when I first toured them because they were out of capacity. Neither of those plants – we didn’t have to spend any capital and we’ve increased the capacity in those two plants by 20%.  So we really are getting good at applying the inside the four walls lean enterprise. So that’s the first item I’d say, the second learning is that we’re getting better at combining in the marketplace, in the sales. Just in this quarter we had $2 million of sales that I can identify in just on the Flow side, the Pump side. $2 million of business from the combined efforts of CPT and our Flow business and our legacy Pentair flow business and that’s, you know, if you will, the legacy Pentair folks are selling an [inaudible] product or vice versa. So you know, those examples I talked about, [inaudible] and Romania and Kuwait, those are examples of both of those and Nihouse and Fairbanks Morris product being sold by the alternate sales force.  So those are positive. I think the other learning is technology is very, very exciting and the food and beverage business is very, very exciting. As we get deeper into that we see more and more opportunities to apply it.  And the – I guess the last thing is, you know, as we’ve talked about before, their margins at the start were a little weaker than what we would’ve liked but we’re still committed to get them to the double-digit level as soon as we can.
Jim Lucas – Janney Capital Markets:  Okay that’s very helpful.
John Stauch :  And Jim, I’m just going to add to that. I mean, clearly understanding, and we knew it going in, but we learned that as you see a business that’s for sale like that, you might have projects in the backlog that don’t have the margins that you would historically like and you know we’ve burned those off now and as we mentioned we’re positioning more towards industrial, a little left to municipal, which for them we’re easier to win. So I mean, those are things that are worked through as a year anniversary and we’re ready to go now.
Randy Hogan:  It’s a good point and actually if I could weave that – your answer back to Deane’s question as well in terms of that systems business – standard systems business. You got to make money in systems and so what John was saying was there was a lot of systems in the backlog without much margin in them and we’ve corrected both the pricing and the costing on that and getting in place disciplines to basically check the as-built versus as-bid profitability to ensure execution.
Deane Dray – Citigroup:  Okay. And then a two-part questions, just a more of a housekeeping related. One, in tech products, the end of last contracts, how many more quarters does that run.
Randy Hogan:  One more.
Deane Dray – Citigroup:  One more, okay. And then secondly, you know, you talked a lot about India, Southeast Asia, could you give us an update on what you’re seeing in China specifically right now.
Randy Hogan: Well, China was lower in the quarter than it has been. But we still expect it – that was one of the places – that was the place that John was referring to when he talked about getting better channel discipline in place so that we don’t get any back channel cross zone.
John Stauch:  But Jim, India was up north of 25% percent worth in the quarter overall. Brazil and Latin America still strong, Middle East very robust, Southeast Asia would be more in the mid-single digit level at the moment. And China, absent of that particular SKU changer back channel I mentioned, would’ve been up nearly double digits. So not quite 20 but, you know, still doing pretty well as far as north of DGP. So I still think these are huge fast growth regions for us. I think we’re well positioned with localized manufacturing, localized design, localized marketing now, and I think we’re positioned to see these in the 10 to 15% range for the year.
Deane Dray – Citigroup:  Great, thank you very much.
Operator:  You’re next question comes from the line of Chris Glynn with Oppenheimer, your line is open.
Chris Glynn – Oppenheimer:  Thanks, good morning. 
Randy Hogan: Hi, how are you? 
Chris Glynn – Oppenheimer: Good, thanks. Just wanted to look at the water margin in a little more detail, some upside to your guidance despite revenues, distinctly little on the light side. Just wondering if this is reflecting CPT a little crisper operationally out of the gate here than maybe expected or initially committed to?
John Stauch:  Yes I think as we mentioned the margins in CPT are improving, that’s indicative of what we’re seeing as far as anniversering and seeing the expansion. And it has a lot to do with the types of products we’re winning and the type of project we’re delivering on. Also we are seeing a mixed benefit on these flood sales that aren’t going to be there. I mean they are lower margins so we are getting a little kicker on that.
Randy Hogan:  And price realization was good, and I think our supply team is doing a better job of managing inflation.
Chris Glynn – Oppenheimer:  And second quarters looking like a heck of a free cash flow quarter. Just wondering if you have plans to kind of apply that to debt in the near term?
John Stauch:  Yes, and I know, Q2 seasonally is our quarter and it’s primarily from what we do in the early buy in pool and then we collect that cash in Q2, that’s why we see that seasonality and the all-near term applications will be to continue to pay down the debt.
Chris Glynn – Oppenheimer:  Okay and then last one just on the interest expense just a little light on the quarter, what factored there?
John Stauch:  Yes, there was a little bit, call it roughly about a half a million related to the tax benefits, you know, the accured interest you have on those particular accruals. And the rest is just a little bit lower debt assumptions, being debt and interest.
Chris Glynn – Oppenheimer:  Okay, so it that a run rate going forward, the first quarter then?
John Stauch:  I would think no, I think the tax is not a run rate but if you just add that half a million back to where we’re at that’s about the run rate.
Chris Glynn – Oppenheimer:  Great, thanks a lot.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your lines is open. 
Jeff Hammond – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Hey, good morning. 
Randy Hogan:  Hey, Jeff. 
Jeff Hammond – KeyBanc Capital Markets:  Just back to the issues in Western Europe and fast-growth markets that were weaker, I mean, I guess on Western Europe, what gives you confidence that that starts to normalize. I mean, a lot of companies have talked about certainly some stabilization, but still some consternation in that market. And just a finer point on that, on the China, you know, strategic move, is that just a one quarter dynamic or could that leak? 
John Stauch:  Let me – I’ll take the first part and then I’ll let Randy comment in addition. Just to give some color, you know, we saw, if you recall in Q3 and Q4 of last year, Europe got a little bit weaker in water. It was still decently strong in Technical Products. If we kind of take a look at where we are in Q1, the year-over-year delta in water has moderated substantially and Tech Products saw nearly a 15% decline. Now, I’m not saying water’s an indicator, I’m just saying that we saw it in the distribution channel on water first and we’re starting to see the year-over-year pressure ease.  And as far as the things in China, yes, that is a one-quarter. And I would say they’re every several years, I mean, every once in a while our pricing gets a little challenged and we take a look at our global product lines and our distribution and we make sure that we’re not seeing any of that back channel come through. And a couple product lines in China, we’re seeing them and hearing from customers that they were coming into Europe and North America so we adjusted.  Randy, do you have anything you want to add in Western Europe? 
Randy Hogan:  Well, I mean, I think you said it well. In fact, Technical Products saw it a little bit later and given the amount of exports they serve, they serve a lot of customers that export out of Europe. We’re counting on as big of decline, which was – it was a double digit decline in the quarter. So you know, hence the adjustment we’ve made in the rest of the year to reflect that. They believe they have a handle on it now and they’re adjusting their cost to protect margins and that’s going to pace. That was really the only place we were surprised by Western Europe. We had it nailed really in the first quarter on the water side. And I think we got – we got a better look at it in Technical Products. 
Jeff Hammond – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay, and then along the same lines, I mean, it seems like a lot of these things that kind of went against you were lower margin and some of the things that maybe worked in your favor from a variance were favorable margins. So I just want to understand on the margin upside, you know, how much of that is mix versus surprise to the upside on productivity? 
John Stauch :  You know, first of all, we locked in a third of the productivity as both Randy and I mentioned on the repositioning, actions we took last year. So I’d say that’s reading out. Okay. Second, we’re prioritizing our strategic growth investments to reflect those businesses in those programs that are working.  As Randy and mentioned, both on the CPT side, we feel better about the projects that we’re winning and how we’re delivering them. And so I think the mix had a small impact on Q1, but you know, I want to remind everybody, I mean, we’ve always said that we’ve got excess capacity in residential today in North America and when any form of recovery or growth comes on that side, we’re going to see higher productivity and higher margins on what was historically a very profitable side of our business.  So when we see pool shipments and we see any form of uptick on where we are in residential filtration, that’s going to have nice healthy margins to it. 
Jeff Hammond – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay, thanks. 
John Stauch: Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research. Your line is open. 
Brian Konigsberg – Vertical Research: Yes, hi. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Just coming back to the pool results in the quarter, obviously very good. You mentioned weather as a contributing factor, but really didn’t emphasize it whereas maybe listening to some of the pool distributors, you know, they kind of emphasized it more and thought there would be more of a kind of – there was a pull-forward affecting Q1, but it doesn’t sound like you see that. Do you attribute that dynamic to winning more distributors throughout the year or maybe you could just give us some context around this comment. 
Randy Hogan:  Yes, I mean, clearly, the pool year started earlier. When you open a pool, you – it really drives chemicals and it drives, you know, the startup, you’re putting your shock in the pool, a lot of chlorine, ozone in. You’re not changing out equipment unless it broke. So our distributors sell a lot of chemicals, so that’s one difference between what they say and what we say.  The second point is these upgrades, which they benefit from too, are ones that can sustain. And when a pool – when the pool season starts early, it usually means it’s going to be a good one. You know, for instance, in the Northeast, the old rule is, if someone’s thinking about putting a pool in, if you don’t have one hot sweltering weekend before Fourth of July, it’s lousy for the pool business. We’re expecting – we’re seeing a return to sort of those kinds of dynamics. I think clearly, you know, when we get an 18% growth in the pool business in the first quarter, and we don’t think we’ll sustain at that level, we think we’ll sustain at a pretty high level. We expect it to be good.  And you know, when we add 145 dealers, the reason we’re getting those dealers is we have the most compelling suite of products. We’ve got 35 – we personally don’t, but there are 35 utilities around the country that are meaningfully rebidding the products that we have the best products.  So those dealers are coming to us because of the solutions we have. Once we get them, we get all of that they sell usually. So that’s why I call it a beautiful thing, momentum is really something.  As we look out in the channels right now, we believe inventory is pretty low. So we don’t believe that they’re over inventories. We think there will be good sell through. 
Brian Konigsberg – Vertical Research: And just going to the balance sheet, I notice that inventories actually picked up quite a bit, a little bit more than you would expect even though Q1 typically is a stronger quarter for inventories, but it was a bit higher than even what seasonality would call for. Can you give us a little bit insight to what’s going on there? 
John Stauch:  Yes. I think I’ll answer with two quick things. One is some of the project backlog that Randy mentioned, as you know, as the backlogs grow, our inventory level is going to grow, as we need that demand.  Second of all, there’s probably a little bit of pro-channel and retail-related sump pumps in the channel. 
Randy Hogan:  We were ready for that extra $15 million. Our service levels are superior to everybody else when it comes to flood, and we maintain inventory, and what doesn’t see through, it stays on our books. So it’s way off next couple quarters.
Brian Konigsberg – Vertical Research:  Yes, the guidance provided in Q2, is that reflecting some of that liquidation of inventory there?
John Stauch:  No, it’s primarily more the liquidation of the pool, as I mentioned earlier, which will be reflected in the pool sales.
Brian Konigsberg – Vertical Research:  Okay, great, thank you very much.
John Stauch:  Thank you.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Robert Barry with the UBS. Your line is open.
Robert Barry – UBS:  Hi, guys. Good morning.
John Stauch:  Hi, how are you.
Robert Barry – UBS:  Good, thanks. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple of things. One, I wanted to clarify the comments earlier on the residential new construction. It sounds like you’re not seeing a significant lift from it, and I know you may be weren’t planning for it, but housing starts are up a lot, albeit off a very low base. So is it just that we’re not kind at some critical mass level yet, or there not being started in the right places, just a little more color on that would be helpful.
Randy Hogan:  There up, but when replacement is 80 to 90% where it used to be 50, you know until you get to a million housing starts a year, you know, you’re not really at a normal level. What’s nice is our distributors are actually back to a more normal stocking levels, and so that’s good.  On the water softener side, people don’t have to put them in. You only need water softener in certain areas of the country, and it’s something that you can put off if you need to.
John Stauch:  And Rob, a couple of things, it’s John. First of all we look at single family housing starts, so I’d look at those numbers, and even though they’re bouncing around, it’s nothing to get excited about what those growth rates are. Second of all, we thought for sure you’d love that Shingo prize, so.
Robert Barry – UBS:  Congratulations on that.
John Stauch:  Thank you. I appreciate that. 
Robert Barry – UBS:  I wanted to also then just clarify on what’s happening with tech products in Europe. It sounds like on the water side things have gotten a little better in Europe and where the deterioration was versus last quarter was on tech product, and I think you said it was down 15%. Do you have any sense of how much of that was destocking versus market demand, etc.
Randy Hogan:  Technical products is largely direct to customer, as opposed through distribution. So it was really the reduction and market demand. You know, these are going to control builders or equipment builders largely in Germany and Poland, and France. So their business was down, and generally they don’t stock a lot. So I think its direct demand in that department.
Robert Barry – UBS:  And then just finally, I think you mentioned fast growth now for the year up 10 to 15% roughly? Is that excluding CPT benefit?
Randy Hogan:  This is just the organic. Obviously when you put CPT in there, it’s much higher, much higher rate.
Robert Barry – UBS:  Okay. Thank you.
Randy Hogan:  Thank you.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Terry Darling with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Terry Darling – Goldman Sachs:  Thanks. Just a couple of clarifications. Hey John, did you recalibrate currency in the forecast at all, and if so, any significant impact there to note?
John Stauch:  No. What we usually do is we take wherever the ending rate is, and that’s kind of how we look at the currency, assuming we’re not any better at predicting it then the market. So, it’s right around that 130,131 rate, and that doesn’t create a significant delta to the prior forecast.
Terry Darling – Goldman Sachs:  Okay, and so just then transition that into the discussion on water organic. I guess it looks you’ve gone from 6 to 8 from 7 to 10 on the organic for water. Is that right?
John Stauch:  You’re rate for water, yes on the organic that’s about right. If you break that it will be about 2 point to price, and about 4 to a little north of in value.
Terry Darling – Goldman Sachs:  And then, I wonder if you can just give us some collars to, for the segments, preferably the old but I kind of expect the new, around that 6 to 8 around the 4, however you want to give it to use in terms of just the organic expectations.
John Stauch:  Yes, I think flow is clearly going to be, you know, the lower single digits. Call it 4 to 5. You know, driven by obviously agriculture being substantially in the double digits, and as Randy mentioned we’re not expecting to recover this retail portion in flood pumps. If you think of the organic of our treatment business, clearly we’re expecting double digit organic with obviously CPT and the old filtration solutions leading the way there, and water purification in low single digits. Still seeing nice fast growth penetration, and not seeing anything substantial in North America residential side. And then aquatic probably just south of double digits or right around double digit growth organically.
Terry Darling – Goldman Sachs:  Did you take aquatic up for the year or no?
John Stauch:  Yes, maybe a point.
Terry Darling – Goldman Sachs: Okay. Is there anyway of characterizing the margin, may be you did and I missed it, in water in the first quarter excluding CPT?
Randy Hogan:  It would be up around 80 to 100 bases points including CPT.
Terry Darling – Goldman Sachs:  Super, thanks very much
Sara Zawoyski:  We’ll do a quick check on time, just given the time here, how many people do we have left in the queue?
Operator:  We currently have three remaining in the queue.
John Stauch:  Okay, we’ll take all three and we’ll just go quickly with our answers.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Jefferies & Company. Your line is open.
Scott Graham – Jefferies & Co. :  Hi. Good morning. So, I just wanted to maybe ask a more holistic question here. If you look over the last four quarters at the companies average organic sale growth is averaged in the 2 to 3% territory. And the second quarter guidance suggest 5 maybe something a little bit lower than that and your targets 7. A target which I think personably is reachable given your portfolio and the megatrends and all that. What’s missing? Why are we able to may be skirt of these individual quarter issues, and put on a couple of points just from some of these trends that are out there wherever they might be. Is the situation with the company just needs to may be hatch more organic growth projects? It just seems that there’re so many opportunities you’ve laid out that we shouldn’t be where we are now.
Randy Hogan:  First of all, you know, to your point, we got a couple of points headwind from Western Europe. Okay, so we’ll just say that’s a big market, that’s down mid-teens or double digit, it’s hard to overcome that completely. The second one is right now CPT is still going through acquisitions, and as soon as CPT comes back into the core, you know, that’s a business that we expect to grow 15 to 20% on an annual basis, and their growth is being reflected in the acquisition line right now. So, clearly I agree with you. I mean we still feel water is, you know, high single digits on an annual growth basis aided by fast growth and it being better position to serve the new new world as Randy mentioned.
Scott Graham – Jefferies & Co. :  My question was, what’s missing within all that? Why isn’t it a little faster. I mean, I understand CPT is going to…
Randy Hogan:  CPT is mid-teens growth. It’s not yet in our organic growth rate.
Scott Graham – Jefferies & Co. :  But where we had a higher organic growth rate a year ago target, before CPT was part of the business, it just seems that you have a lot opportunity, and there just doesn’t seem to be a connection to all that opportunity.
Randy Hogan:  Couple things: Not getting any help from North American, which is North American Residential, which is still a good chunk of where we are in our water revenue. And as I mentioned we got 2 point for headwind from Western Europe. But I think core and aligning growth is definitely in line with what we expected to be in. And I think given the prioritization portfolio, I totally expect to be back there in a couple of quarters.
Scott Graham – Jefferies & Co. :  Okay, Randy thanks.
Randy Hogan:  Thank you, Scott
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Brian Drab with William Blair. Your line is open.
Brian Drab – William Blair:  You guys still sure that you want to continue the call?
John Stauch:  No problem.
Brian Drab – William Blair:  I’ll just ask one quick question, most of mine have been answered. Regarding the tax benefits in the quarter, can you help me bridge from this 13% rate to the 20% rate, counting the adjustments, and then from the 20% rate to the 29% rate that you said would have been the effective tax rate in the presentation?
Randy Hogan:  I mean first of all we think our effective rate could be the rest of the year estimates will be closer to 28 to 29% reflecting incremental tax planning, which are those permit things that you can do to help your tax rate. An unprecedented amount of settlements in the quarter, you know, these are accrual. None of them, you know, more than a half a million and we settled the 2005 to 2009 audits, and went through the appeals process. As Randy mentioned, this certainly wasn’t forecasted. It all came to use in Q1. And then the only difference between what we put in adjust and reported is we take a look back at where we took the accrual, and if we didn’t take the accrual in the adjusted earnings category we released the accrual down and reported, so it doesn’t impact where we took it and where we released it. So, if I bridge that for you it’s about 4 ½ in the difference between reported/adjusted, and then you can take the difference between the tax rate and it’s roughly just south of 7 million of favorable tax items in Q1.
Brian Drab – William Blair:  Okay, great. Thanks.
John Stauch:  I wish I could forecast them, but you just can’t. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of David Rose with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.
David Rose – Wedbush Securities:  Good afternoon.
John Stauch:  Hi David.
David Rose – Wedbush Securities:  Hi, how are you. Two quick questions. One is on, if there were any specific actions taken to accelerate the improvement in margins to offset the topline weakness in the quarter? (inaudible) pretty clearly about what took place, but was there anything specific when you looked at the shortfall in revenues and said “Let’s accelerate this item”. Was there anything of that nature that took place?
Randy Hogan:  No. It was that we, you know, we were targeting to get to get the price realization. We were targeting productivity. We had good readout, it was just basically good execution. So, I would say that, you know, if in fact growth had come through, we would have beaten it by more than a penny, it would have been by a lot.
David Rose – Wedbush Securities:  That’s what I was going to ask you.
Randy Hogan:  That’s if we had gotten the revenue that we had thought.
David Rose – Wedbush Securities:  That’s helpful.
John Stauch:  (inaudible) look out the window and you can see the flood impacts no happening, and as we mentioned earlier, that’s not our highest margin item, so there wasn’t a huge panic related to that level of fail ship. 
David Rose – Wedbush Securities:  So, you really built in a fair amount of cushion in the quarter to begin with?
Randy Hogan:  I wouldn’t say we had a fair amount of cushion. I’d say we had really good productivity. 
David Rose – Wedbush Securities:  And then lastly, I’ve see some fairly impressive wins on the X-Flow pretreatment side of the business, and was wondering if there are any crossover selling benefits from those pretreatment sales into other parts of either a new house or Pentair, even extending up beyond into (inaudible) we start to see those mega project pickup in 2013.
Randy Hogan:  We do see that, you know, we now have a special line of housing that have been built for  X-Flow so it’s pulling through that directly. There’s other filters that can get sold in or around them helping us get better at that on the pumps around the larger projects. And, you know, on the smaller standard systems side, you know, we’ve gone internally to X-Flow where we obviously we’d buy them from other people before.
David Rose – Wedbush Securities:  So, even on some of those legacy contracts like, (inaudible), we could see some benefit on your side?
Randy Hogan:  Yes. Even, as I mentioned, we have housing for the X-Flow but, you know, we’ve gotten housings for the RO membranes, we don’t make RO membranes. We’re the leader in them now, and our hit rate in that has improved. As I mentioned our (inaudible) performance wasn’t just CPT related, it was our core of total line business. So we definitely, I believe it’s helped us with (inaudible).
David Rose – Wedbush Securities:  Okay, thank you very much.
Randy Hogan:  Thank you. Go ahead and wrap it up.
Operator:  There are no further questions at this time. Speakers, do you have any closing remarks.
John Stauch:  No, just give them the replay. Thanks for your attendance.

Operator: At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Pentair Q4 2011 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I'll now introduce and turn the call over to Sara Zawoyski, Head of Investor Relations.
Sara Zawoyski: Welcome to Pentair's full year and Q4 2011 earnings conference call. We're glad you could join us. I'm Sara Zawoyski, Head of Investor Relations. With me today is Randy Hogan, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Stauch, our Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, we will provide details on our Q4 and full year 2011 performance as well as our Q1 2012 outlook, as outlined in this morning's release. Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as the risks outlined in Pentair's 10-Q for the quarter ended October 1, 2011, and today's release. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today, and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results. Today's webcast is accompanied by a presentation, which can be found in the Investors section of Pentair's website at www.pentair.com. We will reference these slides throughout our prepared remarks. All references today will be on an adjusted basis amongst otherwise indicated towards the non-GAAP financials reconciled in the appendix of the presentation. We'll reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks, but in recognition that there are other calls going on this morning, we will target to be done in an hour. With that, I'd like to request you to limit your question to one and get back in the queue for further questions. So we can try to make it for everyone this morning. With that, Randy?
Randy Hogan: Thanks, Sara, and welcome everybody. Let me begin with our fourth quarter performance on Slide 2. As you saw in the press release, we recorded the non-cash goodwill impairment charge of roughly $200 million pre-tax and $1.82 per share related exclusively to our Residential Filtration business as a result of our annual impairment assessment process. The recent decline we saw in residential water treatment components sales in the U.S. and Western Europe and the expected continued softness in these end markets no longer supported the level of goodwill carried in Residential Filtration. Clearly, this is a difficult headline on which to end the year and one that I'm personally disappointed to have to report. However, it does not change where we are as a company, the progress we've made in 2011 and the growth opportunities we have ahead. Today, we sell roughly $1.2 billion into the global residential end markets. Roughly one-third of that relates to pool, which is already back to setting records with good secular trends and efficiency in automation. Another third of that is Flow with solid replacement demand and a strong performance in 2011. The remaining third is Filtration, which includes point-of-use filtration which has low penetration and solid global growth, and the water treatment softener component business that mainly serves developed regions and tends to be more discretionary. This business is the one that's been impacted by consumer sentiment and financing in the housing business. We still, however, continue to see long-term value in the Residential Filtration business with growing scale and fast growth regions and industry-changing innovations like the Hybrid DI coming to market this year. We expect to continue to gain from our global expansion and innovation to drive topline growth and will be relentless in our focus on operational excellence and improving operating performance in Residential Filtration to be sure Pentair is well positioned to benefit from a meaning residential recovery in this business when that comes. The other item impacting Q4 reported earnings was an $11 million pre-tax restructuring charge as we reposition the company to capture CPT cost synergies, address the realities in the developed markets and continue to reposition us for global growth. Let's turn now to the core operating performance in Q4, which came in generally in line with the revised growth expectations we shared in December. The operating performance headlines were solid despite the headwinds in Western Europe in Residential Filtration. Overall, we grew sales 15%, expanded adjusted operating margins to drive operating profits of 18% and delivered adjusted EPS of $0.56, which is up 14%. Strength continued in many of the end markets we serve, including industrial, beverage, agriculture and energy. Momentum continued in the fast growth regions as well with sales up 23% in the quarter before including the CPT acquisition. We continue to execute well on our growth initiatives with new products and expanding coverage adding to our growth. Margin increased another 30 basis points in the fourth quarter, generally as expected. Volume, productivity and pricing helped to offset persistent material inflation to sustain growth investments. In Q4, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.56 compared to the $0.49 in the prior year, reflecting the solid sales in both Water and Technical Products, excellent operating performance and benefit from CPT. We finished strong in cash flow, generating $61 million in the quarter. This brings our full year free cash flow to $248 million. In sum, we delivered another quarter of solid operating performance with strong execution driving topline results, good price cost dynamics enabling margin expansion and sustained productivity funding continued growth investments, which we believe position us well for growth in 2012 and beyond. Now let's turn to Slide 3 for a review of our Water results. Water sales grew 21% year-over-year in the quarter, largely driven by the CPT acquisition, which added $92 million in sales. Excluding the 2010 GIWW project headwind in Engineered Flow, organic sales grew 6% in Water with good price realization and broad base growth across the businesses. Residential Flow sales were up 7% in the quarter. Share capture with better delivery in quality, new products and geographic expansion helped to offset headwinds in Western European pump sales which were down nearly 10% in the fourth quarter. Agricultural equipment sales, including irrigation pumps and crop spray, grew an impressive 31% in the quarter, lapping a 30% growth of a year ago to finish the year overall of 19%. While still relatively modest today, we believe this business can meaningfully contribute to Pentair's future growth with innovation, geographic expansion and channel improvement. Residential Filtration sales grew 5% in the quarter. Fast growth region sales continue to grow at a robust pace with India more than doubling. We continue to expand distribution coverage and make great strides in our in-region for-region strategy. In contrast, sales in developed regions were down 5% in the quarter, reflecting channel and discretionary pressures in residential softener components as well as a sharp adjustment in yearend pro channel inventory levels in the U.S. While we have some upcoming product launches, including a new treatment valve in Q2, we expect continued weakness in residential softener component sales this year. Pool sales were up 18% in the quarter, reflecting share gains and a solid aftermarket demand. Early buy program sales were strong with good carryover, while standard orders grew at an even faster rate, both of which are positive indicators for 2012. Expanded distribution continues to be a growth driver, adding another 95 dealers in the quarter, totaling over 400 additions for the year. Our Eco-Select products well outpaced the industry, growing 25% in 2011, led by impressive IntelliFlo pump sales which were up over 50% this year. Next in innovation is the IntelliChem, which is an efficient auto dosing pool system that monitors pH and sanitizing levels to maintain safe well balanced water. Even with no meaningful housing recovery, industry growth fundamentals remain strong with now over 30 utility-funded rebate programs for energy-efficient pool products and expected launch of an ENERGY STAR program by the EPA with support from the DoE for pool pumps later in 2012. Share gains combined with targeted international expansion at technology and innovation investment should position us well with sustain growth going forward. Engineered flow sale decreased 25% with a GIWW comparison driving 17 percentage points of that decline. The remaining 8% decline reflects continued softness in the large U.S. municipal project sales, partially offset by strong industrial sales. While muni backlog seems to be stabilizing running at roughly $60 million, consistent with 2010 end of the year numbers but better than the 2011 low-point of approximately $45 million, we continue to expect ongoing sluggish municipal sales in the U.S. as reduced capital spending for Water infrastructure continues. Filtration Solutions sales were up 3% at ex-CPT and up 5% excluding foreign exchange. We continue to see nice growth and desalination through the distribution channel along with some project work. Food service steadily adds the sales each quarter, growing 4% in Q4. In energy, sales were down modestly year-over-year reflecting some project delays. Backlog in energy projects, however, has never been stronger as we apply our existing technology in systems outside of the refinery to sell the broader set of customer needs in the oil and gas market. CPT added $92 million in sales in Q4 and grew mid-single digits in local currency when compared to pre-acquisition 2010 sales. Growth moderated from Q3 reflecting market pressures, a tighter project focus and currency headwind. For our market view, backlog remains strong, we seem them delayed from project activity particularly in the municipal water side, which we expect to continue into 2012. Q4 also reflects the tighter focus on profitable growth, muting the topline slightly near-term, but expected to boost profitability and long return. And last currency was more of a headwind than we expected coming into the quarter. For 2012, I'm confident on our ability to generate 10% plus topline growth in this business and grow profits at an even faster pace. We've got some exciting innovations with both our Megablock and Anaerobic-MBR solutions now both in the market. In Dairy, we just launched the first and currently only mix proof valve that is not required a full port leakage chambers, which simply means greater efficiency, much more safety and smarter operation and a new space-saving design for our customers. We're also developing a new technology platform around hollow fiber nanofiltration that improves performance due to the less energy and reduces the footprint compared to the standard RO solution used today. The first targeted application is the removal of silica from water using high purity applications like boiler water feed and steam generation in power plants with plans for broader applications in the future including color and endocrine disruptor in 2013 and beyond. Cross-selling opportunities are also beginning to take hold. Global sales training for CPT should be complete in Q1, unlocking pull-through potential for vessels, pumps and the full water product line. The cross-selling opportunities extent to food and beverage as well, with our leading position in aseptic valves and diary, for example. We're recently started pouring utility pumps, incoming water treatment, boiler feed water and wastewater treatment proving meaningful upside potential. I believe we've only just began to see the benefits from our combined sales coverage, technology platforms and product portfolios. The right half of the page shows Q4 Water operating profits and margin. Water operating margins expanded 20 basis points to 11.2% in the quarter, a significant accomplishment given the mix pressures. I'm pleased with pricing and productivity was constant in Q4 helping the offset inflation. While CPTs seasonality help Water margins in Q4, we expect to drive meaningful improvements in CPT margins going forward through a combination of volume leverage, lean-driven efficiencies as well as synergistic cost takeout from the Q4 repositioning efforts. Through the application of lean disciplines we've already made progress in multiple plans. Examples include machine setup time in half, doubling output of cells with no additional headcount and rolling out our safety first Program, all while reinvesting these savings to create Lean Leader rolls at all CPT sites to ensure a compounding, sustaining impact as we move forward. Overall I'm pleased with the Water performance this quarter and continue to be excited about its future with CPT in the fold and the global investments we've seeded over the last several years. Now let's move to Slide 4, for a review of Technical Products. Technical Products sales were up 2% in local currency and operating profits were up 12%. The topline results reflected good price realization with no net volume contribution. While the majority of end markets we served continue to grow nicely including industry, energy, commercial and infrastructure which all grew double-digits. Communication which accounts for nearly 20% of Technical Products sales was down 19% in the quarter. Consistent with what we've said in Q3, roughly half of that decline reflects the lumpiness of the telecom program going end-of-life, and the remainder is due to communications market softness overall. Technical Products grew fast growth region sales higher by 25% in the quarter, led by impressive growth in China and Southeast Asia. We continue to execute our in-region for-region strategy including repositioning our Qingdao operation to more directly focus on serving the China market with branded products. In Brazil, we've begun localizing thermal production to support our row global cooling initiative. We continue to leverage our lower cost manufacturing capabilities in strong brand to build our position in key growth markets and expand distribution. While there is still more work to be done, Technical Products increased fast growth regions sales an impressive 28% for the year to over a $135 million. Technical Products operating profit grew 12% in the quarter with an impressive 80% drop through in-sales. Operating margins reached 16.4% in Q4, a significant accomplishment given our continued growth investments and mix headwinds for fast growth regions. Bottomline in Technical Products is that like the market, we're growing. We continue to see robust growth in U.S. and global industrial as business spends is more on maintenance and capital. We're also benefiting from some positive mix shift away from communications and our established lean disciplines continue to drive margins higher. Please turn to Slide 5 as I cover the full year. 2011 sales grew, a strong 14% year-over-year to record $3.5 billion. This reflects 6% organic growth including roughly a point of foreign exchange benefit offset by a negative 2-point impact from GIWW. For the year, U.S. organic sales grew 5%. Fast growth regions were up over 20%. And Western Europe was up 3% in local currency. Our clear focus in execution on growth initiatives are driving topline results. At the operating margin line solid pricing, productivity and lean action helped offset inflation in the CPT acquisition impact of 20 basis points. Pentair adjusted margins expanded 70 basis points in 2011, on top of prior year is a 140 basis point improvement. At the same time, we continue to invest in global capabilities and technology innovation in sales and marketing. From a segment view, Water revenues grew 16% for the full year. With CPT innovation and distribution all playing key roles and margins expanded 60 basis points. Technical Products grew revenue 10% for the full year and expanded margins by an impressive 190 basis point, on top of last year's 230 basis point improvement. The bottom line for 2011 was adjusted EPS of $2.41, which was an increase of 21%, so 2011 marks the year of solid sales growth and margin advancement along with significant progress and strategy that we believe position us well for 2012. Now let's turn to Slide 6. Details of the free cash flow are on the left of the slide and a summary of our debt levels are on the right. We finish the year strong, generating $61 million in free cash flow in the fourth quarter. This brought our full-year free cash flow to $248 million representing a net income conversion of greater than 100% and above our goal once again. We returned approximately $80 million to shareholders through dividends and recently raised our 2012 quarterly dividend 10%, which equate to an annual dividend of $0.88 per share marking our 36 consecutive annual dividend increase. In addition, we repurchased $13 million in shares under our share buyback authorization program to help offset dilution and have a similar program in placed for 2012. ROIC, which is shown on the bottom right section of the slide continues to be a key priority for our organization. We're exiting 2011 at 9% on ROIC, up 80 basis points from the 8.2% at the end of last year. Our goal continues to be to drive ROIC back into the double-digit range. Not let's turn to Slide 7. Beyond the numbers, we made good progress on our strategic priorities, setting the stage for future success and sustainable growth. Organically, we increased fast growth region sales 22% in 2011, totaling about $650 million with CPT. We also meaningfully advanced our global water and fluid process capabilities through acquisitions, Clean Process Technologies and Hidro Filtros in Brazil. Both acquisitions directly aligned with the biggest mega trend driving the world today, and that is the population in the wealth growth that what we call the new world. This is putting incredible pressure in demands on food, water, energy and industrial and transport infrastructure. On the innovation front, we remain committed to investing for growth and serving these growing needs. Sustaining higher R&D investments deliver customers what they need including better efficiency, sustainability, automation and safety. We continue to be recognized by customers for our service and our innovation solutions. We continue to grow beyond market rates by identifying new adjacent opportunities including expanding our global thermal platforms in Technical Products which is up 40% outside the U.S. as we design, develop and manufacture new product in China, India for China and India. In Water, we see exciting new market opportunities at high growth areas like dairy and agriculture. Another key growth driver is Pentair Integrated Management System. We continue to improve product quality, on-time delivery, workplace safety as well as cost-and-cash as shown by our 80 basis points gross margin expansion in 2011. We also have over a decade of generating strong cash flow, consistently converting greater than a 100% of net income to free cash flow, all investing for future growth. We also recognized our one-year anniversary of the rapid growth process, training over 500 global years in this new disciplined growth process and adding another strong tool in our PIMS toolkit. We believe that progress in 2011 to advance our strategy in technology and innovation, fast growth region and PIMS positioned us well for sustained profitable growth in 2012 and beyond. And the Q4 repositioning actions are yet another catalyst as we better align to capture fast growth region opportunities, flow resources to the best opportunities and lower cost structures in developed regions. With that, let's turn to Slide 8 for a snapshot of our realignment within Water. Three years ago, we implemented our global business unit organization structure, enabling us to advance our global growth strategies and execution. As we leveraged PIMS and incorporated our rapid growth process, we gained deeper insights into their markets, current processes and growth platforms. Now with CPT in the fold, our next step was to ensure that we were aligned around how the customers want to do business, while also recognizing today's market realities. Our new water & fluid process alignment focuses on three key platforms. Two of them flow and treatment in process each represents roughly $1 billion in sales today. Aquatic Systems, which is the renamed pool business, represents roughly $500 million in sales. Within this framework, we will prioritize technology platforms, leverage scale where we can like in flow and have a shared fast growth region strategy across businesses. This will help ensure we are moving swiftly and efficiently on opportunities in key growth markets like China, India and Brazil, maximizing growth, customer alignment and scale, while reducing channel and business conflict. We believe this new water alignment will help us advance our mission towards being an increasingly global company while delivering superior returns to our shareholders. With that, let's turn to Slide 9, which is the same outlook we've provided in December. We continue to expect organic revenue for 2012 to grow in the mid-single digits, margins to expand 40 basis points to 80 basis points and EPS of $2.60 to $2.75 a share. We entered 2012 with good price cost momentum, additional price actions underway and a strong track record of productivity. With additional savings expected from our recent repositioning actions and the improvement in CPT margins, we believe we can manage the continued mix pressures and foreign currency headwinds. We also expect to once again convert greater than 100% of net income into free cash flow and improve an additional 50 basis points in ROIC. With that, let me turn it over to John to review in greater detail the 2011 financial performance and 2012 guidance.
John Stauch: Thanks, Randy. Please turn to Slide 10 where I'll discuss the adjustment items enacting full year reported EPS. The acquisition-related costs, including deal cost, customer backlog and inventory step-up adjustments, came in at $0.15 for the full year, in line with initial estimates with no carryover into 2012. The restructuring charge totaled about $0.08 in the fourth quarter and $0.10 for the full year, which reflects the repositioning actions Randy discussed. Recognizing today's market realities, we've reduced capacity and consolidated warehouses to lower cost in developed regions. At the same time, we've better aligned the channels between CPT and the Bayswater businesses and taken a more market-backed look at key fast growth regions to ensure we are leveraging the broader Pentair portfolio and have the right prioritized investments in the right regions. And last is the goodwill impairment charge of $1.82 in the fourth quarter, resulting from an annual impairment analysis. Under GAAP, goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step process. In the first step, we determine that the carrying value of the Residential Filtration business exceeded its fair value. From there, you move on to the second step, which includes a rigorous and thorough valuation analysis of the business and all the assets and a revaluation of goodwill. The second step resulted in $200.5 million pre-tax reduction of goodwill and a Residential Filtration GBU, which is primarily triggered by performance in valves and tank products for water softeners in developed regions. As Randy mentioned, we still feel that our technology in this business, especially the to-be-launched Hybrid DI, our Homespring application and all of our point-of-use technology for fast growth markets has significant value. But the steady downturn of the U.S. housing market combined with a shift in the pro channel, the retail channel which pressured profitability and the performance of this business in Q3 and Q4 of 2011 could no longer sustain for accounting purposes the value of the goodwill in the balance sheet. So we wrote it down to what was more in line with the business outlook, reflecting the realities of today's market. Because the majority of our goodwill is not tax deductible, we've only a small tax benefit associated with the impairment, $19.4 million, resulting in an after-tax charge of $181 million or $1.82 per share. With that as a review of the adjustments, let's turn to Slide 11 for a view on the ongoing operating performance. Over the past two years, we've expanded margins by 210 basis points with another 40 basis points to 80 basis points of expansion expected this year. Lean discipline and productivity enhancements along with repositioning savings will positively impact 2012, all while continuing to invest more in R&D, technology and selling/marketing growth initiatives, primarily in fast growth regions. In 2012, we expect to build upon the product quality, on-time delivery and workplace safety improvements of a year ago, enabling us to serve our global customers better and more efficiently. We're anticipating our repositioning efforts to drive over $20 million of savings in 2012, equating to approximately one-third of the top end of the net productivity range we provided in December. This gives us a higher level of confidence in our 2012 operating targets while helping us fuel future growth. Another key enabler to our margin expansion is improving CPT margins. With roughly 15% EBITDA margins for the Pentair ownership period in line with our expectations, full year CPT EBITDA margins for 2011 were about 12%. Along with volume leverage, we're driving material sourcing savings, lean transformation and a tighter profit focus to increase profitability. Net pricing and productivity should yield even better results for us in 2012. We expect pricing to yield 150 basis points to 200 basis points for the full year with most pricing actions rolling in during Q1 and early Q2. We expect material inflation to moderate a bit in 2012 compared to the persistent inflation of plus-4.8% last year, providing a better price material cost dynamic. In 2012, we'll continue to prioritize and allocate our resources to the best opportunities available. We'll continue to fund our growth initiatives with R&D and sales and marketing investments critical to driving share gains and delivering long-term sustainable growth. Corporate cost should increase by about $5 billion versus 2011 due to higher pension and medical costs and global investments in business development, brand marketing and fast growth market infrastructure. Please turn to Slide 12 labeled Q1 2012 Outlook. For Q1, we expect the Water revenue to be up approximately 20% over the first quarter of last year with Technical Products up low-single digits. This puts total Pentair revenue up 13% to 15% including the contribution from CPT of approximately 10 points or roughly $80 million in sales. We expect operating income to grow 7% to 12%, which equates to operating margins between 10.5% and 11%, slightly below the Q1 2011 margin of 11.1%. Because of the seasonality of CPT and the softer geographic mix, we expect Water margins to be down 50 basis points to 100 basis points. We expect Technical Products margins to expand 30 basis points to 50 basis points, reflecting some carryover pricing actions. Below the line, we expect interest expense to be about $8 million higher in Q1 of this year versus Q1 of 2011 and the tax rate between 29% and 30% consistent with full year 2011 results. Overall, we expect earnings per share in the quarter to be between $0.53 to $0.57, which equals growth of 2% to 10% over last year. Also, we want to remind you that like previous years, our cash will typically run negative in Q1 due to the seasonality of our revenue. Please turn to my next slide, Slide 13, labeled Q1 and Full Year 2012 Outlook. As we said in our December call, we anticipate generating roughly of our EPS in the first half of 2012, which implies the modest first half growth rate and specifically Q1, as shown here on the slide. We expect once the European headwinds to carry over into the first quarter, impacting both sales and profitability. Further on, sales year-over-year growth in Technical Products is negatively impacted by the choppy telecom project by roughly 3 points in Q1 and into Q2. While the CPT acquisition adds Q1 sales, we expect CPT margins in the low-single digits in Q1, typical of their normal seasonality, but we are working hard to improve to focus on higher margin projects and a transition to an improved operating structure. In addition, we have an incremental $8 million of acquisition-related interest headwind related to deal which we did not have in Q1 in 2011. Pricing and reposition savings should ramp in the first half before reaching the full run rate in Q3, thus being the lightest benefit in Q1. All in, we are expecting a good start in Q1. We have a clear path forward for growth and margin expansion in 2012. Please turn to my next slide, Slide 14, labeled full year 2012 outlook. For the full year 2012, we are reaffirming our previous guidance initiated in December. We expect revenues to be up 7% to 10% to about $3.75 billion at the midpoint and we anticipate $445 million to $470 million of operating income, which would yield operating margin expansion between 40 basis points and 80 basis points. We continue to expect another solid year of EPS growth with earnings per share of $2.60 to $2.75. We expect free cash flow in 2012 to be roughly $270 million or at least 100% of net income. We are targeting a 75 basis point increase in ROIC by the end of 2012. Please turn to my last slide, Slide 15, for the summary. Our record sales and strong operating performance in 2011 demonstrates our excellent execution of growth and productivity initiatives by both our Water and Technical Products teams. Our presence in fast growth markets has never been stronger. And we'll continue to leverage the investments in new product development and selling and marketing that we have ceded over the past few years. We continue to covert income to cash at very healthy rates and deploy disciplined capital allocation strategy through balance of dividend, buybacks, high-return capital expenditures and acquisitions with strong strategic fits. In 2012, we are committed to our growth agenda through disciplined investments, focused resource allocation and prioritized initiatives. We look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. With that, we'll open up for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Robert Barry with UBS.
Robert Barry - UBS: Based on how you calculate the return on invested capital, how much of the improvement, if any, was related to the goodwill impairment charge?
John Stauch: Very small, 10 basis points, 15 basis points. What we do is we basically a take five quarter average of the ROICs we blended in. So we don't have the full investment base of CPT in yet either, but there isn't a full benefit from the goodwill reduction within the Residential Filtration business either.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Lucas with Janney Capital Markets.
Mike Worley - Janney Capital Markets: This is Mike Worley sitting in for Jim. Not that we would expect 80% incremental margins intact to continue, but what was the main reason for that and would we return to normal like 35%, 40% in 1Q?
Randy Hogan: The biggest drivers of that are they really are lean champions and they had good price and they had real positive mix. The declining communications, communications is the lowest margin. So they had a positive mix shift. That helps too. So yes, you can expect it to drop more than normal rate. I still think high end of that normal rate. They are solid, solid business.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Credit Suisse.
Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse: Randy, hoping you could touch a little more on the realignment of the Water global business units and maybe how this helps you in terms of a better sales channel, go-to-market strategy and also operationally in terms of driving productivity. And how do the benefits specifically play out in your mind over the next couple of years? Does this change your thinking in terms of M&A amongst those various buckets, or that's not really relevant?
Randy Hogan: Well, let me start with that. Our M&A focus continues to be in the areas of technology. What we're learning is that there is some more attractive businesses like dairy-like industry. Those have the highest margins and they have really good growth fundamentals. We're looking at applying anaerobic MBRs into a broad array of industries and we have market-leading capability there, the CO2 recovery, same thing. The realignment is really to do a couple of things. Number one, it's to allow us to get some cost synergies from the CPT acquisition. The Nijhuis business that we bought, which is really a pump business, we get more synergies by aligning it with our pump businesses. And as we look at that, we look at our high-performing Residential Flow business and our struggling Engineered Flow business, we saw an opportunity to take cost up by putting them all back together. And it was particularly relevant as we look to globalizing. We have a lot of brands in the U.S., for instance. Their channels are well established. But as we go overseas, we had gaps in coverage and we had conflicts in brands that we can make coherent by managing it as one unified piece. So that's the answer in Flow. In terms of Filtration, we still have two GBUs in Filtration: one, the Residential Filtration; and two, the more technical process solutions. There are similar technologies, but the applications and go-to-market are very different, ones that imply capability and the other one is more through distribution. But again, as we go to these new countries, we want to go to Pentair. We don't want to go to individual GBUs. So that's the other big change we're making here. So in China, we are Pentair. We are not Pentair Residential Filtration. We're not CPT. We are Pentair. And we see big leverage there. For instance, I was recently in Chongqing, 32 million people. We only had three salespeople and they were all Residential Filtration. It's an industrial capital of the city. It's a huge opportunity for us. So we need to be there as Pentair for Pentair. And that's a big part of the realignment. And then finally, the focus on pool leading our efforts in agriculture, because we already sell 20 million, 25 million worth of equipment with the RAS segment of agriculture with the use as pool equipment. And actually, our advanced pool equipment helps raise the yields in those applications. So we're quite excited about that and we saw that name change better captured where we're investing on our platforms. So we're seeing the benefits both in terms of cost and in terms of prioritized investments and being Pentair, not individual GBUs in the markets.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Quealy with Canaccord.
John Quealy - Canaccord: It's Chip Moore for John. Just hoping you guys can talk about what you're seeing in January in a little more detail, particular in the muni market, and if you're still looking for that to be down sort of in the single-digit range for the year?
John Stauch: If we take a look at Q4, we did as we shared in December see a pretty steep decline in November and we did have a nice recovery in December. And so while Western Europe is still a challenge for us in the first part of 2012, we did see a distributor reaction based upon the economic outlook in Europe that we think impacted us, primarily as Randy mentioned, Residential Filtration. As we look out to 2012 at the muni market, we still think it's down to single digits globally. Clearly, a customer base that doesn't have a lot of money. Break and fix will probably still get done, but large projects that have been anticipated continue to get the lag. So we're still anticipating a tough outlook for the municipal market for 2012.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with MKM Partners.
Josh Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners: Just maybe to dig in on China for a moment, given the macro-sensitivity there, are you guys able to calibrate same-store or same-city sales? I would imagine that you're moving west and penetrating more cities as you go in some of the more established cities on the East Coast. Has growth flattened there or gone negative? Just maybe help us calibrate within country. Is the growth coming from additional regions or more growth within already established regions?
John Stauch: It's a combination. First of all, we do about $130 million and $140 million in China. So our growth rate is still strong in the 20s on the volume basis. Obviously we're coming from a little lower base than some more established organizations. But it is continuing to add distributors, adding new customers. And as Randy mentioned in his comments, we've got more localized content with more localized production with more localized marketing application. And then I think there is a lot to this one-Pentair aspect in serving the customer the way the customer wants to be served. So all those things factoring in and we still see a pretty strong outlook for our products and technologies for 2012.
Randy Hogan: All of those things are really more than offsetting. What we have seen, which is some of our more established distributors having more difficult, as no surprise here, getting financing to put in inventory. That is the impact of the government being more strict about where monies go. So we have seen that too. But as John aptly described, the new initiatives and the new coverage is where it will sway.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Can you just run through within the mid-single digit organic growth again? How are you thinking fast growth regions versus Europe versus North America and maybe just touch on how you're thinking about FX relative to your guidance?
John Stauch: If you look at full year 2012, Jeff, we've got FX sort of $100 and 50 basis points in the headwind. You're going to see a predominant amount of that in Q2, not assuming we're going to get back the FX levels to year-old levels that we had last year. So let's call it 100 basis points to 150 basis points. Acquisitions as you know, will still carry over and give us about 5 points. But if you look at core volume growth, it's close to 4 points. And in that context, we're thinking 15-ish for fast growth regions which for us is about 20%. So I kind of gave you what developed is looking like and within that we have context of European down about 5%. And we still see some growth in the U.S. domestic market.
Jeff Hammond – KeyBanc Capital Markets: And you're not really changing your revenue guidance, so what's the offset to the FX?
Randy Hogan: Meaning what?
Jeff Hammond – KeyBanc Capital Markets: It means is FX materially worse from your December outlook?
Randy Hogan: No, its not. Ironically, the year-olds ending or ended 2011 starting in January, about where it was last year, I think the difference is that we just don't see it spiking in Q2 the way it ran up last year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Jefferies.
Scott Graham - Jefferies: Just wondering, how Water versus Technical Products order rates where as the quarter progressed?
John Stauch: You're talking about Q4?
Scott Graham - Jefferies: Well, you indicated muni business kind of weaken and then improved a little bit. But I'm just wondering if you can maybe look at that more holistically by segment. As the quarter progressed, you know, October, November, December how did these businesses do, just trying to identify from this trend?
John Stauch: The Tech Products, we knew it was going to be low growth, because we knew what communications impact was. I mean it really came in the way we thought it would, with the low single-digit growth in the fourth quarter in Tech Products. In terms of Water, what caused us to trim our guidance in December was the fact that Western Europe was a lot weaker. And we saw weakening in November. And in December it was still weaker, but not as weak as it was in November. Muni came in the way we thought it was going to be, but it was weak and we expected it to be weak. The surprise for us in the quarter was how much weaker Western Europe gone in the Residential Business in November and December.
Randy Hogan: And Scott, just to add to that, we usually expect and see summary stocking in Q3 due to the season within Residential and Residential Filtration working its way out more in the summer months. We don't usually see in November a sort of correction, and that's what caught us off guard in the Q4 with the November correction primarily in Residential Filtration distributed base and as we mentioned those tanks and valves specifically.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Drab with William Blair.
Brian Drab - William Blair: Just wanted to ask about the Residential Filtration business again and make sure that I didn't miss something but the outlook for that business in terms of organic growth 2012. What are your expectations there? And then how is the JV with GE Incorporated into that thinking and how is that business doing? And I think you mentioned the Spring Business. I'm not sure what we're talking about there?
Randy Hogan: Let me start with the JV. The Residential Filtration is the JV. We set that up in mid-2008 and with the expectation that housing was going to strengthen and we would have the clear market leading position particularly in the developed world. And we have that. We have that position. We've actually made great progress in terms of new products and innovation and going global, particularly with a point of use product. The problem was that U.S. market didn't come back for that business. And the western European market got worse. It's that simple. So strategically and if you will in terms of the initiatives we're investing in that business, that business has done everything we expected it to do and it has been very aggressive on taking cost out too. So it really singularly is driven by the housing downturn going longer and having a greater impact on water softeners and basically water softener is something that, if you lose your well pump or you lose an injector pump or you lose a trash pump, if you have a grinder, you're going to replace it. If your water softener goes out, you can buy bottle water. It's more discretionary purchase and that's really the whole impact there.
John Stauch: I'll hit the growth, we still and if you take a look at point of entry products which the valves and tanks, they were flattish for the year. They were up slightly in Q1 and Q2 and a big correction in Q3 and Q4. So when you take a look at the outlook for next year, we still think we'll be flattish on that side of the business. And we got strong double-digit growth on the fast growth markets on the point of use. So this business is still expected to grow mid-single digits. The challenge is to make a lot of money and the piece that's flattish. And we're starting to make good money on the piece that's growing internationally in the fast growth space.
Randy Hogan: Well, we moved Homespring. Now we make that in China. We improved margins dramatically. It's an exciting product. It's still at a price point where and it is a discretionary purchase, so it's where I think now with our lower cost, we can be more aggressive in terms of pushing it in. We're also very excited about the Hybrid DI which we showed at the Aquatech Show. We call it Hybrid DI because it not only replaces a softener, it does some of the same characteristics as in RO systems. For the first time, we'll have it and introduce this year a solution for those communities that don't want to have salt discharge anymore. And we think that the opportunity that that presents is enormous. And again, we'll be commercial on that maybe this year. So there are some exciting things going on in that business.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research: Just referring to the balance sheet, from my calculations I calculated that you guys are kind of bumping up against your three-and-a-half times debt EBITDA covenant in Q4, I'm just curious how did the charges in the quarter kind of playing to those calculations? And also is there an equity or capital based covenant associated with your debt as well. It's not highlighted anywhere?
John Stauch: We're nowhere near the covenant levels. And if you take a look at the debt levels versus the 500 plus of EBITDA, we're nowhere near the numbers that you're referring to. And well within those bank limits and most of those bank limits allow for non-cash adjustments anyway.
Randy Hogan: And our banks have no problems with this one.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with Citigroup.
Deane Dray - Citigroup: Just as you're going through the realignment of the broader business units and I missed what you said regarding CPT. I trust it's in that process technologies, is that correct?
John Stauch: Yes, if you take a look at this product line what we call the purification on the one side which is basically the Residential Filtration and the rest. And what we've really done is we've taken Nijhuis out of that and put it up in the Flow. So we have a strong technically focused group that includes the higher tech side of CPT.
Deane Dray - Citigroup: So the initial plan when CPT was acquired is you were going to run it as a standalone business. Does this reflect some integration of the business further within Pentair?
Randy Hogan: If we characterized it that way, that was certainly not intended, our intent was to get to know the business before we made decisions on how to run it. So we wanted to do is run it throughout the year and get to know the business intimately. So that when we did make changes they were smart changes not some kind of top-down corporate America, slam down changes, which many of us have seen before. So the intent always was once we understood Nijhuis and the dynamics to how Nijhuis, the pump business, worked with the waterside of CPT was to say how can we get synergy. And as you know, we ended up selling some Nijhuis pumps through our Engineered Flow sales force. This was much more natural in terms of what we've done here. And we took some cost structure out when we did. So this is perfectly to plan.
Deane Dray - Citigroup: And then how about some color regarding what is the seasonality impact in the first quarter of CPT. Just what it is about the nature of their sales that would be softer in the first quarter?
Randy Hogan: Part of it is I would call it cultural organizational training. There was a business that always focused on the year and so the fourth quarter was the crescendo and then they kind of paused in the first quarter. A lot of the first quarter business, at least as we look at it traditionally for that business was our pump business in countries that we longer do business in. But we exited those businesses, those countries. And so we're not getting that business which would typically be in the first quarter. So it's a seasonally weak quarter. We'll see overtime whether that will continue or whether will end up flattening things out as they go. But that will come with the knowledge and work.
Deane Dray - Citigroup: Randy, it's right I mean that's just a private equity model that have to shift to a public company model and that Q4 is very meaningful, and I think overtime Q4 will be a little less contribution and we'll get to more normalized activity in Q1 and Q2, as we flattened that project and that booking cycle.
Randy Hogan: Particularly as we drive our lean disciplines. The first thing that hit me with was capital expenditure request because they were out of capacity. We've already run three lean events and we've created about 20% capacity. As we get to more of a lean kind of a pulse from the business, I would hope we could flatten things out and then create capacity and use it earlier in the year.
Deane Dray - Citigroup: And then just last question from me regarding CPT is, what are you expecting for contributions from new products in 2012?
Randy Hogan: On a percent basis, I don't that have on the top of my head.
Deane Dray - Citigroup: Is that the roll out of some of those new membranes or is that more of a 2013 of that?
John Stauch: We're going to see the first rollout of the nanofiltration about midyear and we think that application is going to be an exciting one. And as you recall, a few years ago we built and RO system in Vietnam to basically remove silica for feed water for new power plant in Vietnam. And RO is a sledgehammer as we've talked about before. But this first application is aimed at more technical removal like silica, that plant would cost less than half of it would applying in nanofiltration solution. So we think that there is a whole range of solutions for that that are going to be very exciting. We're also very excited about the anaerobic MBR. The anaerobic MBR and the CO2 removal in beverage and in another food process is a huge opportunity to improve the efficiency as well as the environmental footprint of all of these plants. And we've talked before about the yoghurt plant in the U.S. with the Anaerobic-MBR, it's very, very exciting. We've already sold two more. So that's something we're very excited about.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois with Longbow Research.
Garik Shmois - Longbow Research: Just wondering how much or if any of the dry and warm weather in North America played into the strong results improving the quarter and if so, is it possible to quantify how much of demand was put forward away from the first half 2012?
Randy Hogan: We don't think in the fourth quarter that we saw a lot of pull ahead, because in fact the carryover of orders into the first quarter were stronger than they were year ago. In the fourth quarter we had stronger regular orders as opposed to early buy which means that's selling though. And that could be because of the drier weather. But it also could mean, just that we've returned to a more normal application, 30 utilities driving rebates to drive energy is pretty compelling. And 400 additional dealers that we've got in place to drive because of our superior solutions is really why we think we're outgrowing the market.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Terry Darling with Goldman Sachs.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs: Just wanted to get a little more color on end market expectations within Water in 2012. John, if I follow the discussion correctly and I qualify, water up 9 to 12 for the year, call it 6 to 9 ex-CPT, call it 7 to 10 adjusting for the currency headwind roughly. And I think I heard you say you're expecting municipal down mid-single digit. Can you take us through the other segments, just a broad brush, what you're expecting on organic?
John Stauch: As we mentioned, just more of the 20% in water is fast growth that we think is going to grow at least 15%.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs: I'm sorry, John. I was talking about like Resi Flow, Engineered Flow, pool.
John Stauch: If you take the Engineered Flow business, I think you're down mid-single digits to flat, with exports around commercial being a little stronger than they were in 2011. And then you've got what we think is a continued muni headwind of around 5 points of decline. Residential Flow grew mid-single digits last year. We still think it's growing mid-single digit this year, helped by agriculture, which we think continues to grow double-digit. When we a look at Residential Filtration, we mentioned mid-single digits with a lot of its fast growth penetration offsetting which is likely to be flattish developed market shipments. Who we still think will be high-single digits based upon trends in the market, all the factors around the dealers, certainly the energy efficiency place that Randy mentioned, we don't see significant slowdown in what would be high-single digits growth rate in our pool business. And we've also got the agriculture penetration that Randy mentioned. All in all, I think we grew overall volume in water last year as roughly 5% all-in for water, absent price in the foreign exchange and acquisitions that we think is about a point lower at around 4% this year.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs: So if the way to connect the dots between those comments which map to mid-singles, you're not including price in all those segment indications?
John Stauch: That's correct. Price for water, we expect to be around 175 basis points to 200 basis points.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs: What was it again for all of 2011?
John Stauch: It was just around 100.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs: Do you need to take additional price increase actions in the channel to get to that number or are we talking about a run rate or January price increases that they get you there?
John Stauch: You're talking about everything that's either in or planned at the moment. I mean it's anticipated and it's lined up.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs: Are there any other acquisition revenues other than CPT in the mix for 2012?
John Stauch: Not at the moment, I don't know.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs: So did the CPT revenue expectation for '12 come down because of the weakness in Europe?
John Stauch: Well, I mean it may come down slightly, but I mean with still strong double-digit growth.
Randy Hogan: We still expect double-digit growth. There is a impact on it, Terry. I mean when we were at about (technical difficulty) CPT and we're now about 30-ish. So there is that impact. But other than that, core volume is roughly the same.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Rose with Wedbush Securities.
David Rose - Wedbush Securities: I have a follow-up on the CPT revenue expectations for next year as well as the breakdown in Residential Filtration. CPT you're guiding for mid-single digit growth in the first quarter. Why are we seeing an acceleration for the rest of the year to get to strong double-digit growth, particularly when you said you're deemphasizing sales and focusing more on margin?
Randy Hogan: We got a plethora of opportunities in CPT and what we're doing is prioritizing those that have repetitive sales after them. So things that we can do and sell and then have a repetitive sell-through in the industrial cycle. And the second one is backing away from some of the lower margin aspects and a lot of those happen to be in muni where you're solving water issue once and you don't have that repetitive sales. What you're seeing in Q1 is just a little bit more FX headwind on the business and a little less Western Europe volume. But we're starting to ramp the backlog in the business and we feel pretty good about the second half opportunity there.
David Rose - Wedbush Securities: This is one of the calls that you haven't talked a lot about ultra-pure water aside from boiler feed, but you've talked about life sciences, some microelectronic opportunities, similar markets that Paul serves. Is there still expectation that we'll see more in the ultra-pure side?
Randy Hogan: I just used a couple of examples with basically the nanofilter we're launching mid-year is going to be a superior product to put into ultra-pure applications. I just used some of the simpler ones, if you would, as the examples, because they're real-time and we're already selling them. But no, we still see opportunities there and we're still excited about.
David Rose - Wedbush Securities: And you've been talking about anaerobic MBR for almost a year and you have two products. I think you've said you've made two product sales. How much of the system sales each?
Randy Hogan: They're millions.
David Rose - Wedbush Securities: We don't have a number? Okay. So we'll expect that to ramp up?
Randy Hogan: Yes.
David Rose - Wedbush Securities: When we look at the Residential Filtration market and break it down between point-of-use and point-of-entry, I'm trying to better understand the dynamics. From what I understand, you've got a lot of growth in the point-of-use mostly from the emerging markets. You've identified a weak U.S. and European residential market that's point-of-entry. With that said, what do we expect for the Hybrid DI given that macro?
Randy Hogan: It's like the Hybrid DI is going to have high margins and it's going to enter at the high end. And ultimately as we get changed in some places where you'll need to put them in, it will have a ramp, as I said before on another call, it's not going to have iPad kind of a ramp. But it's going to have a very profound impact over time on how people solve treatment problems, particularly in areas where discharges is an issue, which basically means anyplace that's arid and have water shortage problems.
John Stauch: Just to give you numbers, think of point-of-entry which is the valves and tanks and water softeners as being about 60% of the business and the other 40% in what we call point-of-use. And the rest of the world solved their drinking water issue at the point-of-use and the one particular area they're going to drink from because of the cost and also footprint issues. And so that part of the market and the technology there is doing exceptionally well. I still think we feel that the rest of the business will recover. There is a need for it. It's 10% to 15% penetrated in North American market. It's right now struggling to get financing and that's challenging both the price point and the penetration rate.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Robert Baird.
Mike Halloran - Robert Baird: Could you just talk a little bit about the water margin side of things? Sequentially comparable revenue and water for Q1, but down margins, but then as we work through the year here, obviously a nice sharp recovery and expect some year-over-year growth. Is it really just the seasonality component particularly related to the CPT business and a little bit of the resi softness? Could you bucket those out a little bit?
Randy Hogan: I would say it's 80% of the CPT margin headwind and the rest, which is a little bit of the Western Europe headwind, will make pretty good margins. That's it. I don't want to overcomplicate it. We're anniversarying and putting CPT for the first time in the first half of the year. It's not going to make majority of their income. And as we mentioned, we'll be improving that as we go forward. But it's going to have a margin headwind hopefully one last time in Q1 and early Q2.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Jefferies.
Scott Graham - Jefferies: Just on the goodwill impairment, could you tell us the sales size of the business that this affected?
Randy Hogan: Yes, about mid-400.
Scott Graham - Jefferies: And if I may, John, you're not thinking this way at all on CPT. But clearly, you saw a couple of things in the quarter that you didn't like. How do we avoid this on CPT three, four years from now?
John Stauch: Well, I think we're looking at two different things. We had a series of business we combined in the residential period where the residential housing market in North America was at two-point-some-million. So there was certain expectations and valuations of the things we put on the balance sheet that reflected that. I think where we're with CPT is obviously looking how into industrial process and some things that I think are a little bit more predictable as far as what their revenue contribution could be. I mean trying to say it's 20-20, but it's hard think back to 2 million housing starts going all the way down to mid-400s. When we got to 2008 and we revalued and put the GE business in our fold, we had what we felt was a realistic view of the residential market, but it was significantly higher than where we are today. So we still feel that we're long-term going to hit the value of the business, but it's getting harder and harder and therefore why we took the charge to get the accounting of perspective to agree with our particular views of where residential is going to go. So I think we're in good shape with CPT. Clearly, it's going to be about executing and all the things that we shared with you and internally to our strategic plan.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stewart Scharf with S&P Capital.
Stewart Scharf - S&P Capital: Just wondering how are you planning to prioritize your cash use with debt-to-capital at 40%?
John Stauch: Well, our first goal has always been to support CapEx inside the business. The rest would be to support our strategic initiatives.
Stewart Scharf - S&P Capital: Regarding long-term growth guidance for revenues and EPS, you had 7% CAGR and 15% respectively. Does that still hold true through 2015?
John Stauch: We're looking at roughly 5% to 7%-ish this year. So I think every year, that's going to reflect the different type of economic outlook. But we still believe that we're sitting there with our growth outlook this year and we continue to draw our cash and the ability to augment that and the strategic initiatives that Randy mentioned.
Operator: At this time, there are no further questions in the queue. I turn the call back over to the presenters.
Randy Hogan: All right, thank you very much.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Nicole, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Pentair Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Ms. Sara Zawoyski to begin. Please go ahead, ma’am.
Sara Zawoyski: Thank you Nicole, and welcome to Pentair’s Q3 2011 Earnings Conference Call. We’re glad you could join us. I’m Sara Zawoyski, Head of Investor Relations. With me today is Randy Hogan, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Stauch, our Chief Financial Officer. On today’s call, we will provide details on our Q3 2011 performance, as well as our updated full-year outlook, as outlined in this morning’s release. Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company’s anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as the risks outlined in Pentair’s 10-K as of December 31, 2010, and today’s release. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today, and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results. Today’s webcast is accompanied by a presentation, which can be found in the Financial Information section of Pentair’s website at www.pentair.com. We will reference these slides throughout our prepared remarks. Any references to non-GAAP financials are reconciled in the appendix of the presentation. I would also like to point out that all financial results and references to year-over-year numbers in today’s call and presentation are on a continuing operations basis, and comparative with adjusted figures, unless otherwise noted or highlighted. The third quarter 2011 adjustments included acquisition related costs and restructuring charges of totally $0.07 of EPS again as outlined in the release this morning. We will have time for Q&A with investors and analysts after our prepared remarks. With that, I’ll hand the call over to Randy. Randy?
Randy Hogan: Thanks Sara and welcome everyone. Let me begin with Q3 results as shown on slide 2 of the deck. Pentair delivered a solid quarter with sales up 15%, adjusted operating profits up 11% and adjusted EPS of $0.58 up 5% from the prior year. We posted this sales growth in both segments with Water up 20%, and Technical Products up 6%. A good indication that innovation continues to pay off, fast growth region sales remains strong and CPT is off to a great start. We continue to drive demand for our products innovation focused on sustainability, energy efficiency, automation and safety together with strong focus on quality and delivery. U.S. residential sales for example grew 8% in the quarter and 6% year-to-date even without a notable end-market recovery. In fast growth regions, we continue to see good growth with sales up 22% in the quarter before including CPT. Latin America, India and Southeast Asia results stood out in the quarter. Fast growth regions are approaching 20% of our total sales mix of 2011 compared to less than 15% just one year ago. And finally CPT sales grew nearly 25% from their prior year in local currency. With CPT now in the fold, we’re excited about the many growth opportunities ahead. Turning to margins, we said we’d get pricing and we did. 2% in both Water, and Technical Products. Pricing combined with the relentless focus on productivity more than offset inflation in the quarter. As we anticipated CPT temporarily pressured overall margins, but did show sequential improvements on its own from Q2. The below line item tax and interests were in line with expectations. On earnings we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.58 at the high end of the guidance we provided in July, and we now have the most difficult GIWW comparison behind us. We enter Q4 with many things working for us and in our control, including pricing, innovation, and increasing scale in fast growth regions. The end-markets we serve however continue to be mixed. Our updated full-year outlook range of $2.44 to $2.47 reflects both of these realities. Simply put we’re raising the bottom end of the range, reflecting our solid performance and taking $0.03 of the top end of the range to reflect less of a market contribution from mainly Europe. On free cash flow, we generated $70 million in the quarter keeping us on track to deliver more than 100% conversion in net income for the full-year. Overall, we had a solid quarter and we are well positioned to deliver greater than 20% earnings growth for 2011. Now let’s turn to slide three for review of our Water business. Water revenues grew 20% in the quarter reflecting good growth across most of our businesses. The CPT acquisition contributed 17 points of this growth adding roughly $90 million in sales in the quarter. Volume is down 1% year-over-year reflecting the tough comparisons with the large GIWW projects. Recurring volume growth actually accelerated a 5% in the quarter from 4% in Q2, reflecting continued momentum in fast growth regions, innovation, and distribution gains. By global business unit or GBU, residential flow continues its strong performance with sales up 15% in the quarter including three points of FX benefits. U.S. residential pump sales grew double-digits in the quarter helped by a strong flood season. Excellent operating performance by the team enabled us to service customers flood demand in efficient and profitable way. Pump sales in Europe moderated from first half but still grew in the third quarter. Our agricultural lines including irrigation pumps and cross-spray products continued their double-digit growth trend growing 18% in the quarter and showing some nice added traction in Brazil. Residential filtration sales grew 5% in the quarter with FX contributing roughly two points. We continue to transform this business into one that is more global, with more point of use filtration and higher efficiency product offerings. In the developed market, our move towards more salt and energy efficient products and channel partner expansion helped to partially offset channel and discretionary spend pressures in the U.S., and Europe. Fast growth regions grew over 20% in this business. India and Latin American sales virtually doubled in the quarter with more in-country for-country innovation and increased distribution coverage. To further support growth in India, we recently expanded our partnership with Eureka Forbes, a leading consumer company in India with a 7,500 strong direct sales force. Strengthening our foothold in the reverse osmosis market in India at the same time leveraging our goal of production capabilities. Pool sales were up a robust 14% in the quarter as we continue to add dealers, innovate and grow outside the U.S. Q3 marked another good quarter of strong net dealer gain for pool, adding 75 in the adding in the quarter, bringing our net dealer gains for the year to over 300. We continue to lead in innovation around energy efficiency and sustainability evidenced by a strong Eco-Select performance in the quarter with sales up 35%. And Eco-Select now represents over 35% of pools total sales mix, compared to 32% last year. Strong demand for our IntelliFlo variable speed pump platform was a big driver. The compelling paybacks for the consumer along with dealer training and incentives help extend the selling opportunities beyond traditional replacement and new pool sales. With less than 10% penetration for variable speed, meaningful growth opportunity for Pentair’s IntelliFlo remains. We also launched seven new products in the quarter including a new generation of LED Lights and intense moderating control equipment interfaced with consumer devices like the iPad. Engineered flow sales decreased 32% in the quarter with $31 million in GIWW comparison driving 28 percentage points of that decline. The remaining 4% decline reflected continued softness from the large U.S. municipal project sales, only partially offset by higher commercial and industrial sales. Within industrial, demand remains strong for reciprocating and centrifugal pumps in the oil and gas sector which for us was up over 30% in the quarter. U.S. municipal remains sluggish based on funding concerns, but we believe that the U.S. municipal markets reached bottom and we’re beginning to see some bid activity resume. In filtration solution, sales were 8% at CPT led by food service and desalination and including two points of currency. We continue to successfully expand distribution in our small project business in desalination and remain encouraged by some of the larger project wins including a $3 million benefit in the quarter from a project in the Middle East. Foodservice share gains continued in the quarter due in part to the continued global rollout of Starbucks. The filtration solution opportunities are vast in markets like China, and extent beyond the large global food companies. And so we’re focused on those smaller companies too. We continue to make good progress in energy which is expected to be up 10% for this year as we acquired existing technology and system selling off to a broader set of customer needs in the oil and gas market. Recent wins include several natural gas liquid separation systems for gas and shale development in Texas and North Dakota. Let me provide an update on CPT. With just the quarter end, we’re off to a great start. Even as Europe softened a bit, CPT sales grew an impressive 24% in the quarter in local currency when compared to their pre-acquisition 2010 sales last year. Growth was broad based across both water and beverage. The innovation remains robust and the installed systems base is growing helping to support compelling ongoing revenue going forward and replacement components and services. As we move forward, we will move more deliberately and swiftly pursue synergies and improved margins. Globally, we began sharing our CodeLine vessels and X-Flow membrane opportunity. Cross selling opportunity extends to pumps as well. Recently we won a $1 million pump project in the Middle East leveraging Pentair’s customer relationship with sales team with the CPT know how’s [ph] flow technologies superiority. On the cost side, sourcing opportunity is plenty. Lean driven initiatives are just starting and structural cost takeouts have begun with the consolation with some regional buildup. The right half of the page shows Q3 Water operating profits and margins. Water operating margins were 11% in the quarter, while this is 40 basis point year-over-year decline, it reflects an improved base margin performance of roughly 12% from a 60 basis point expansion offset by a 100 basis point negative impact from the lower CPT margins. Price realization was solid in the quarter, up 2% from prior year helping to offset inflation. We’re making meaningful progress on lean enterprise globally in Water. Although CPT margin impact was expected, we’re not complacent on it. As I just said, we expect to drive sequential improvements in CPT margins through a combination of volume leverage, lean driven efficiencies as well as synergistic cost takeout. Overall, I am pleased with our Water performance this quarter. I am excited about its future with CPT in the fold and see leverage from the global investments we’ve seeded over the last several years. Now let’s move to slide four to review our Technical Products. Technical Products sales were up 6% and operating profits were 14%. The top line results reflect solid pricing and continued strength in most end-markets, industrial, general electronics and energy all posted double-digit growth, a continuation from the strong first half performance. Notably the oil and gas opportunity extends beyond Water. Energy which is over 10% of Technical Product sales was up 30% in the quarter as we provide the control of automation cabinets intrinsic to the industry’s capital spending. Communication which accounts for roughly 20% of Technical Products sales was down 18% in the quarter, consistent with what we said in Q2, this largely reflects the lumpiness in some of the telecom programs along with some underlying softness in the general electronics market. Technical Products posted another quarter of nearly 30% growth in fast growth region sales led by China and Latin America. We continue to leverage our global manufacturing capabilities in strong brands to build our position in key growth markets and expand distribution. In China for example, we expanded our distribution coverage, increasing our distribution comp by 20% in the quarter. Highlighting our in-region for-region focus, we launched several new cooling solutions in the quarter designed specifically for the China market. Latin American sales were up 34% reflecting broad based strength across key verticals including energy. While there is clearly more work to be done, Technical Products has improved its fast growth region sales mix to 13% up from the 11% a year ago, and at the same time improved overall margins by an impressive 210 basis points year-to-date. I am pleased with the Technical Product operating margin performance posting another quarter of 17 plus percent margin on vesting a growth initiative. Now let’s turn to slide five. For our Standard work, details of free cash flow are on the left of the slide, and a summary of our debt levels are on the right. We generated free cash flow with $70 million in the quarter reflecting the solid Q3 performance. Year-to-date we’ve generated $188 million of free cash flow and believe we’re on track to deliver roughly $250 million for the year. We returned approximately $20 million to shareholders through dividends in the quarter with an annual dividend rate of $0.80 per share. In addition, we repurchased $12 million of shares under the $25 million share buyback authorization program. We continue to show progress on ROIC just shown on the bottom right section of the slide. We return on invested capital of 8.8%, an increase of 60 basis points. Our goal continues to be to drive ROIC into double-digits as we outlined for you at our Investment Day in September. Now please turn to slide six. For the year, our execution has been sound and we entered Q4 strong with year-to-date revenues up 14%. Segment margin expansion of 110 basis points and 23% earnings growth. Pentair continues to perform well even if the few end-markets have not. On the top line we expect CPT to add roughly $100 million in sales in the quarter. We expect those things that helped us in Q3 to continue including sustained global industrial capital spending. We do expect Technical Products growth rates to moderate reflecting more difficult comparison as well as more challenging global electronics market. In Water, we expect no near-term improvements in U.S. residential markets, still we expect to grow mid-single-digits in U.S. residential markets as we continue to capitalize on the secular trends around energy efficiency and sustainability. U.S. municipal spending remains under pressure, negatively impacting our large pump project business and as a result engineered flow is expected to be down roughly 30% in Q4 reflecting another difficult GIWW lap and down more than 10% ex-GIWW. Across both segments, we entered the back half of the year with a mixed Europe. Today it’s probably a bit more mix with some moderating growth rates in Germany and pockets of weakness in southern part of the Western Europe. For reference Western Europe is roughly 14% of our total sales of which Germany is roughly half. In fast growth regions sales were up over 45% year-to-date and we anticipate continued robust growth in key regions, like China, Brazil and India. We’re just beginning we believe to see the benefits of our investments in these markets including CPT. With higher volume in fast growth regions, from the scale to drive better operating leverage helping to advance margins. We’re committed to driving growth investments, productivity initiatives, and continuous cost structure improvements. In addition, we anticipate price alone to offset inflation in Q4 with productivity coming on top of that. For CPT, we expect sequential improvements in margins. We’re rapidly moving forward in the application of lean enterprise and rolling out the PIMS toolkit across CPT now. We’re also developing plans for a more optimal combined go-to-market approach in key reasons with the goal of selling more together. We anticipate this will result in a charge in Q4 that is not reflected in the current guidance. So despite all of the headlines our view of opportunities remains relatively unchanged. We believe we are well on track to deliver greater than 20% earnings growth and record sales of nearly $3.5 billion. Before I turn it over to John to review the Q4 outlook in greater detail, I know that many of you are interested in hearing our outlook for 2012. We’re working on those plans now and once finalized, we intent to review our outlook with you on September 14. To be sure our focus for next year continues to be growth. We believe the progress in 2011 to advance our strategy and technology and innovation, fast growth regions, and PIMS positions us well for sustainable profitable growth in 2012 and beyond. As we said in September in our Analyst Day, what really enables and supports Pentair’s future are the mega trends that are driving the world. The biggest mega trend driving the world is the population and wealth growth of what I’ll call the new world. And the demand that puts on food, energy and infrastructure. We believe the two businesses that we’re in Water and Technical Products both had great opportunities here around efficiency, sustainability, health, and safety. These mega trends and formally we’re focusing our growth initiatives and investments in Pentair. We continue to control our own destiny through focused execution of our consistent strategy, finding new ways to grow, advancing lean enterprise globally and accelerating our productivity and repositioning efforts. With that I’ll hand it over John. John?
John Stauch: Thank you Randy. Let me begin on slide eight, titled Q3 Pentair performance assessment. We thought it would be helpful to share with you our growth in Q3, absent to GIWW project that existed in 2010 but not in 2011 and the CPT acquisition which is driving a more favorable year-over-year growth comparison. When excluding these two items, you can see our revenue growth was up 8% on recurring organic basis. While modestly below our year-to-date performance, this was in line with our estimates and position us well to finish the year strong. When we make the same adjustments to Water for Q3, you can see that our recurring organic growth from Water was 9% slightly above our year-to-date average driven by mid-single-digit growth in developed markets including two points of realized price and 20% plus growth in fast growth markets. This means effective of products growth moderated in Q3 largely reflecting more difficult comparisons, industrial growth remains strong with some headwinds in global communications effecting growth. Overall our revenue for Q3 was about as expected and still strong compared to our year-to-date performance in longer term growth targeted. When excluding the impact of GIWW and CPT, year-over-year on earnings per share, you can see that the Q3 our year-over-year growth is 18%. A solid performance led by revenue growth, and price cost relationship that was almost neutral and moderating year-over-year FX translation benefits. The Q3 performance sets this up nicely for a solid finish for 2011. Please turn to slide number nine, labeled Q4 versus Q3 business expectations. In light of the solid Q3 revenue and operating performance, as well as from day to day market uncertainty of volatility, we want to share with you how we are thinking about Q4 and what we have included in our guidance. We are expecting recurring organic growth to moderate a bit from 8% in Q3 to around 7% in Q4. This is driven by slightly less foreign exchange tailwinds about a point less, continued strong price realization, moderating Western Europe contribution, and the decline in communications revenue within Technical Products but with other developed markets tracking sequentially inline and continued robust growth from fast growth markets. This expected revenue growth along with a seasonally strong CPT performance will contribute nicely to the bottom line, generating expected EPS growth of greater than 20% for Q4 2011. Please turn to slide number 10. We wanted to provide some richer color on our Q4 2011 EPS guidance. We delivered $0.49 per share of EPS in Q4 of 2010 with about $0.02 of that performance coming from the GIWW projects that was concluded in the fourth quarter of 2010, which means it is the last quarter in which we’ll have a year-over-year comparison with the project. We are expecting net CPT contributions, operating income interest less taxes to be greater than a nickel in Q4 2011 and this key performance quarter of the year generate solid margins. Our base businesses are expected to generate between $0.07 and $0.09 per share which is up about 14% to 18% year-over-year, on the expected seven points recurring organic growth I mentioned earlier. Embedded in this performance is our expectation that return modestly positive our net pricing versus material inflation. And we therefore expect that material productivity to deal even more upside in Q4 and future quarters with net price less net productivity to be greater than material inflation. I would emphasize from the last bullet that our CPT integration efforts remain on track and we expect that we will see continued improvements in the operating margins of CPT as well as strong double-digit top line growth in both with Beverage and Water businesses. Please turn to slide number 11 titled Q4 ‘011 Pentair Forecast. For Q4, we expect revenue to be between $880 million to $900 million. Operating income is expected to be between $100 million to $104 million. Operating margin should be around 11.5% and EPS should be between $0.59 to $0.62 on an adjusted basis or up between 20% and 27% for the quarter. We expect Water revenue to be up greater than 25% inclusive of the CPT acquisition and the year-over-year GIWW comparison. And we expect mid-single-digit growth in Technical Products. Water margins are expected to be around 11.5% and Technical Products margin should be delivered near 17%. We expect that our Q4 tax rate will be slightly less than 29% which will include some modest adjustments to bring our full-year run rate to around 30% consistent with our go forward rate assumptions heading into next year. We’re expecting a strong finish to the year in cash flow or about $60 million which should get us to our target of $250 million for the year. Please turn to my slide, slide 12, full-year 2011 outlook. For the full-year 2011, we are expecting revenues around $3.5 billion consistent with our previous forecast, and EPS around $2.44 to $2.40 on an adjusted basis. These results will have Water up 16% to 18% for the year or up 7% to 9% on a recurring organic basis. And Technical Products should achieve double-digit organic growth for the year. Overall, we expect our gross margins to expand greater than 100 basis points with price plus productivity offsetting inflation and we are maintaining our operating expenses to the 20% targeted level. Overall EPS is forecasted to be up 22% to 24% versus 2010 demonstrating both our growth and operating productivity leadership business. As I mentioned earlier, we are still expecting $250 million to cash flow with a strong finish to 2011. Please turn to my last slide labeled adjusted to reported EPS forecast. Detailed on slide 13 is the quarterly breakout of reported to adjusted EPS performance. Similar to last time, we have divided these into four main categories. Deal costs which were completed as of Q2, customer backlogs which will conclude in Q4, inventory step-up which was completed in Q3 and repositioning actions which includes $0.02 of restructuring in Q3 related to global staffing and manufacturing reductions following the acquisition of CPT. With the CPT acquisition now in the fold, we have looked at our go to market strategy and fast growth and developed regions. Our GE [ph] is structured around key product platforms as well as our manufacturing footprint and logistics optimization opportunity. We expect to announce some further actions in Q4 that will strengthen our capabilities in all of these areas as well as reduce our overall cost structure. We will be comparing the detail of those in the Q4 earnings call scheduled to late January. I will now turn it back to Randy who will give us a quick summary before we turn it over to you for questions. Randy?
Randy Hogan: Thanks John. 2011 is shaping up to be a good year for Pentair, in meanings we better than what we thought it would be at the beginning of the year. As you recall we began the year with EPS expectations in the range of $2.20 to $2.35 a share compared to $2.00 a share in 2010. Today we believe we’re well on track to deliver EPS in the range of $2.44 and $2.47, up 22% to 24% from prior year. This performance reflects roughly $0.05 from CPT with the remaining $0.40 or so cents driven largely by strong execution. So we’re counting on our market snapback in 2011 for several critical markets and we didn’t get it. Despite this, we grew sales and earnings better than we initially expected. As we move into 2012, we have more scale and fast growth regions, good price material momentum and the added technology and application know how of CPT positioning us well for continued success. Thanks for your time in listening. We’ll now turn it over for questions. Operator, take over.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We will pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question is from the line of Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jeff Hammond – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Good morning guys.
Randy Hogan: Good morning Jeff.
John Stauch: Good morning Jeff.
Jeff Hammond – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Just getting to Tech Products a little bit differently. So it seems like that the slowing really is isolated to Europe and the electronics piece. Can you just talk about what you are seeing in your developed markets traditional or electrical business?
Randy Hogan: Yes, the general electronics business still grew and the trough side business still grew in the third quarter. It was really the communication, the larger communication projects that saw that big decline I talked about. That said, we do see softening in Europe which is largely the general electronics and we see as we’ve seen a moderating if you will on the growth rate on the industrial side. We haven’t seen a decline. We’ve just sort of seen it leveling now which is what we’re reflecting in the fourth quarter guidance.
Jeff Hammond – KeyBanc Capital Markets: And what happens to communications in 4Q?
Randy Hogan: Communications is down again in 4Q. So communications is down, general electronics is down a little bit and basically the industrial side is flattening. We’re not getting to double-digit growth to single-digit growth. So that’s sort of how the mix works.
John Stauch: Jeff, just to quantify it. The communications for us is about 20% of total Technical Products and you could think of those down business are like IT is generally the growth decline. That compares to what was growth in Q2. So we saw that slide throughout Q3 and we’re not expecting that to get better, but as Randy mentioned in the industrial side, we’re still seeing double-digit growth in.
Randy Hogan: Getting to double-digit.
John Stauch: In Q3 and we expect that to be more like mid-single-digits growth in Q4.
Jeff Hammond – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. And then just quickly on res flow. What do you think you are benefited just from the opportunistic weather flooding activity?
John Stauch: Yes, I’d quantify it somewhere between $7 million and $8 million Jeff. We have floods every year. I think the difference this year as Randy mentioned where we were much better prepared for the operating deliberate [ph] and made it more profitability this year.
Randy Hogan: And we made a couple of cents this year in the third quarter, the last year we’re in the beginning of the year and we didn’t make any money because it was all expedited and just turns lost productivity. The business did a great job this year. So where the couple of cents and but Europe was probably weaker about a couple of cents in the quarter. So this is how I would like to.
Jeff Hammond – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay, thanks guys.
Randy Hogan: Thanks Jeff.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Jim Lucas from Janney Capital markets.
Jim Lucas – Janney Montgomery Scott: Thanks, good morning all.
Randy Hogan: Hi Jim.
John Stauch: Good morning Jim.
Jim Lucas – Janney Montgomery Scott: Couple of questions, John, at the end there you gave a little bit more color on the restructuring on the quarter and where you’re looking to do some other activities. As you are looking across the portfolio and putting in place these actions, what kind of paybacks are driving the decision making process?
John Stauch: I think Jim, I’d put in two buckets, I mean obviously the staffing decisions are very quick paybacks, right, I mean certainly less than a year. And there is obviously opportunities as we look across the businesses both in the channels and how we serve our customers better. And so we’re really focused market back, customer back how do we optimize the Pentair portfolio. And I think that will be the majority of the restructuring changes we make which really are designed to make it more seamless of doing business. On the plan side, Jim I mean two year paybacks are normal. And we look at the benefit we’re going to get on the logistics and the supply chain. And do we make ourselves easier to do business with and that’s really how we’re gearing our manufacturing analysis on plan.
Randy Hogan: If I could just add one thing and just sort of less about payback and more about philosophy. We continue to need to move our center of gravity to that new, new world, the fast regions. We’ve made good progress. But we have so much more to do in terms of getting our best talent and our best capability to the faces of best opportunities. And that sort of informs our thinking.
Jim Lucas – Janney Montgomery Scott: All right. That’s very helpful. And with regards to the CPT integration, one of the areas you talked about is go to market strategies and you gave a good example of the win in Middle East, when you’re looking at the timing in terms of how quickly being able to go to market, can you maybe expand a little bit more of what you’re seeing in putting the sales opportunities together?
Randy Hogan: Yes, the one we talked about in the Middle East was a great example. We had a good coverage on the ground in a number of countries that CPT didn’t in Middle East and so we had an opportunity. CPT has already technical solutions. And so the two groups who are working very well to get it by the way. The two groups that are large pump area with (inaudible) and CPT pull that together and we’re able to secure than when actually deliver it and it’s pretty impressive. The simpler one are things like we make CodeLine vessels, any kind of high tech membrane goes in a CodeLine vessel. So CPT wasn’t buying those for their own system. So they are now as well as sharing these opportunities so there is both. And then the next step will be there to get what I would call more integrated design of for instance in our systems we have a set of standard systems. We haven’t fully incorporated the technical thinking, we have some CPTs. So I would say that sort of the shared opportunities like our contacts selling their products, their contacts selling our products is one type there. And then there is the cross selling opportunities and then there is the integrated design. Those are the three buckets I just wanted to.
Jim Lucas – Janney Montgomery Scott: Okay. And finally just was hoping you could flush out a little bit more on engineered flow, you know obviously that market remains very next to say the least, could you talk about what you’re seeing on the quoting side, not just the quoting but are these just people getting the quotes, are they potential shipments as well as one of the things in the past talked about is that’s been in North American muni-centric business as you look, are there opportunities globally on the muni side for engineered flow?
Randy Hogan: Yes, the – let me begin with that one, that actually the Middle East one is that kind of we’ve been investing to put people on the ground to sell larger, more sophisticated pump systems. And the example of the win in the Middle East was just that. We didn’t had a ready solution based on our U.S. design, CPT did. I think there is going to be more opportunities as we get our sales force is better trained globally to sell those if you will in other 50 cycle European base design which is a (inaudible) versus our very well accepted design from the U.S. which aren’t as well known in sometimes in 60 cycles versus 50 cycle pumps. So that’s a big opportunity for us. So we do have to get to be more global on that business because we suffer because we’re primarily in the large municipal business. We are in the break and fix world of the U.S. municipality. So we think we will make more progress as a result of CPT technology and our investments. That’s the way I am thinking about it.
Jim Lucas – Janney Montgomery Scott: And then with regards to the quoting activity in the U.S.
John Stauch: Quoting activity is I’d say stabilized. It’s going up a little bit. I am always I am looking forward to see orders going up.
Jim Lucas – Janney Montgomery Scott: Okay, thank you.
John Stauch: There cannot be more (inaudible).
Jim Lucas – Janney Montgomery Scott: Thank you.
Randy Hogan: Thanks Jim.
Operator: The next question is from Deane Dray of Citi Investment Research.
Deane Dray – Citi Investment Research: Thank you and good morning everyone.
John Stauch: Hi Deane.
Randy Hogan: How are you, Deane?
Deane Dray – Citi Investment Research: Just a follow-up on the flood contribution. My guess is that $78 million does not come at high margins since it’s going through big box. So if just comment on the profitability and Randy maybe expand on the point about you said that it was done efficiently and profitable. What went right in being in a position to benefit from that?
Randy Hogan: Yes, let me talk about the position and then I’ll let John to talk a little bit more about the specifics on the numbers but basically when we have the big floods in the beginning of 2010, we were not in the inventory position. We were focused on being efficient on the inventories but we didn’t have a lot of surge inventories and when those floods hit if you recall in the spring of 2010 they were pretty enormous, not necessarily up where you are but in the mid-section of the country. What happens is we end up expediting things out of Mexico, expediting things out of China, expediting things. We’re running a lot of overtime. So we have a lot of negative areas against that product and because it is a thinner margin business, because it’s largely sold to resell, we actually didn’t make money doing that. So the residential flow business is a learning organization. So they said, if in fact we’re going to see more of these kind of larger events which someone predicts we will and in fact we have since then. They have changed their profile. They’ve actually invested more in inventory. They’ve focused through lean enterprise to being much more flexible in terms of their production and so we were ready for this thing. And so we had the inventory. We had the processes in place to ship efficiently and actually make money. So and served customers very, very well. We got kudos from our channel partners there.
John Stauch: I would just add, I mean roughly there is about 20% contribution. So probably about a $1.6 million operating income side which converts to roughly $1.5 to $2.0 but it’s hard to exactly quantify because there will be returns and all kinds of netting costs. So but overall, I think it positions us well to secure the accounts and the way we respond means that we secure our position. It gives us a better negotiating position for 2012 and beyond. So I think we’re very proud of the team and the fact that we are able to deliver on that.
Deane Dray – Citi Investment Research: Great. Thanks really helpful. And then on how does that months play out in the quarter especially for Water July, August, September?
John Stauch: I mean I think July and August are always hard reads. September came in as we expected and July and August was mixed as Randy mentioned and we saw the lumpiness and the volatility across different product lines. So I think overall the quarter was more of a usual quarter of Water. And the Technical Product side as we mentioned industrial remains strong throughout the quarter, and the communications orders and the sales started to slide throughout the quarter which is why we are predicting lower revenues through Q4 in communications side.
Deane Dray – Citi Investment Research: And maybe this should be helpful to hear from you what the thinking was when you reaffirmed guidance for the year but not necessarily for the quarter, quarter seemed to play out fine, the months played out uneventfully but just looking ahead when we see a development like that.
Randy Hogan: We did not want our Analyst Meeting to turn into a quarter discussion, I mean I just didn’t want to do that. I felt like we needed to do stuff to affirm the year just to get it out of the way but we really wanted to talk about where we’re going for the next three quarters.
John Stauch: Deane it’s a standard practice, the full-year was required to kind of a give a launch point for where we were on the four or five year vision. So that’s our standard practice to confirm the year. And at the time of the Q3, there was nothing unusual to update on which is standard procedure.
Deane Dray – Citi Investment Research: Great, that’s really helpful. And then Randy maybe can you expand on the point where you commented that the muni demand may have reached bottom?
Randy Hogan: Well we’ve seen an increased level of activity in discussions and estimations biz and the like in the U.S. So that usually portends an uptick in our activity. So right now, we were not coming on that helping us in the fourth quarter or even I would if I can reach out to the far to the beginning of next year because we have pretty good visibility on that in that business of the quarter. So I think we sort of reached to the new normal and the water utilities or adjustments.
Deane Dray – Citi Investment Research: And then just last question from me, the most recent mix or the run rate mix for your muni business if you separate the break and fix which we recognized as the biggest component but how much is break and fix versus project related sales?
John Stauch: Well probably right around 85% to 90% break and fix at the moment and the rest is project in the North American side. Clearly if you look at the CPT side, as Randy mentioned on a global, there are lot more projects focused and the global bids are still fairly strong, the non-U.S. I mean.
Deane Dray – Citi Investment Research: It’s really helpful. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer & Co: Thank you good morning.
John Stauch: Hi Chris.
Randy Hogan: Hi Chris, how are you?
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer & Co: So I was wondering if you could elaborate on what you’re seeing in Europe, if there are any pockets that have had some jarring developments or just sort of a gradual softening pretty much.
Randy Hogan: I wouldn’t say it’s jarring, I mean it’s no surprise to anybody that Southern Europe is weak that we get most of our sales out of Northern Europe. So the Benelux countries and Germany and France is an important country for us as well. And I would just say that adjunct to the third quarter, August is always slowing here by anyway. And September was probably a little weaker than I would have like to seen coming back. The residential market has been I would say soft all the year. And it’s more in the general electronics area where we’re beginning to see some more softening and that’s an important market for us in Germany in particular. So I’d say nothing specific just sort of a softening.
John Stauch: Just to provide more color to that Chris, probably we’re seeing this across to your landscape but Q1 for Europe was a very nice recovery especially in Germany. But to put in perspective if you look at volume growth our absent foreign exchange contribution in Q2, volumes were up 3% and 5%. So it wasn’t likely with the substantial contribution you still have the some small contribution in Q3. But it’s really I would say that the drop off in Europe happened in Q1 to Q2.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer & Co: Okay, got it. One on the communication side, do you viewing this as sort of volatility in the spend that actually kind of favorable comparisons next year or just how you’re viewing what’s going on there?
Randy Hogan: Communications for us is our lumpiest business in Technical Products. It’s the place where we have the largest projects. So I would say that we have a one big project going end of life that probably has bigger impact on us than just the general level. However when we do look at the general level electronics it’s more challenged than the industrial side. So we’re cautious about that.
John Stauch: Yes, I don’t think we can certainly to do our plans but I don’t think we’re expecting it to be an upside next year. I think we think that that area throughout 2012 to be a tough environment and we’ll plan for it accordingly.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer & Co: Got you. Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question is from Hamzah Mazari of Credit Suisse.
Chris Parkinson – Credit Suisse: Good morning, this is Chris Parkinson on behalf of Hamzah. I just had a real quick follow-up question, you mentioned you gave us some additional color in the cross selling initiatives with CPT. If could give us a little more color on the cost synergies and then how the ramp-ups like how that should occur in the fourth quarter as well as into 2012?
Randy Hogan: Yes, if you recall we weren’t looking at significant cost synergies when we put the deal together as manufacturing numbers and we looked about $4 million. What you’re seeing progressing forward is little over seasonality in CPT and therefore the leveraging of the amortization cost. I think if we take a look and we spent more time with the business, there is certainly things a $3.5 billion company you can bring to a $300 million business that drives efficiency especially in back office. And that’s where we’re expecting to be able to bring the synergies across the year within 2012. So I am looking steady improvements, continuous improvement every quarter as we would look at it and we would look to take a look at any channel opportunities as I mentioned the restructuring and opportunities that changed the business model of CPT going forward.
Chris Parkinson – Credit Suisse: Perfect, thank you very much.
Randy Hogan: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Brian Drab of William Blair.
Brian Drab – William Blair: I have just one quick question on the margins were so high. With respect to the fast growth regions and what you’re calling the new, new world. How are the margins in those regions in the quarter relative to what you see in the developed world and what do you expect going forward?
John Stauch: Yes, I mean obviously the developed world we got capacity and we’re absolutely a lot higher and I won’t give those exact percent, they are pretty high in the developed world but we are 10% in the developing world now which we think is showing and demonstrating what Randy mentioned of scale. And I think we expect that to continually improve. We’ve now got localized product and localized manufacturing to the regions that we’re serving. And we’re bringing to do it lean disciplines around cost management. And we expect the growth to continue. As we mentioned at the Analyst Day, I mean we’re actually hearing price discussions in China for the first time. So with inflation there, I think people are starting to realize that value product is still being priced a little bit. So I think most businesses are in these regions to make money and we’re one of those businesses and we expect that the margins will continually improve.
Brian Drab – William Blair: And then we’ve had lot of questions around Europe, and may I ask a slightly different way, if you look at the water business and then the tech products business separately specifically within Europe and kind of look at how things progress July, August, September, October. How do you characterize each of those segments overall, and given that we’re almost through October now maybe you could make a comment on that month as well?
John Stauch: I’ll give you some quick color on the numbers and I’ll let Randy comment. But consistent with seeing that we brought to the Investors Day and consistent with the way that we’ve been developing and operating projects, these are developed regions, I mean GDP and the amount of population grows is not robust in the regions we’re talking about. Europe for us is less than 20% of our total sales and we don’t look at it as the significant or substantial growth environment. So it grew ultimately for the year greater than our expectation. As I mentioned Q1 was a significant contribution and we started to see a low single-digit growth in Q2 and Q3. That’s in line with what we think it’s going to be long-term. And that’s consistent with both Water and Technical Products. It’s hard to be a globally competitive in euro at the rate that it’s at today. So you really you’re line of growth within those regions. And while there is still growth in Germany it’s not of the growth that’s equal to China, Brazil or India. I’ll let Randy answer.
Randy Hogan: Yes, growth from Germany is really their export growth, that is expensive. We support taking on the Technical Products side. The German X-Flow [ph] and that’s really what helps. Now our Western Europe team also has two of our growth regions which is Eastern Europe and the Middle East. So we want to invest there and when I talk about moving our center of gravity, we’ll be moving from Western Europe to Eastern Europe and the Middle East from United States to Latin Americas. From both of those regions to Asia because our base case has been the same since 2009 when we said that we expect Europe isn’t going to grow much at all for the next five years market. The U.S. is going grow like Europe used to which means that half of the rate of U.S. needs to. But the fast growth markets are going to grow like they are doing now because the wealth of that populations demand there. So that’s really what informs the way we think about Western Europe and the U.S. business, it’s not new thing.
Brian Drab – William Blair: Okay, thank you.
Randy Hogan: And if you will quarter-to-quarter – quarters are annoying [ph] right now.
Brian Drab – William Blair: All right.
John Stauch: So I think it’s important to separate the foreign exchange impact in Western Europe and the actual volume we’ve had there.
Randy Hogan: Yes. And there was no contribution really to foreign exchange in Q1 and you add substantial volume. When you kind of look at Q2 as I mentioned before, volume was mid-single-digits and there was a substantial foreign exchange contribution. If now you look at volume, you are foreign exchange contribution is tailing off and your volumes moderating slightly. That’s the way we describe it.
Brian Drab – William Blair: Okay, thank you very much.
Randy Hogan: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Ajay Kejriwal of FBR Capital Markets.
Ajay Kejriwal – FBR Capital Markets: Thank you, good morning.
Randy Hogan: Good morning.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Ajay Kejriwal – FBR Capital Markets: Good, so just wanted to maybe first follow-up on the U.S. municipal discussion, I would be curious to hear your thoughts on what driving that pickup and bid activity because from everything that we are seeing and reading that does not look like finances of municipalities are improving. So any thoughts on what’s driving that, is that any break and fix that they have not done and they are trying to catch up or is it something else?
Randy Hogan: Yes, I’d call it dead cat bounce, I think it’s more of what were you talking about there. We have different shares and different positions depending on the area. I will go into which areas with. What we feel better is the more activity there is in the municipalities where we have very high share so because our share varies by region to region. So I would just say that the area is that we are particularly strong in have got some larger projects that they have to keep going. And so that’s figure our way but when I say that this is pickup in bidding activity, I am not talking, I am not – that doesn’t portend 20%, 30% growth, it just pretends filling in some blanks. So don’t – I don’t want to even know the reason my comments on the U.S. municipal. They still have funding channels but most water utilities do have some other sources of funds. They can raise the rates and they can do some bonding, that’s other part of cities in the like that’s difficult to (inaudible).
Ajay Kejriwal – FBR Capital Markets: Got it. That’s helpful, and then on pricing you’re getting good pricing across both Water and Technical Products, I guess as material start to rollover and you’re seeing some potential demand issues in Western Europe. Maybe any sense on what – you think you could be given pricing a little bit or could customers be asking for some rollbacks?
Randy Hogan: Well I would say that the competitive dynamics and the customer relationship dynamics hasn’t changed much. Just to roll back history a little bit, one of our beliefs is that the ability to get price is a good market for being in an attractive business and we’ve generally been able to get price in these two segments, Water and Technical Products. We actually constrain, we decided not to raise prices fast as there is – when the recovery began because we work confident enough to raise prices and we don’t want to risk losing any volume because we raise prices. So we rectified that, and got back into what I would say the 2% is more of our structural practice, its normal we’re returning to normal. Material has to support that but it’s really structure that supported our ability to get price more than material. So if anything we’re still catching up on material. The material inflation that we suffered in without raising prices before. So I don’t view them as totally coupled with materials and pricing.
John Stauch: Yes and to Randy’s point 2% is an average net right. So there is certain areas were we’re able to get more price and there is areas where we get lot lesser much more competitive. As you mentioned on the global project side, a lot of times it’s not counted as a price but that’s a bid activity on the global projects is more competitive because of the general pricing is coming down.
Ajay Kejriwal – FBR Capital Markets: Thanks for that. And maybe one more from me on CPT. My rough math suggests margins forestallers, intangibles in the high single-digit. And you’re getting very nice growth here. So maybe help us think about the trajectory from here as the intangibles come down and as you continue to grow, at what point CPT margins come to newer segment average?
John Stauch: Yes, just remember tangibles are flat right for the quarter, and those are over a long period of time. And what we’re seeing is more contribution over that intangible. Q4 will be a nice quarter for CPT. It will be definitely high single-digits or double-digit growth reflecting where they could be, but in the project business. And so Q4 tends to be the strongest season. So listen, I think we mentioned we’re in kind of high single or mid to high single-digit range in ROS [ph] ending 2011. We expect 100 to 150 to 200 basis points expansion next year and we continue to grow on that base, when we expect to make stable progress. So that’s kind of the way I would think about it.
Ajay Kejriwal – FBR Capital Markets: Got it. So the intangibles are flat on a dollar term but as sales increased the percent of sales that go down.
John Stauch: Correct.
Ajay Kejriwal – FBR Capital Markets: Got it. Thank you.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Terry Darling of Goldman Sachs.
Terry Darling – Goldman Sachs: Thanks.
Randy Hogan: Hi good morning.
Terry Darling – Goldman Sachs: John, maybe I am just trying to think through the end-market breakdown there for Technical Products on the organic growth side. So organic up 3% fast growth up 29% so I guess developed markets are down very significantly. Is that the right way to read it and then if you look at the individual segments there, only comps is down with a lot of big growth numbers in the other segments. What else down is from an end market perspective to get you all buttoned up to up only 3% for the segment?
John Stauch: Yes, I think it’s optical illusion on that chart, because we show kind of our high verticals. But fast growth definitely up nicely. And then the only market that was down and it was down strong was communications which as I mentioned is down mid-teens. And everything else was up. Industrial was up strong as I mentioned, certainly commercial was actually even up double-digits, infrastructure was modest up 2% to 3%. And our general electronics was still up. Medical is a market for us that we capture that tends to be lumpy as well, that’s very small market for us, less than 5%, that was down.
Randy Hogan: And security and defense which is a little bit bigger than that one.
John Stauch: Yes, that was down as well.
Terry Darling – Goldman Sachs: You said defense was down?
John Stauch: Yes, security and defense was down about 15%.
Terry Darling – Goldman Sachs: Okay.
John Stauch: It’s only about 5% of the Technical Products.
Terry Darling – Goldman Sachs: Okay. And how big is general electronics as a percentage of segment, at one point, I think you guys had a pie chart out there at 20% but that might be still?
John Stauch: It’s about 10%.
Terry Darling – Goldman Sachs: About 10%. Okay, so between comps and general electronics, about 30% of total. I mean would you think those to combined or down next year or do you think you’ve got some new products or some easier comps in the back half of the year that don’t make it that tough?
John Stauch: I think it’s flattish to up modestly.
Terry Darling – Goldman Sachs: Okay.
John Stauch: But we hadn’t the plan yet but I think.
Terry Darling – Goldman Sachs: Yes, but that’s where you think is not. And then on incremental margins I mean 40% here in third quarter for tech products and guidance implied pretty close to that as well, you’re getting that net price. As you move into next year, is there anything you would have us think about regards to the sustainability of incremental at that level?
John Stauch: I think – it’s really in the planning cycle but that would be our expectation. What you’re seeing as Randy mentioned in more normal environment in which our price and cost are more predictable and therefore the incremental margins are in that direction, also reminds you I mean electrical and industrial possibilities substantially higher in the communication so you can get a mixed backup too.
Randy Hogan: Well and as good as we filled our tech products business in our margins there is not profit (inaudible). It is still higher.
John Stauch: I’d say 40% incremental at least this quarter Terry, and the last quarter for that matter, but pretty tough across industrial so.
Randy Hogan: The 40% is what I mean is the 7% plus as other folks who are talking 20%.
Terry Darling – Goldman Sachs: Yes, okay. And then over to the engineered flow side of the house, I am just trying to put all of the different commentaries together there. You’re going to actually see organic on a year-over-year basis ex GIWW go from I think you said down 4% in 3Q to down to 10% in 4Q. What is driving the sequential deceleration, that’s just the tougher, it’s just the comps dynamics there or.
John Stauch: We had a few projects that were going end of life in 2010.
Randy Hogan: Yes we had some other big not huge projects but now we’re calling bigger that were in the fourth quarter. That’s what’s really I mean to John’s point earlier that there is 85%, 90% for break and fix. In other words, the smaller lovely business because it slows in expected margins but fewer of the big ones.
John Stauch: But Terry, I think the – we have to do a better job of helping everybody understand the global platform and clearly when we look in here (inaudible) from predominant U.S. business that I know reasonable to say that down mid-single-digits might be zero to down maybe 5%, it might be its run rate but when you flip right over the global side and take a look at (inaudible) and CPT we’re up strong double-digits because the global opportunities are still there. I think from finding the capacities Randy mentioned in the go to market on these two businesses combining the engineering talent the capability I think the globally we still expect the global pump platform to be up high single-digits next year.
Terry Darling – Goldman Sachs: Okay, that’s helpful. And then lastly Randy, any update on the private label strategy with CPT at this point?
Randy Hogan: Not any real update but just sort of make it a broader conversation so everyone knows, we believe that there are a lot of folks who we can supply membranes to as I call it – we call it sort of our Intel inside [ph] kind of thinking. We don’t want to be systems providers, we want to be component suppliers to a lot of vertical markets. And so we are pursuing those opportunities more aggressively than the former owners did because strategically they didn’t want to conclude their exit options. We certainly have a difference strategic thoughts in terms of when we think about CPT. But we’re still working on them. I am still bullish on that idea, but nothing new on that yet.
Terry Darling – Goldman Sachs: Okay, thanks very much.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from the Garik Shmois of Longbow Research.
Garik Shmois – Longbow Research: I think you just have question on pool. You’ve got a good job of winning share and penetrating the dealer channel. Just wondering how many more opportunities you have there and how sustainable this is?
John Stauch: I think you saw (inaudible) analysis and you see that they are doing pretty well and the market itself is doing well. We think the demographics of a pool owner is different than that of a broad based consumer group. And I think we think that there is opportunities continue to improve the penetration rate, I mean the penetration rate is variable speed and the energy efficiency is still below double-digits. And there is a lot of more opportunity for that platform as people change out the pumps and go more energy efficient. And also the automation platform and the ability to tie all the energy efficiency into control environment is also a higher penetration rate. So we think there is a long runway left with our current products set. And the more the acceptance rate is across the dealer channel which as Randy mentioned, we added a lot more dealers to our platform. There is also energy we make on this. So we think the momentum is building. So we think there is a long runway left.
Garik Shmois – Longbow Research: Thanks and just as a follow-up, can you just talk about perhaps the margin opportunity as you introduce your new products into the dealer channel?
Randy Hogan: Well margin dollars is a lot better. The margin percentage isn’t necessary best, these products are 2x to 3x higher in products, two or three times higher in price. So the margin dollars are higher but the technology content is also higher. So it’s a little bit lower gross margin but I still like it. So I like the dollars.
Garik Shmois – Longbow Research: Great, thank you very much.
Randy Hogan: Thank you.
Sara Zawoyski: Nicole, just given the time, if we can just get a quick check in terms of who is on the queue or how many numbers.
Randy Hogan: How many people.
Sara Zawoyski: Yes.
Operator: We have five questions left in the queue at this time.
Randy Hogan: Okay, we’ll go through them really quickly.
Operator: The next question is from Robert Barry of UBS.
Robert Barry – UBS: Hi guys, thanks for taking the question.
Randy Hogan: No problem.
Robert Barry – UBS: I’ll actually just ask two quick housekeeping items, one is whenever you gave the outlook for 3Q sales did you contemplate FX in the revenue growth expectations?
Randy Hogan: Yes, and just a way to put in for Q3 it was little lighter in the FX contribution side, the average euro to dollar which is our primary currency was little lowered than what was in the forecast.
Robert Barry – UBS: Okay, and then would you give what the breakout in that walk on water operating profit, $22 million between price and productivity?
Randy Hogan: Well you can see price on the right hand side, the prices shown on the left hand side. Sorry, on the left hand side.
Robert Barry – UBS: All right, fair enough, that was great [ph].
Randy Hogan: On the sales.
Robert Barry – UBS: Yes, okay. Great, that’s all for me. Thanks.
Operator: The next question is from Scott Graham of Jefferies.
Scott Graham – Jefferies & Co: Mine is quick as well.
Randy Hogan: Hi Scott.
Scott Graham – Jefferies & Co: Hi, how are you all doing? Page 10 of your handout where you talk about the high single-digit organic of the base business, this slide has ex CPT, ex GIWW. Previous page is saying were current organic growth of 7% I assume that’s what you mean in that sales up high single-digits.
John Stauch: That’s correct.
Scott Graham – Jefferies & Co: All right, now then the first page.
Randy Hogan: We had...
Scott Graham – Jefferies & Co: Okay. But then the first bullet down below says slightly moderate and year-over-year organic growth comparisons, now I do understand that that includes GIWW at least I think it does but your third quarter organic was two.
John Stauch: Yes, I think what you are arguing about is 7% organic growth high single-digits or mid to high but that you are looking at the same numbers. If you look at page nine, you’ll see that we mentioned the recurring organic is approximately 7%.
Scott Graham – Jefferies & Co: Yes.
John Stauch: For Q4.
Scott Graham – Jefferies & Co: Right.
John Stauch: That 7% is what the sales up high single-digits refers to.
Scott Graham – Jefferies & Co: Right. And that is – the 7% is ex GIWW.
John Stauch: That’s correct.
Scott Graham – Jefferies & Co: So when you say slightly moderating year-over-year, I am not sure what that means?
John Stauch: From just talking from 8% to 7%, so moderating versus Q3 is what we are referring to.
Scott Graham – Jefferies & Co: Okay, versus the.
Randy Hogan: The year-over-year rate in Q4 is slightly or point less than the year-over-year rate from Q3 to Q2.
Scott Graham – Jefferies & Co: Okay. And both of those numbers are ex GIWW?
John Stauch: That is correct.
Scott Graham – Jefferies & Co: That makes sense. Okay, thank you. That’s all I had.
Operator: The next question is from David Rose of Wedbush Securities.
Randy Hogan: Hi David.
David Rose – Wedbush Securities: Good morning. I’ll try to make up quick. If you could on the engineered flow side, can you discuss the strategy to grow the replacement side of the business and the margin component, one of your longer competitors talks about the strength in the aftermarket sales as it relates to a recurring string of replacement business and a higher margin profile. Is there something like that we can expect in 2012 and then.
Randy Hogan: I mean that’s function of two things one if you’re talking about one particular person who is in the rental business, that’s a service business and it’s a pretty attractive business which has a different demand profile. We’re really not in the rental business. And in terms of the service side, yes we service our install base. There isn’t a lot of cross service of other peoples install base. So I mean when I talk about break and fix that’s the service component is in there. We don’t have any major initiative to try to attack other peoples install base at this time.
David Rose – Wedbush Securities: Okay, fair. And then China residential, what you see on a domain [ph] go in terms of sales trends for your products?
Randy Hogan: They are up strong, things for sales are up high double-digits.
David Rose – Wedbush Securities: Okay. And then lastly the 70 products that you mentioned in the third quarter, how much of that would be incremental in terms of revenues for Q4 and or 2012 or is that just filling in existing products?
Randy Hogan: The pool is always a little bit, I don’t have it right on top of my head. It’s always a little bit of a cannibalization but one of the reasons we continue to gain share in pool is the fact that we cannibalize, we innovate over ourselves before other peoples do. So I don’t really have that number off hand but they do get 14% growth and I think a lot of that sales momentum is because of that innovation. So I don’t have really [ph].
John Stauch: Yes, it’s hard to quantify the quarter. The way we look at it longer term is we drive to one to two points on innovation and incremental to what the base growth rate would and that’s what we’re striving for. That’s net of cannibalization in what we’re trying for. I don’t have the exact number within the quarter.
David Rose – Wedbush Securities: Okay, great. Thank you.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from John Quealy of Canaccord.
John Quealy – Canaccord Genuity: Yes, thanks one more for John. You’ve talked about broadening about your capabilities in the energy space and you called up some filtration wins in gas this quarter. Can you talk about some of the figure opportunities you see there?
Randy Hogan: We have a really nice energy business in terms of doing a fluid separation in refineries in chemical plants. Well I mean fluid separation not that we tried but fluid separation is fluid separation. So we have a lot more – we put a lot more effort to get into the exploration production side and particular it’s related to the shale developments in some of this new natural gas area. So there is actually two or three different things we can be involved in helping with some of the filtration around the production fluids as well as some of the energy fuel fluid. So a lot of the ones that I talked about were actually natural – are liquid gases, the propane and the butane and moving from the natural gas stream. That’s sort of like right in our real house. So we’re investing to get people on the ground to sell that more (inaudible) Q3. So that’s what that’s about. Hello.
John Quealy – Canaccord Genuity: Okay.
Operator: Your final question is from the line of Brian Konigsberg of Vertical Research.
Brian Konigsberg – Vertical Research: Good morning.
Randy Hogan: Good morning.
John Stauch: Good morning.
Brian Konigsberg – Vertical Research: I just had a quick question, you were trying to touch on this before with municipal funding and multiple sources, I feel like we’ve gotten different answers to this from different suppliers, but the funding sources between user fees and tax dollars, obviously it’s not that is more user fee type driven and should be a lot more stable than kind of fluctuations we’ve see in tax collections. It seems that more collections had a bigger impact this quarter than I would have thought but maybe you can give us a little more color on the dynamic there and how we should be thinking about it going into 2012, should we tracking more of the tax collections or should we think that as you kind of get more steady from here?
Randy Hogan: What I would say is large scale developments additional infrastructure development track more the ability to keep the system going, the break and fix side goes more to the usage fees and the fees. And so that’s why that money all would be there. It’s whether they are going to do a major upgrade in the system like they did in New York, there was one major upgrade in the suppliers [ph] in New York that was political will and they put the money there. And so it’s those larger scale projects that are really falling off. So I don’t track tax receipts but I track quotation activities and try to put a reality factor on them as to whether the budgetary or whether they are (inaudible) or whether they are budgetary or whether they are actually funded.
Brian Konigsberg – Vertical Research: Got it. Thank you very much.
John Stauch: Thank you.

Pentair delivered a strong second quarter, with sales up 14%, margin expansion of 70 basis points, and EPS growth of 23%. Underpinning these results are successful investments, a growing international presence and strong execution across the board. First, investments in more energy-efficient sustainable product offerings and added global sales coverage continued to yield positive topline results, as evidenced in our Q2 performance. Water sales were up 15% or up 7%, adjusting to exclude Clean Process Technologies, or CPT, and the 2010 Gulf Intracoastal Waterway or GIWW project sales. At the same time, Technical Products grew 13% on top of prior year's 19% growth in Q2. Second, fast-growth regions are meaningfully contributing to Pentair's growth, approaching 20% of our total sales mix in 2011 compared to less than 15% just 1 year ago. In the quarter, fast growth region sales were up 26%, excluding the benefit from the CPT acquisition, and 55% including CPT. Third, we continue to drive meaningful margin expansion through continuous cost structure improvements and strong execution of lean deployment across Pentair, with margins up 70 basis points. And finally, CPT is off to a great start with good top line momentum and plenty of growth opportunities for the combined businesses. On earnings, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.75 compared to $0.61 in Q2 last year. The margin performance of both Water and Technical Products, along with lower taxes from a more favorable geographic mix, drove adjusted EPS $0.03 above the high end of the guidance we provided in April. As a result, we're raising the full year outlook to reflect the Q2 beat, and some added CPT benefits we see in the second half, which John will cover in more detail later. On free cash flow, we generated nearly $180 million in the quarter, putting us on track to deliver more than $250 million for the full year. Overall, we had a solid quarter and a very good first half. We believe we are well positioned to deliver record-adjusted earnings in 2011, all without a notable U.S. residential recovery. Now let's turn to Slide 3 for a review of our Water business. Water revenues grew 15% in the quarter with good growth across most of the businesses and regions. Global expansion, distribution gains and innovation led to higher recurring volumes, which were up 4%. Pricing is solid across all of Water, up over 100 basis points. Largely, though masked by timing of growth rebates. Currency and the CPT acquisition contributed the remaining 13 points of growth. We continue to make excellent progress on fast-growth region expansion, with sales up 26% in the quarter excluding CPT.  Like Global Business Unit or GBU, residential flow sales were up 7% in the quarter, including 4 points of FX benefit. U.S. residential sales grew slightly, helped by greater penetration related to new products and improved service delivery and quality, all evidence of lean enterprise progress. Pump sales in Europe were up double digits, benefiting from a stronger flood season, as well as expanded distribution. Our agricultural vertical sales, including irrigation pumps and cross-spray product was up 14%.  Residential Filtration sales grew 12% in the quarter, with FX contributing 4 points. We continue to roll out a more efficient water softeners that will boost from OEM sales, enabled by improved lead times in service, helped offset what continues to be a relatively flat U.S. market. Fast growth regions in Residential Filtration continue to grow at a rapid pace, up over 45%. China grew an impressive 44% in the quarter as we leverage the innovative in-country for-country product offerings like Pentair Fresh, along with increased distribution coverage. Continuing at this pace, we expect over half of the sales from this GBU to come from outside the U.S. by year end. Pool GBU sales were up 7% on top of the 31% growth in the prior year. While pool permits increased modestly off of a very low base, we continue to attract new dealers through leading innovation around energy efficiency and sustainability. This continues to be supported by a growing number of utility-funded rebate programs across the U.S. including a new one, a $600 utility rebate in Florida. With less than a 10% penetration, the opportunity for Pentair's IntelliFlo variable speed pump is enormous as we move beyond traditional replacements and new pool of construction demands. With a lot of tailwinds, this business continues to post excellent sales growth. The Engineered Flow GBU sales decreased 7% in the quarter. Excluding the $7 million of GIWW sales that we had in this quarter in 2010, revenue grew a modest 1%. Robust commercial and industrial sales helped offset a decline in larger new municipal project sales in the quarter. In commercial, we're encouraged with the progress we're making to grow the HVAC and fire pump verticals outside the U.S., with good gains in the Middle East in particular. Within Industrial, demand remains strong for reciprocating and centrifugal pumps in the oil and gas sector. The U.S. municipal remains sluggish though and in the near term, based on funding concerns. But longer term, we believe municipalities will have to resume repairing and upgrading their water infrastructure, given the stresses in the U.S.  The Filtration Solutions sales were up 7% x CPT, including 2 points of currency, reflecting broad-based strength across key markets including Foodservice and Desalination. We continue to be encouraged by the positive movements in desal, and resulting CodeLine demand. In Foodservice, we continue to grow our presence outside of the U.S., with sales up 60% in China. We also grew in the Industrial, Medical and Energy verticals. Filtration Solutions continue to fire at all cylinders, and CPT is the right catalyst for even greater growth. The right half of the page shows Q2 Water operating profits and margin. Water operating margins were 14.2% in the quarter. This reflects an outstanding base margin performance of over the 15%, offset slightly by CPT, adding to a 40 basis point improvement year-over-year. Price material came in as we expected. We're making meaningful progress on lean enterprise in Water, and it is reading out in numbers with lower cost of quality and improved on-time delivery across our GBUs. CPT margin pressures are seasonal and temporary, with sequential margin improvement expected as we drive volume leverage and productivity. Overall, I'm very pleased with our Water performance this quarter, and excited about its future. Now let's move to Slide 4 for a review of Technical Products. Technical Products sales were up 13% and up 9% excluding currency, reflecting broad-based growth across most end markets we serve. Industrial, General Electronics and Energy all posted strong double-digit growth. Communications is down in the quarter, a trend we expect to continue in the second half based on lumpiness of some of the telecom programs we serve. Infrastructure, a growing part of Technical Products portfolio, was up 10%. And notably, we recently won a $4 million order to provide cabinets for another charging station project in the emerging electric vehicle charging market. Technical Products grew a solid 29% in fast-growth regions led by China, up 33% and Eastern Europe, up over 50% in the quarter. We're investing to drive this growth, building our distributor base and adding selling and marketing resources in more key markets like Russia, the Middle East and Mexico. I'm particularly pleased with Technical Products' operating margin performance, posting another quarter of 17-plus percent margins, while investing in growth initiatives. Through every cycle, Technical Products' earnings power has increased. And 2011 is no different, as we expect to advance margins in another roughly 170 basis points to 17% for the full year. We expect the breadth and depth of our product portfolio, brand, strength and global capabilities to enable us to capture more and more growth opportunities as we move forward in Technical Products. Please turn to Slide 5, as I cover the market trends and key assumptions for the balance of the year. Clearly, we had a strong start with first half sales up 13%, segment margin expansion of 170 basis points, and over 30% earnings growth, putting us in a good position as we enter the second half. On the top line, CPT is tracking slightly ahead of expectations, with an additional $190 million in sales expected in the second half. Of course, the $47 million in second half 2010 revenue related to the GIWW project provides a difficult comparison. Adjusting to exclude both CPT and GIWW, we expect our recurring base business sales to grow in the 8% to 10% range for the full year. We expect those things that helped us in the first half to continue like global capital spending tailwinds, strength in fast-growth regions and investments in innovation and expanded distribution.  In Technical Products, however, we do anticipate industrial growth rates to moderate, reflecting more normal tech product growth in the second half of this year. For our market view in Water, we see no near-term improvement in U.S. residential markets. Still, we have a significant install base to serve with over 80% of residential revenues generated from repair, replacement and upgrade. And we continue to capitalize on the secular trends around energy efficiency and sustainability. We expect municipal spending to remain under pressure, negatively impacting our large pump project business. As a result, Engineered Flow is expected to be down roughly 25% in the back half, reflecting a difficult GIWW lap, and down around 5% x GIWW because of U.S. municipal weakness. Outside the U.S. and across both segments, we expect a mixed Europe with some growth in Germany and Eastern Europe, offset by smaller pockets of weakness in other parts of Western Europe. In fast-growth regions like China, Brazil and India, we anticipate continued robust growth. On the margin line, price and productivity should still offset inflation. Despite the back half of the year with incremental deal integration costs and amortization, along with increased investments, we continue to expect margin expansion of roughly 100 basis points for the full year, which should be quite an achievement. So despite all of the headlines, our view of served markets and the opportunities there remains unchanged since our last update with you in April. We believe we're well on track to deliver greater than 20% earnings growth on record sales of nearly $3.5 billion. Beyond the numbers, we continue to rapidly advance our strategy to expand globally, innovate and drive PIMS across our business, as outlined on Slide 6. In fast-growth regions, sales were up 20% year-to-date and with this growing, comes scale to drive better operating leverage. We're just beginning, we believe, to see the benefits of our investments we've made over the past several years. We've added manufacturing capabilities, global lean enterprise deployment, local engineering and channel development in key markets like China, Latin America and India. These investments are beginning to pay dividends in the form of top line growth and margin improvements. We have now turned our focus to drive added distribution, penetration and coverage. In the quarter, we had a strong Pentair presence, including CPT at the Aquatech show in Shanghai. And we're looking forward to the upcoming show in Amsterdam in November. We also opened up our first flagship showroom in Shanghai in partnership with a large distributor, another means to increase brand awareness with consumers in China. And we're relentless in our pursuit of in-country for-country products with a new wall-mounted RO filtration system called Pentair Zero [ph] as an example that was designed and manufactured in India, specifically for the Indian market. Turning to innovation. Our investments in sustainability, energy efficiency, automation and safety are driving demand for our products. In the quarter, for example, our energy-efficient Eco-Select product suite contributed nearly 40% of our Q2 pool sales compared to just around 30% last year. In addition, we launched our new standardized global RO systems platform for low brackish water, won the Best Green Product Award for Pentair's Rain Switch in Malaysia, and continue to be a key player in providing protective enclosures and cooling solutions for recharging stations in the emerging electric vehicle market, just to name a few. Another growth accelerator is our Pentair Integrated Management System or PIMS. We continue to serve our global customers better every day by improving product quality, on-time delivery, workplace safety and delivering cost and cash to boot, as evidenced by our year-to-date gross margin improvement of 120 basis points with strong cash flow generation. And on the strength of excellent on-time delivery rates and rapid sales growth, Pentair was recently recognized as True Value's 2010 Partner of the Year, a title that is awarded to only one of its 1,800 vendors across all categories annually. We're very excited about the new CPT acquisition, which advances our strategy in every aspect. We expect CPT will add over $140 million in annual revenues in fast-growth markets, add leading innovative and a highly valued filtration technologies including ultra filtration, nano filtration and membrane bioreactors, and provides us an opportunity to leverage lean enterprise to drive greater profit. CPT is a clear fit and high-impact acquisition that we believe creates a stronger, more global growth profile company in Pentair. In sum, we are committed to our long-term growth agenda and continue to make good progress. Now let's turn to Slide 7 for a more in-depth update on the recent CPT acquisition. The business is performing exceptionally well as CPT grew sales double digits and won nearly $20 million in new systems and projects just since we closed. This growing installed system space will help support compelling and recurring revenues going forward from replacement components and services. And we continue to leverage our strong technologies portfolio, now extending it into anaerobic membrane bioreactor systems, for example, to improve excellent [ph] Lower discharge cost and raise biogas yields to not only provide water reuse, but also an energy source for a number of different industries. This all uses our proprietary side stream ultra filtration solution, which is simplist to maintain. The integration work is on track and going well. We're in the process of providing product offerings across all verticals, especially Desalination and beverage. We're also developing plans for a more optimal combined go-to-market approach in key regions, with the goal of selling more together. A good example of that is the CPT team just recently secured a CodeLine sale with a customer in Brazil that prior to this, we have never made sales to. That's the kind of thing we expect to happen more and more as we work together. All critical ongoing activities are successfully complete and trained to consolidating financials. We're rapidly moving forward in the application of lean enterprise and rollout of the PIMS toolkit, with early in sourcing and combined global procurement opportunities already identified. Simply put, CPT is off to a great start. Now let's turn to Slide 8. For our standard work, details of free cash flow are on the left of the slide, and a summary of our debt levels, including the recent $500 million acquisition related public debt. Free cash flow is strong in the quarter, reflecting a solid Q2 performance. Year-to-date, we've generated $117 million of free cash flow, and we believe we're on track to deliver greater than $250 million for the year. We returned approximately $20 million to shareholders through dividends in the quarter, with an annual dividend of $0.80 per share.  Our ROIC, which is shown in the bottom right section of the slide, we continue to make progress on this important commitment, adding another 90 basis points for a return on invested capital of 9%. Our goal continues to be to drive ROIC into double digits. With that, let me turn it over to John to review in greater detail the Q2 performance and 2011 guidance. John?
John Stauch: Thank you, Randy. Let me begin on Slide 9, titled Q2 Performance Excluding CPT. We acknowledge that the inclusion of CPT in your models takes some work. So I wanted to show you what Q2 numbers look like excluding the impact of CPT. The base business, excluding CPT, had a very solid quarter. Revenue was up 8%, 9% excluding the impact of GIWW, which was around $7 million in Q2 of 2010. Operating income growth of 18% was driven by strong margin expansion in both Water and Technical Products related to volume, productivity and solid execution of managing the price material cost deflation.  Overall, Pentair margins reached 13.8% for Q2 2011, which were up 120 basis points year-over-year. Overall, Water grew 5% organically, 7% excluding the impact of GIWW. ROS expanded 130 basis points to 15.1% due to volume leverage, price material cost management and lean improvements. CPT results for the approximately 7 weeks of ownership were $54 million in sales, and roughly $3 million in operating income inclusive of typical integration cost. This was in line with expectations. Overall, a very solid performance for the base business, plus a good start for CPT. This gives us confidence that CPT will enhance our overall business outlook, and be additive to our previous Pentair longer-term expectations. Please turn to Slide #10, updated 2011 CPT. The combined Pentair and CPT teams have put forth a tremendous effort over the last 7 weeks to review the business drivers, R&D pipeline and backlog, connect with the functional and country leaders, and understand the global sales channels. And we are more excited than ever about the synergy opportunities, particularly revenue in the next several years. We have completed our purchase accounting work, and wanted to give you the final impact of this analysis and effort. We now expect 2011 revenue for CPT to be around $240 million, about $10 million higher than our previous estimate, driven primarily by more robust backlog and the benefit of fast-growth markets. EBITDA is still on track to be at 15% for the year. So the base CPT business and 2011 contribution is actually stronger than we anticipated.  ROS, inclusive of amortization and depreciation, however, is now expected to be close to 8% of sales as the value of technology came in a little bit higher than anticipated, causing a slightly higher amortization rate. Since the amortization of the fixed amount, we fully anticipate the margin of CPT to accelerate quickly from the 8% starting point to our anticipated ROS margin target of 15% by 2014, consistent with our previous expectations. On an annual basis, D&A will be about $24 million, and we expect ongoing incremental annualized interest related to the CPT acquisition will be around $30 million. Our ongoing tax rate, inclusive of CPT, is now anticipated to be 30.5% for the rest of 2011, reflecting a more favorable global mix and tax structure. Q2 benefited about $0.02 from the year-to-date true-up to an ongoing lower rate and a one-time tax adjustment related to a change in Wisconsin tax law. All in, and reflective of the stronger CPT base business, we have lifted our 2011 outlook to approximately $0.05 accretion versus the original $0.03 of accretion. We have also included on the lower left an easy way to depict the expected accretion of CPT, given all of its geography impacts on operating income, interest and taxes, with the inclusion of it in our results.  Simply, the operating income is taxed at a blended CPT rate of around 27%, and the $30 million of incremental interest is comprised of roughly $120 million of European float, taxed at a Dutch rate, plus the $500 million of bonds taxed at both the U.S. and Dutch rate, around $13 million of after-tax interest on an annual basis, reflecting approximately 8 months of 2011 ownership this nets to the $0.05 accretion we are now anticipating. We have also included an update on the adjustments related to deal cost, inventory step up and customer backlog. I will give you a better view of this by quarter in a few slides. Please turn to Slide #11 titled, Updated 2011 Adjusted EPS Outlook. Our guidance for Q2 2011 was $0.68 to $0.72 per share. We delivered 75% excluding the CPT acquisition-related cost. This is better than the low end of that range of $0.07, and better than the high end of the range of $0.03, and was up $0.05 versus the midpoint of the range. We have added those deltas to our previous full year guidance of $2.33 to $2.45 per share, which puts us at $2.40 to $2.48 per share for the year. Adding in our current expectation for the CPT business, we are at our new guidance expectation of $2.42 to $2.50 per share on an adjusted basis, up 21% to 25% versus 2010. This means that we expect the second half of 2011 for the base business to be in line with our previous expectations. While the growth rates maybe moderating slowly -- slightly, we still feel comfortable that our price material cost estimates are in line. And our base productivity expectations are reading out. While North American residential and municipal markets remained constrained, we still see good industrial growth and accelerating fast market penetration. All in all, we still feel that the second half is in line with previous expectations. Please turn to my next slide, Slide 12, labeled Q3 2011 adjusted EPS guidance. We want to remind you that GIWW was a very prominent component of the Q3 2010 results. The project added $31 million of revenue last year at high teens ROS or roughly $0.05 of EPS. While CPT results are encouraging and accelerating versus Q2 2011, we are also accelerating some integration activities within the quarter. These consist of migrating IT networks, PCs, updating software platforms, continued sales office combinations and training, as well as other activities that will impact us by about of $0.01. CPT's seasonal strength is in its fourth quarter, led by higher project activity, annual service contracts and aftermarket component sales. The base recurring sales in Q3 are still expected to be up high single digits, and we anticipate a 12% to 18% EPS growth on our core business for Q3. Overall, we are anticipating another solid quarter in Q3, with high single-digit growth plus CPT revenue and continued productivity in the quarter, plus the benefit of accelerating CPT margin expansion. Please turn to the next slide labeled, Q3 2011 Pentair Forecast. For Q3, we anticipate revenue to be between $865 million and $885 million, inclusive of CPT. This is an overall growth rate of roughly 12% to 14% with organic, meaning x acquisition growth of approximately 3% to 4% or roughly 7%, excluding the headwind from 2010 GIWW shipments. This compares to an organic growth rate of 12% in Q1 and just over 8% in Q2. So only modestly lower on a comparable basis. We expect Water to be up roughly 16% to 18%, and approximately 7% to 9% on a recurring organic basis excluding CPT and GIWW impact.  Technical Products should be up around 5% to 7% as year-over-year comparisons get a little tougher, but global opportunities around infrastructure and electronics are still encouraging and abundant. Overall operating margins should be around 11.5% at the mid-point inclusive of CPT, and about 12% excluding the impact of CPT as we continue to integrate the business into Pentair. We expect adjusted Q3 EPS to be about $0.55 to $0.58, and the year-over-year growth rate is negatively affected by the benefit in 2010 of the GIWW shipments. Overall interest is anticipated to be around $17 million, and the tax rate should be about 30.5% as previously discussed. In summary, Q3 may be a little optically challenging, but will still be a solid quarter and should set us up for delivering a very solid second half of 2011. Please turn to Slide #14 labeled, Full Year Outlook. For the full year, we expect revenue to be about $3.5 billion, inclusive of CPT, or up 14% to 16% versus 2010. We expect adjusted operating income to be between $410 million and $420 million, and operating margins around 12%. As previously stated, we now anticipate full year adjusted EPS to be between $2.42 to $2.50 or up 21% to 25% versus 2010. Full year adjusted operating income at the mid-point should be up around 24%. And we now expect free cash flow to exceed $250 million, and our ROIC to be around 9%, inclusive of CPT. For the full year, we expect interest to come in around $57 million to $58 million, and the full year tax rate to be slightly north of 30%, which reflects the ongoing rate of 30.5% plus the one-time benefit in Q2. Overall, we are encouraged with the first half performance, excited about the potential of CPT and confident in our cost actions, which we believe will drive a record year for Pentair. Please turn to my last slide, Slide #15, labeled, Adjusted to Reported EPS Forecast. Before I hand it back to Randy, I just want to make sure that you have the adjustments by quarter for modeling purposes, which are limited to 3 categories: fuel costs, which have all been booked in quarters 1 and 2 in SG&A; customer backlog adjustments, which started in Q2 and will be complete by the end of 2011; and the inventory step-up impact, which started in Q2, and will be complete by the end of Q3, both reflected in cost of goods sold. In addition, we are considering some modest repositioning actions, focused on optimizing the combined Pentair and CPT sales organizations and go-to-market approach. We would anticipate that if these actions are taken, they should help accelerate the earnings potentials of CPT. But they have not been contemplated in our reported EPS forecast at the current time.  I will now turn it back to Randy, who will give us a quick summary before he turn it over to you for questions. Randy?
Randall Hogan: Thanks, John. 2011 is shaping up to be a record year for Pentair with solid top line performance, excellent margin expansion in the base business and our new CPT acquisition firmly in the fold. And while the macro environment is mixed, we believe our strategies to invest in global growth and innovation while leveraging PIMS will deliver sustainable profitable growth as our first half results demonstrate. As we turn the page to Slide 17, again, we would like to remind everyone that we will be hosting our Annual Analyst Day on September 14 in New York, and we hope to see you there. Thank you for your time. Now let's turn it over for questions to the operator. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Robert Barry with UBS.
Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank: I wanted to ask about the price inflation dynamic in the quarter. I think last quarter, you expected to get about 150 to 200 basis points of price this year. And I think to offset inflation, I was curious what your latest views were on that.
John Stauch: We still feel that we'll be in that 150 to 200 basis points range. Water was impacted slightly in Q2 by some sales rebates in our Pool business, which -- those come in as we forecast what the business is going to do for the full season. And that was a few million dollars in the quarter. That won't impact the full year with the timing issue between Q2 and Q3.
Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank: Okay. A question on pool actually. Did you continue to add dealers in the quarter?
Randall Hogan: Yes.
John Stauch: Yes, we did.
Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank: What was the kind of same-store sales basis growth rate in Pool?
Randall Hogan: I don't have that right now, I'm so sorry.
John Stauch: Pool grew around 6%, 7% in the quarter,7% as Randy mentioned. We probably got a point of share from adding dealers. Now we do have a retail component in there that we're building out pretty aggressively, and that was a piece of it as well.
Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank: Okay. And then just a question on Slide 11, which was very helpful, related to the tax, how much is the lower tax rate adding to the EPS guidance?
John Stauch: Yes, it's -- what we've done is our previous guidance around 32% for the year, did not reflect the impact that CPT has on the overall tax rate. So as we look at our full year estimates of both the base business and CPT, the ongoing tax rate now is around 30.5%. That is inclusive of the double taxing of the bonds, as I shared in my comments.
Randall Hogan: I'd add that we anticipated some of the tax benefits when we gave the $0.03 incremental CPT and some of the additional $0.02 is also tax...
John Stauch: Yes. So I mean the difference between the 3 and 5 reflect a little bit better performance in the business, and maybe a $0.01 extra in tax.
Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank: Okay. Because I guess if I just look at mid to mid, and maybe I'm not thinking about it right, $2.39 to $2.46 is $0.07 higher, $0.02 of that is the change in CPT, $0.05 is second quarter. And then if I go to my model and lower the tax rate, it's going to add another $0.05. And probably it's a headwind, but is there some double accounting there? Is some of that $0.05 embedded in the...
John Stauch: Yes, geography is. I mean, the interest is going up substantially, right? And then the tax rate is getting better. That's why we were sharing with you the little chart on slide. Well, we did a little waterfall graph on Page 10, because that's the way to do CPT. And that will help as you look at the geography, and then you think of the impact of CPT.
Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank: Okay. So then bottom line is and maybe you even touched on this in one of the later slides, in the current update versus last quarter, there's no incremental headwind that you're seeing in the back half?
Randall Hogan: Nothing that we didn't already anticipate like more moderating growth in Industrial. So really, the business outlook is STET, and is a little bit better with CPT.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Crédit Suisse.
Christopher Parkinson - Crédit Suisse AG: This is Chris Parkinson, on behalf of Hamzah. Can you just give us a quick update on basically any cross-selling initiatives following the CPT acquisition? In your views, are there any areas of particular focus given the company's end market distribution?
Randall Hogan: Yes, I gave you the one example in Brazil, which literally was something that was -- it hasn't shipped yet. It wasn't in the second quarter. It's an order we just booked. But that's the kind of example where they -- the CPT team has a different reach globally than our business did and much deeper into municipal, globally much deeper into industrials. The case example I gave you where the CPT team sold some CodeLine product was actually to an energy company in Brazil, which we've never made a sale to before. So what we're doing is we're filling out the product line, and making it available to the CPT team. Then there's some straightforward cross-selling, for instance, in their systems business. They didn't use our enclosures. They didn't use our tanks. They didn't use our housing, and that's getting all changed right away, as you can imagine. We call that the in-sourcing opportunity, and so we've got a good handle on all of that. And I'm really encouraged by the -- it's more than receptivity, the welcomeness the CPT team has to do that because it's a real win-win. So 2 efforts, one is the in-sourcing into their systems business in particular, as well as in-sourcing their membrane, the ultra filtration membrane into some of our innovation platforms on, for instance, residential side. And then, it's the filling out the product line and leveraging their, frankly, higher touch deeper relationships with some very attractive customers outside the U.S. And the last piece will be to leverage our position in the U.S. to help them grow particularly in the beverage area and Water in the U.S.
Christopher Parkinson - Crédit Suisse AG: Perfect. And then just a quick question, can you give us a real quick update on the muni pipelines? Is this still basically maintenance oriented, or do you believe there's going to be any inflection over the -- let's say, the intermediate or longer term, where do you see that?
Randall Hogan: Right now, I'm just talking about, leaving aside for a minute the Filtration side, the Filtration Solutions business, which is certainly desal and globally. Our large pump business is in municipals, largely U.S. So we don't get the benefit of some of the spending. We don't have much exposure to that outside the U.S. So I'm just talking about the U.S. market. We saw the quote activity rate fall drop down, so our backlog is at a low point right now. Quote activity is picking up. That's encouraging. But until it turns into funded orders, I'm not going to hold my breath. And that's why we said what we said about the second half x GIWW being down 5% for that business despite the fact that commercial and industrial sales will be up globally. And that, we anticipated that. I wish it wasn't true, but that's the reality we're seeing right now. And I think it will still remain break and fix. Something has to change there. I mean, the opportunity we believe is actually going to be different when it comes back. It's going to be water reuse, which is attractive for us with CPT, and our other opportunities on the backside of wastewater. And they're going to have to find new creative ways to pay for it because municipalities are going to remain constrained for a while even though they have pricing capability in water. So it's going to be an interesting debate as to how that gets solved but it has to get solved, particularly where there is heavy drought.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with Citi Investments.
Deane Dray - Citigroup Inc: We've had a lot of focus on the upside coming out of CPT from the Water perspective. I'd be interested in hearing a little bit more color on the other part of the business, the Foodservice. I know you called out some pretty heavy growth coming out of China. So will you just take us through what the opportunity is, how do you go to market? So we're very comfortable in -- you know the water sector, you know all the water customers. You do some business in Foodservice today, but how much of this is new territory for you or selling additional CPT products to existing customers?
Randall Hogan: Sure. Great question. And let me differentiate between Foodservice. We use Foodservice to describe what we do with Starbucks and McDonald's, and Darden restaurants and the like. So that the -- in restaurants or in hospitality versus food and beverage, which is, if you will, at the factory level which is the focus of the CPT. They're the world leader in the beer business, in Beer Membrane Fil, MBRs -- actually, BMR -- BMFs, Beer Membrane Filters. And we've had a number of very encouraging discussions with the highest level, with the leading manufacturers of beer. And they actually view CPT as part of the Pentair fold as giving additional opportunities for us to expand what we offer in those areas. So that's one of those areas where we're filling out, if you will, the product portfolio, to leverage their very, very strong coverage in the beer business. Similarly, they have leading positions in a number -- they had some really great reference installations in the soft drink area. So again, because of our region and our depth, we're having very encouraging discussions to try to grow that. Because their market share is leading everywhere in the world in beer. It is spotty in soft drinks. So we see an opportunity to fill out market share globally. And then in the dairy business, in particular, their share is low in North America, which is the largest dairy market. So we see real opportunities for them to grow here. Leveraging the MBRs, in particular, not just on the product side, but in the waste side, it varies. I mean, I mentioned the anaerobic membrane bioreactor application. That's basically taking the waste in huge diaries and turning it into one, a water reuse opportunity and two, into biogas that they can use to fund their facilities. So it's a big focus area for us. Their positions with what they call the signal [ph], the market leading positions in, I'd say, is the highest quality, highest value valving. And valving manifolds are used in beverage, as well as Haffmans, which is CO2 removal and CO2 reuse, which is both a green activity. That's also a nice cost savings for the businesses. So we -- a lot of our -- the water investments are easier to think about. The beverage, the food and beverage ones are very exciting as well.
Deane Dray - Citigroup Inc: Is there a big margin differential between the Water and food market?
Randall Hogan: Yes. Food and beverage is higher and in some cases, meaningfully so. But when you take a look at the life cycle on the water side, it's good margins too.
Deane Dray - Citigroup Inc: That's good to hear. And over in Technical Products, as you were clicking through the end markets, what kind of jumped out to us was the comment about the opportunities in charging stations for electric vehicles. And this is kind of reminiscent of the opportunity you all had in the wireless base stations, a couple of cycles ago. So what is the opportunity? What's the content for Technical Products, and how do you see this growing from here?
Randall Hogan: Well, I mentioned the one project that's at over $4 million in content for us in that 1 project. And that is just to place maybe 1,000 units out in the field, and what we're doing is we're doing basically the housings, pedestals, wall mounts, a bunch of different pieces in both the power source and then the individual charging stations. And we -- I'm not going to give you a number, because I've seen some spectacular numbers for the opportunity, but I'd like our team to come up with our own sense of what that opportunity is. As you know, we've done integration in a very high level. And a number of the companies we're talking about are really more technology companies. And they're not really manufacturing companies. So we're very excited about the opportunity, but I can't give you a number now. But I think that's a fair thing for us to mention, and we'll give you that September 14.
Deane Dray - Citigroup Inc: Is there an opportunity in thermal, India's charging stations? Will they be outdoors?
Randall Hogan: Yes, a lot of them will be outdoors. Generally, at the power source itself, at the transformer, there may be some cooling opportunities. But it will probably be air to air. It won't be fully air conditioned, I wouldn't think, but I'm getting out of my league here.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Cox with Piper.
Michael Cox - Piper Jaffray Companies: My first question is on the capacity expansion you've done in China and India. Where do you sit today in utilizing that? And I guess, what sort of runway for growth do you have in the facilities you've already built out?
Randall Hogan: Well, as many of you have seen, you've been through the facility. We've doubled the facility in Suzhou. We now have -- in Wuxi, we have a pump manufacturing capability, and we still have big opportunities. I would say we're 60, plus or minus, 5% utilization right now, and filling rapidly since we -- particular, with the focus on this in-country for-country. We talked about Pentair Fresh. We talked about a number of other things. We now make CodeLine in China, which lets us get underneath, inside, if you will, the duty that made us uncompetitive in China with our CodeLine. And so we're gaining rapid market share there. And so we still have a lot of room for growth with the space we built. And we have fantastic leadership there.
Michael Cox - Piper Jaffray Companies: Will you anticipate a similar type of program in Brazil at some point?
Randall Hogan: Well, we have. We made the acquisition in residential filtration, Hidro Filtros. And in fact, John and I are going down there as soon as we get cleared with a few things in Brazil. And we think Brazil offers that kind of opportunity. Whether we'll build that out in a similar fashion or not, I think it remains to be seen that it is clearly investable. It's an exciting opportunity for all of our products and the ones we talked about for CPT. That's why CPT has a better position there than we do on the industrial, municipal. And we can leverage that. Yes, we think we have at least that much of an opportunity in Brazil.
Michael Cox - Piper Jaffray Companies: My last question on the GIWW, what sort of headwinds does that leave in the fourth quarter? If I remember correctly, most of that was pulled into the third quarter last year but...
Randall Hogan: Correct, it was mostly third quarter.
John Stauch: It's going to be $16 million of revenue roughly in the fourth quarter and $31 million in Q3.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: I like the slide that showed the Water x CPT there, John. It looks like it did high 30s incremental margins again. So I just want to ask for an update, how you see the fundamental state of all incremental margins for the base business. And then once we get at year end, maybe with CPT, how you think those revenue leverage compare...
John Stauch: It's a great question. If we take CPT and GIWW out of the equation, because we're looking at this ourselves, our incremental margins at this segment line were over 35%, and expected to be 35% for the full year. We obviously have slightly higher corporate cost as we're still continuing to invest in marketing and our sales offices globally. And it's north of 30% at the overall Pentair level. Clearly, for CPT, we're in the process of figuring out what those incremental margins should look like. For CPT, I think we're expecting more of the 20% type of incremental. And we would still be targeting our base business to be north of 30%, and we got to figure out what the mix is. And the difference is they're project-based business, did not go out at the type of incremental margins that a component-based business would be. And there are some exciting opportunities, as Randy mentioned, where we continue to build out reference sites but at the same time, starting to place more projects into some key vertical markets. So I'd say right now, between the component mix and the project mix, 20% incremental for CPT is the more credible number right now.
Christopher Parkinson - Crédit Suisse AG: Okay. That's really helpful. And then since you mentioned the general corporate, I didn't catch it if you talked about it earlier. But with the acquisition now and you're talking about some of the investments, what should we think about for a run rate in the back half next year for the general corporate?
John Stauch: Yes, for Q3 and Q4, in our corporate guidance, we have between $15 million and $16 million a quarter. It usually runs a little higher in the beginning of the year. We have the accelerated accruals and the stock options and those types of things. And the variability in corporate flops around between the medical expenses. But I mean, we're not seeing anything unusual at the moment. So I'd say between 15% to 16% in both Q3 and Q4 is the general run rate of corporate.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Okay. And then last one, the expanded distribution in Europe in the resi flow side, can you talk about where you are in that strategy and what the opportunity is?
Randall Hogan: Well, we -- our focus has been in Eastern Europe in particular, but we made progress in France and the U.K. as well. We haven't reached that much in Italy and Spain. There's not a lot of action in those countries right now. But Eastern Europe is the biggest opportunity, and we made good progress there.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Garik Schmois with Longbow Research.
Garik Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: First question is just on the sequential movement for your EPS guidance from 3Q to 4Q. If you look back, I think, historically, 3Q tends to be a stronger earnings number than 4Q. Just if you could walk us through sequentially what you're expecting, is it some seasonality in CPT or something else there?
John Stauch: Yes, I mean, for us, just to set the basis, and we didn't have a Q3 earnings guidance out there. We had a back half. And historically, for us, Q3 and Q4 are relatively flat with each other with the difference being that we have less of a pool season in Q3, more of pool season in Q4 is the early buy. And then some of the residential businesses are stronger in Q3 and fall off in Q4. That's just the normal trend. But Q3 and Q4 tend to be generally the same. What's happening in the dynamic is last year was helped by GIWW in Q3. And that's why I think that distribution was set off. And overall, we've learned a lot more about CPT. And we realized that they have annual service contracts, which for the most part, the profit is flat in Q4. The way that their aftermarket of the membranes and the component ship out is more skewed to Q4 due to maintenance cycles of those businesses. And then their projects tend to be booked earlier in the year, and also shipped into Q4. So a lot more skewing to the Q4 in CPT. I think we've had some original estimates that suggested that. But I think in the firming up, we now know that. And so we're going to see CPT more skewed to the back half of the year on a go-forward basis.
Garik Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: And I guess, just one more question on CPT, you mentioned a 15% return on sales longer-term target. What kind of annualized revenues would you need to get to that 15% view?
John Stauch: It's actually a little inverse of the thought, right? I mean, the higher the revenue, the more likely the higher the project. And therefore, the more squeeze on the overall operating margins. There is enormous opportunity and a lot of demand for most of the products and all of the projects that CPT is participating in. And the challenge for Randy and myself and Mike Schrock will be working with our business leaders to determine the right profitable projects by country and by verticals. And we expect north of double-digit for sure of growth on an ongoing basis, and that's what our view of 150 basis points a year margin expansion is based upon.
Randall Hogan: If I could on that, our goal is to get to 15%. That's our goal for the whole company. And we know structurally, this business can make it. But as John said, we view CPT as a great opportunity that also, gives us a platform to build a strategic position that's frankly unmatched. What informed that view is our view when you look at the pressures on the world, and you take a look at the pressures on not just from population but wealth growth, which frankly drives pressure on energy and food and water, even more strongly than population growth itself. And you take a look at the stress that the world is under in water both in terms of water directly and water use in energy and food. There's 2 undeniable technologies that are going to be put to play. One is desalination, if you're near the ocean, and the second is water reuse wherever you are. And so when John talked about those systems and putting in those and making those bids, we are -- I think we have a leading position in terms of the reference sites today. And we intend to continue to lead in building out those reference sites, because we are going to be number one in those businesses. That's our goal.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Jefferies.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Kind of the same question but looked at a little bit differently. The third quarter guidance versus the fourth quarter guidance relative to the organic growth, you guys have a stated goal of 8% top line growth, which is certainly admirable. And you've been achieving that recently but more because of the comparisons being easier this quarter or organic growth was about 4, and maybe add a point or 2 for the GIWW. Third quarter of your organic growth, if my math is right here, looks about flat to plus 2 kind of thing. And then the fourth quarter organic growth probably looks more closer to your target. Is there anything in the third quarter other than what you've mentioned in your bridges, GIWW shifts? And any other shifts in other businesses, particularly residential that we are kind of pushing out from the third quarter to the fourth quarter?
Randall Hogan: Yes. You're right. Our long-term goal is 5% to 8% organic on a sustained basis. And we're actually better than that if we actually had U.S. residential growing at all, which it isn't, with the exception of pools did grow. But the other U.S. residential businesses, as we mentioned, we don't expect growth in the second half. So in the third quarter, more of a normal pool. And then Pool actually stronger in the fourth quarter than the third quarter. So that's -- that may be the whole difference...
John Stauch: Yes, and there is a point of growth related to an end of life program around telecom and Technical Products that's negatively impacting Q3 results more and a little bit in Q4, and that is the program that's end of life-ing, that we've been shipping the light speed program. So other than that, no, we're growing, as Randy said, around 5% a quarter, 6% a quarter for the year, absent those programs. And we're doing it without the market help that we anticipated on North America and our country [ph].
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: So if I could just summarize what you're saying here, just to make sure. The fourth quarter organic will be a lot better than the third quarter organic for the reasons that you've put in here in the slides plus what you've just said? Certainly, the third quarter of Q2 '10 was your most difficult comparison of the year. I get that as well. But you're fully believing that what we don't have in 3Q, we will have in 4Q, and will be in that 5% to 8% range again in the fourth quarter. And that, in fact, even though residential has weakened sequentially, you're not changing your residential thinking on your sales growth. It's just all of these sundry items?
John Stauch: That's absolutely correct.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Pokrzywinski with MKM Partners.
Joshua Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC: Just want to go back to the third quarter of last year and make sure I'm remembering the comp correctly. Wasn't there a pretty decent destocking in the -- in some of the wholesale channel, particularly on residential flow? It seems like we should be bumping up against that now? Is there anything we should keep in mind as far as an easier comp there? That doesn't only seem to be flowing through the numbers, I guess, and maybe a partial offset to GIWW? And then maybe just secondly, kind of an update on the distributor at large, has access to credit, curtailed inventory buys, or is there any change of tone there?
Randall Hogan: Yes, if anything, our performance and execution on delivery has improved so much that actually, we -- despite all the flooding talk in the U.S., there is actually, there was more inventory in the channel than the floods needed. So actually, I said that there's -- we don't have a good comp coming. We have ample inventory in the channel. And a big part of that in residential flow in the U.S. is retail, as well as through the Pro channel. I'd say, in retail, they're not constrained by financing at all, but they are cautious. And none of these headlines about uncertainty and Washington's craziness and all these, it doesn't help any of these guys invest. Our distributors have credit available. In fact, if you take a look at lending in general, there's credit available for people who are worthy of getting credit if they want it. And they're not drawing it. But I'd say they're keeping, they're counting on us and other manufacturers, continuing to execute at a high delivery level and with shorter lead times and running at lower inventories. And I don't think that's going to change anytime soon, so until there's a broad-based belief that the U.S. economy is going to grow.
Joshua Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC: I guess what I'm saying or what I'm asking is, is there a risk of another round of destocking from some of these headline issues, or have we already kind of hit bottom on inventory and they're now relying on your lead time?
John Stauch: We had not assumed that there would be a significant destocking because the inventory levels right now are not all that large. I'm not going to predict what will happen if U.S. defaults on their debt, and the borrowings -- no, I can't get there. But I mean, right now, we're pretty much at the low inventory levels. People are buying what they're selling. We've seen a flow through, and our sell through rate is consistent with the inventory. So the 2 issues related in Q3 are just nothing more than we've got that end-of-life program, otherwise our core volume will be up 5, and this is not a whine or excuse. But for us, foreign exchange, we look at as part of organic because we sell in euros in Europe. And so when we have a North American-based business and euro-based business, when that dollar gets weaker, we'll see more sales being shipped out of U.S. And there's some arbitrage there. And so overall, our core volumes are still running in the organic growth range of 5% to 7%, and that's with any bounce back with residential.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Quealy with Canaccord.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity: It's Chip Moore for John. If you look at your base business, it look like sales came in slightly below the range you guys were projecting, excluding CPT. And was there anything -- that was a little more challenging in there than you thought, or is that more of just a timing issue?
John Stauch: North American residential flow was slightly lower, and then we did have a desal project business in our CodeLine [indiscernible] business that got pushed into Q3 and Q4.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity: Okay. And then if you look at the strength in desal that you mentioned, do you view that more as a potential restart to that market, or is this more of a kind of one quarter phenomenon?
Randall Hogan: No. We think it's a -- the financial crisis really stalled a lot of big projects. I mean, the financing, everything just sort of ground to a halt, and we view this as a secular growth coming back. So we believe we're on the uptrend on that.
John Stauch: And we're seeing those projects turn into quotes, and wins and backlogs, and a lot different rates than we're seeing in the North American muni market.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ajay Kejriwal with FBR.  [Technical Difficulty]
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Barbalato with Vertical Research.
Mark Barbalato : So you guys have been performing pretty well despite a weak residential and housing market. And obviously, you guys said earlier that you're not looking for much contribution in the second half. Do you have a view on those markets recovering or an outlook on 2012?
Randall Hogan: We'll give you our thoughts on that on September 14, but our focus in both Residential Filtration and Residential Flow, our 2 biggest businesses that are suffering from that flatness, is to grow aggressively outside the U.S. And that's what they're innovation has been focused on, and that's what we've been driving. So that's where I have them focused. The U.S. residential market, there's no down side [ph]. It has to come back eventually. It will be driven by housing sales. Housing sales will give us a lift even before housing starts. But I don't really have an outlook. We haven't really developed an outlook for our plan base for 2012. And I think we can share that instead. We'll develop it by the 14th and have it...
Mark Barbalato : Well then, I'll wait for the 14th.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Lucas with Janney Capital Markets. [Technical Difficulty]
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Robert W. Baird.
Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: So just a couple of quick sequential questions. Just want to make sure I understand the normal seasonality, Q2 to Q3. If you were to adjust for all the year-over-year impact, specifically, GIWW and back out the CPT acquisition, when you think about your guidance, do you think it reflects pretty normal seasonal trends, 2Q to 3Q?
John Stauch: Yes. I mean, we, as a course of action, I mean, we see a big drop in the Pool business from Q2 to Q3. And that's really what happened seasonally from Q2 to Q3. And as Pool has more normal first half, let's call it, in their cycle that the most difference with taking out CPT from Q2 to Q3 is that one business.
Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Okay. That makes sense. And then on the Technical Products side, as I think about the back half of the year, I know you pointed out maybe a little bit more conservative trends, slowing trends in the back part of the year. When you think about the seasonality there, it implies maybe flattish to down Q3 sales sequentially. Are you actually seeing those signs of weakness beyond just the comparisons being tough and seeing really good performance in that unit...
Randall Hogan: Well, the second to third in Tech Products, you usually see a little bit of a step down because of the European holidays, European markets are important to us, particularly in Germany. But generally, no, it's -- they've had about 8 or 7 good quarters in a row of great growth. And so we're just saying moderate down to that 5% to 7% kind of growth in the second half.
Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: So it's a comps issue more than anything else?
John Stauch: Yes, I mean, that's also inclusive of that project, end of life, I mentioned. So they're still growing at high single digits excluding that. And right now, the trends, the macro trends that we talked about on Water, all benefit Technical Products. And the industrial production cycle is pretty strong right now, and we're seeing that capital and cash being less as it drives productivity in the factories. So it's a pretty good backdrop for Technical Products right now.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Rose with Wedbush Securities.
David Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc.: I just want to finish up on the CPT and then the final question on the fourth quarter. Can you kind of clarify a little bit more the margin impact from system sales on CPT? I mean you had 20-plus million dollars in system sales. I'm assuming that pushed down margins a bit more than what you would've liked or what I would have expected. Is there an impact that we see from that? And going forward, how does that change going forward...
John Stauch: Yes, let me take the first part of it. And then I'll let Randy quickly address some of the market strategic -- I mean, the reason that you pursue the system in CPT, both on the beverage and the Water side is twofold. Your installing a system, which is going to protect and secure the installed base, because you have a proprietary technology that will be replaced with your membranes and/or your aseptic valves. The second piece of it is we're gaining service contracts. Those service contracts allow us to go in and work on the maintenance and get a long-term maintenance contract. So the initial sale of the system doesn't provide what looks like a significant margin benefit, but the life cycle of the system or the project is a very substantial margin. And for the right vertical markets, we want to pursue those aggressively. What we don't want to do is dilute the capacity utilization and/or the resources to chase markets that are not what we would call our core vertical markets strategically.
Randall Hogan: The $20 million I mentioned was ordered. We haven't actually shipped those yet. And so they aren't impacting margins in the near term. As John described how the systems business works, one of the opportunities for us to improve the systems margin is -- now that includes a lot of bought through [ph] Equipment. If you look at the embedded margin on the product that this business makes, it's still 50% plus, so they get a lot of pass through. There's going to be -- we're going to be in-sourcing a lot. We're going to be in-sourcing the pumps, the enclosures, the housing, the tanks, more valves. So we believe we can be competitive on the systems business, and actually raise the margin as we raise the manufacturing content.
David Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc.: Yes and I appreciate the value add, and going forward on the system sales as one of your competitors appreciates as well. The big question is, is how long does that take? Because if your mix continues to be weighted towards the system sales, I'm assuming then the margins will be compressed at least for the rest of this year, and then you start to see the shift next year?
Randall Hogan: The compression in the margin, really, is -- I want to remind everyone, we started at 15% EBITDA. So when you rebuy a business, you restate the fair market value, all of the assets, and then continue the growth on this business at the growth rate that they're delivering now and that we expect to happen. We'll leverage that D&A up relatively quickly. And there's a fair amount of capacity. And I mean, it's not inexpensive to build a membrane facility, and that's volume dependent as well. So we're pretty confident that we can grow the systems, grow our installed base, and continue to raise margins.
David Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc.: Okay. And lastly on the revenue side, clearly, there's a level of comfort that you've had in the fourth quarter for the meaningful step up, and you've walked through the different nuances. I was wondering on the CPT side, if you can give us a little bit more clarity on what percentage of that business do you feel has effectively booked or contracted versus what you expect to sell through other new orders or bid activity that you're working on?
Randall Hogan: We've been generally conservative with our CPT revenue forecast as we get to know the business. So the revenue that we're projecting is primarily all booked.
David Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc.: Okay. And so there is upside to that number?
Randall Hogan: Possibly.
David Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc.: And lastly, if I can, Aurora Pumps, it seems like you have some weakness on that side, is there any particular reason?
Randall Hogan: Well, Aurora was focused on -- it's mostly commercial, HVAC and fire. They're mostly in the U.S., and the commercial market was creamed. Actually, they're up a little bit because of -- in the Aurora area because of export sales and again, I mentioned in the script in the Middle East in particular. So Aurora decline was going on for the last 10, 12, months anyway.
Operator: Presenters, your last question have been withdrawn, you may proceed with any closing remarks.
Randall Hogan: All right. Thank you all again. I look forward to seeing you at the investor conference in September. Thank you.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Stephanie and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Pentair fourth quarter earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Todd Gleason, Vice President of investor relations; please go ahead, sir.
Todd Gleason: Thanks, Stephanie and welcome to Pentair’s fourth quarter 2009 earnings conference call. We’re glad you can join us. I’m Todd Gleason, Head of Investor Relations and with me today is Randy Hogan, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and John Stauch, Chief Financial Officer. On today’s call, we will provide details on our fourth quarter and full year 2009 results as well as update you on Pentair’s outlook for 2010. Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company’s anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements, subject to future risks and uncertainties such as the risks outlined in Pentair’s 10-K as of December 31, 2008 and Pentair’s News Releases. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results. Today’s webcast is accompanied by a presentation which can be found in the information section of Pentair’s website at www.pentair.com. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the line for questions-and-answers. I will now hand the call over to Randy. Randy.
Randy Hogan: Thanks, Todd and thank you all for joining us today. Let’s begin by reviewing our fourth quarter results shown on slide number two. The headline for the fourth quarter is that we exceeded the earnings expectations we provided on October by about $0.04 to $0.05 driven by stronger sales and inline operating margins. Sales $702 million were down 9% year-over-year. Sales in both water and technical products exceeded our initial outlook providing about $30 million of upside versus our estimate. While year-over-year sales were negative for both businesses trends continue to improve sequentially. Fourth quarter negative 9% sales Delta was the best comparison of the year. Sales in our water business were down 7%. Our largest market, North American residential continues to improve sequentially and we continue to benefit from strong municipal water sales. Technical product sales declined 12%; however several key vertical markets did show expansion in the quarter led by infrastructure, security and defense. In Q4, we delivered reported earnings per share for continuing operations of $0.29 which was negatively impacted by $0.18 of non-recurring items associated with intangible and asset impairment charges and restructuring actions. If you remove those non-recurring items we delivered $0.47 of adjusted EPS, which was up 15% year-over-year. So our sales were down 9%, our adjusted EPS grew double digits highlighting the positive results of our productivity initiatives. Total company operating margins on an adjusted basis expanded 140 basis points. The positive benefit from productivity and materials deflation more than offset the negative impact from the sales decline. Relative to our adjusted EPS, our fourth quarter effective tax rate was slightly over 30% and interest expense was better by $4 million year-over-year. Finally, we delivered $30 million of free cash flow in Q4 before a discretionary pension contribution that we made in December. Now let’s turn to slide number three, is provides an overview of our Q4 water results. Here those details, on the top of the slide, we provide standard sale and operating income walks. We will refer to these as we describe the performance of the Water Group. Overall, water sales declined $34 million to $475 million, down 7% versus fourth quarter 2008 or down 9% in local currencies. As I mentioned earlier this was a few percentage points better than the sales outlook we shared in October. Our Flow Technologies business was down 3% year-over-year. Growth in our Municipal business could not completely offset continued decline in U.S. Commercial and Industrial markets. Sales and residential were down modestly, but continue to show sequential improvement. Filtration was down 9% is modest growth in residential and food service did not overcome double digit sales declined in industrial and other commercial markets. As we said last quarter, we’re seeing stabilization in U.S. Residential Filtration markets with industry shipments improving sequentially and with our new product launches in growing systems capabilities we believe we are well positioned for growth in 2010. Pool equipment was down 13%, which represents the smallest quarterly year-over-year decline in the year. The prolonged decline in North American residential new pool builds persists, but we continue to see better sell through in our distributors and demand for our Eco Select energy efficient products remains strong. Now let’s discuss operating profits and margins for our Water Group. On the top right you can see our year-over-year operating income walk for water. Adjusted margins were 11.6% up 140 basis points year-over-year. Margins came in essentially inline with our guidance as productivity actions and materials savings delivered meaningful results and more than offset the impact of volume decline on margins year-over-year. We’ll not included on the walk pay as you go restructuring expenses abbreviated as PAYG on the slide are chilling of as we have completed a majority of our plant shutdowns and moves. In the quarter, we took a charge of $21 million shown on the walk, which gets to you $34 million of reported operating income in the quarter. The majority of the $21 million is the write-down of intangibles and other asset impairments. These charges were determined following end of year impairment tests which determined the book value of certain intangibles and other assets could no longer be supported after 3.5 years of sales declines in our residential businesses. While disappointing, we expect sales and residential markets to steadily improve in 2010 and eventually return to more normal levels. To summarize, water’s Q4, we are seeing an improving landscape and despite sales being down the quarter the expansion of water margins demonstrates the results of our productivity initiative. Now let’s turn to slide number four and take a look at technical product. Year-over-year fourth quarter sales of technical products were down 12% or down 15% in local currencies. Sales exceeded our original expectations as several key markets have stronger quarters than anticipated. Looking at the businesses within technical products our Global Electrical markets declined 16%, while Global Electronics sales declined 13% in local currencies. Technical products adjusted margins were 15.3%, an increase of 220 basis points versus Q4, 2008. Aggressive cost actions and solid execution on our restructuring efforts more than offset the decline in sales year-over-year and margins expanded sequentially each quarter this year, which demonstrates the growing impact of our cost actions. Technical products took additional restructuring actions in the quarter. The $3 million charge is associated with closing an engineering facility outside Chicago that has been consolidated into other locations. So this helps to reconcile our reported operating income of $32 million. Now please turn to slide number five and let’s review full year 2009 results. For the year, total company sales were $2.7 billion. Year-over-year our sales were down approximately 20% as water declined 16% and technical products was down 26%. It’s been such a challenging environment sometimes I still do a double take when I take a look at those numbers and I’ll tell you, this will not be our new normal. Total company full year 2009 margins decline 2010 basis points as tremendous execution against our cost actions could not fully over come the 20% drop in sales volume. For the year, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.47. While down significantly year-over-year, the result was modestly better than $1.40 plus that we’ve forecasted for 2009. For the year, we generated $232 million of cash flow excluding the discretionary pension contribution, that’s a 160% conversion of net income. As John will highlight in a few minutes, our balance sheet remains healthy as we significantly lowered our debt balance and in January, we announced we are increasing our annual dividend for the 34 consecutive years to $0.76 per share. Please turn to slide number six and let’s review some of the key accomplishments in 2009. Before I begin, we’re proud of the tremendous effort of our 13,000 plus employees and what they exhibited throughout 2009. The relentless drive, their ideas, their energy helped ensure 2009 was a year of progress. While markets were dreadful and sales dropped significantly, our teams remain focused and dedicated and I thank them all. With that, let’s review the hits and misses in 2009. First productivity, early in 2009, we laid out an aggressive plan to accelerate our multiyear footprint consolidation plan. Our new goal was to reduce our cost structure by $300 million and deliver over $250 million to the bottom line productivity savings in 2009 we accomplished that goal. You can see the results of these cost actions in the Q4 performance we just reviewed. Margins and earnings grew despite year-over-year sales declining 9%. That’s solid productivity. Furthermore, much of this productivity is permanent. We’ve earlier outlined as markets recover we expect to drive growth.  When Pentair reaches the same sales levels 2008 or $3.4 billion, our earnings per share should Eclipse $3 per share, which is $0.80 higher than the $2.20 of adjusted EPS we delivered in 2008. Our earnings capability has increased $0.80 per share as a result of these cost actions. Next, let’s review how we invested innovation and future growth. We maintained our investment levels in R&Ds; sales and marketing while aggressively reducing our manufacturing and administrative cost structure. In fact, as a percent of total company sales, R&D and sales and marketing payroll expense went up about 90 basis points. This investment will allow to us continue to introduce leading new products and grow in markets and regions. While investment is important for long term growth, booking orders is proof of concept. In 2009, our Municipal Water business put the largest order in company history the $60 million Gulf Intracoastal Waterway project in New Orleans. This will yield about a dozen pumps to be delivered to Army Corps of Engineers in 2010 and 2011 to drive the largest pumps station in the world. Throughout the year, we highlighted innovative new products which we’re introducing the markets around the world. A few examples include our residential flows, variable frequency drive controls to improve energy efficiency in residential water systems. Technical products global and closure product line fusion, which will add to our leadership position in Global Electronics protection. Additionally we have highlight are growing capabilities around Systems and Advanced Solutions. One recent example is our revolutionary rainwater reuse system it will be utilize by the Minnesota Twins of their new stadium which opens in April 2010 against the Red Sox. We’re excited to become Minnesota Twins official sustainable water provider. The rainwater system sets the Twins apart as the leader in sustainable applications for professional sports venue, and we’re proud and excited to be part of the action. Unfortunately, growth was negative in 2009 as market conditions slowed the traction of many new products and growth initiatives. While disappointed sales and meet our expectations, we are not deterred. We have a host of exciting new products as market conditions improve; we expect to see solid growth. Towards the bottom of the slide, we highlight a few additional accomplishments, most of which are already covered so I won’t repeat them now. One item is the last bullet point. I think it sums up our commitment to our shareholders. We’re not satisfied with sales of $2.7 million or adjusted EPS of $1.47 and believe we are doing the right things to get Pentair back to higher levels with urgency. Before I hand it over to John, let me share my perspectives as way in 2010. Please turn to slide number seven. As our press release indicated, our full year 2010 EPS range was updated from $1.75 to a $1.90 per share. At the mid point is represents 24% increase versus 2009 adjusted EPS. It seems pretty good, especially after $2009. We would point out that while a nice increase it is only half of the way back to 2008 adjusted EPS of $2.20. Our goal is to drive growth and productivity with urgency to get back to these record levels as soon as possible. The good news is our sales trends are encouraging. As the slide highlights quarterly 2009 sales deltas although negative year-over-year improved throughout the year. The fourth quarter Delta was the best of the year and showed solid improvements in many markets. We’ll need steady growth to reach our ultimate goal and we expect 2010 will begin to demonstrate that growth. Speaking of 2010, for the fist quarter, we’re forecasting mid single digit sales growth. Current orders in our sales and market profiles suggest we should see expect modest growth from improving residential activity. Additionally, our Municipal business should tip to benefit from our strong backlog and revenue from the record New Orleans project. Fast growth area such as China, Latin American and Middle East remain growth regions for Pentair. As we continue to penetrate and invest in those areas. Finally, distributor inventories remain low from a historical perspective so as markets improve, distributors will sell through and restock. As the slide suggests, our balance sheet and free cash flow generation provides us with us appropriate flexibility to both reduced debt and considered acquisitions or other deployment of our cash such as share buybacks. So those are some of the key positives that inform our thinking as we enter 2010. As always, uncertainties and headwinds must be accounted for, too. The past six to seven years, we’ve witnessed the volatile commodity market with steel, copper, aluminum and oil among others all hitting record highs with big price swings. We’ve an outstanding materials organization driving a number of projects to ensure we are efficient and our materials purchases. We’re aware that in any quarter raw material costs can spike. However, given our history, solid pricing disciplines who would expect to be able to offset material inflation; unlike materials where we can drive aggressive productivity initiatives and monitor our pricing actions. The next three bullets are not things we or anybody else can necessarily manage. The global economic situation is improving, but what pays. Furthermore, credit for important segments of our markets such as full construction remain elusive and while we’re encouraged, the government stimulus moneys are being deployed to invigorate global economies, the impact of the recovery is still in question. Our current 2010 guidance takes all of this into account, and we feel good about controlling our destiny. Now I’ll hand it over to John, who’ll provide additional details on financials and also discuss our 2010 outlook in more detail. John.
John Stauch: Thanks, Randy. Please turn to slide number eight. This slide is divided into three sections. The top section reflects GAAP or reported earnings per share for Q4 and full year 2009. The middle section details adjustments from GAAP to adjusted earnings per share for those periods. At the bottom of the slide, we provide 2008 reported and adjusted EPS results for comparison purposes. Starting with the first column, labeled Q4, ‘09 natural, our GAAP reported earnings per share were $0.29. Included in this result, were $0.04 of EPS charges for restructuring costs primarily associated with the closure of technical product, Chicago Engineering and Design facility. As Randy mentioned earlier, we transition the work from this facility to other locations over the past few years. So this is the charge to completely exit the facility. Also included in our GAAP EPS, was $0.14 of charges as a result of asset into tangible impairments. At the end of 2009, we determined that book valuations for certain intangible items and other assets required lowering after three years of revenue decline in our residential water businesses. These charges reflect the revaluation of these items. Additionally, as part of completing a distributing and manufacturing JV in China and transition the manufacturing to our Suzhou facility, we wrote-off non-performing assets related to that JV. Removing the impact of these costs gets you to the $0.47 of adjusted earnings per share for Q4, 2009. The $0.47 is up 15% versus the $0.41 of adjusted earnings if the fourth quarter of 2008. Please shift one column to the right, which provides similar detail regarding our full year totals. Rather than walk through the numbers, I’d simply point out that we had $0.30 of negative delta between our 2009 reported GAAP EPS and our adjusted EPS of $1.47. As you can see at the bottom of the slide, in 2008 we had the opposite results, reported GAAP 2008 EPS, were $0.39 higher than adjusted EPS as gains outweighed non-recurring charges in 2008. Thus when you net 2008 and 2009 non-recurring items, the difference is minimal. Please turn to slide number nine. The top half of the slide is a full year debt balance walk, which shows the progress remain on reducing debt levels in 2009. Moving from left to right, we ended with $954 million of debt. If you add back the $44 million of receivables, which we securitize at the end of 2008, which is how our rating agencies look at debt. Our adjusted debt balance was $998 million. We generated $232 million of free cash flow, which we used to pay down $207 million of debt as well as prepay our 2010 $25 million pension obligation. As we indicated on our third quarter earnings call, we did not securitize any receivables in fourth quarter 2009. Therefore, we did not add to our debt via new securitization program. The $44 million receivables, which were securitized in 2008, were collected in the first half 2009. So as the walk indicates, that amount is now zero. In 2009, dividend payments were $71 million, and other items of $12 million get you to the ending balance sheet debt of $806 million. So to summarize, but it 20% reduction in our debt year-over-year keep us in a comfortable position as we indicate at the bottom of the slide. Let’s move on to slide number 10. The upper left section of the slide outlines the major components of cash flow for the full year 2009 and year-over-year details. As the walk shows, we generated $207 million in free cash flow after our $25 million discretionary pension contribution. Working capital delivered almost $64 million of cash flow on the year, which was approximately $118 million more than working capital contributed in 2008. Similar to our execution around cost takeout, we are focused on free cash flow. We continue to make nice progress leveraging our disciple lean efforts and feel very good about our full year cash flow generation. As we viewed on the previous slide, our cash usage was primarily focused to reduce debt to $806 million, which is shown in the bottom left of the slide. Our current debt has an average interest rate of 4.4% about 10 basis points higher than Q3, 2009. This represents a mixture of LIBOR plus 50 variable rate debts along with fixed rate debt of approximately 5.5%. So we remain very comfortable with our debt position and going forward, we expect to increase our EBITDA, which will provide additional flexibility with respect to cash usage. Please turn to slide number 11 and let’s discuss our 2010 outlook. We showed a similar slide in December when we provided our baseline 2010 outlook. We’ve updated it to reflect new guidance for Q1 and full year 2010. The top section of the slide shows the baseline we provided in December. In it, we projected Q1 EPS of $0.30 plus on mid single digit sales. Additionally our baseline for the full year was EPS of $1.70 plus on sales of around 5%. Our updated Q1 guidance which is shown in the mid-section of the slide has EPS between $0.32 and $0.35. We now expect Q1 sales to be up mid-to-high single digits as our backlog is better and market trends have improved modestly. Our expectation is that the second quarter will experience its standard seasonal up tick as residential construction markets are higher. The full season is in full gear and other markets gain momentum. So, our early view is that Q2, EPS will be between $0.50 and $0.55. Thus we expect the first half of 2010 will have EPS growth above 40% when compared to first half 2009 adjusted EPS. Let’s go to the far right column, which highlights full year EPS guidance. In December, we introduced the baseline EPS outlook of $1.70 plus which we are now updating to $1.75 to $1.90 per share. We continue to expect mid single digit sales growth for the full year which is incorporated in our $1.75 to $1.90 outlook. As Randy highlighted, uncertainties remain with respect to the Global Economic situation. With our liner cost structure and improving market trends we believe Pentair is well positioned for solid EPS growth in 2010 of around 20% year-over-year. Please turn to slide number 12 and let’s review our fist quarter 2010 outlook. For Q1, we expect revenue to be between $680 million and $695 million dollars up mid-to-high single digits year-over-year. We expect water revenue to be up 6% to 8% year-over-year. We expect technical products to be up around 5% to 6% as backlogs in orders trends have turned positive when compared to 2009. Operating income is expected to be between $60 million and $65 million which would produce overall Pentair operating margins of around 9.5% up around 300 bases points’ year-over-year. We expect water margins to be about 10% up over 300 basis points year-over-year and technical products to be about 14% up above 400 basis points year-over-year. Q1 EPS as previously mentioned is expected to be $0.32 and $0.35 per share up over 60% when compared to Q1 2009 adjusted EPS. We expect our tax rate to be around 32% and our Q1 interest expense to be better by about $2 million year-over-year. Finally, we expect cash flow will be negative which is typical for our first quarter, but inline with 2009 Q1 cash performance. So a solid start to 2010 with sales growth, margin expansion and very strong EPS growth. Please turn to slide number 13. The top of the slide shows the sequential EPS walk from Q4 adjusted earnings. To the Q1 guidance we just discussed. We thought it might be helpful to have this data since we spent much of 2009 discussing sequential performance. Starting with Q4, 2009’s $0.47 of adjusted EPS, we expect a slightly higher tax rate and share count to negatively impact Q1, 2010 by a penny. We expect a negative $0.05 of EPS from incrementally higher employee benefits, such as pension expense, higher medical costs, 401k contributions, merit increases, sales incentives and bonus accruals. We outlined this expense in December, when we provided our initial guidance. For the full year, we expect about $30 million of headwind, so this negative $0.05 represents one quarter of that total. The next item is a seasonal impact from smaller sales and shipments in our pool business. We expect that sequentially, this will have a $0.08 to $0.09 impact to Q1 EPS. The seasonal impact is slightly better than normal, when comparing Q4 to Q1 as we have moderated our participation in the Pool early buy program. All of our other businesses net to similar performance with Q4. Those items walk you to $0.32 to $0.35 EPS guidance we provided to Q1 or down versus Q4 2009, mainly due to seasonal factors, we expect Q1, 2010 EPS will be up approximately 60% from Q1 2009, so a solid start to the year. Please turn to our final slide number 14. In summary, 2009 was a challenging year. We effectively dealt with the global recession by taking aggressive action to reduce our cost structure. As we enter 2010, our balance sheet is in solid position and we expect another great year of free cash flow generation to provide additional flexibility. While proud in the tremendous accomplishments with respect to our cost actions in 2009, the amount of facility closures and restructuring was disruptive. In 2010, we will double down in productivity initiatives within our current facilities and functions to drive meaningful savings going forward. Finally, as Randy mentioned earlier, we viewed 2010 as a critical year. We have a healthy sense of urgency to get back to previous company sales and EPS highs. In 2010 is an important step along that path. We’d now like to answer any questions you might have. Stephanie, please open the lines for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse.
Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse: Question on your water business, you have a number of growth initiatives, you guys are targeting over the next couple of years. Some of them are coming off of a pretty small base. When can we expect those initiatives to have a material impact on both your top and bottom line and how do you any about those initiatives impacting your margin profile longer term within that segment?
Randy Hogan: We do have a number of growth initiatives, because residential is our largest segment. It’s about almost half of all of water. The main most meaningful driver of growth is going to be the residential market actually turning up and that’s the biggest driver of our growth that we expect this year. We don’t expect it to turn up rapidly, so we do expect it to be positive. On top of the base market growth, we have a number of initiatives in terms of new customers, new channels, and new products in our residential filtration business in particular that I’m quite excited about both in the U.S. and globally and I think that they will have a more meaningful impact in the second half of this year and going into next year. Our whole systems initiative that we’ve talked a lot about is going to be a net drag, if you will on our margins, but it’s going to help us enter a number of new markets that are quite exciting the small commercial, small industrial systems business in RO. The water reuse markets, which we think actually will, while we use the example here of what we’re doing with the twins it gives us a nice platform to show people in the U.S., kinds of things we’re going to be doing in India and we are doing in China. So I think they will be a net drag on margins, but they’re a net positive on the top line. Now, what I’d like to do is counter the net drag on margins with really achieving operating excellence on our water side to the tune that we have in technical products. We haven’t gotten there yet. We still have a lot of opportunity in water. As we talk about it, we really have two businesses that I think are performing at the highest of highs and that’s technical products and actually our pool equipment business. All of our other GBU’s have a potential to get to that level from operating standpoint. So that’s how I think about water.
Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse: Just one follow up question on inventory levels, you talked about them being pretty low in the distribution channel? Are you backing any restocking bump within your 2010 guidance? How should we think about that?
Randy Hogan: Not really. I can’t tell you right now whether the volume we’re seeing some of these markets, particularly the ones related to infrastructure and defense and security and technical products and residential. How much of that is just the channel actually restocking due to what I would call the stable level because they were drawn down too far and how much is end market demand.  I hope to be able to get a clear sense of that as this goes on, but we’re not counting on a pop. We’re counting on what we’re seeing now to sustain, which I wouldn’t characterize as a pop.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jim Lucas – Janney Montgomery Scott.
Jim Lucas – Janney Montgomery Scott:  Question first on technical products could you just bring us up to date on the electrical versus electronic gap that one of the key areas of improvement was consolidating into a global GBU and could you just talk about the margin differential, how that gap is closed between the two and what you’re seeing geographically within enclosures?
John Stauch: Yes. I’ll take the fist half, Jim, and I’ll have Randy chime in. It’d be nice to say we’d closed the gap. I’d say we haven’t for a good reason. The electrical margins continue to impress and to get larger. We’ll be have made substantial progress on improving the electronics business in a down cycle. So we have seen compression as we talk about the Chicago facility that is further examples of us being able to move into the existing technical products or electrical sites. We closed on the electronics side three more factories within the year, and we’re starting to merge the vertical markets together and start to share some of the regional sales forces to try to get some leverage around getting some better Global Electrical momentum. So I think we made substantial progress this year, and we have improved the margins in electronics.  The low single digits right now, Jim, and I think with some particular advancement in sales, we can continue to get closer to the 10% level, but electric will continue to expand. In fact, we have record margins in Q4 on our electrical side of the business.
Randy Hogan: Right on the margin side, I think the Europe is done a nice job and which is predominately electronics, the European business had stabilized. Actually, we saw a little bit of growth, and the margins are up. So I feel good about that and, it’s always tougher to make that kind of progress over there in Europe. So I’d say that’s looking good I think our efforts to globalize technical products remains our number one opportunity on the electrical side and we’re making I would say baby steps, positive ones toward working with some of the global OEMs that so value the Hoffman product line. The product line is mentioned Fusion is a global metric product line on the electrical side that really positions us well to serve those global folks like ABB, Yokogawa, Allen Bradley excuse me, Rockwell automation.
John Stauch: I think would I summarize by saying in way, shape performed do we view these technical products margins what we call peak margin. There’s a lot more potential left in these.
Jim Lucas – Janney Montgomery Scott: Then with regards to the capital allocation strategy going forward, in your prepared remarks you did make reference to acquisitions potentially one area of opportunity. Could you just give us an update of where you stand on the capital allocation standpoint and with regards to the acquisition pipeline; you’ve talked about bolt-ons in the past. How would you characterize the pipeline today?
Randy Hogan: Bolt-ons is still a primary focus we have obviously with the level of cash flow we have, and our balance sheet. Those are the only ones that are logical from a cash standpoint. We remain interested in ones that expand our technology base and expand our footprint in terms of reach to customers of global. So, global and technology that’s what we’ve maintained and, we had not been focused on that over the last 18 months that aggressively, and we started to be more keenly focused on it in the fourth quarter and there’s things out there.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mike Snyder - Robert Baird.
Mike Snyder - Robert Baird: Maybe first just starting on water, you mentioned the pace you go restructuring costs winding down, John. Can you give us a sense of what they did hit Q4 and just really how much is left?
John Stauch: My estimate in Q4, Mike, and this isn’t a precise number, because we’ve talked about inefficiencies as we swallowed demand in some of the facilities, but I’m estimating that to be about $2 million to $3 million in Q4 is what cost us in water. I would think it’s going to be probably only about a $1 million or so in Q1.
Mike Snyder - Robert Baird: The estimate for Q1 is just the estimate of under absorption, or what is actually now kind of baked into your estimate?
John Stauch: I would say, what I’ve got there is that we’re still running slightly higher labor rates and scrap rates versus what we were running in the pitching sites. We’re making progress on that, but we haven’t yet absorbed it to the level that it was at the pitching site.
Mike Snyder - Robert Baird: What is actually left in terms of number of rooftops that have not been closed that will be closed in 2010?
Randy Hogan: We’re actually in 2010, other than just finishing up this facility in Tech Products, which that’s in further consolidation on Minneapolis footprint. Non-anticipating taking on any closings in 2010, but getting back to accountability and back to our lean efforts and making sure that we’re making progress on quality delivery, scrap and making progress on lean.
Mike Snyder - Robert Baird: Then the New Orleans pump orders, what is the rough delivery schedule over the next 24 months?
John Stauch: I think it’s between seven and eight this year and the balance next year, yes that’s close.
Mike Snyder - Robert Baird: Anything delivered in the fist half of this year?
John Stauch: No. We’ve got some small, component delivery in Q1 and Q2, Mike, but it’s relatively low. Mostly deliveries are in Q3 and Q4.
Mike Snyder - Robert Baird: Then pool price increases, I presume nothing was issued as of the start of the year. So can you give us a sense just how the pre-buy or lack of pre-buy and then what you expect in Q1? You mentioned, sequentially it was less than ordinary just any more color on that just how this season will end full?
John Stauch: The sell through actually remains positive and we had a good sell through in Q4. We had a decent standard order quarter in Q4. As I mentioned in the comments, we chose as well as the rest are the market also went along with the stronger early buy than we’ve seen in prior years. We expect that to positively impact Q1 a little bit from the carryover from Q4 into Q1. Right now, we’re seeing sell through rates against some pretty low levels here, Mike. I mean, we’re three years down on the pool compression. So we’re starting to think that we’re going to see year-over-year sales increases in full.
Mike Snyder - Robert Baird: Any appetite or I guess ability to issue price increases now given that at least according to slide three, you’re still down about a $1million bucks in the price cost curve?
John Stauch: Yes, I think real quickly, I think pool is not an area that we’re looking at price increases this year at the moment. We’ll keep an eye on commodity costs and…?
Randy Hogan: That’s really going to be the trigger. Our outlook actually isn’t assuming we get any real benefit from price. We saw the benefit of price over the course of 2009, wane from being a positive couple points in the fist quarter to being diminimous in the fourth quarter. So our focus is or our expectation, our plan, within our outlook is actually flat to maybe a little bit of giving a book price. Now that said, if we see materials, we know how to hit the price button. If we see materials inflation, we’re in the kind of businesses where we’ll have some pricing flexibility and we will use in that. That’s really how we’re approaching it right now.
Mike Snyder - Robert Baird: Then switching to Technical Products, there is the area where you’re most behind in the price cost curve. Looks again from slide four and just Q4 alone you were about negative $7 million. I’m curious just what’s been issued in price increases so far for January 1 period and just what’s, your, I guess ability is to get mid of your price increases there.
Randy Hogan: Real quick, Mike, I mean I think we’ve got some modest price increases. Let’s count low single digits going forward in Q1. I do want to share with you that, although we had minimal price increases, we did have some sizable commodity benefit in Q4, as we expected and anticipated and as those commodity prices begin to firm up, and increase it gives us the ability to start thinking about price increases into the market.
Mike Snyder - Robert Baird: So your outlook now just as you looked at your raw materials inputs still, I presume as rising within your costs of goods sold for GT?
Randy Hogan: Correct.
Mike Snyder - Robert Baird: Then I guess just looking at the kind of first half and full year guidance. I’m just curious as to it appears as though you’ve got little or no sequential acceleration in the results, and what I want to just kind of roughly done, if you take fourth quarter earnings of $0.47, you take Q1 even at $0.33, you’re up at $0.80 for the year. It sounds like New Orleans benefits the second half. It sounds like maybe some pricing benefits the second half, and then even pool should have a delayed benefit given the lack of a pre-buy. It strikes me that if you just annualize either the Q4 and Q1 run rate or even the first half run rate of $0.89, there’s no real acceleration built into the second half, again despite some of these benefits, especially New Orleans in the second half. Is there anything as you look at, especially out of the second half guidance that would explain why there wouldn’t be acceleration?
Randy Hogan: Mike, we think the fourth quarter showed a real acceleration already in our earnings capability. We think, it’s reading out already number one. Number two, it’s easier to see all of those things you said on the positive side than the negative stuff that’s going to happen that we don’t know yet and things are still so uncertain. I know stuff’s going to happen. I just don’t want to count on all of the good guys, when I haven’t seen all of the bad guys yet. That’s all.
Mike Snyder - Robert Baird: That’s what I’m driving at. It seems conservative and there’s a cushion built in there?
Randy Hogan: I didn’t say I was conservative. There are bad guys out there. I just don’t know all yet.
Operator: Your next question comes from Deane Dray - FBR Capital Markets.
Deane Dray - FBR Capital Markets: Just a follow-up on that last point with regard to having some contingent built into your 2010 estimate, it looked like that growth investments of $0.20 and that mentioned earlier on the call. Is that still the right number?
John Stauch: Yes.
Deane Dray - FBR Capital Markets: How do you expect to see that during the course of the year? Would that be front end loaded? Is it going to be linear? How should we think about that?
John Stauch: I think we’re going to be discipline, Deane. I think we want to see Q1, readout Q2, have a good indication of our season in Q2 and then we begin to put the investments out there for 2011 and beyond.
Deane Dray - FBR Capital Markets: Then we won’t bring out or accuse Randy that you all being conservative, but it is interesting how you changed your approach to guidance. Back in December, you had a single point for the year. Now you’re framing a range. What changed in terms of your visibility or your risk tolerance in terms of giving a range and then related to that it looks like you’re now in a pattern of giving a sequential two quarter forward guidance. Is that going to be a practice of balance of the year?
Randy Hogan: We’ve got two more month of actuals that made us more confident to actually put a top on the range. That’s simply the change.
John Stauch: Then also as we go out with the pre-guidance or sort of our view, we haven’t seen the pension or the actuary studies yet. We haven’t seen where medical is ending and quite frankly haven’t finalized all of our year end and budgeting, but I think we feel like there’s more visibility to predict Q1, Q2 right now and then we’ll give a further update on the full year as it becomes clearer.
Deane Dray - FBR Capital Markets: Then on the asset impairment, you said it was residential. Is it filtration or pull? Just can you clarify, which businesses were impacted?
Randy Hogan: Actually, its brands related to the ones we use in residential flow and pull.
Deane Dray - FBR Capital Markets: Just a question of the earnings decline, is that was the driver?
Randy Hogan: It’s actually the volume decline and then our base case, which is not for a snap back, but for a slow growth from there. We also have stopped using some of the brands and those broader ways and frankly that was decisions made in marketing that didn’t anticipate what that would do to intangibles. That’s a lesson learned.
Deane Dray - FBR Capital Markets: Then on the regarding restructuring on a go forward basis and we like seeing the pace as you go in the early comments in the call said it was winding down, but if I heard correctly towards the end, you all were going to be doubling down on productivity initiatives in 2010. Is that just a realized savings or actually incremental restructuring?
John Stauch: If you think about the 18 facilities we moved last year it is a substantial utilization of our teams. A lot of our lean people were involved in those moves. We just want to go back to those four walls where we made the majority of products and just focus back on the lien.
Randy Hogan: On the basic disciplines of continuous improvement in driving the safety quality, delivery cost in the new facilities John mentioned that we have a number of facilities that really aren’t productive. They’ve expected a lot, they received a lot of new product that’s really the day-to-day practice of lien enterprise is what we’re talking about.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Cox - Piper Jaffray.
Michael Cox - Piper Jaffray:  I want to spend a minute on the restructuring charges. To a question earlier about the pay as you go. You’ve referenced some under absorption of labor and scrap. I just want to clarify, is that included in your restructuring charges? Is that what you are calling out for Q1?
John Stauch: No. That was included in the adjusted operating income as part of our ongoing view. That would be slightly better in Q1.
Michael Cox - Piper Jaffray : So, it should we expect the call out of restructuring these kind of onetime items that have been cropping up. Should those be done now?
John Stauch: Done is a finite word, but I would say we expect to be very minimal going forward.
Michael Cox - Piper Jaffray : So there’s nothing embedded in your guidance for it?
John Stauch: No.
Michael Cox - Piper Jaffray : Then in the balance sheet cash flow side, do you have the 2010 year end debt level target that you’re looking towards given your free cash flow assumptions?
John Stauch: I would say it’s more dependent on the EBITDA and we believe that we’re going to continue to expand EBITDA going forward and we have a comfort level around our debt EBITDA levels and so when you think about our debt level, we’d like to trim a little bit more off the debt with the more EBITDA we get gives us more flexibility to make bolt-on acquisitions and or purchase shares back on our share buyback program.
Michael Cox - Piper Jaffray : In terms of the capital expenditure plan for the year, should we expect something similar to what we’ve seen in the last few years in the low $50 million range?
John Stauch: Yes.
Michael Cox - Piper Jaffray : I guess I know it’s premature, but is that a good run rate as we look forward over the next couple of years?
John Stauch: I would say it actually is, we do what most companies do we spend a budget and the budget changes. Sometimes you’ve got maintenance upgrades. Sometimes you have plan restructuring sometime you have capital related to software, but we’re not a very capital intensive business.
Randy Hogan: Every roof needs capital and we’ve taken out 18 roofs, 18 buildings and so we don’t have the maintenance capital on that. That’s capital we can redeploy to support productivity and growth and we have a number of facilities, particularly Poland and China and new one in India which are not fully utilized yet. So I mean, the investments will go into providing capability in those factories, but it’ll still be inside that $50 to $60 million.
Operator: Your next question comes from Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer:  In the walk to 4Q to 1Q guidance was a comment that all other bucket sequential modest increase, just wonder if that includes Tech products?
John Stauch: Yes.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer: As we look at for the year any reason we wouldn’t be looking at least a current run rates quarterly for the year?
John Stauch: You mean Q4 or Q1?
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer: Well, looks like Q4, Q1 are lining up comparable at any rate?
John Stauch: Yes, I think, Chris, as we kind of alluded, I think we want to kind to get through Q1 we take a look at Q2. The season in Q2 mean as lot to us and when we have that lot we can see the back of the year that will really give us a picture on what the residential market truly is. The second quarter is our high quarter. It’s all driven by residential and flow filtration and pool. It’s so critical for us to understand what the environment is. I agree.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Then with the revenues certainly outperforming in the fourth quarter, did you see opportunity for any early cost restoration?
John Stauch: We announced we restarted our employee ESOP contributions, our employee option, stock ownership plan where we contribute. We are restarting our 401K match, and we are reinstituting our pay raises practices that we stopped. Those have all been announced.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Those all impacted water and quarter?
John Stauch: They didn’t impact anything in Q4. It’s the $30 million headwind we talk about when we talk about 2010 those were those costs. A little bit in the first quarter. Chris, a little bit in the first quarter, I mean the sales levels in some of our water business did trigger distributor rebate levels and did trigger distribute a rebate that our levels, and then if you trigger some sales and distribution bonuses.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brian Coningsburg - Citi.
Brian Coningsburg - Citi: Most of questions have been answered. Just coming back to the both on comments, maybe you could just give some color on the quality and attractiveness of the pipeline today and maybe some pricing dynamics?
Randy Hogan: I would say that particularly on the water side, pricing expectations never did decline from the seller’s standpoint. So I can’t talk to the specific number, because I don’t have a specific number my head right now, but the quality of the assets is still good. I mean, there are a number of interesting and intriguing technologies as well as interesting opportunities in the non-U.S. opportunities. We did buy one small business from actually in Brazil to that we bought a small business that basically was their pool equipment business in Brazil. Brazil is the second largest country after the specific country after the U.S. It’s a nice, typical simple built on small, but gives us the opportunity to introduce our eco select products into Brazil, those are the kind of things we’re looking at between that and $50 million. That was diminimous that way.
Brian Coningsburg - Citi: Secondly, maybe you could just give an updated on every ones stimulus benefits coming through that you see the…?
Randy Hogan: We’re tracking some 300 projects right now. We’ve won probably $7 billion worth of orders. We didn’t make a meal of it on the conference call, because it’s only $7 million and out of 300 projects we’re tracking, right now, that maybe that would yield another $15 million to $20 million orders. Not anything that’s really significant at this point. So I think we’re still waiting for that big tranche of projects to get released.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brian Drab - William Blair.
Brian Drab - William Blair: You talked about extensively about the water business in general, but could you make some comments on, what your expectations are for the JV versus GE this year and I know we had really high expectations for good EPS accretion from that for 2010 originally, but I imagine that’s more of a kind of a story that’s going to take some time to play out at this point?
Randy Hogan: I think you said that well. We had high expectations and we still have high expectations. We have yet to reach them. I’m very encouraged by how the team’s working together. I’m very encouraged by the wins they’re achieving in terms of new channel coverage and new product introduction, but it’s going to take, I think, another couple years for us to achieve the level that we expect it to achieve.
Brian Drab - William Blair: Then just a couple of small items here, I might have missed this, but do you expect further pension contributions later in 2010 or is this is just…?
Randy Hogan: For us, our total pension expanse is about $10 million overall for Pentair and that’s versus $5 million for 2009. It doubled, but I mean it’s only $5 million to us on a year-over-year basis.
Brian Drab - William Blair: Then last, with the $24 million in restructuring in the quarter, how does that breakdown between COGS and SG&A?
John Stauch: In the quarter, about $6 million of costs of goods sold. The rest is SG&A, primarily G&A. For the full year it’s about $7 million. Our downsizing line goes through G&A. The only thing that really goes through the cost of goods sold would be asset reductions or asset impairments.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Just a follow-up on water, if you look historically of the last four or five year, maybe last year being the exception, your water business was up sequentially 4Q to 1Q. You talked about the sequential decline in pool that you expect, although a little bit less. What’s the offset? Do you typically see flow and filtration tick up?
Randy Hogan: Correct. Filtration and flow, we usually see a pickup, primarily residential flow starts to see stocking orders for Q2 into the residential channel. We have a modest increase expected in that business, but not a significant increase expected.
Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Then just housekeeping item, corporate expense for ‘10?
Randy Hogan: I think you’re looking at Q4 rates being the sustainable rate going forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from Garik Shmois - Longbow Research.
Garik Shmois - Longbow Research: Really just on the free cash conversion in the slides, I believe in the December call. You were looking for about 125% of net income. Now on the slides it’s equaled or exceeding that income. Is there a material difference we should be reading into there?
John Stauch: Not a material. I mean I’m in my tenth year and I’ve committed to convert over 100%. So we went back to my standard ten years promise.
Garik Shmois - Longbow Research: So there’s nothing operationally that’s changed…?
John Stauch: Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mark Zepf - Goldman Sachs.
Mark Zepf - Goldman Sachs: If you look at your business across geographies and verticals, where you raised guidance for 2010 versus the December call, which markets of verticals did you not raise your expectations for?
Randy Hogan: Commercial construction, I think it’s every bit as bad as we thought. It’s going to be every bit as bad as we thought it would be. Western Europe as well, yes, we haven’t raised that.
Operator: Your final question comes from Shannon O’Callaghan - Barclays Capital.
Shannon O’Callaghan - Barclays Capital: Just on the technical products end markets. I mean can you just give us a little more color. You mentioned infrastructure, security defense, just give us a little more color there. Also what about sort of broader industrial piece of that? What do you see in there?
Randy Hogan: Let’s start with your last question. For the year, industrial sales were down 23% year-over-year, but in the fourth quarter, they’re only down 5%. So that gives you a sense of, if you will, strengthening of our industrial sales as the year went on. The ones I mentioned that were actually up in the fourth quarter were infrastructure, security and defense. Everything else was down. The most meaningful change from the third quarter to the fourth quarter was in fact, in that industrial arena. Where we saw stocking orders improve and distributions. I’d say that was the source of the biggest part of the upside surprise in sales for the fourth quarter. Now in terms of outlook, I think infrastructure will continue. I think in particular, tech products are probably seeing more of a bounce from a stimulus spending than water at this point, because the use of enclosures is ubiquitous. I mean, whether there are upgrade in the lighting, in the parking lot or the electrical system or the air conditioning system in a hospital, you buy boxes and so we think that that’s directly benefiting what we call our infrastructure area as well as security and defense has remained a decent market for us. Not big enough in my opinion there’s more we can do there. So those are the ones, security and defense, infrastructure and I think industrial are the ones we expect to see be pretty good and energy actually interestingly enough, energy was strong in the fourth quarter of 2008. It was down over 20% in the fourth quarter of 2009. I think as energy prices stabilize and come up, I think we’ll see energy improve as the year goes. By commercial construction as I mentioned continued to be weak the general electronics and communications for us probably up and down.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Darla and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Pentair Q3, 2009 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker’s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Todd Gleason, Vice President of Strategic Planning and Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.
Todd Gleason: Thanks Darla, and welcome to Pentair’s third quarter earnings release conference call; we are glad you could join us. I am Todd Gleason, head of Investor Relations, and with me today is Randy Hogan, our Chairman & Chief Executive Officer; and John Stauch, our Chief Financial Officer. On today’s call we will provide details on our third quarter results, as well as update you on Pentair’s outlook for 2009.  Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company’s anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements, subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as the risks outlined in Pentair’s 10-K as of December 31, 2008, and Pentair’s news releases.  Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results. Today’s webcast is accompanied by a presentation which can be found in the financial information section of Pentair’s website at www.pentair.com. We will reference these slides throughout our prepared remarks. Any references to non-GAAP financials are reconciled in the appendix of the presentation. I would also like to point out that all financial results and references to year-over-year numbers in today’s call and presentation are on a continuing operations basis, unless otherwise noted or highlighted. As is our custom, we will reserve time for questions-and-answers after our prepared remarks. I will now hand the call over to Randy who will take you through Pentair’s third quarter 2009 results, provide his perspective on the results of our businesses and the markets they reserve, and provide an overview on how we are driving to deliver results in 2009. Then John will conclude our formal comments with additional information regarding our third quarter financials, and provide more detail on our outlook. Randy.
Randy Hogan: Thanks Todd and welcome everyone. Before we begin I’d like to make a few remarks. First, thanks to the many of you that attended our investor and analyst day in New York City on September 3. It was great to see so many of you in the audience, and to share with you our long-term strategies. Second, as you obviously know since you’re on the call, today’s conference call is starting a few hours earlier than it has been the case historically. We will solicit feedback on this time slot and we do intend to permanently hold our conference calls in the mornings going forward. Hope you find the earlier time convenient and helpful.  Now let’s begin by reviewing our third quarter results shown on slide number two. Sales of $663 million were down 23% and slightly below the low end of the guidance we provided in July. We have some pluses and minuses with respect to sales, but the headline is water sales were in line with expectations, while technical product sales were lower compared to the guidance we provided in July. Sales in our water business were down 17%. Our largest market, North American residential remains down year-over-year, but we continue to see modest sequential improvement. We will discuss water in more detail in a few minutes. Technical product sales declined 32%, about five points worse than expectations. Virtually all of our major vertical markets and technical products experienced double digit declines as capital spending remains constrained. In the quarter, we delivered reported earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.38, which includes a negative $0.04 of non-recurring items associated with restructuring actions. If you remove the restructuring, we delivered $0.42 of adjusted EPS, which was down 25% when compared to adjusted EPS in the third quarter of 2008. While down year-over-year, adjusted Q3 EPS was up $0.04 sequentially when compared to Q2 2009, despite lower revenue of approximately $30 million. The takeaway is, the results from our cost actions continue to benefit us, as we progress through the year. Total company operating margins on an adjusted basis contracted 60 basis points. The positive benefits from productivity and price did not offset the negative impact from the 23% sales decline. On a sequential basis, though our margins continue to improve nicely, third quarter operating margins expanded 160 basis points when compared to the second quarter margins, and when you compare Q3 margins against Q1 margins, we’re up 490 basis points, so Pentair is indeed making good margin progress.  Relative to our adjusted EPS, our third quarter effective tax rate was 32%, which is the same as the second quarter and inline with our guidance. We continue to expect our full-year tax rate will be between 32% and 33%. Finally, we produced $103 million of free cash flow in Q3. Year-to-date we have generated over $200 million of free cash flow, approximately $95 million more than the first three quarters of 2008. Now let’s turn to slide number three, which provides an overview of our Q3 water results. Here are the details: on the top of the slide we provided our standard sales and operating income loss. We will refer to these as we describe the performance of the Water Group. Overall, water sales declined $96 million to $462 million, or down 17% versus the third quarter last year and down 16% in local currency. As I mentioned earlier, this was inline with the sales guidance we provided in July.  Let’s review our business performance in water. Our flow technologies business was down 14% year-over-year. Growth in our municipal business, where we continue to have record backlog and nice order activity did not offset continued declines in US commercial and residential markets. However, we are maintaining our investments in global growth and new products, such as our VFD or Variable Frequency Drive controls to improve energy efficiency. So we expect Q4 to start to show better year-over-year comparables. Filtration was down 21% as we continued to see declines in commercial, residential and industrial sales globally. However, we are seeing stabilization in U.S. Residential Filtration market, with industry shipments improving sequentially. It was our new product launches and growing systems capabilities that were positioning our filtrations business for growth in 2010. Pool equipment was down 16% as the prolonged decline in North American residential new pool builds persists. Pentair pool equipment sales are essentially all going to satisfy after market replacement and upgrade demand as pool permits are down close to 80% to 90% versus three years ago. Now let’s discuss our operating profits and margins for the Water Group. On the top right you can see our year-over-year operating income walk for water. Adjusted margins were 12.1%, up 80 basis points year-over-year. Margins came in essentially in-line with our guidance as productivity actions delivered meaningful results and more than offset the impact volume declines had on margins year-over-year.  Because of continued market weakness we instituted new restructuring actions in the quarter. The charge associated with this action is shown on the walk as the $3 million negative impact to op income, which is how you get to our reported operating income of $53 million. So despite the drop in sales, adjusted margins have increased year-over-year as a result of the aggressive cost actions we’ve taken. We expect to maintain this trend with respect to margins in the coming quarters. Please turn to slide number four and let’s review Technical Products. Year-over-year, third quarter sales in Technical Products were down 32%. As I mentioned earlier, sales declined about five percentage points worse than we had anticipated. However, it is in-line with most of our major end markets, which are declining at rates at or about 30%. That said, we believe the markets have essentially bottomed out, and are relatively flat sequentially, which is demonstrated in our quarter-over-quarter sales volume. Looking at the businesses within Technical Products, our Global Electrical markets declined 29%, while our global electronic sales declined 32% in local currencies. Technical Products adjusted margins were 14.4%, a decline of 180 basis points versus Q3 2008. Aggressive cost actions and followed execution on our restructuring efforts did not make up for the dramatic decline in sales year-over-year. That said, margins did improve sequentially over 240 basis points, despite the sales volumes that decreased modestly, so we’re delivering the sequential improvements we expected. As in water, Technical Products took new restructuring actions in the quarter. The $5 million charge associated with those actions is shown on the walk, and covers the cost of the additional factories that we added to the planned shutdown that we mentioned in the July call. This helps you to reconcile to our reported operating income of $24 million. Now, please turn to slide number five and let’s review some of the key takeaways from Q3. Starting with some of the pluses or positives we mentioned earlier, that we continue to see sequential improvements in the North American residential market. One highlight was that in August, our pool business had the first year-over-year increase in sell-through for any month in about three years. So while sales continue to decline for residential pools in the quarter, this is an indicator that positive comparisons are in the near term horizon. We’ve already discussed our Q3 margins for both water and Technical Products, but obviously we believe each were positive in the quarter. In the quarter we announced the largest contract in Pentair’s history; a $65 million municipal pump order with the Army Corps of Engineers, to enhance flood controls for the City of New Orleans. The pump station is expected to be the largest in the world, with the bulk of revenues for us being generated in 2010 and 2011.  With the focus on stimulus spending, and the need for infrastructure investments globally, we expect orders to remain strong in our municipal water business. Another plus coming out of the third quarter was free cash flow, which as mentioned earlier was $95 million higher than our cash generation through three quarters of 2008.  The next few items are essentially neutral for Pentair. We expect the commercial and industrial markets to experience declines and certainly we saw that in the third quarter of 2009, so basically no blood versus our guidance. While Asia and Middle East markets generally have slowed earlier this year, we continue to see solid growth prospects for both water and technical products in those areas.  As for the minuses, it is a volume story. Third quarter sales missed the low end of our guidance, as Technical Products continues to experience more dramatic sales declines than anticipated. While we’re seeing slight sequential sales performance, we expected the business of sales to improve modestly, which is yet to occur. Overall, Q3 produced a balance of positive, neutral and negative items, which is not uncommon of course, but there are more positives than negatives and we remain encouraged that the things in our control remain positive to our results. Let’s take a look at our total company productivity. Please turn to slide number six. Throughout the year we’ve discussed our major productivity actions. We wanted to provide the details, so you had an update on our expectations for each major action and their impact on our cost productivity. The upper half of the slide details, the $250 million of productivity we expect to generate for the full year by component. We’re on track to deliver these savings and we’ve already generated about $200 million to the first three quarters. The final component is labeled volume. The total company sales expected to be down about 20% for the full year, or approximately $700 million. The negative $386 million is simply the amount of nonmaterial margin drop through that occurs if we had not taken the actions we did to adjust our cost structure. The bottom half of the slide details the expected headcount reductions by the end of the year. Hourly headcount is expected to be down 14% by the end of this year, which is in addition to the 7% reduction we had already taken in the second half of last year. Salary headcount is expected to be down 9% and shown on the slides, you can see we had reduced our salary workforce by 5% in the second half of 2008. It’s a large drop since we started our major restructuring activities mid last year. In sum, there’s been significant progress on our cost actions, and the way they were done lays a nice foundation going forward. Now please turn to slide number seven. This slide is also one of our standard update slides and it’s provided into the four quadrants we talked about before; cost out, driving free cash flow, positioning for growth, and our perspectives going forward. As previously detailed, we continue to execute against our cost actions. We knew 2009 would be a very difficult year and so far it has been. Only through solid execution on the cost side have we delivered on our targeted results. We’ve completed most of our major facility closures. Furthermore, our cost actions are going to yield the $250 million of productivity we just showed you. Of that, we anticipate about $150 million to be permanent and we have reinforced our lien activities at each facility; all of which are focusing on their key deliverables of safety, quality, delivery, cost productivity, and cash flow. Speaking of cash flow, moving down the left side of the side, our ability to generate significant free cash flow remains the focus for the company. We still have a tremendous opportunity of working capital, and we’re making progress; since year to-date we’re already $95 million ahead of the game. Moving to the top right of the slide, it’s important to note that we remain energized about our long-term growth prospects in both water and Technical Products. While sales remain in decline for 2009, we continue to introduce new products, win key orders and position our businesses favorably for significant orders in the future. Last quarter we highlighted the $65 million municipal pump contract with the corps. This quarter we highlight the fantastic work our pool business has done to gain share through energy efficiency pool pumps, and environmentally sound equipment via our Eco Select line of products. Eco Select products now represent over 30% of our pool sales. As I mentioned earlier, our pool equipment sell through grew in August. The first month to demonstrate year-over-year sell through growth in three years, which coincidentally happened on the third anniversary of the beginning of the U.S. residential decline. Examples such as these highlight some of the investments we continue to make in innovation, sales, and marketing to position us for growth going forward. The final section of the chart is labeled going forward. We will continue to execute against our cost actions and we’re implementing additional actions to increase productivity even more. As we drive working capital action, we’re confident we’ll deliver strong free cash flow, which will be used for dividends and to pay down debt. Finally, we believe that with our innovation and market investments, Pentair’s positions take advantage of market opportunities as they emerge. We look forward to continuing to share that progress with you. By taking out costs today, driving free cash flow to investment tomorrow and developing new technologies and satisfying our customers every day, we will emerge stronger for the long term. Before I hand it over to John, I’d like to review one final slide. So please turn to slide number eight. We maintained our EPS outlook for much of the year, but as this slide indicates, we’ve seen sales decline worse than we anticipated, particularly in Technical Products. However as we showed you, our execution on cost actions and our margin attainment have been very strong. As a result, we can maintain our guidance, excluding the additional restructuring. John is going to cover our outlook in more detail, but I wanted to highlight that we continue to deliver on our commitment and that we’ve generally forecasted very well in a difficult environment. While sales have been worse than expected, especially in tech products, we expect to deliver more productivity, which will result in the anticipated margins and EPS results. Now I’ll hand it over to John, who will provide additional details on our financials and also discuss our full year 2009 outlook in more detail. John.
John Stauch: Thanks Randy. Please turn to slide number nine. This slide is divided into three sections. The top section reflects the GAAP or reported earnings per share for Q3 year-to-date 2009 and our Q4 and full year outlook for EPS. The middle section details the adjustment from GAAP to the adjusted earnings per share for those periods. At the bottom of this slide we provide 2008 reported and adjusted EPS results for comparison purposes. Starting with the first column labeled Q3 ‘09 actual, our GAAP reported earnings per share were $0.38. Included in this result was $0.04 of EPS for severance costs and other charges, as we took new actions in Q3 2009 to eliminate 275 positions not included in our prior restructurings. The majority of these actions were related to the finalization of our plant moves and our water businesses, the announced closure but additional factory in technical products, and incremental down sizing of technical products related to Western Europe. When moving the impact of these costs, you get to the $0.42 of adjusted earnings per share for Q3 2009. The $0.42 is down 25% versus the $0.56 earned in the third quarter of 2008. Please shift one column to the right, which provides similar detail regarding our year-to-date results.  Rather than walk through the numbers, I’d simply point out that we now have a $0.12 delta between our reported year-to-date EPS of $0.88 and our adjusted EPS of $1. We mentioned earlier that we were expecting a favorable result from a tax audit, we still are, but we are now expecting that benefit could be early 2010, instead of the previous expectation of Q3 or Q4, 2009.  The following two columns represent our Q4 and full year 2009 outlook, in the same reconciliation format. As you can see, the bulk of our restructuring charges are behind us. While there’ll still be minor work left to do, the cost related to our 18 facilities, combined with our move to six global business units is predominantly done. We are forecasting about $0.03 of restructuring charges in Q4. 
 : Please turn to slide number 10. The upper left section of the slide outlines the major components of cash flow for the third quarter and the year-over-year detail. In the quarter, we generated $103 million in free cash flow. Working capital management delivered almost $31 million of cash flow in the quarter, which was over $19 million more than working capital generated in the third quarter of 2008. Similar to our execution around cost takeout, we are focused on free cash flow. We continue to make nice progress, leveraging our disciplined lien efforts and feel very good about our year-to-date cash position of $202 million for the first three quarters of 2009. You may notice the large negative other in 2008. I want to remind you that most of that with our litigation settlement for Verizon that occurred in Q3 of last year.  As we discussed all year, our cash usage objective has been to reduce debt. Shown on the bottom left side, you can see we remain on target to lower our debt to around $800 million by year-end. In fact, we are currently at $815 million of debt through the third quarter.  Overall, our average interest rate is 4.3%, only around 10 basis points higher than Q2. This represents a mixture of LIBOR plus 625 variable rate debts, along with fixed rate debt of approximately 5.5%. So we remain very comfortable with our debt position and going forward, we expect to increase our EBITDA, which will provide additional flexibility with respect to cash usage. Please turn to slide number 11, and let’s discuss full year free cash flow and our securitization program. Similar to other companies, Pentair has historically maintained a practice of entering into a receivables securitization program. For Pentair, this occurred each year in the fourth quarter. The program was put in place to mitigate risk associated with the concentrated set of specific customer receivables. The cost of this program has varied, but between insurance and discounting, the total cost has been around 1% to 2% of the total receivables sold, sold fairly modest. I’d also mention that management is not incentivise on the securitization of receivables. As we indicate on the lower left side of the chart, the amount of securitization has varied slightly from year-to-year since 2006. Originally, when we estimated our full year free cash flow of $225 million, we forecasted approximately $50 million of securitization, similar to previous years. However, our Q4 receivables balance and not the risk, is expected to be less this year and the overall cost to this program is higher. Therefore, at this time we are not expecting the securitized receivables in Q4. Assuming we do not participate, we are maintaining our free cash flow forecast to meet or exceed $225 million, given our year-to-date generation is already $202 million. The reason for this detail is to highlight that our year-end debt position will likely be $50 million less than originally expected, since many rating agencies include securitizations in their outstanding debt calculation. Additionally, we are maintaining our free cash flow forecast at $225 million with this assumption in mind, which is why we’re not raising our full year number. Please turn to slide number 12, and let’s review our fourth quarter 2009 outlook. This is an overview of our Q4 2009 market forecast. About 65% of our sales are related to U.S. markets. As we head into Q4, our clearest information is related to sequential indicators, since we can analyze current order trends and compare them versus the last several months. At this time, as we look at market and order trends versus the just completed third quarter, it appears most of our major end markets are improving modestly. The loan exception is commercial, which continues to weaken as the backlog of projects shrinks. As a reminder for Pentair, North American commercial water revenues around $150 million annually, and commercial revenue and Technical Products related to buildings is approximately $50 million annually. In all other North American markets, things are stabilizing, and improving very modestly, with six week order trends improving at all market segments, including the normal impact of seasonality, which means they are actually improving more than the sequential benefit we’re actually seeing. For Western Europe, markets appear to parallel the U.S. markets, as we are seeing similar trends. We anticipate orders and sales in December will once again moderate for the holidays. In our faster growth markets like China, we have seen a sharp recovery when compared to the initial decrease caused by the global recession, and our low penetration and new product launches in the Middle East and India continue to give us confidence that we will grow in those markets even if things remain unpredictable. Please turn to slide number 13 and let’s look at our Q4 forecast. For Q4 we expect revenue to be between $655 million and $670 million, down about 14% year-over-year, and approximately flat with Q3 of 2009. We expect water revenue to be around 10% to 12% down year-over-year, but a sequential improvement from the 17% decline in Q3. We expect Technical Products to be down around 18% to 20% year-over-year. You may remember that Q4 2008 was the first quarter that turned negative in Technical Products, so definitely some easier comparisons year-over-year in Q4. Additionally, we expect Technical Products revenue to increase versus Q3, which will be the first sequential upturn in revenue since mid 2008. So once again, we believe that the Technical Products markets have bottomed. Adjusting operating income is expected to be between $72 million and $77 million, which will produce overall Pentair operating margins of around 11%, up around 170 basis points year-over-year. We expect water margins to remain around 12%, up about 180 basis points year-over-year, and Technical Products margins to be about 15%, up 170 to 190 basis points year-over-year. All evidence of our cost out actions, and provides additional optimism, that when the top line begins to grow, that we will see the conversion we have positioned the company to achieve. Adjusted EPS is previously mentioned as expected to be between $0.40 to $0.44 per share, essentially flat to up modestly year-over-year. We expect our tax rate to be around 32% to 33%, our Q4 interest expense to be around $9 million, and expect our share count to creep up to about 98.9 million shares outstanding. Finally, we expect cash flow to be approximately $25 million for Q4, without any securitization. Please turn to slide number 14. Here is our expectation for the full year. Our total company, full year sales outlook remains $2.7 billion or down about 20%. Our operating income will be around $255 million and our operating margins around 9.6%. We have proven through three quarters, that our cost actions will yield significant 2009 and 2010 savings. Currently, we are forecasting $250 million in productivity savings in 2009 and we are seeing the benefit from material that we expected.  We are maintaining our adjusted EPS guidance of $1.40 plus and with just one more quarter to go, we have introduced a high end of $1.44. We continue to see signs of stabilization and even some pockets of improvement, but it’s too early to determine meaningful trends for 2010, and we will provide you with a 2010 outlook on the fourth quarter earnings call. In summary, we executed against our major actions very well again in the third quarter, but markets remain challenging. We took additional actions, which were necessary to provide support to our full year outlook and improve our ROIC going forward. We also feel good about our cash generation, and our ability to expand EBITDA next year will give us the flexibility in our balance sheet we used to enjoy, and that we want to have at our disposal for 2010 and beyond. We now like to answer any questions you might have. Operator, please open the lines for questions. Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari.
Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse: Thank you. Could you give us some color on what you are seeing with the inventory in your distribution channel? On the filtration product side, you commented on some de-stocking and some market softness there, as well as on the technical product side, on the electrical side, could you give us a sense of where we are in the de-stocking process? What you’re seeing in the channel?
Randy Hogan: I mean, I think consistent with what you’re hearing from other companies out there, inventories are low. I mean as a general rule of thumb, where we have been able to see our sell through, where we have very clear visibility between our customers and the end markets, our sell through is generally mirroring or is a little greater than what our sell to the distributors has been. So, I think that would confirm what you’re hearing from everybody else, that distributor levels are low and the nature of the order is still reflected. A non-stocking order usually is smaller than most skews are, and we are still seeing a lot, a higher portion of those kind of orders. So I don’t think that the restocking, to whatever extent it will happen, has really begun at all. 
Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse: Just a follow-up, on the technical product side, you talked about sales coming in worse than expected. Is it fair to say that you saw end markets within Technical Products get worse during the quarter, but now we’re running sequentially flat and then is that fair, one; and then could you give some more detail on end markets within Technical Products. For example, last quarter you said datacom was down 50%, has that gotten worse and could you give us some detail on what the industrial side is running and the electrical side as well?
John Stauch: I’ll take the first part and I’ll hand it over to Randy for the color on the vertical marks. Really, what we saw in technical products for Q2 to Q3 was a modest decrease, $207 million down to $202 million. What caused the disappointment was we had assumed that sequentially Q2 was the bottom and that we would see a pickup heading into Q3; that in fact did not happen. The year-over-year our growth rates for Q2 and Q3 in Technical Products were generally the same, down 32 and down 32. So I think it was more hope that we would see recovery quicker than we have and I think when we look at the way we’re exiting September and heading into early October, we feel comfortable we’ll see sequential growth from Q3 to Q4.
Randy Hogan: In terms of what we’re seeing in the vertical market, addressing specifically datacom. Datacom, we had another rough quarter and sales was down year-over-year about 48%, and part of that was timing when the ordered one of our larger orders that just basically got pushed out. It’s not a loss of a job, just the volume decline and we expect that volume will be better in the fourth quarter on that particular job. When we look across all the markets, they all look down and that part reinforces the de-stocking, right? I mean because they’re not all down, but the ones that look best right now are not surprisingly the ones that are serving the public sector. Institutions, water actually is one of the brighter spots, and on the electrical side, and then on the electronics side, security, military, medical are the best. Still down for us year-over-year, but down modestly.
Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse: Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
Randy Hogan: Your welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Schneider.
Mike Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Just thinking of Technical Products for a minute, so the push out of the major project you said from Q3 out, is that why you have confidence now in making the call that indeed volumes will be $10 million better in Q4?
Randy Hogan: Well, it’s really when we looked at second going into third, the business felt good, as we look at third going into fourth, the data looks better. That’s why we feel better.
Mike Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Is the project push out, the large food and beverage order that you spoke to earlier this summer?
Randy Hogan: No, it was Datacom, actually in Asia.
Mike Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Then just switching to water, so filtration is really the only business that seems to have sequentially deteriorated. Can you just drill down into that either by market or by brand, and just give us some insight as to still what’s getting worse within there? Is it all ever pure or is there more going on?
Randy Hogan: If you take a look at the net filtration businesses, it’s a modest decrease. The point I made in my comments Mike is, historically Q2 is our best quarter, and we see a seasonal downturn in Q3 and Q4. The fact that we’re actually staying fairly steady, tells you the markets are improving, but the normal seasonality is working against it.  Then the other insight there would be Europe. I mean Europe, our core filtration was weaker, and part of that is the natural summer months we experience and we had seen some recovery here in September and October. Filtration is our global business in water and to John’s point, Europe. Europe, I think we’re continuing to see de-stocking in the third quarter and the distribution channel.  To your point on Everpure actually, Everpure has a lot of momentum going for it. I think we’re actually going to be seeing growth from them. It may be shared, but we’ve had a number of good wins. What’s interesting is it’s a global business, but if you just take a look at its largest market, which is the U.S, the food service industry, as far back as we can see, 17 years at least, this is the first time that there’s been a decline in the number of restaurants in America in the last 17 years. It has been that drawback, and we think that is over. We think if a restaurant has gotten this far, it’s probably going to make it through, so we’re beginning to see an increase in activity.  So I think it’s interesting, because you think about our water business, only about 13% of our sales are commercial, and it’s really split between new construction, which is the flow side, and then Everpure, the food service side. So, we think actually in that part of commercial, we’re probably bottomed out and we’re beyond the bottom. So I feel pretty good about Everpure.
John Stauch: Mike, just a follow-up, the combined filtration businesses were down $3 million from Q2 to Q3. If you take out the benefit of the acquisition last year, they were down nine sequentially from Q2 to Q3, so just not sure if you had that information. I just wanted to make sure you had it.
Mike Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Okay, and could you give us an update just on the joint venture now with the GE residential products? Kind of where are you in the combination of the businesses? What’s gone better than expected in the first few quarters? What’s not up to your expectations? We just haven’t heard much about it.
Randy Hogan: Well, volume has been the biggest disappointment, right? I mean the fact that the residential market fell even further. Just to backup, when we put these businesses together, it was to get into position to win even bigger when residential the market recovers. This additional step down has complicated things. So we really would like some more volume in there.  I think that the radical combination and the shutdown of the factories have gone about according (Inaudible). We’re done with the major shutdowns. We’re now improving our delivery, improving our touch with customers so that we can grow going forward. The thing that’s gone better frankly is the innovation, and I’m really excited about a number of the things we’re doing, both in terms of what we’re doing with the channels and the distribution, but also in terms of the new products we have coming in point of use and even on the point of entry. So that’s how I assess it right now.
Mike Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Okay and then John, just specific on corporate expense or unallocated expense, if you pick a part of this segment guidance for Q4, then the annual, it looks like you’re anticipating that corporate expense line to go from what was about a $10 million or $11 million run rate, possibly as high as $15 million in Q4, and I realize that’s the plug and there maybe some cushion built in there, but is there anything unusual coming in Q4, in that line item to explain the jump?
John Stauch: The only incremental unusual as we go from Q3, Q4, is we intend to adjust our year-to-date insurance rates and we have some incremental stock option expense based upon wherever the stock is trading at, and then there’s some hope on some potential business mix that we’ve accrued for in the next couple of months.
Mike Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Okay, and final question just slide six, where you go through total company productivity, John you laid out that volume is a $386 million decrement in this stair step on a $700 million decline. Can you just give us, I guess the implications of that 55% decremental impact of volume? Is that what you modeled now on the way up, and is that the type of incremental margins we should be expecting at least early in the recovery before you start adding headcount and fixed overhead?
Randy Hogan: I mean it works easier as you know on the way down than it does on the way up. The way we’re modeling it there, as you see in the impact of sales minus materials and material for us is called roughly 40% of sales, and then what we’ve been able to do on the way down is to take variable labor out at a rate slightly higher than what the volume decline has been. We feel very confident that we won’t have to add the labor in at the same rate of the growth. So there should be some incremental, some will comeback obviously.
John Stauch: Mike, this is John. I’d remind you too; we talked in fair detail about this last quarter, that Q2 versus Q1 sequentially showed growth, and that sequential conversion was around 45%. We said at the time a decent indicator, because we think sequential is important as year-over-year in this environment, is as least a decent indicator of probably a really strong drop through.
Randy Hogan: The difference is basically material, plus sales commissions, plus variable labor is kind of how it gets.
John Stauch: Mike just to follow-up, I mean I think 35% to 40% is a reasonable expectation of the growth and the reason I would hedge a little bit on what we lost on the way down is the question of where the mix will be. So not all our revenue is as profitable as other components and I feel good about 35% to 40% as we look forward in 2010; and then as our investments kick in, it probably begins to compress to more of a 30% conversion going forward.
Mike Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Got it, thanks again.
Randy Hogan: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co.: Thanks, good morning.
Randy Hogan: Good morning, Chris.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co.: So just reconciling some of the directional pieces in the water margin. Randy, you had kind of a broader comment that maintained the trend of improvement in coming quarters, I’m initially taking that as a sequential comment, but you have some incremental restructuring here in the second half, maybe raw deflation has a little further to go. How far out do you think we are from getting to the point where it sequentially is just more strictly the volume levers that we think about?
Randy Hogan: I mean we’re going to probably have our highest margin quarter in what tends to be one of our weakest water quarters. So I think that’s where we feel confident that when you get to Q2, which is our best quarter, we’re going to see the benefit of this cost reduction in a significantly larger way; that would be my general outlook on this.  The second quarter is always the peak and if we look, there’s a margin being in the fourth quarter, and it’s going to be nominal, and I think we will see water at its wholesome best in the second quarter.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay and John, your comments about seeing the operating margin being the highest in one of your traditional weakest quarters. Were you referring to the quarter you just reported?
John Stauch: Q4 is traditionally for water.
Randy Hogan: Seasonally fourth quarter is generally a lower volumes season and quarter two and three are just seasonality. 
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay, then just wondering if you know anything about the stimulus opportunity that you didn’t know a month or two ago?
John Stauch: It’s really the same thing. I mean the activity is picking up in terms of discussion and we still have a couple of million dollars that we’ve won. Obviously we want to win a lot more than that. We didn’t think a lot was going to be left this year, but we expect a lot more will be left next year and hopefully in the first quarter.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co.: I know you had some tangible comments on the water side, but thought that Tech Products played there, too anything more tangible?
John Stauch: Yes, I mean the thing is and that’s one of the big focuses for our Hoffman line of products and distribution. Enclosures are ubiquitous, they’re used everywhere. If there is a capital dollar spent, there is an enclosure sold, and so the business is all over making sure the distributors are using the same data as we’re using on the water side in terms of chasing down the opportunities that are there.  I saw last week one of our panel builders who is actually the biggest businesses in water and they’re actually seeing growth right now, and they’re 100% Hoffman. So that’s what I meant when I said Technical Products going after (Inaudible)
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co.: Great. Thanks for the help.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Michael Cox.
Michael Cox – Piper Jaffray & Co.: Good morning and congratulations on the quarter again. My first question is, the SG&A in the quarter did increased sequentially despite the drop in sales sequentially and I understand part of that probably is from the restructuring, but I just wondering if you could provide a little more color on the sequential change?
John Stauch: On the reported side you are seeing the restructuring in there. If you take a look at SG&A on an adjusted basis, it was up about $2 million to $3 million and the Delta would be primarily some bad debt expense that we accrued, and we have a pretty standard policy on bad debt and when customers go past 180, past due we accrue, and that’s what are you going to see is the Delta.
Michael Cox – Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay, that’s helpful. Then on the gross margin side, it is the first time we’ve seen above 30% for a year now, and I guess I would be curious as to whether these structural changes have been made that will allow to you maintain that even in perhaps a seasonally slower quarter here over the next couple of quarters.
John Stauch: The biggest drop in that is finally seeing the material improvement, and when you take a look at Q3, we’re a couple hundred basis points better than we were in materials, as a percentage of sales a year ago, that is the help. I mean we have seen it, but because of the way we have thrown in the standards and leasing not standards, it was about six months in arrears and we’re starting to see the benefit of the materials start to flow through. So yes, we would expect to sustain it into Q4. 
Michael Cox – Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay, and then my last question is just in terms of your sales projections for the fourth quarter, and I guess if you’re looking at early in 2010, what have you imbedded for 4X, perhaps a benefit relative to last year?
John Stauch: It’s interesting, as you pointed out, foreign exchange is actually positive in Q4 for the first time for the year. So for us if you take a look at Q3 year-over-year versus Q4 year-over-year, that’s about a 3% benefit sequentially.
Michael Cox – Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay great. Thank you very much.
John Stauch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Shannon O’Callaghan.
Shannon O’Callaghan – Barclays Capital: Good morning, guys. Just on the Tech Products margins, longer term here, you guys have slowed this slide back at your Investor Day with sort of the errors of Tech Products and the future looked like kind of like 13 to 17, but it looks like you are all going to be at 15 in a horrible market in 4Q. I mean, is that range intended that way or do you see potential upside of that based on what you’ve seen happen here this year?
John Stauch: Yes, I’m very pleased with the margins. I’m disappointed that the sales went down as much, but it’s a business and it’s pretty attractive, even at the bottom of the cycle, which is where we think we are today. Q4 by the way is 15%, for the full year 13%, which is actually the goal we set for the business at the beginning. So that’s kind consistent with where we thought they would be. The 15% in the fourth quarter, we thought they would be close to that on higher sales. So, the fact that they’re there on a little bit lower sales is better.  I would tell you that at the peak in this business, I wouldn’t say that the margins need to be higher. What I want this business to do is grow more aggressively globally and I would like to invest and continue to invest in that business to do it. I think our global opportunities in this business are enormous, absolutely enormous. So if you think about 13 being the bottom, and 20’ish plus the top, pretty nice business, particularly if we globalize.
Shannon O’Callaghan - Barclays Capital: Okay, and then how do you feel about where you’ve set the cost structure here, in terms of if things come back quicker than you think? I mean, where is that threshold where you do have to bring a significant amount of costs back, do you think? What kind of sales growth would you need to see before you need to bring some costs back into the system?
John Stauch: I’ll take the first half and then I’ll have Randy conclude. I think clearly we have capacity in all of our factories. If you look at our shifts, and if you look at the way we took out labor, we have very little temporary labor, which we intend to have to handle the seasonal up ticks.  So our capacity in our factories is pretty set for a sizable upturn here, where we would be challenged, like other companies would be challenged, is in our material supply, and we’re doing everything we can in the areas that we think we’re going to grow to make sure that our suppliers are prepared and ready, and that we have insights into our channels, and to our customers’ customers, to make sure that we’ve got demand, if it picks up quickly back to our supply base.
Randy Hogan: Yes, I think, I’m not concerned about factories. We have a couple of flexes; first of all, we virtually have nobody on overtime, and if we have overtime, we have temporaries and of course we can add shifts. So inside our factories, I think we’ve got a pretty good idea of what we will do. So the challenge, the real key is to make sure our suppliers are ready to go too. So there’s a lot of discussion and activity around that.
Shannon O’Callaghan - Barclays Capital: Alright, and then just last one is, talking about the EBITDA increasing and getting the debt levels down. I mean what’s the future thought, when you get to some target level? What is that level? What do you start doing with your cash at that point? I mean what’s the M&A world look like and what are you think?
Randy Hogan: Well, it will be to fund growth. I’m particularly pleased that we’ve maintained our dividend increases through this period and we’re paying down debt. We want to fund growth too, and that growth could be M&A or it could be organic in terms of putting capital to work in new product innovation, or to help us globalize.  So in terms of M&A, it’s beginning to pick up a little bit, nothing is happening yet, but on the water side, people still think things are worth more than we might think they are. On the Tech Product side, we haven’t seen anything of real interest.
Shannon O’Callaghan - Barclays Capital: So when do you hit that point? I mean can we think of M&A as sort of off the table for you guys for now and when does that change or…?
Randy Hogan: No, I wouldn’t say it’s off. I mean right now we’re still focused on a couple of things; one is to help us globalize. So we’re looking at that in terms of expansion and capability, and that’s true in both businesses.  Now in the case of Tech Products, we tended to do organically. We just built a new factory that we started this year in India, and we’ve expanded the factory in China, and I still see some possibilities for water in Asia. So for us, it would be bolt-on's in geography and technology, and if we can’t do that, we’ll maybe turn back some stock again. That’s kind of the way we look at it, what can we do on the organic side, what can we do on the acquisition side and then what do we do with extra cash as well.
Shannon O’Callaghan - Barclays Capital: Okay, thanks guys.
Randy Hogan: We’ll be in a good position to deal with it next year, so that will be a nice position to be in.
Shannon O’Callaghan - Barclays Capital: Sounds good. Thanks guys.
Randy Hogan: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond.
Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Hi, good morning, guys.
Randy Hogan: Good morning.
Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets: I just want to understand a little bit better the moving pieces within water, because you’re taking down your second half revs by about $15 million, and yet you’re speaking about continuing to see signs of improving North America residential. So can you just tell me what the offsets are and maybe give me a little bit better color on what you’re exactly seeing in the North America revs water that makes you feel better?
Randy Hogan: One is, we are in the residential business in Europe and we are in the residential business in Asia, and both softened from what we thought they would be. So the comment about North America is not inconsistent with the data, because the additional softening wasn’t North America so much, it was Europe being lower than we thought it would be. Actually as I mentioned, Asia slowed down for us. Now, we see it coming back, but it was slower than we would have liked. So those are the keys there, and we look at the U.S., we think the U.S. residential will continue to modestly improve.
Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Where are you exactly seeing improvement, actually in your shipments or in order rates, or is there…?
John Stauch: In order rates …
Randy Hogan: Order rates and sell through at distribution.
John Stauch: Here is where we’re challenged. If you take a look at last year, and you can go back and historically take a look at this, and last year had a little Tech Products correction, but generally we’re down $100 million from Q3 to Q4 in total Pentair revenue, and majority of that is the seasonality of our pool business and the residential businesses, which don’t have a strong winter here in North America, or in those areas that experience winter.  What we’re seeing this year is actually increase from Q3 to Q4 on the residential businesses, and that’s where I was mentioning that the seasonality year-over-year is being offset by the sequential up-ticks in those order rates and those sales.
Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay, that’s helpful. Then, I know you’re not prepared to give any color really on 2010 guidance, but can you give us a sense of, based on all of the restructuring actions you’ve taken, what you think your incremental cost savings are in 2010, and then as you look at this $100 million of cost savings as temporary, based on the trajectory of your business, how much do you think of that comes back?
John Stauch: Well, I mean we said that we were going after and felt that we were going to get 300 in the aggregate between 2009 and 2010, and all of our analysis confirms that. So 250 realized this year, 50 carry over to the next year. There is some headwinds, things like merit increases and some of the short term things we did, and I would say offsetting that is a little bit better feeling than material right now. So, I still feel comfortable with everything we shared earlier of 300 in total, which is 250 this year, and an incremental 50 next year.
Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Any temporary costs comeback, you make up with productivity?
John Stauch: I think we make up with incremental material.
Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay, and just a clarification on Tech Products. I think you mentioned in an earlier question there was maybe a project that got deferred or pushed. Is there a way to quantify that? Is that really just going from Q3 to Q4?
Randy Hogan: Well and in the next year or two. I don’t know the specific numbers. It was a hole in the third quarter. Basically, it’s a large project that the customer in Asia pushed it out.
Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Is it more that some of that comes back in the fourth quarter that gives you confidence; you go from the low twos to 210?
Randy Hogan: Yes, we think their receipts. Our sales to them will be higher in the fourth quarter.
Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay, and then underlying order activity, September and October is a little bit better to support it as well?
Randy Hogan: Yes.
Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Drab.
Brian Drab - William Blair & Co.: Good morning. I just have a couple quick questions at this point.
Randy Hogan: Hi, Brian.
Brian Drab - William Blair & Co.: Hi. First of all on the pool market, can you give us a little more color there and some of the key indicators you’re looking at, permits and how you think the 2010 season is going to shape up?
John Stauch: Well, we haven’t really focused on the 2010 season right now, but it can’t be worse, it’s got to be better, and when you basically have no new things being built. Well, early by the signs. The best thing right now is if you go several years back, there were supplier pull aheads and you saw people doing things to shape demand, most of that because of credit and distributor needs have shaken out of the system. So what we’re seeing is generally a normal season now, and a sell through consistent with where our orders and sales are. So I think we feel like there’s not extra stock in the channel, and as we head into next year, pool permits from this point as Randy said in his notes, 80% to 90% down versus where they were at peak. So pretty strong after market demand and new housing builds will drive a little bit better pool permit sales, so net-net I mean right now if we had to make a call, I think pool feels like it could be slightly up next year, but I mean that could change.
Brian Drab - William Blair & Co.: Okay great, and just one other question; on the Technical Products side, just really strong margin performance, given sales were down over 30%. Can you give us any more resolution in terms of margins between the electrical and electronics business and the trends you’re seeing? Is one sub segment trending better than the other?
Randy Hogan: We’ve always sort of said the electrical and electronics are the tale of two cities. Electrical is highly, highly profitable; electronics is thinner margins. They both benefited though. I mean both margins improved because the big lift in the third quarter was material. We finally were getting materials readout that we knew was coming and arrived fully in the third quarter. So they both benefited from the material productivity.
Brian Drab - William Blair & Co.: More clearly talking about steel when you’re talking about material primarily?
Randy Hogan: Primarily, yes.
John Stauch: They also did a great job of reacting to the demand early and taking out the variable portions of the manufacturing side.
Randy Hogan: Yes.
Brian Drab - William Blair & Co.: Okay. Great. That’s all I’ve got. Thanks.
Randy Hogan: Thank you.
Todd Gleason: Darla, this is Todd. I’m just noting that we’re getting close to the end of our hour. If there is anyone left in the queue we certainly want to get to them, if not we will wrap up.
Operator: Yes, you have a question from the line of Scott Graham.
Scott Graham – Landenburg Thalmann: Hey, good morning.
John Stauch: Hey, Scott.
Randy Hogan: Good morning.
Scott Graham – Landenburg Thalmann: If we can put aside the $30 million, $ 40 million, $50 million worth of raw materials benefits that’s part of your overall $300 plus million plan, and just sort of focus on spot rates of materials right now; John, you indicated that you were actually more optimistic about the ability to capture some raw material benefits next year. Could you tell us why that would be with raw materials sequentially rising now, is that a manufacturing, engineering thing or…?
John Stauch: Because we measure it like any company would measure, the gross pipeline going in and results coming out, and what Randy and I and our Chief Operating Officer Mike Schrock heard for sometime is that the gross going in are better, and quite frankly we’re now finally seeing it.  So when we look at the material percentage of sales and the improvement we’re seeing in that line, that’s all in. That’s price, that’s mix, and that’s the commodity savings, and that’s what we really care about is; what’s the benefit to Pentair and we’re capturing it. That’s why we feel more confident.
Scott Graham – Landenburg Thalmann: So you feel a big part this is like you’re using less.
John Stauch: Well, it is more that the promises of where these savings are coming from are finding their way into the P&L.
Randy Hogan: Essentially we’re FIFO. We’ve seen it on the books, but we haven’t seen it in the P&L. It was in inventory, with better costs and that even if costs go up, we will still have a better cost in inventory for a while. Plus depending on whether we go, how long out we go, on materials or not, we can lock in and right now, I think we’re in pretty good shape.
Scott Graham – Landenburg Thalmann: Okay. So on the materials for the third quarter, the gross margin rose. Was that solely from materials or was there some other restructuring involved there, net of the volume decline? Could you maybe give us a couple of buckets on that?
John Stauch: Sure, I mean material as I mentioned earlier was roughly 200 basis points plus of improvement, and the gross margin has actually improved 150. Now I cautioned you that labor was a sizable benefit as well, and the thing that gets squeezed is the fixed costs as the revenue comes down, so that’s kind of the component.  A really productive job on reducing labor rates, which came down almost 100 basis points as a percentage of sales materials, better than 200 basis points, and the other offset would be the squeeze on the fixed manufacturing costs.
Scott Graham – Landenburg Thalmann: Okay, so because of the way you’re handling materials internally, not to say that the 200 basis points is a sustainable number, but even though materials prices across the board are sequentially higher, you can still derive benefit from materials nevertheless.
John Stauch: Yes.
Scott Graham – Landenburg Thalmann: Okay. Good.
John Stauch: We will know when that time ends. We will be able to talk about it.
Scott Graham – Landenburg Thalmann: So it is not like you need to go out and announce a price increase in weak conditions to offset. Okay very good.  The next question was really just about the municipal business, and obviously I know you guys have high hopes for this business. I was just wondering how you guys are marketing the New Orleans win to municipalities in the state, and even internationally and what kind of traction are you seeing on that?
John Stauch: It is a high visibility job and certainly our sales force is talking to it, about wherever they can and we’re not doing any kind of advertising with it. It’s a highly technical sale and it’s about specification. So you want to make sure that the engineering firms, the CH2M HILLS and the Black & Veatches, and the CDM’s and all are aware of it, and Mitsubishi and DOLSAN and making sure that the high fluxes, that the folks in Asia as know about it. So that is primarily what we’re doing.  Our main focus on that job is execution right now, and we’re off to a good start. There’s still a lot going on, and there’s no shipments, but there’s a lot of engineering going on. There is a lot of testing.
Scott Graham - Landenburg, Thalmann: That’s all I had. Thanks.
Randy Hogan: Thank you.
John Stauch: Anybody else in the queue?
Operator: Yes, we have a question from John Quealy.
Randy Hogan: John?
Chip Moore - Canaccord Adams: Good morning, thanks. This is Chip Moore for John. I’m just wondering if you could give us a little more color on free cash flow moving forward. You made reference to having some more to do on working capital. If you could quantify how much more you think you can get there, and then on CapEx, how we should be thinking about that. If you expect that to hold steady I guess at current levels. Thanks.
John Stauch: Yes, I’ll answer CapEx first. I mean I think we have been pretty active moving factories, and anytime you move a factory, there’s a higher level of capital expenditures than you would like. Especially with moving it to places like China, where you’re not really allowed to import the equipment, but you generally have to buy new. So we think that CapEx let’s say stays flat kind of from Q3 levels into Q4.  On the working capital side, we’ve done a good job taking out working capital as the revenues come down, and what we’ve really benefited for in the drop in revenue, that’s been the working capital benefit. I think we can do better around our improvement in the processes, again primarily around the fact that the plant moves are behind us and now we don’t need the type of safety stock and double counting of inventory that our plants like to have to protect themselves against customers.  So I’ve seen an opportunity in the inventory. We have instituted in a series of payment term increases and payables at the starting to see the benefit up, and I expect that more of that in Q4, and then if we get more global, we’re seeing some leakage in the receivable base. So we’re looking at the inventory and payables offset the globalization of our receivable base. That’s where I see the opportunities.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Adams: Great, thanks.
John Stauch: Thank you. Okay Darla, do we have anyone else in the queue or…?
Operator: There is no one else in queue. You may proceed with closing remarks.
John Stauch: Thank you. Thank you all for listening. We’ll be around for further questions if there are any, and this is the end of the call, could you give directions on the recording?

Operator: My name is Patrick and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Pentair Q2 2009 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question and answer session. (Operator Instructions) Todd Gleason, you may begin your conference.
Todd Gleason : Welcome to Pentair’s second quarter earnings release conference call. We’re glad you could join us. I’m Todd Gleason, Head of Investor Relations and with me today is Randy Hogan, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and John Stauch, our Chief Financial Officer. On today’s calls we will provide details on our second quarter results as well as update you on Pentair’s outlook for 2009.  Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company’s anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties such as the risks outlined in Pentair’s 10K as of December 31, 2008 and Pentair news releases. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today and the company undertakes no obligation to update publically such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results.  Today’s webcast is accompanied by a presentation which can be found in the financial information section of Pentair’s website at www.Pentair.com. We will reference these slides throughout our prepared remarks. Any reference to non-GAAP financials are reconciled in the appendix of the presentation. I would also like to point out that all financial results and references to year-over-year numbers in today’s call and presentation are on a continuing operations basis unless otherwise noted or highlighted. As is our custom, we will reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. I will now hand the call over to Randy who will take you through Pentair’s second quarter 2009 results, provide his perspective on the results of our businesses and the markets they serve and provide an overview on how we are driving to deliver for the rest of 2009. Then, John will conclude our formal comments with additional information regarding second quarter financials and provide more detail on our outlook.
Randall J. Hogan, III : Let’s begin by reviewing our second quarter results shown on Slide Two. Sales of $694 million were essentially at the low end of the guidance we provided in April. We had some pluses and minuses with respect to sales but the headline is North American residential market showed signs of sequential improvement while Europe and many commercial and industrial end markets continued to bump along the muddy bottom.  Sales in our water business were down 18%, essentially in line with our expectations. Our largest market, North American residential remains down year-over-year but we have seen steady sequential improvement since March. The seasonal uptick we forecasted for our pool equipment business occurred at or above the pace we expected so that was a positive. Our European water business was weaker than expected especially in April and May which offset any upside on North American residential market sales may have been able to deliver in the quarter. Technical product sales declined 32% which was about 500 basis points below our expectations. Similar to water Europe, volumes in April and May were worse than forecast but orders and sales picked up from there in June. All of our major vertical markets and technical products experienced double digit declines in the quarter.  Also in the quarter we delivered reported earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.33 which includes $0.05 of non-recurring items associated with new restructuring actions and our early redemption of high interest rate notes, neither of which were in our Q2 guidance. We will discuss these items in more detail later in the call. If you remove those items, we delivered $0.38 of adjusted EPS which was down 46% when compared to adjusted EPS in the second quarter of 2008 which excluded the onetime gain on the formation of Pentair Residential Filtration, our combination with GE. While down significantly year-over-year, adjusted Q2 EPS almost double sequentially as the benefits from cost actions, material savings and some seasonal volumes provided a strong lift over Q1 2009 adjusted EPS. We remain on or ahead of schedule with regard to our major cost actions and have already closed 15 of or 17 targeted facilities. Furthermore, headcount is down 18% year-over-year. While difficult actions, these are necessary to ensure we remain competitive and are positioned appropriately for the long term Despite our well executed aggressive costs actions, the dramatic volume declines in the quarter resulted in our margins contracting 370 basis points for the total company as positive benefits from productivity and price did not offset the negative impact from volume declines and foreign exchange. Another way to consider our productivity results is by looking at sequential margins. Second quarter operating margins expanded 330 basis points when compared to the first quarter of this year. Q2 sales grew about $60 million when compared to the first quarter while income grew by about $27 million. If you do the math, the operating income conversion from the additional sales was almost a 45% conversion rate so that’s another indicator that productivity is yielding strong results. Relative to our adjusted EPS, our second quarter effective tax rate was 33%, up three points versus the first quarter but in line with our guidance. We continue to expect our full year tax rate will be between 32% and 33%. Finally, we produced $131 million of free cash flow in Q2. Year-to-date, we’ve generated approximately $40 million more free cash flow than in the first half of 2008.  Now, let’s turn to Slide Three which provides an overview of our Q2 water results. Here are the details, on the top of the slide we provide our standard sales and operating income walks. I’ll refer to these as we describe the performance of the water group. Overall, water sales declined $107 million to $487 million, down 18% versus second quarter 2008 sales or down 17% organically in local currencies. As I mentioned earlier this was at the positive end of our sales guidance we provided in April. Let’s review our water business unit performance individually; our global flow technology sales declined 175. Growth in our municipal markets did not overcome continued declines in residential and commercial and softness in agricultural markets. Global filtration was down 14% in the second quarter versus last year as the benefits from the formation of Pentair Residential Filtration did not overcome the general economic decline’s impact on residential and commercial markets. Our global pool equipment business did benefit from a nice seasonally uptick versus the first quarter but sales were still down 16% year-over-year as pool permits and the overall pool equipment market remained depressed.  Internationally, sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa or EMEA were down approximately 24% in local currencies which was below our expectations when we introduced guidance. Worse than expected sales in April and May were not overcome by June volumes which were more in line with our original expectations. In Asia, water sales were down slightly in local currencies as sales growth in China did not compensate for weakness in other parts of the region.  Now, let’s discuss operating profits and margins for our water group. On the top right you can see our year-over-year operating income walk for water. Adjusted margins were 10.5% down 330 basis points year-over-year. Margins came in essentially in line with our guidance as productivity actions delivered meaningful results but did not offset the impact volume declines had on our margins year-over-year.  In the quarter we instituted new restructuring actions. The charge associated with this is shown on the walk as a $1 million negative impact to op income which is how you get to our reported operating income of $50 million. So in sum, this is a very challenging environment where we continue to take the right steps to position our water business for better days.  Now, please turn to Slide Four and we’ll review technical products. Year-over-year, second quarter sales in technical products were down 32%. As I mentioned earlier, sales declines of about five percentage points worse than we had anticipated. April and May were very weak as we did not see any improvement from the depressed Q1 levels. However, June sales more closely tracked the volumes we had expected and proved to be the strongest month year-to-date. Sales declines were experienced across the board in technical products as all our major vertical markets contracted with several dropping more than 30% led by datacom which was down over 50%. Looking at the businesses within technical products, our global electrical business declined 28% while our global electronics business declined 32%. Technical product margins were 12%, a decline of 440 basis points year-over-year. Aggressive cost actions and solid execution on our restructuring efforts did not make up for the dramatic decline in sales. That said, margins improved sequentially almost 200 basis points despite slightly lower sales volumes than in the first quarter. So, we’re delivering the sequential margin improvements we expected. As in water, we took new restructuring actions in the quarter. The $1 million charge associated with those charges is shown in the walk and reconciles to our reported operating income of $24 million.  Now, please turn to Slide Five and let’s review some of the key takeaways from Q2. Starting with some of the pluses or positives, we mentioned earlier that we are seeing sequential improvement in the North American residential market. In the second quarter, this market performed slightly better than we had originally forecast. Since residential markets represent about 50% of our water sales, this is an encouraging trend.  Next on the list is the sequential volume conversion. We anticipated that our cost actions would produce strong margin conversions from higher sales and as we shared earlier we did generate nice sequential margins. We expect to continue to deliver solid productivity results which will continue to position us for sequential margin expansions going forward. Moving to the next positive item, you may have seen our press release last week announcing the largest contract in Pentair history, a $65 million municipal pump order with the Army Corps of Engineers to help improve flood controls for the City of New Orleans. The pump station is expected to be the largest in the world and deliveries are scheduled to commence in 2010 and cumulate in 2011. The record order demonstrates our position in the municipal markets. Another plus coming out of the second quarter was free cash flow which as mentioned earlier was about $40 million higher than our cash generation in bin point of 2008.  The next few items are essentially neutral. We expected commercial and industrial markets to experience strong double digit declines and certainly we saw that in the second quarter of 2009 so no blood really versus our guidance. While Asia and Middle East markets generally have slowed, we continue to see solid growth prospects in both water and technical products. We’re being cautious on our sales forecasts for these markets and therefore not overly dependent on the growth rate we previously had generated until we see the recession’s impact on these regions. We’ve already mentioned the two negatives, or minuses listed on this slide. Q2 sales in Europe were negatively impacted by the extremely soft April and May; technical products experienced a similar trend as the first months of Q2 remained at or below Q1 levels. Sales in June improved in both but were not enough to bring either business up to the expectation we had when we started the quarter. Overall, Q2 produced a balance of positive, neutral and negative items which, is not uncommon, of course. We’re encouraged the positives are beginning to outweigh the negative.  Let’s take a look at our total company productivity for the second quarter. Please turn to Slide Six. We showed this slide during our Q1 earnings review so this is just an update on our major productivity actions. The walk at the top of the slide shows the major components impacting our year-over-year operating income. The first bucket labeled net material and price is a positive $1 million. Since you can see on the previous slide that we generated $16 million of price, you’d be correct in calculating that material inflation was still a -$15 million. We continue to work off higher priced inventory which has been a drag on earnings in the first half of 2009. Sequentially we did improve materials by approximately $10 million so we’re gaining traction. Some of our material benefits from lower priced commodities is trapped in inventories in our balance sheet so that should provide a lift in the second half as cost of goods sold increases in line with those lower raw material costs already in inventory.  The next three buckets in the walk totaled $65 million in positive productivity associated with wage and headcount reductions and the result of our aggressive actions with regard to discretionary items. Bottom line, our costs actions are yielding results. The final component is labeled growth which reflected a decline. With total company sales down 23% or approximately $200 million, the -$119 million is simply the amount of non-material drop through that occurs if we had not taken the action we did to adjust our cost structure. The bottom half of the slide detailed the year-to-date results of our headcount reduction actions year-over-year. Hourly headcount is down 21%, similar to our sales decline. Salaried headcount is down 13%, another significant drop. But, what’s most critical is that wages shown on the bottom right of the slide are down 20%. That means our actions are yielding solid cost reductions and since we continue to maintain our investments in R&D, global expansion and organic growth initiatives, we have not sacrificed future growth for short term benefits. There have been significant progress on our cost actions which lays a nice foundation for the remainder of 2009 and 2010.  Please go to Slide Seven and let’s review full year 2009 productivity. Three sections of this slide represent the three largest components of cost to our company: materials; hourly labor; and salaried labor. We’re driving actions in each to provide meaningful bottom line productivity in 2009 and to ensure we are positioning the company for 2010 and beyond. Here’s the major takeaways from each component: first, in materials we expect $30 million of net benefit from actions we’ve taken to secure lower price commodities and components for the balance of 2009 when we’ll start to see solid improvement in materials and we expect to lower our materials as a percent of sales by 1% or the $30 million. Next is hourly labor, previously we had targeted about $70 million of savings from this cost bucket. Our current view is that we should get between $75 and $80 million of cost takeout here so while these actions are difficult they are necessary with the sales drop we and lots of other companies have seen during 2009. The third section salaried labor, is expected to be down another $70 million. We remain on track to achieve those savings having already reduced our salaried headcount by 13%. These top three productivity actions drive a significant portion of the cost savings we expect to achieve in 2009. In total we current expect to drive productivity savings of $250 million, up about $10 million versus our previous view. This is critical to delivering on our commitment as our end markets remain soft and difficult to predict.  Now, please turn to Slide Eight. This slide is also one of our standard update slides and it is divided in to four quadrants: cost out; driving free cash flow; position for growth; and our perspective going forward. As I previously detailed, we continue to execute against our cost actions. We knew 2009 would be a very difficult year and so far it’s been worse than that. Only through solid execution will we deliver on our targeted results. The items highlighted in this section demonstrate our progress. These are items we’ve already covered so I won’t repeat them. We’ll continue to keep you posted on our progress as taking out costs is clearly critical in this environment.  Moving down the left side of the slide, our ability to generate significant free cash flow remains a focus for the company. We have a tremendous opportunity with working capital and we’re already making progress since year-to-date we’re approximately $40 million ahead of last year. Moving to the top right of the slide, it’s important to note that we remain energized about our long term growth prospects in both water and technical products. While sales remain will remain in decline for 2009 we continue to introduce new products, win key orders and position our business favorably for significant orders in the future.  The $65 million municipal pump contract I just talked about is a great example of our strength and position and an important market for Pentair in our engineered flow business and this is in a market which is targeted for the government stimulus money. We’ve won several relatively small stimulus related programs already and we’ll keep you informed as to the level of projects getting underway.  We’re also proud to announce that our filtration solutions enviro product continues to be recognized as the leading reverse osmosis product in food service. In May, McDonalds selected enviro as the winner of the McDonalds’ innovation award. The enviro system sets new benchmarks in RRO and water efficiency and we remain very positive on its prospects in food service and hospitality end markets.  The final section of this chart is labeled going forward. We will continue to execute against our cost actions and we’re implementing additional actions to offset volume declines. As we drive working capital actions we’re confident we should deliver at least $225 million of free cash flow for 2009 which will be used to pay dividends or pay down debt. Finally, we believe that with our innovation and market investments Pentair is positioned to take advantage of market opportunities as they emerge.  As I said earlier, we look forward to sharing our progress with you. By taking out costs today, driving free cash flow so we can continue to invest in tomorrow and developing new technologies and satisfying our customers every day, we will emerge stronger for the long term. Now, I’ll hand it over to John who will provide additional details on our financials and also to discuss our full year 2009 outlook in more detail.
John L. Stauch : Please turn to Slide Nine. This slide is divided into three sections, the top section reflects the GAAP or reported earnings per share for Q2 year-to-date 2009 and our second half and full year outlook for EPS. The middle section details the adjustments from GAAP to our adjusted earnings per share for those periods. At the bottom of the slide we provide 2008 reported and adjusted EPS results for comparison purposes.  Starting with the first column labeled Q2 ’09 actual, our GAAP reported earnings per share were $0.33. Included in this result was $0.02 of EPS charge for severance costs as we took new actions in the second quarter to reduce our headcount by an additional 100 people. The next non-recurring item is the $0.03 associated with the early termination costs for our note redemption, an action we completed in April. Removing the impact of these two items, you get to the $0.38 of adjusted earnings per share for Q2. The $0.38 is down 46% versus the $0.70 earned in the second quarter of 2008.  Please shift one column to the right which provides similar detail regarding our year-to-date total. Rather than walk through the numbers, I’d simply point out that we had a $0.07 delta between our reported year-to-date EPS of $0.50 and our adjusted EPS of $0.57. The timing of certain non-recurring benefits is not easy to forecast but we continue to work on several items that would offset or eclipse the restructure and bond related charges for the year.  The following two columns represent our second half and full year 2009 outlook in the same reconciliation format. As you can see, we expect an additional $0.03 of restructuring charges in the third quarter related to the closing of a technical products facility and as I just mentioned, we are working on some positive non-recurring items that would provide about $0.10 EPS. So, guidance for both our GAAP and non-GAAP EPS remains $1.40 plus. In a few minutes we’ll discuss our outlook for Q3 in more detail.  Please turn to Slide 10; the top portion of the left hand side of the page gives the major components of cash flow for the second quarter and the year-over-year information. As you can see, we delivered $131 million in free cash flow. Working capital management drove almost $100 million of cash flow in the quarter and working capital drove over $40 million more cash flow than the second quarter of 2008.  Similar to our execution around cost takeout, we are focused on free cash flow. We continue to make nice progress leveraging our disciplined lean efforts and expect working capital will continue to generate strong free cash flow in the second half of the year. As you can on the lower left hand side of the chart, our current cash usage objective is to continue to reduce debt. We expect to lower debt to approximately $800 million by the end of 2009. With the early redemption of our outstanding 7.85% note which we completed in April, our earliest maturity on our remaining outstanding debt is 2012. Overall, our average interest rate is current 4.1%. This represents a mixture of LIBOR plus 50 variable rate debt along with fixed rate debt of approximately 5.5% so we are comfortable with our debt position and we expect to reduce it further throughout 2009.  Please turn to Slide 11 and let’s review cash and related metrics another way. The top section of the slide provides a straight forward walk on our debt balance to start the year and how we expect to pay down debt to approximately $800 million by the end of the year. We also show our dividend payments of approximately $70 million for the year which is the other use of cash in 2009. The green boxes represent the $225 million of free cash flow that we intend to generate in 2009 which is obviously how we pay down debt and fund our dividend.  The lower half of this slide shows some key cash related metrics. We continue to have a big opportunity to reduce our working capital as a percent of sales. It currently stands at 15% which is three points above 2008 levels. Our current receivables position remains good but, we have receivables days or DSOs creep up as global mix and in some cases customer terms have each had a negative impact. Conversely, we are working to manage our payables to reflect the market realities. Our DPP, or days payable has increased to 62 days from 58 days in similar portion as receivables have increased by on a smaller balance. Finally, our rapid decline in sales and plant moves and closures, days inventory on hand or DIOH has grown to 89 days from 75 days a year ago. We expect to lower this metric by about 10 days in the second half of the year. As we complete our factory closures we’ll have a more stable inventory system and sales level look to stabilize so our planning and inventory systems will continue to improve.  Please turn to Slide 12 and let’s review our third quarter 2009 outlook. This is an overview of our Q3 2009 forecast. We expect Q3 revenue to be between $675 million and $695 million, down approximately 20% when compared against last year’s sales of $856 million. As you can see on the upper right of the slide, this revenue projection reflects a contraction in water revenue of between 15% and 17% and a contraction in technical products revenue of between 26% to 28%.  We expect Q3 operating income to be $70 to $80 million and produce double digit operating margins for Pentair. As we just covered, our outlook for Q3 EPS is between $0.35 and $0.45 per share on an adjusted basis. The benefits from our cost actions will continue to read out at substantial reductions in operating costs accelerate in Q3. Additionally, we expect year-over-year net material performance to be a larger positive than represented in Q2. We expect our Q3 tax rate to be around 33% which is essentially flat with the tax rate in Q2.  Interest expenses is expected to be reduced by approximately $4 million year-over-year as our interest rate profile has improved dramatically. Finally, we expect to generate free cash flow of about $60 million which will keep us on track to deliver $225 million of projected free cash flow for the year. So, a lot in common with the quarter we just completed. Sales are expected to be slightly lower than Q2 but income should increase as benefits from our ongoing cost actions provide additional relief. Please turn to Slide 13 and let’s look at our Q2 to Q3 sequential sales and income in more detail. We wanted to provide this detail to address potential questions regarding our Q3 outlook which has sales dropping sequentially but income rising. Here’s how we’re delivering that dynamic. First, we are forecasting sales to decline about $10 million sequentially. We expect sales to drop $30 million from the absence of seasonal volumes that historically fall in to the second quarter. To somewhat offset that drop, we expect our European water businesses and our technical products business to each generate about $10 million of additional sales in Q3 versus Q2. Both of these businesses will still be down year-over-year but we do not expect a dramatically slower start to the quarter that we saw in April and May. So, that walks you to the midpoint of our sales range for Q3. Now, let’s do the same thing for operating income on a sequential basis. As you can see, we estimate operating income to be up between $3 million and $13 million sequentially. Here is the walk, we expect the sequential drop in sales translates to a -$5 million in income. To offset that drop savings from sourcing materials programs should deliver about $7 million of positive income versus the second quarter. Finally, since we started our restructuring actions several quarters ago we’ll begin to see the steady decline in pay as you go expenses and manufacturing related costs. The pay as you go costs reflect our facility closure costs such as dual leases, lower production yields, training ramp up costs, IT system migration costs and asset depreciation accelerations. So, these incremental productivity items should deliver about $6 million in operating income. The total of these three items brings you to the midpoint of our third quarter operating guidance. I hope that information was useful. Please turn to Slide 14 and let’s review our full year outlook. We are maintaining the same full year guidance. Our total company full year sales outlook remains $2.7 billion or down about 20%. This is a drop of -$600 million in revenue year-over-year. We continue to expect our cost actions will deliver significant savings. Currently, we are forecasting $250 million in cost reductions in 2009. While that will positively position our cost structure going forward, it isn’t enough to keep operating income flat with 2008. As such, we continue to expect our operating income will be down about 30% to approximately $255 million. Finally, we are maintaining our EPS guidance of $1.40 plus. While our end markets remain unpredictable, we continue to see signs of stabilization and even some pockets of improvement but, it’s too early to determine meaningful trends so we will continue to focus on our cost actions and cash generation which will put us in a great position for 2010 and beyond.  Let’s turn to our final slide, number 15. In summary, we executed against our major actions very well in the second quarter but markets remain challenging. We took initial actions which were necessary to provide support to our full year outlook. We have two facility closures remaining and both are on track to be completed in the third quarter. With headcount down 18% year-over-year we have taken aggressive action to ensure our cost structure reflects the market realities and with lower interest expenses and strong free cash flow generation, we are in good shape with respect to our balance sheet. Finally, we provided detail on our sequential sales and income assumptions so we expect more productivity in the coming quarter and we remain convinced that 2009 earnings while down substantially reflect improved cost position that will be leveraged when market returns to growth.  We’d now like to answer any questions you might have. Operator, please open the lines for questions.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from James Lucas – Janney Montgomery Scott.
James Lucas – Janney Montgomery Scott: First question, the costs taken out, the cash flow is a very good number, your controlling the controllables if you will and now with no major debt coming due for a little while now can you speak to priorities of capital allocation?
Randall J. Hogan, III : Jim, it really is the two Ds, it’s dividends and debt. I’m pleased with the cash flow that we’re generating and I’m pleased with the progress on costs and you said it aptly, we got control of the controllables but I still think there are too many uncertainties in the external markets to commit to anything bolder than that. 
James Lucas – Janney Montgomery Scott: So in terms of weighing share repurchases versus acquisitions it sounds like that’s on the back burner?
John L. Stauch : It is Jim and we want to continue to control our own destiny and we think right now the best way to do that is to keep the debt at manageable levels and continue to pay it down. When we get to a comfortable level either with more predictability around EBITDA and our ability to lower that debt position then, I think we’ll look opportunistically at the ideas that you’re suggesting. But, right now it’s focus on debt reduction and keeping destiny within our control.
James Lucas – Janney Montgomery Scott: Then switching gears, on the filtration side of the business could you perhaps give us a little bit more color on both Porous and Everpure and what you’re seeing in their end markets right now?
Randall J. Hogan, III : I’ll go with the food service first, no surprise that there’s a challenge in the food service industry in terms of new placement but, I think Everpure is doing well in viral and our partnerships with Ecolab and some of the other leaders. I think our position with winners in this environment, people like McDonalds is boding well. So, we’re down slightly but I think we’re actually gaining share. We’re also looking to extend that capability more deeply in to the hospitality area, also an area that’s challenged right now. But, given the focus on sustainable water solutions, higher energy efficiency and lower water usage, we’re having some very encouraging discussions with a number of the larger hotel chains.  So, that’s the Everpure and food service discussion, in terms of Porous Media we have a number of new initiatives, really I would say deepened initiatives particularly in power and oil and gas that are very, very encouraging. So that’s more of a flat business right now with our opportunities to penetrate more deeply in to power, oil and gas. Medical is actually is probably the slowest one of the segments that Porous Media is seeing right now.
James Lucas – Janney Montgomery Scott: Finally, with regards to the muni business, you talked about a few smaller stimulus projects that you won and updates to come in the future but could you talk about just your overall municipal strategy which has been evolving here over the last couple of years?
Randall J. Hogan, III : Sure. As you’ll recall Jim, municipal was not a target for growth in Pentair 10 years ago when we were really focused on water and that admittedly may have been more of an internal view but it was a business that basically is our Kansas City focus, Fairbanks-Morris plus some of our other larger engineered flow plants that serve that. But, it wasn’t making that much money, it was sub 10% ROS but thanks to lean and thanks to leadership in that unit and in engineered flow overall, we actually drove that up in to the teens. When they got there we said this is an area that one, given the super cycle investments expected in infrastructure and our ability to compete more effectively while making good money, we started to invest. So, we started to invest in global reach so we’ve had wins in the Middle East and we’ve had wins now in the Philippians and expect more wins in Asia and we’ve aggressively positioned to win whatever money gets spent in water from the stimulus package. We put out a white paper that you can get on our website and it shows about $15 billion of the stimulus money which will go directly in to the areas of water. Now, we mentioned that we won a few of those. There were three projects, they are waste water projects, in sum they’re less than $1 million. But, we have six more we’re bidding right now which will probably be over a couple of million so we expect to see this build. In fact, by February of next year much of that first tranche of money in to water should be let so we should have a very clear sense as the end of the year hits as to where some of the early larger opportunities will be from the stimulus money. So, we’re investing and working with our distributors to win more than our fair share. We actually happen to have the most by America footprint of anybody that serves this industry which we think is an advantage. This is an area, not just because of the stimulus, but because of the infrastructure super cycle we continue to want to invest in.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Hamzah Mazari – Credit Suisse.
Hamzah Mazari – Credit Suisse: Just a couple of questions, the first one is last conference call you guys said that at Q4 you expect sales declines of less than 20%. Is that thinking changed or is that still accurate? Can you give us a sense of how July is looking like for some of you major business lines?
Randall J. Hogan, III : In the fourth quarter we said 10% but that’s really a lapping because if you recall we were down 14% in the fourth quarter of ’08. So, we’re really not saying the fourth quarter is a better run rate of volume, it’s just an easier comp. 
John L. Stauch : If we just answer your second question around July, what we’re doing internally here is taking a look at July as it relates to April and May, year-over-year comparisons are usually the way we look at results. Right now we’re trying to take the best known period we have which is the April and May start to the quarter and all indications are that Q3 is starting out in those areas that Randy mentioned as being softer, are starting off better here in July than they did in April.
Randall J. Hogan, III : It’s tough to look at year-over-year comps. I mean in this month for example, around the 4th of July holiday we had a number of plants that went on furlough so that kind of makes compares really difficult. But, we believe that we’re going to deliver the $1.40 plus and we think our cost is going to be delivered to get there.
John L. Stauch : I think we all would agree, we need stabilization before we get recovery. I think we’ve said that our residential markets are stabilized. We knew there’d be incremental softness in commercial and industrial like the rest of the market is participating in. Europe feels more stable here in Q3 than it did in Q2 and the tech products end market feels more stable than it did in Q2.
Hamzah Mazari – Credit Suisse: Just bigger picture, your return on invested capital in your water business has been much below expectations because of end markets. What has to happen there for that to come back? Is it just residential coming back or are there other structural changes that need to happen in that business?
Randall J. Hogan, III : Well, we really need volume. We need to globalize all of the water businesses very aggressively but particularly the filtration businesses and the residential business and we need to drive volume. So, global volume and what I call product innovation volume are the keys to getting the ROIC back and we think we can.
John L. Stauch : We’ve taken a lot of action around the cost basis in water. Obviously, goodwill is a large component of the investment base in water and that’s where we need the growth and we need the incremental conversion on that growth which is one of the reasons we highlighted the sequential improvement, we need to see that type of year-over-year improvement as we get the revenue.
Hamzah Mazari – Credit Suisse: Just last question, is the higher priced inventory, how far are you along in working that off? Is that behind you now and how is pricing holding up in your business lines?
John L. Stauch : It’s flipping positive in July. We’ve been realizing the purchase price variance in Q2 in a favorable area, it gets hung up in inventory and now it’s coming off and starting in July we actually have positive variances on the balances as we ended the quarter of Q2.
Hamzah Mazari – Credit Suisse: Just on pricing, are you seeing any pressure there across your business lines?
Randall J. Hogan, III : If you look at the first quarter we were up 1.9 points and in the second quarter we’re up 1.4 so it’s moderating and as you recall, I think we said on the last call that we’re not expecting a of benefit from price but we’re not expecting to give up a lot of price either in the second half. Actually, ironically the firming up of some material markets supports that.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Shannon O’Callaghan – Barclays Capital.
Shannon O’Callaghan – Barclays Capital: A little follow up on the pricing question, you talk about this sequential net material benefit going in to 3Q, what do you expect for 4Q and is this something that flows in to next year or does it flatten out? How do you see it playing out?
John L. Stauch : Absolutely it gets better from Q3 to Q4 and it carries over at least until the first half of 2010. Then, just like any company we’ve got to go out and get incremental actions that improve it further. But, we’ve done all the right things, there has been a timing delay and when we’re recognizing it starting to roll out here substantially positive here in the second half you’ll see another first half benefit for sure in 2010 against 2009 first half.
Shannon O’Callaghan – Barclays Capital: So does it continue to be a sequential benefit like it is in 3Q?
John L. Stauch : Yes.
Shannon O’Callaghan – Barclays Capital: At about the same rate or does it moderate?
John L. Stauch : Probably slightly better.
Shannon O’Callaghan – Barclays Capital: Then can you fill out a little bit, you’re talking about pockets of improvement and North America residential pool a little better seasonally. Can you fill out, give a little color on what you are seeing get better and why you might be encouraged or hesitant?
Randall J. Hogan, III : In just looking at the North American residential market, as we look at what we saw in the second quarter, it looked like we were seeing end market demand so not a lot of distribution draw down. We saw additional distribution draw down in the first quarter and that seems to have, I wouldn’t say that they’re building inventory yet but, they certainly aren’t taking inventory out. Actually, in a couple of our businesses, as I mentioned, we had a better pool quarter than we had forecast. I think a couple of things drove that, one I believe our market position and our outstanding sales force has held us in good stead as well as our Eco-Select line of products.  Just as a reminder, Eco-Select is our line of environmental and energy sustainable products that we sell in pool. It includes a soft chlorinator, includes our [intella] flow high efficiency multi speed pump, it includes our [intella] touch controls, it includes our LED lights and that actually was 36% of our sales in the quarter. It was less than 30% not long ago so we think that’s share so we’re encouraged by that. We’re getting a lot more coverage, a lot more utilities are actually rebating those products so we think that’s encouraging. As well as, when we look at residential filtration in particular we’re starting to see I think, I hate the term green shoots, because they get over used but that’s in fact what we’re seeing. We’re seeing more activity, more opportunity there in North America residential and that is our single biggest market so we’re encouraged by that.
Shannon O’Callaghan – Barclays Capital: Just a last one, on tech products your modeling in a sequential bottom here, you mentioned some of the way the month flowed out in 2Q but datacom looks really tough, electrical obviously it was below your plan overall for the segment and the quarter, what gives you kind of confidence in the sequential bottoming out there? And, do you specifically see anything that encourages you there in terms of inventory destocking or anything else?
Randall J. Hogan, III : Well, the datacom was down over 50%, part of that was those are end of life programs so we have a good handle on those. We mentioned cooling was down 38%, cooling is nice margin, good business. They were particularly hurt in April and in May and their run rate improved and I think that’s going to help. Then, what we call the big H, the Hoffman Electrical business, we’re seeing better daily order run rate at the end of the quarter and that’s why we see it a little bit better, it’s still down year-over-year but still better.
John L. Stauch : Shannon just to put it in perspective, Q1was down around 27% , Q2 down 32%, Q3 down 27% so I don’t want anybody to suggest we’re thinking about a recovery we’re just thinking that Europe was abnormally soft in April and May for tech products as well in Europe and we’re just not seeing that repeat.
Shannon O’Callaghan – Barclays Capital: So the Europe thing did you guys ever sort of make sense of why it was so weak for two months? Does Europe actually look like it’s getting better now versus those months?
John L. Stauch : I would say it’s down at the rate that we would have expected and June was a decent order month, one month doesn’t make a trend. But, we head in to July with a little better backlog and a little bit more predictability in the market.
Randall J. Hogan, III : A little color, it was like Europe was going through what the US went through in an accelerated fashion so we saw distributors really clamp down particularly on the water side, just basically not an order as they adjusted to what they saw as the new reality there. Then, as that settled in, I think it just happened in two months instead of six, in the US it was about six.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Schneider – R. W. Baird.
Michael Schneider – R. W. Baird: Just continuing on the European theme, how much visibility do you have in to your customer plans for the third quarter? Obviously, August is a normal vacation or holiday period for them but do your customers intend or have you been able to discern if they intend to shut down for even greater extended holiday periods this year?
John L. Stauch : Well, I think that’s the question we’ll be looking at. I mean July could be strong, we could see August normal shutdown and then September could be one of those months where it doesn’t turn back on. I think in our numbers we’ve put a little contingency in for that dynamic. But, right now the orders and the customers we’re dealing with, especially in technical products aren’t relative to those shutdown types of patterns that we would see. On the water side we’re expecting a soft Q3 as well there, we’re just not expecting it to be down 40% which was April and May was for us.
Michael Schneider – R. W. Baird: Then just on the price question, per the charge it looks like you still had a fairly substantial amount, $16 million in price benefitting the quarter. Could you remind us just how that gets anniversaried from some of the price increases last year and what the comparable contribution looks like in the second half?
John L. Stauch : You’ll see Q3, as Randy mentioned, dropped down from our Q2 realization and then we tend to implement price increases in Q4 that begin to get realized the first of the year. So, being in the distribution business most of our distributors only like prices to be adjusted annually and most of those are dealt with in Q4. Just a little preview in the 2010, I don’t think we’re expecting a robust pricing environment as we head in to 2010.
Michael Schneider – R. W. Baird: Then on materials, a similar question, in the slides you indicate that you expect a $30 million benefit for the year but building on Shannon’s question, if there’s a $7 million benefit in Q3 it implies $63 million in Q4 so it’s more than a slight increase or is my math not correct?
John L. Stauch : Well, the big wild card in that number is mix Mike. The mix of our product lines is also netted in that negative number. If you think about it, you’ve got electronics versus electrical and tech products and then you’ve got the mix of municipal which is lower margin then what we have in residential. So, the number I was alluding to accelerating rapidly is the net year-over-year procurement savings which you can kind of see what it is in Q3, it’s at least double that on a procurement basis in Q4.
Michael Schneider – R. W. Baird: In the water business, Fairbanks-Morris has this record order, it is incredible how big it is relative to the size of Fairbanks-Morris. Now I guess two questions, one are there additional phases to this New Orleans project that come beyond 2011 that you’d be bidding on? Then secondly, meanwhile do you have the capacity in Kansas City to take on more stimulus projects and just how limited are you in the wake of the New Orleans order.
Randall J. Hogan, III : I’ll answer the second question, yes we will have the capacity. One of the reason we reorganized like we did was to have focused and engineered flow. We have more flexibility across plants when you think about our Aurora facility and our Ashland facility as well as our ability to contract out. The $65 million includes buying out diesels and we buy them in so there’s a fair buy in content there, their diesel drive. We look at the stimulus money and what we want to do is make sure that we don’t turn anything away because we can’t make it. Thanks to lean we have a lot of capacity in Fairbanks-Morris and thanks to bringing down the walls between the other engineered flow businesses we’ll have more flexibility in how we serve it. As for following on orders, for this particular plant I guess the answer would be know but for flood control projects I would say emphatically, follow on jobs, there are more, there’s a lot more. They even could be bigger.
John L. Stauch : There is a bigger one in New Orleans Mike that follows on to this one that is at least equal in size and we would like to be the winner of that one as well.
Michael Schneider – R. W. Baird: Then final question, just conceptually, water came in better than expected because of the residential and technical products maybe slightly lighter than expected. I noticed in the reconciliations for the slides it looks like you did raise your revenue forecast for water and trimmed your technical products but was that adjustment solely due to the second quarter or did you make a similar adjustment for the back half of the year between the segments?
John L. Stauch : The purpose of that was solely through Q2.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Deane Dray – FBR.
Deane Dray – FBR: To go back to the question on the North American residential water improvement, how much of this might have been from the joint venture with GE? And, how much of that is represented in the business today?
Randall J. Hogan, III : We did have a pickup year-over-year but we factored that out when we went from the 18% down to the 17% down, you’ve got to look at foreign exchange. We saw residential filtration down in the teens but not because of the joint venture. If we could separate it out, which is a little difficult to do, separate the volume from GE or the volume from legacy Pentair, they were down similarly. But, what we see is we see more activity in the channel, we see more activity among OEMs as well so that’s why we’re encouraged that it’s getting better. Frankly, I think we are more in touch than we were a year ago, we’re more in touch with the customers there.\
John L. Stauch : Then again Deane, it’s not rapidly getting better, it’s turning positive sequentially which is something we haven’t seen for three years. So, we’ve hit bottom and we’re getting a recovery off of the bottom.
Deane Dray – FBR: Is there any difference in the go to market strategy there? Do you think you’re taking share in residential?
Randall J. Hogan, III : I don’t think we are yet, I think we are in a position to and I look forward to seeing us do it.
Deane Dray – FBR: Then over on the pool side, you did not benefit from an early buy earlier this year so just give us a sense as to are you seeing what would be characterized as just in time orders, is there any more destocking, what’s the inventory in the channel look like today?
Randall J. Hogan, III : I’d say the visibility we have, I think the sales actually were in line with what we saw. I think in general there were a few that did a little bit better in the channel in the sales in the quarter. But, people are being really, really cautious. We can tell from the nature of the orders that we’re seeing more end market demand, they’re smaller orders with more variety on them and they’re more urgent which tells you that’s an end market order not a stocking order. I was encouraged that we got closer to what our business thought was their upside, we didn’t use that upside but we got closer to what they thought they could do. I think right now we’re being properly cautious as we look at the third quarter and the fourth quarter in our forecast as to what to expect from pool. We’re not expecting a return to past times, we’re expecting caution to hold.
Deane Dray – FBR: You commented in the past about the financing issue for customers who want pools but can’t get financing for that. How long do you think this lingers?
Randall J. Hogan, III : Well, until the banks decide, and we’ve been active in trying to get banks help some of our better, bigger pool builders and banks are really not stepping up to fund them. Really, the only pools that are getting now are the ones that can get built for cash. So, the market is probably about 90% replacement at this point, that’s my number not the businesses number but I don’t know how it could be any different.
Deane Dray – FBR: Just to clarify, on the New Orleans order, this does not get classified as any part of stimulus, this was all Army Corps of Engineers?
Randall J. Hogan, III : Yes, this is Corps of Engineers. Actually, the Army Corps of Engineers is going to have some stimulus money. This isn’t classified as a stimulus job, it’s classified as a flood control job for New Orleans.
Deane Dray – FBR: Then wasn’t there some orders right after Katrina that you got for flood control? Are these just follow on projects?
Randall J. Hogan, III : Actually, this is a cool project. What they’re doing is this is really a system that is going to basically pump water out of the flood control canals. So, it’s similar to the earlier project which was on the 17th Street canal which was actually a temporary measure, technically it’s temporary, it will be there 25 years from now I’m sure. But, the idea is a lot of the reason that the canals failed is because there was so much water in the canals the levies couldn’t handle it. So, once it’s pumped out of the low spots in to the flood control canals you’ve got to be able to get the water out of the flood control canals in to the Mississippi or in to the Pontchartrain. This is an enormous pump station to do that. These are 12 foot diameter pumps.
Deane Dray – FBR: How would you characterize the win? Did you win on specs, did you win on an efficiency comparison? What there anything innovative in design, was it price?
Randall J. Hogan, III : I think our competitors will tell you it’s price but I would tell you this, it was based on our performance, on prior programs so very high confidence from the end customer together with very solid technical solutions, so spec. I’d say we won on relationship and spec. I’m not unhappy with the margins.
Deane Dray – FBR: The first shipment is again?
Randall J. Hogan, III : Next year.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Michael Cox – Piper Jaffray & Co.
Michael Cox – Piper Jaffray & Co.: I was just curious, on the non-recurring benefits it looks like those went up in your projections by the same amount as your non-recurring charges? I was just wondering if you can give some color around what these benefits are and is it just a coincidence that they seem to offset the charges?
John L. Stauch : It’s not a coincidence it’s just simply one tax refund that we’re expecting from prior periods an consistent with our practices we would disclose that and call that a non-recurring benefit. The timing of it is hard to gage because a small piece of it is getting a re-audit related to an R&D tax piece of it. So, overall it’s one item and it’s about $10 million.
Michael Cox – Piper Jaffray & Co.: That will be called out separately? I assume that’s not in your guidance?
John L. Stauch : No it’s not and we would call it out separately and put it down there in the reported adjusted line.
Michael Cox – Piper Jaffray & Co.: On Slide Six where you go through the productivity improvements, let’s say for the sake of example that unit volumes next year rebound just as much as they were down this year so you’re sitting back where you were 2008 levels, how much of that $65 million maybe in percentage terms would be a permanent take out versus what would come back in a better unit volume environment.
Randall J. Hogan, III : God, I hope you’re right on that rebound. 
John L. Stauch : A lot of the benefit and changes in wages, a good chunk of that was volume related but also plant closing related. We would think that you would start with sales minus less material and you would get a contribution margin and we would not have to put in significant capacity to handle call it a 5% revenue growth. Now obviously, that depends on where it is but we should see some pretty good incremental margins which is call it 35% to 40%. We saw sequentially 40%, we’d like to have it be 40% but we would continue to try and invest in some sales and marketing R&D programs so let’s say 35% of whatever sales volume we have should drop through as incremental.
Michael Cox – Piper Jaffray & Co.: My last question is on the Asia Pacific region, it decelerated in the second quarter versus Q1. I know you commented a lot about Europe but can you talk a little bit about Asia Pacific? 
John L. Stauch : There are two things happening in Asia. First of all, I think stimulus money has come back in to the market quicker than we saw here in the states. I think it’s more focused so as we take a look at Q3 and Q4 I think we’re going to see a quicker recovery in some of the slowdown that happened. Also, just – I’ll take you inside baseball here but there were some valves that were being sold out of Asia in to Europe that are now being directly shipped from North America and Europe. It’s a temporary reset on our year-over-year performance in Asia.
Operator:  Your next question comes from [Mark Zepp].
[Mark Zepp]: On Slide Seven you cite $55 million of productivity carry over in to 2010. Is that a net number against any kind of near term cost actions that would be expected to flow back in to the P&L in 2010?
John L. Stauch : Yes, the reason I shared it this way on page seven is I do think it’s important to highlight the $20 million in furloughs and 401k as something we would not want to continue to realize the benefit from and so we would look at turning those programs on when the market recovers and that would be a particular headwind against those savings that we shared with you.
Randall J. Hogan, III : But $55 was permanent. 
[Mark Zepp]: Then just to reconcile the tech products comments, you have 3Q essentially a little bit better than 2Q but there’s a big spike in restructuring for 3Q. Is that just a lag affect in terms of timing or if the declines extended in to 2010 would we be looking at potentially more actions on the tech product side?
Randall J. Hogan, III : That particular action is an action we announced early Q3 related to a Minnesota factory we’re closing and consolidating in to our other Minnesota location so it’s a particular action. Clearly, we’ll continue to take a look at the cost basis in technical products as our other businesses and take the necessary actions if the markets don’t recovery. 
John L. Stauch : So technically speaking we’ve talked about 17 plants previously, we’ve now gone to 18 and we’ll have this plant closed by the end of the year as well.
[Mark Zepp]: The entire charge will be taken in the third quarter?
John L. Stauch : Correct.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer & Company.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer & Company: Looking at the datacom performance, I was just wondering in how core are you viewing that business these days and strategic?
Randall J. Hogan, III : It’s disappointing to see how much datacom went down. Its’ very lumpy in terms of demand but it’s one vertical market. The plant capacity is spongeable in terms of the vertical markets we aim it at so I think the real question is how can we stabilize datacom so it doesn’t have the lump effect it seems to have in our larger electronics vertical. As you may remember, we consolidated the organization in tech products at one leader. We’re making the plant, if you will, end market agnostic so we can leverage. Those of you who were on our tour a number of years ago in Reynosa Mexico saw very, very busy [inaudible] plants and not so busy electronics plants and now that’s over. We have all the plants managed under one operator so we can balance that volume better. So, I would say I think about datacom as a market segment that is less attractive than some of the other ones but it’s a vertical market that we can serve without it costing us a lot versus some of the others.  For instance, I’d like to do more OEM business in the industrial space which would be more of electrical. I think there’s going to be those opportunities, we’re seeing some of that in Europe right now, we’re seeing some of it in the US, we’re seeing some of it in water in Europe actually where folks are looking at their own foot print and saying I may exit that manufacturing and I’ll buy it. We’d like to be in a position to pick up some of that business so I’d rather do more of that and less datacom given the lumpiness of datacom.
Todd Gleason : We want to get everyone’s question, I just thought I’d ask since we’re running a little over how many more people there are in the queue.
Operator:  There are four more questioners in queue.
Todd Gleason : We’ll try to quickly go through them then.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Analyst for John Quealy – Canaccord Adams.
Analyst for John Quealy – Canaccord Adams: I think my questions have been answered, maybe if you can just provide an update on some of the longer term growth initiatives, kind of the traction you’re seeing with some of the newer energy related product lines?
Randall J. Hogan, III : Well, we talked about the energy related product lines in pool already. We’ve introduced a variable speed drive for the well pump market. We think that the variable speed drives applied in the HVAC setting is going to be outstanding on the commercial side. Our biggest opportunities are globalizing engineered flow and that would include serving RO and [inaudible] and really driving our hospitality initiative globally. Those are a couple that I’m quite excited about. Then water reuse which is we have a number of interesting products in water reuse. We haven’t yet, and nobody has, really developed water reuse as a business and I think we’ve got as good a shot at that than anybody and I have a lot of personal energy and excitement about that. We’ll talk more about that. We have our analyst meeting in September, it’s going to be in New York City. We hope to see you all there. We’ll share some of the exciting pieces of water reuse. And, I mentioned earlier power and petrochem in the industrial filtration area which is kind of exciting, some new products and new applications. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from Brian Drab – William Blair & Co.
Brian Drab – William Blair & Co.: I’ll just ask one question, when you look at the total targeted cost savings of $215 million, can you help us get a handle on maybe break these costs down in to temporary and permanent? Of course, you can make an argument that any costs could fall in to either one of those buckets but could you just attempt to break it down in to temporary and permanent cost savings? As you do that could you tell us how much in overhead you took out of the costs structure in closing down these plants.
John L. Stauch : To answer your question, if you look at page seven, we’ve highlighted two of what I would call the non-permanent actions which are the furloughs and 401ks. The other piece that is hard to quantify is how much the discretionary spending went away is permanent. Now, we’re going to do our best to make almost all of it permanent but we have cut travel, cut expenditures, certainly some of that will come back in some day when we grow but we’re going to do our best to manage that out.
Randall J. Hogan, III : I think we’ll be a lot more [inaudible] though. I think a lot of companies have found they didn’t need it and we are one.
John L. Stauch : Then, your final question is how much true overhead, if I look at just the leases, the rents, the utility costs, etc. it’s somewhere in the neighborhood of $10 to $15 million a year permanent cost gone because the rooftop is gone.
Brian Drab – William Blair & Co.: Maybe I’m missing something but when I add up on Slide Seven the $30 million, the $75 million, the $70 million is $175 million plus you just said another $10 to $15 million in overhead costs –
John L. Stauch : The rest is in the variable manufacturing bucket if you look on page six, we kind of highlighted that, and last quarter as well, and that’s things like freight distribution costs, volume related activities as well.
Operator:  Your final question comes from Scott Graham – Landenburg Thalmann.
Scott Graham – Landenburg Thalmann: Just two questions for you, Randy when you talk about and I guess this just may be a fifth way to skin the same cat but second quarter is seasonally better in water just by its nature so when you’re saying you kind of came out of the gates a little slow and then you kind of improved in June and that kind of thing are you essentially saying that yes, all three months together we essentially had a second quarter season sequentially from the first quarter or are you saying that maybe in June things were a little bit better than that? Just help me understand in the context of the second quarter being an in season quarter in water if you feel better about things or just kind of the same as you did a quarter ago?
Randall J. Hogan, III : April and May in water were really bad in Europe but we are off to a pretty as expected seasonality in US residential and that’s what really drives it. It’s usually residential flow and the pool business that drive the seasonality in the second quarter and that was about the kind of seasonality we expected. It’s still down year-over-year but the seasonality we expected. What happened was Europe popped up in June to being down like we expected so it was a run rate improvement from April, May to June but it was still down year-over-year.  We felt good about that because when we were looking at April and May we were deeply concerned about Europe. I would tell you I’m still very uncertain about Europe but as we said earlier in the call June was better and July seems to be more consistent with June than April and May so that’s encouraging. But, I’d say the uncertainty is still greater than confidence in my mind when it comes to Europe.
John L. Stauch : The only thing I would add is normal seasonality would include a normal pool season and we haven’t seen a normal pool season in some time. So, we’re not seeing any lift from Q1 to Q2 like we use to when the pool season hits it peak and therefore we’re not seeing the subsequent drop in to the Q2, Q3 and Q4 ranges like we use to.
Randall J. Hogan, III : We expected it to be higher first quarter to second quarter because I think as Deane mentioned earlier, we didn’t have as much early buy shipping in the first quarter ’09 as we had in ’08 so that decline year-over-year in pool was that much more dramatic. So, the step up from the first quarter in pool to the second quarter was bigger than the usual step up and that was more because of the comp in the first quarter than it was any major seasonality increase.
John L. Stauch : But, to summarize yes, Q1 and Q2 in water has seasonality but we’re reflecting that we think the markets are improving sequentially, we’re talking the seasonality out and saying the average daily order rate feels like it has bottomed in North American residential. It’s not getting significantly better but it’s no longer declining like it has for the last three years.
Scott Graham – Landenburg Thalmann: So that’s really the answer I think, your comment essentially considers the seasonality?
John L. Stauch : Yes.
Scott Graham – Landenburg Thalmann: Was the weak start to the quarter in Europe, did that prompt the additional restructuring charges or was that going to happen anyway?
John L. Stauch : It certainly feed in to it but it might have happened anyway. 
Scott Graham – Landenburg Thalmann: Last question is you’ve got this terrific order out of New Orleans and you’ve got the enviro now under your belt, how do we go out now and market these, particularly the big water win, how do we sort of stimulus market that? How do we get the enviro in to more end points, can you talk a little bit more about that?
Randall J. Hogan, III : Two separate points, enviro is actually not just McDonalds who likes it, Starbucks likes it, everybody likes it because it is very, very efficient, a RO system, it’s a superior solution. So, we have a very effective sales force in our food service division and they’re marketing it, you can see it online, we have all kinds of promotions that we’re working at. As I mentioned, we’re selling in to hospitality too because we think it’s going to be a major product for hotels. That’s one of our I’d say higher performing marketing groups anyways.  In terms of the promotion of a win like the New Orleans win, those are project and engineered based bids so what we’re doing there, and I commend if you haven’t looked at it on our website, you can see our white paper on the stimulus spending. We have a website where we’re working with our distributors more directly in talking to them about the specific money that is targeted to their service areas to make sure that we are bidding and quoting those projects and that they understand our position in terms of our buy America position which is very strong as well as our capabilities which that order affirms if you will.  The Corps of Engineers is always a good reference point. For history, about half the pumps in flood control in New Orleans have been made by Pentair company. That’s not a bluebird, that’s a market that we compete in quite effectively.
Scott Graham – Landenburg Thalmann: I guess what I’m asking here Randy and it sounds like I think you’re saying yes to this is that off of these wins and placements your guys are out there developing market plans or maybe they’ve already been developed and with these wins there, they’re kind of taking them –
Randall J. Hogan, III : Absolutely. We have not cut as deeply in R&D and in marketing and sales precisely so we can keep the pressure on to try and drive growth. I am not happy to have had to laid off the people we hired, it’s a terrible thing to have to do. So, I want to get volume, I want to put people back to work.

I will now hand the call over to Randy who will take you through Pentair's fourth quarter and full year 2008 results provide his perspective on the results of businesses and the market we serve and provide an overview on how we are driving to deliver results in 2009. Then John, will conclude our formal comments with additional information regarding 2008 financials and more color on our 2009 outlook. Randy?
Randy Hogan: Thanks Todd, and thank you all for your joining us today. Let's begin by reviewing our fourth quarter results shown on slide number 2. What started out as an uncertain economic environment quickly became a quarter mired in rapid market declines. Our original forecast did not predict this unprecedented decline, but when we understood the magnitude, we shared our observations, we set the bar and accelerated additional cost actions. Here are results. In the quarter we delivered reported earnings per share in continuing operations of $0.22 which includes non-recurring items predominately associated with the restructuring actions we announced earlier in Q4. We will discuss these items later in the call in more detail if you remove those items which is the basis of our guidance, we delivered $0.41 of EPS on an adjusted basis. The $0.41 is down 21% versus the $0.52 in the fourth quarter of 2007 and is at the mid-point of our $0.40 to $0.42 revised EPS guidance we provided in December. Pentair's fourth quarter sales of $768 million were 5% below the $807 million in sales we generated in Q4 2007. Fourth quarter sales in our Water segment were down 6% year-over-year. Declines in each GBU reflect the sudden and significant volume declines in global markets. In December we completed the sale of our Spa and Bath business which is reflected in discontinued operations in the press release. Until the first quarter, divestiture of our National Pool Tile business the sale of this non-core business allow us to fully focus our core businesses. Our Technical Products business declined 2% in the fourth quarter versus Q4 2007. This 2% decline is in start contrast of a 13% average growth rates we had experienced in the first three quarters of 2008. While we had initiated aggressive cost actions earlier in 2008, we are not able to offset the rapid volume declines in the quarter and our margins contracted 240 basis points for the total company. The positive 400 basis point benefit from price and productivity could not offset the negative 640 basis points impact from inflation, volumes, and foreign exchange. The negative $3 million expense related to the Residential Water Filtration integration with GE is netted in productivity. Relative to our adjusted EPS, our fourth quarter effective tax rate was 32%, reflecting the investments we have made position our global operations more optimally. In the fourth quarter we delivered $63 million of free cash flow, reduced year-over-year debt levels, yielded $3 million reduction in interest expense. And in the quarter, we bought back shares worth approximately $11.9 million. So, difficult environment, but as we will discuss today we continue to take aggressive cost actions. Now let's turn to slide number 3. As you can see what a difference the quarter here makes. During the third quarter of 2008 we recognized that global economy was slowing. We took additional actions to reduce our headcount and reduce our facility footprint. In October, when we reported third quarter 2008 earnings, we also slightly lowered our full year 2008 expectations to reflect a more cautious outlook. However, we did not forecast the magnitude and suddenness with the order and volume declines that are shown on this slide. As the slide shows our orders the red line on the graph were trending very positive in the first three quarters of 2008. In the fourth quarter our orders declined 14% year-over-year. The confluence of continued soft residential demand, tight credit restrictions and aggressive commercial and industrial distributor inventory reductions negatively impacted our order rates in the period. Since the majority of our businesses have short lead times, the immediate drop in orders translated into a drop in Q4 sales. As the data shows on the top right section of the slide. Sales on our Technical Products business were down 2% year-over-year comparative to the 13% growth we were experiencing through the first three quarters. And it is not hard to understand that we had to act quickly to further reduce our cost structure. Our water business also witnessed sales declines in the fourth quarter. But since we have a large residential exposure, sequential sales declines were less pronounced as those markets have been soft for some time as you know. As the slide highlights we sought sequentially more pronounced declines in both EMEA and in Asia were we had been growing over 20%. Which includes the benefit of foreign exchange, we declined the mid single digits in the fourth quarter. Of course you have all seen the headlines effectively every company has highlighted significant slowdowns in either October or November or December. Or perhaps all three.  For Pentair the declines were felt more severely in the later parts of the quarter. The speed and severity of the decline was stunning and precipitated our acceleration of cost actions. We show this material as a lead in to why and how Water and Technical Products businesses experienced a level of margin compression they do in the fourth quarter.  Certainly not every financial metric is a result of volume, so when the environment changes this quickly its hard to adjust production and forecasting fast enough. Let's take a look at how the sudden drop in sales and demand impacted our two businesses. Please turn to slide number, 4, which provides an overview of our Q4 Water results. Here are the highlights. On the top of the slide, you can see we provide our standard sales and operating income loss. We will refer to these as we describe the performance of the Water Group. Overall, Water sales were down $33 million to $509 million down 6% versus last year's sales and down 7% organically in local currencies. As you know, approximately 40% to 45% of our Water Group is exposed to residential markets. Those businesses continue to be down double-digit as further softness in US and European residential markets continues to impact our sales. In the quarter, we also saw softness in non-residential markets as well as slowing international market. Our Global Flow Technologies sales declined 5% growth in municipal and agriculture which was driven by new products as well as continued global expansion in our commercial organization, did not overcome, continued declines in residential flow. Global Filtration was down 2% in the fourth quarter versus last year as it benefits from the Pentair residential water filtration business combination, could not overcome soft, residential and commercial markets.  The Global Pool Equipment business was down 12% in the quarter as new pool builds remained very low. In fact, residential pool permits in the US were down another 50% year-over-year in major markets such as California, Florida and Arizona. As we will discuss in a few minutes, we remained very cautious regarding the pool markets. Internationally, sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa or EMEA were down mid-single digits as broad based declines in residential markets lowered volumes and offset growth in the Middle East. In Asia, Water sales were down 5%, the sales from China increased double-digits but could not overcome declines in Australia and New Zealand as residential and pool markets in those countries continued to contract. Let's shift gears and discuss the operating profit margins for our Water Group. On the top right you can see our year-over-year operating income loss for Water. Adjusted margins were 10.2% down 250 basis points year-over-year.  Inflation impacted Water margins by over 370 basis points and can not be overcome by productivity, price, and product mix. Our fourth quarter adjusted margins include the $3 million associated with the integration costs associated with the setting up Pentair Residential Filtration or as we call it PRF which is the combination with GE. As we announced in October and reiterated in December we are taking significant actions to rationalize our global footprint, reduce structure and invest in our best growth opportunities. We are executing well against these actions but they've yet to read out as volumes declined more dramatically than we had forecasted and many our cost reductions are not yet fully finalized. As we mentioned in the headlines in December we sold our Spa and Bath business, this better positions our pool equipment business to focus solely on its core which is serving residential and commercial distributors, pool builders and end customers with leading pool systems technologies. So, I believe we continue to take the right steps in a challenging environment. Now I will turn to slide number 5 and we will review Technical Products. As we discussed a few minutes ago orders on our Technical Products business dropped off materially in the fourth quarter. This lead to a short fall versus the guidance we provided in October of approximately $25 million which when coupled with high materials costs in the quarter drove margins down. Let's read some of the details. Year-over-year fourth quarter sales in Technical Products were down 2% or flat in local currencies. Our global electrical business grew slightly. Solid growth in our energy vertical market and a few commercial and industrial markets overcame softness in other verticals particularly automotive and machine tool. Our global electronic business declined 6% led by double digit declines in Asia-Pacific. European sales grew in local currencies. Looking at Technical Products margins the headlines is we declined 260 basis points year-over-year. Several factors impacted margins the most, the first was inflation, which you can see on the operating income loss on the top right section of the slide. In the quarter, we were expensing steel at around $850 to $900 a ton. Earlier in the year our steel expenses are around $550 to $650 a ton. The slowing sales and declining orders we moderated production levels in December which create a negative absorption which cancelled our positive productivity. Finally, we did take aggressive cost actions in the quarter the benefit of which we realized starting in 2009. So, we continue to take aggressive cost actions as expenses associated with materials come down in 2009 we will benefit from much greater productivity. Let's take a look at our full year results. And also please turn to slide number six. For the year totaled company sales were $3.35 billion. Year-over-year our sales were up 2% as 9% growth in Technical Products more than offset a 1% decline in our Water business. Total company full year 2008 margins declined 30 basis points as the items that impacted us the fourth quarter made a significant dent in our full year results. The aggressive actions we took in each quarter of 2008 as well as the lower tax rate, share count, and interest expense enabled us to deliver earnings per share of $2.20 on an adjusted basis, which was up 5% year-over-year. As we articulated on our third quarter earnings call our balance sheet remains healthy and our debt profile is very manageable. So, while we hit new record sales in earnings level we exit the year with more difficult and unpredictable end markets. But also a number of cost actions underway to improve our cost structure and protect margins. Let's turn to slide number 7 to review our full year 2008 sales and operating income loss. You can see the detail on the two walks on the slide. I'm not going to go through all the data as we just walk through our full year results. Instead, let me share some observations. Aside from our pool GBU, which declined 14%, sales grew for the full year in each of our other GBUs. Technical Products, led the way with 9% growth. Flow Technologies grew 2% as our non-residential businesses overall, had a good year. Filtration 7% growth was aided by the formation of Pentair Residential Filtration and our continued growth in food service, desalination, in Europe and Asia, geographically. While we are disappointed at our fourth quarters sales declines impacted the year so heavily, overall, we had a good year given only we are battling soft residential and pool markets, each quarter. We benefited from our pushing the new geographies and our growth in emerging markets of approximately 20% helped to broaden our global reach. Furthermore, new products such as our food service and [Enviro] filtration system and our AquaLine free filtration system have been embraced by customers and partners. On the margin side, you can see the detail in the walk on the top right of the slide. For the year, margins declined 30 basis points. We had negative impact from high commodity costs, foreign exchange, integration costs and expenses related to our factory shut downs and moves. We continued to invest in new systems to improve our infrastructure and also enable the formation of our GBUs. As we have discussed throughout the year, our aggressive cost actions helped expand year-to-date margins until the sudden declines in the fourth quarter. We have a number of cost actions underway and on track to provide significant benefits in 2009 and beyond.  Please go to slide number 8 and I will provide my perspective on 2008. This slide is divided into four quadrants financial results, key accomplishments, market observations and our perspective going forward. To the first three quarters of 2008 our financial results met or exceeded our quarterly targets. These results reflect the dedication and hard work of our 15,000 employees demand as in sales and their teams as they serve customers. And I thank them for that great service and performance. Declines in the fourth quarter significantly impacted our full year results however and we are taking aggressive actions to prepare for 2009. Our balance sheet remains healthy. By year end 2008 we have reduced our long term debt by over $100 million. We have secured credit facilities, very good fixed debt rates and ample free cash flows that satisfy our foreseeable needs. And for the 33rd consecutive year we increased our quarterly dividend which now stands at $0.18 per share. We have an opportunity to improve working capital in this contracting environment and this will be a key focus in 2009. Under key accomplishments we continue to drive growth in international markets specially in emerging regions. In 2006 Pentair sales were only 28% international. We improved that global balance at 32% in 2007. In 2008 thanks to our rapid growth in emerging regions, our international sales were 35%, this is great progress. We have already discussed how we improved our portfolio with the formation of Pentair Residential Filtration to sale of National Pool Tile and Spa and Bath all nice accomplishments in the year. It's difficult to shut down over 10 facilities in the year but we accomplished that task and we have another half dozen facilities underway. Much of the benefit will be recognized in 2009, this is an important long-term structural cost improvement we are undertaking. Remaining competitive with leading new products is extremely important as well. Pentair stepped up our efforts in this area and we made solid progress in 2008. I encourage you to review again our September 2008 Analyst Day presentation which is on our website. As we detail many of the new and exciting technologies and systems we are introducing to our market. At our Analyst Day, we also outlined our long-term strategy for growth, productivity and key initiatives. While the challenging economic environment has accelerated our cost actions, it has also reinforced the strategy we outlined in September. Our market observations likely mirror those many of our peer companies. It's a challenging market, it's very unpredictable and there is lots of moving parts right now. Markets in 2008 taught us, thinking you are being conservative doesn't necessarily mean you are being conservative. Residential markets were worst than our original expectations, and our original expectations were lower than most everybody else. Almost all global industrial and commercial market has slowed dramatically. There are a few bright spots, but the majority are in decline. It's not our place to predict the bottom, but it's clear it hasn't come yet. The good news is materials are also coming down, and then we like many others are taking swift cost reduction actions. We know what we can control, and that's our focus in 2009 and we will control it. So, going forward, we are driving labor, materials productivity and accelerating our G&A consolidation actions, which were always our focus for 2009. We have a significant focus on cash and are committed to driving inventory improvements and continuing to generate strong free cash flow. Cash will be used to pay our recently increased dividend and also reduce debt. At this time, that is our only plan for cash usage. Being realistic about the market headwinds we face and other challenges that may come our way in 2009 is also a key thing. This is why slide number 9 is important to review.  Before I turn it over to John, let’s take a quick look at some of our major actions heading into 2009 in more detail. The information and the data on this slide tell the story. The data shows we are reduced our headcount by 9% in the second half of 2008, savings from this we will read out in 2009. Additionally, we have announced actions to take our headcount down further to a total of 16% reductions versus the end of Q2 2008. And you can see it is both salaries and hourly workforce that has impacted, all in the savings will be $85 million. Related to the headcount reductions the number of facilities we are exiting, the total number of facilities closures between 2008 and 2009 is 17, with most of the production shifting the best cost regions. This is important not just because our volume declines warrant facility rationalization. But also because the formation of our GBU structure enables more consolidated manufacturing assembly and distribution. It will help us become more competitive and benefit our customers too.  And every GBUs driving for material savings, we have a tremendous opportunity to deliver bottom line improvements in this critical area, and I believe we can do better than the 2% to 3% shown here. It’s a good start and certainly an area we are counting on to deliver to the tune of $40 million. Now I will hand it over to John, who will provide additional details on our financials and also discuss our 2009 guidance in more detail. Then we will answer questions. John?
John Stauch: Thanks Randy. Please turn to slide number 10. we have been using this slide the last few quarters, so you can reconcile the GAAP to non-GAAP EPS results for 2008. Let’s review, on the top of the slide, we show our GAAP or reported EPS results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2008. As you can see we generated $2.59 for the full-year. This is up over 20% versus the $2.12 a full-year EPS in 2008. Moving down the slide, the middle section shows the major adjustments that brings us to our most comparable performance related earnings per share for the fourth quarter and full-year. The first adjustment is the $0.86 per share gain we recognized in the second quarter 2008 in the formation of Pentair residential filtration along with GE. The second item, which is the $0.14 charge also relates to a second quarter action when we settled the 1994 horizon legal case. You can see both items are in the full-year 2008 column as there was no impact in the fourth quarter. The final adjustment is the $0.33 of restructuring charges we took in 2008. We took $0.19 in the fourth quarter which is shown in the first column. We already taken $0.14 to the first three quarters of the year. Thus, the total three years is a $0.33 per share shown on the slide. As we will discuss in a few minutes by taking these $0.33 of restructuring actions, we will significantly improve our cost structure. These adjustments bring us to the $0.41 of EPS for Q4 and $2 of EPS for the full-year of 2008 or $2.20 for the full-year of 2008. The 2007 figures are on a continuing operations basis reflecting our sales both National Pool Tile as Spa and Bath in 2008. Those are reconciliation between reported and adjusted EPS for the quarter and full-year. Now, let's take a look at our balance sheet in cash flow metrics as we exit 2008. Please go to slide number 11.  The left half of the slide provides walk from net income to free cash flow for 2008 as well as an outlook for 2009. We will discuss our guidance for 2009 in a few minutes. But if you read in our press release we have maintained full-year 2009 EPS at $1.70 to $2, which was the same guidance we provided back in December. So, net income for 2009 reflects that guidance range.  Let me touch on some of the highlights in the cash flow walk. First, for 2008 we delivered $218 million of free cash flow before several discrete payments. This number was slightly below our targeted cash flow of $235 million. A portion is missed around $15 million it was related to the difference between planed and actual cash and our divested businesses of Spa and Bath and National Pool Tile as well as heavy plant integration cost in our residential filtration business.  In addition, we utilized around $50 million of working capital a bit more than planed as a dramatic slowdown caught us holding some inventory as well as some collections of receivables at the end of the year were delayed by customers.  Cash versus accrued taxes and lower capital spending helped close the gap. You can see that $280 million number in the middle section of the left hand side of the page. A portion of that cash flow generation was used to pay the Horizon legal settlement of $28 million. Further we used $18 million for severance payments associated with the restructuring. And finally we had an incremental $8 million of pension funding in 2008. So, that brings you to $164 million of free cash flow after these discrete items.  As we discussed, we are shutting down 17 facilities in 2008 and 2009. This is approximately 25% of Pentair's total plans. Since the majority of those factory shutdowns are well under way or in the final stages of completion, we were burdened with redundant inventory at a number of locations. This helped maintain customer service levels, in fact our on-time delivery and warranty metrics both improved modestly despite all of this moving parts.  We know working capital represents a significant opportunity for us in 2009 and we have a number of actions underway to deliver much improved performance in this key area. And while we missed our 2008 free cash flow goal of 100% conversion of net income, it comes on the heels of the year when we delivered over 130%. So, we have solid track record of free cash flow generation and we believe 2009 will be another solid year.  The bottom section on the left side of the chart shows how we deployed the free cash flow in 2008. We paid $67 million in dividends and we purchased $50 million of shares. We also paid down long-term debt by over $100 million. Our expectations for 2009 are shown in the two columns immediately next to the 2008 column. The columns tie to our low and high estimates for the year.  Our outlook demonstrates our commitment to approve working capital performance and our expectations around debt pay down, dividends and capital expenditures.  The right side of the slide provides detail associated with our debt and key ratios. Of note, we have $134 million of senior notes coming due in October of 2009. We have ample cash and credit to satisfy this note. You can also see our average debt is at about 5.13% which includes the 7.85% of senior note debt that we will retire in 2009.  So, we exit 2008 with a solid debt position, a healthy debt-to-capital ratio of 33.4%. Now, let’s review our 2009 outlook in more detail and our assumptions for the markets in which we participate.  Please turn to slide 12. On this slide, we show our key assumptions for 2009. The top one-third of the slide shows our financial expectations as it relates to our guidance range. The bottom two-thirds outlines our assumptions for the market environment as well as some of our expectation that have an impact to our EPS results. As the slide shows, our view of US residential markets remains cautious. With new home constructions down over 25% and we placed them flat to down slightly.  US non-residential markets have clearly softened. In an almost every case we see commercial and industrial demand down double-digits in 2009. Internationally, Europe continues to soften is expected to be down double-digits in both residential and non-residential demand. We see emerging markets such as the Middle-East and Asia providing some growth opportunities, but overall we are planning in those markets to slow compared to the recent period of rapid expansion.  So, we are expecting very difficult end markets in 2009 and we are taking cost actions to reflect these challenging times. Embedded in $1.70 to $2 EPS forecast are the following assumption. We expect a negative $0.05 EPS impacts on foreign exchange as the dollar continues to be strong in 2009 than the average 2008 rates.  We have a used $1.20 to the Euro for our planning assumptions. Both commodities and logistics are expected to experience deflation, which will benefit EPS in 2009 when compared to 2008. The largest commodity impacts for Pentair steel, resin and copper which all expect to be lower than average cost for 2008.  Our investment in sales and R&D remains focused and prioritized to high growth platforms as we continue to invest for long-term growth even in this downturn. Finally, we expect our tax rate will remain around 32% to 33% while lower debt levels and interest rates will benefit interest expenses by about $9 million versus 2008 or around $0.06 per share.  With negative pension asset returns in 2008 and a discount rate of 6.5% we expect a negative $0.02 per share impact from pension. So, our market assumptions reflect the challenging environment. However, we have taken aggressive cost actions to ensure we delivered the highest level of profitability in earnings in 2009 given the market situation. Now let's review our first quarter 2009 outlook. Please go to slide number 13.  We are forecasting sales declines of approximately 15% in the first quarter. We are forecasting [Technical Difficulty] to remain at or near December 2008 run rate levels. This is what we have seen so far in January and we believe distributors and dealers continue to manage inventories very aggressively. Credit is still difficult for distributors and dealers and financing products like water softeners and pools is less available to our customers. Additionally, difficult comparisons in our pool business in Q1 contribute to significant sales decline in our water business, which is expected to be down significantly in the first quarter. We expect sales in our technical products business will be down approximately 25% it's demand in commercial and industrial segment continuous to slow and distribution inventories are correcting.  Operating income and margins are expected to be down significantly in the first quarter as volume declines and drop through are at a high conversion rate. The benefits we will get from restructuring material depletion will not yet be realized in the first quarter, but we will begin to provide benefits sequentially throughout the year.  Our guidance for first quarter 2009 EPS has been n updated to reflect our outlook for $0.20 to $0.30 of earnings per share. The updated range reflect the additional cost actions because our ongoing efforts to curb production to maintain inventory and working capital levels.  We expect to continue to have 32% to 33% tax rate and interest expense will be lower by about $2 million versus a year ago quarter. Finally, as in the case in the first quarter each year, free cash flow is expected to be negative for the quarter. So, a challenging environment to start the year. However, as we look out to the year, we expect that off of this Q1 run rate, we will see some modest seasonality increases in water shipment as we normally do in Pool, Flow and the Asia Pacific region. As well as start to realize lower material cost as we burn off the negative factory variances on the balance sheet from Q4. In addition, we will continue to reduce salary and hourly headcount associated with the announced plant closures and begin to capitalize from the benefits of overall reduced operating expenses throughout Pentair. Now, let's summarize today's earnings review and then take questions. Please go to slide number 14. We are dealing with unprecedented levels of contraction in many of our end markets. Our fourth quarter 2008 results reflect this challenging time. So, we are taking aggressive actions to bolster our results and reflect the current economy. While we are disappointed that the very end of 2008 has such a negative impact to our earnings, we are proud of many of our key accomplishments, including improving our portfolio by divesting non-core businesses, and advancing our filtration strategy by forming a Pentair residential Filtration business with GE. We strengthen our balance sheet by lowering our debt levels and ensuring our credit facilities are in good shape. We took quick and aggressive action to improve our cost structure, shutting down 17 plants between 2008 and 2009, as well as reducing our overall headcount by greater than 15%. As we transition into 2009, we remain conscious that major markets globally will continue to be challenging. The tough start to the year reflects this caution as we forecast low sales in the first quarter, while still expensing higher costs associated with the materials and headcounts. So, we understand the current environment and are focused on improving your company to deliver the optimum results given the weak market outlook.  We would now like to answer any questions you might have. Operator, please open the lines for question, thank you.
Operator: Yes, sir. (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Michael Schneider of Robert W. Baird. Your line is open, sir.
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird:  Good morning guys.
Randy Hogan:  Good morning, Mike.
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Maybe first we can address the cost savings way down on slide nine, you layout the headcount reductions we are going to save your 85 million annually. I am just curious is that at the end of the year, what would you actually expect to realize in 2009 of the 85 or you said the number?
John Stauch: Well clearly the 85 is what we expect and so the 85 million reflects the 2009 benefit, Mike as it pertains to those headcount reductions.
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Okay, than still one in the 2010 would be roughly how much?
John Stauch: Probably, another $10 million to $15 million or so.
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Okay, so if you bare with me for a second and in an elevator right here, if you add up the savings on slide nine, you basically get to $145 million and your operating income assumption for the year at 350 is down call it $41 million. So, I am trying to understand if you take $41 million of decline in operating income and add back the $145 million in savings on slide nine, it looks like you are assuming decremental margins now on this 10% revenue decline of about 55%, which seems extremely sever given what’s going on even over the last quarter, and then certainly given your historical decremental margins. I am curious in that savings versus decline in operating income what I maybe missing or why 55% is the assumption for decremental margins?
John Stauch:  I don’t think you are missing it, Mike. The way we have put together the plan Randy and I and Mike Schrock as we laid it out and said, we got sales minus material and let's look at that variable contribution margin, and let's assume that's cost. And let's count on two forms of productivity and this is productivity, we can absolutely see, which is lower purchases and lower payroll. And let's put behind this the challenges capturing it by lien or capturing it by program, or initiatives and so we put together what we think is a tight plan that reflect sales minus material over our payroll reduction and our purchase reduction. And that's what we have guided people to and that's what we are reflecting here today.
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Okay.  
John Stauch: We did incremental savings, I mean I think we would feel that would also triple to the bottom-line.
Randy Hogan: We are not going to predict where the market goes. I mean we wanted volume. I talked before, if I try to put volume on the upside. Frankly, who knows where to start there, it would be uncertainty in the markets though. We are trying to stay focused totally on what we can control as John just described well.
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Okay and then just two questions also on your assumptions. So the material savings of $40 million, I believe there is about 3% on your raw material purchases, I just compared that to 2008 on slide seven you called out that inflation costs you $113 million? Are those two numbers comparable?
Randy Hogan: That's total inflation.
John Stauch: That includes labor increases and material increases. For a simplistic view though, Mike, you can do 50-50 roughly.
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Okay, so the material savings you expect to get in '09 don't even fully reverse or undo the inflation you experienced the materials in 2008?
Randy Hogan: That's correct.
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Okay. How do you arrive at the 3% number when we have got steel down massively, we have got copper down massively, I am just curious how you arrive at the 3%.
John Stauch: We planned that closer to 2, Mike, and two things that factor into that, one is, we did a price lock last year in steel, in technical products which gave us a little lift in Q1 or we are buying below market rates. We crossover in technical products, sometime late Q1 or early Q2 the material savings. 
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Okay.
John Stauch: So, it’s really taking the percentage change and only counting on about three quarters or a little bit more than 2.5 quarters of benefit. I think you would agree, we have to rollout the variances from our balance sheet. And the new productivity and new purchases are little bit delayed as you have to build the inventory ship the inventory then you recover them.
Randy Hogan: We didn’t have so much inventory wouldn’t take so long.
John Stauch: That’s fair, Randy 
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: And the flip side of that is the pricing assumption, you have got revenue down 10%. What amount of pricing have you baked in there?
Randy Hogan: We roughly are looking at around flattish price and the only price that we counted on as price that’s contractually in. If we took that, we would be looking at about 1.5% to 2% up, Mike, and then we are counting on probably between now and in the end of the year having to get some back.
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Okay. Alright, thanks again guys.
Randy Hogan: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Potter of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open sir.
Alex Potter - Piper Jaffray: Thanks. I was just wondering if you could comment first of all on foodservice, it seems in the release today that foodservice was down and I was wondering at least at the Analyst Day presentation its seem like very impressive presentation and that it seems like there was a lot of energy savings and water savings benefit they call on for this kind of all total solution approached to food service offering. I was wondering why that's not attractive in the current economic environment?
Randy Hogan:  It was actually down low single-digits in the fourth quarter which was the first time it's been down in ages. We love our products, we love our market position but you can't deny what's happening. If you look at the three different segments in food service the faster the medium priced sit down in the high end, you can read about how they are struggling. There is few at the low end that are doing well and we will do well with them.  And our globalization is going well but you can’t deny what's happening with the other restaurants chains. With that said, I like our competitive position as I like our new products. What we have done with that team is we have broadened the focus from being just food service to being food service in the hospitality. So, we are actually cutting deals for broad-based supply agreements with some of the larger hospitality companies, which I think are going to be the source of growth for us. But even with all of that we are not assuming that we can do much more than gain share because you can't deny what's happening in the restaurant industry.
Alex Potter - Piper Jaffray:  Okay. Fair enough. That’s good to hear that it wasn’t down double-digit or something. Okay. And then also if we could just switch gears to residential flow. I was wondering what it's going to take for residential flow to turn around. I mean it's basically just going to stronger housing is that the story?
Randy Hogan:  Basically that’s the key. We kind of a mix bag in the fourth quarter, the pro channel in residential flow was down a lot which was inventory being adjusted, actually retail was strong because there was some early flooding in winter as they came up, so actually retail came up. So, the key is going to be housing. That said most economists think that housing is going to be the key to the whole turn in the industry. So, I believe that's true, the fundamentals say that should be true, question is when? There is a lot of water yet to go under the bridge before I will see the residential market turning. So, what we are doing is we are focusing on getting our cost structure right. Getting our channel strengthened. And being there so when the market comes back, that's both in residential flow and in residential [features]. So that's really what we are talking about.
Alex Potter - Piper Jaffray: Great. And then I guess on the topic of trying to get things when the economy turned around. My last question here is, there is obviously you made clear that you are just going to be focusing on things that you can control and things you can predict. There is a lot of uncertainty right now in terms of the stimulus package. But we are just wondering how you see Pentair as being positioned to benefit if and when something eventually doesn't pass the congress?  
Randy Hogan:   I don't know where it is today. But that has been targeted some $45 billion to $50 billion to go to water. We through industry associations are engaged with understanding that. We have a team set up to track those things to make sure that we get our bids in. And I think we can win more than our fair share. We are the most US centric supplier for that equipment. If it goes into waste water plans or goes into water supply plants anything that requires pumps or filtration equipment. I think we will do fine. I am hopeful that there will be a lot of that. I am also not building my plan based on it.
Alex Potter - Piper Jaffray: Okay, great. That's all I have got thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer. Your line is open, sir. 
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Thanks, good afternoon. 
Randy Hogan: Hi Chris. 
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer:   On your slide 12 of the different vertical markets, it looks like the US raise your replacement flat-to-down. One of the more optimistic forecast among the different verticals could you go into what’s behind that at all?  
Randy Hogan: Well residential replacement if you think about our business whether, this is water right we don’t have residential and tech products. Basically, if your some pump breaks in the basement and you have lot of water in the basement it doesn’t matter if you have a jug or not have a jug, you can go get a new pump. If you need a well pump, you are going to get a well pump, that’s what the replacement market is. Even on the Pool side, when we talk to people in the channel, people pumps break on their pool; they are still going to replace it. So, it's fundamental how people operate and it’s true with filter too. The filter system breaks that generally it will replace it. The only reason it's not up, it’s typically is all based on price, but we are going for price and we are expecting some inventory drawdown in the channel. 
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: So, I guess what are going to do this year and it sounds like you don’t really project any remodel impact in it?
Randy Hogan: It was flat and flow actually in the fourth quarter was a little up, the flooding related business we would call that replacement that goes into the replacement category. One is, flooding and people run out by pumps. 
John Stauch: Retail has been at low inventory levels for sometime and it does go to the retail channel as well.  
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Okay and then on Mike’s comments dissecting the earnings guidance teasing out decremental, etcetera. It sounded like part of the reasons for the build up was the fact that you simply know exactly what the volumes trends will be throughout the year. Is the EPS range sensitized to more dramatic volumes or above the narrow range that's kind of referenced?
John Stauch: I think the better way to think about it, Chris, is that we are taking a look at it sequentially, right. So if you take a look at Q4 and you are brining into Q1. We would assume that things don’t get better than somewhat we have seen in December and January. That we continue to see the inventory corrections in the channels and that we continue to see some cautious views as far as taking product either for capital reasons or just through the distribution channels. If you then take that sequentially and you go forward, the question is what happens and what we do about the seasonality that we usually get. And we usually do get some seasonality of Pool, it's always a Pool season. Just a matter of how we get in.  
Randy Hogan: Always has been.
John Stauch:   Always has been. We are hopeful it happens again. And then we tend to see seasonality in Q2 both in technical products and also across the Water businesses especially in Europe this is more [shippable days]. That will be a good gauge as to where the year is going to play out. And I think as we started to exit Q2 we are going to get a clearer picture with the back half of the year.  So, I would say that we feel we have got tons of cost actions that put us squarely in that range. And we control those and that’s what Randy was talking about and that’s what we are focused on here. We are probably going to go after more labor than even what we have got identified. We want to make sure that we are utilizing the full options in our plans as most of businesses have to not build inventory and to manage the cash position. We got some room in interest as we continue to pay down the debt. And then we will give an update kind of where we are again in Q2. So, those markets are the uncertainty right now, we can't predict.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: And then just lastly. The first quarter margin impacts obviously a lot of different things seems like significant under absorption. First we expect to see inventories come down a lot and second what's kind of netted out for some restructuring benefits in that quarter and what's the exit run rate I'm guessing $25 million in the fourth quarter?
John Stauch: I am trying to get, I am sorry. I guess the quarter you are referring to.
Randy Hogan: You talked about the end of the year.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer:  Yeah, just tell me the impact on margins in the first quarter from under absorption and what you might get with those inventory levels?
John Stauch: When we exited Q4 directionally we had about $13 million to $15 million of factory variances on the balance sheet that need to be respond in Q1 and that's reflected in our number. So, the easier way to say that not take into accounting exercise the first $13 million to $15 million of inventory burn doesn't get you the new pricing. Right so the material that better than that and purchase better doesn't get experience until we work through that and that's what you are seeing in Q1. That will all be gone by the end of Q1 and then you start to see sequentially better than that, so, that's a minimum.
Randy Hogan: Right. One of the other things is we have taken production levels down we believe in the first quarter that will help keep from passing more brains through to the next quarter we are trying to get production levels down, so we don't keep just passing this forward, right. That's in the quarter.
John Stauch: That's obviously pretty good as well, Chris.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Okay. Thanks for the help. 
Randy Hogan: Thank you. 
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Brian Drab of William Blair. Your line is open, sir.
Brian Drab - William Blair & Company:  Good morning. 
Randy Hogan: Good morning Brian. 
Brian Drab - William Blair & Company: Just looking at your top line growth assumptions for 2009 looks I should say top line decline assumption negative 8% to negative 10%. Trying to get a better feel for the break down there, I know you have already threw the answer to one question so that you expect price to be flat. And then, did I hear correctly, that for your FX you are assuming an exchange rate of $1.20.
Randy Hogan: Roughly. For the euro.
John Stauch: Dollar to euro.
Brian Drab - William Blair & Company: For the euro. And what would you expect the impact to be on the top line, given that assumption?
John Stauch: Its going to be about $20 million to $30 million roughly.
Brian Drab - William Blair & Company: $20 million to $30 million for the year?
John Stauch: Yes. I would call it $30 million.
Brian Drab - William Blair & Company: Okay. So, just one percentage point, what you'd expect?
John Stauch: Yes. We're going on different ways here, right? So, you got the Canadian dollar, you have the US dollar. But we built a plan, dollar, euro is most meaningful to us. Right now, its about 27 today when I looked last. We built offline in about 20. So, I think we got a little cushion before we would see that impact. But you have also got the Canadian currency, you have got the Australian dollar, all of these move forward. So, I'm calling about $30 million make sure about a point of revenue reduction related to currency.
Brian Drab - William Blair & Company: Okay. Then on, I guess I have not taken into account all the other currencies as much as I should, but I would have expected that that would have been, it would have been a much bigger impact. But year-over-year in 2008, the exchange rate was favorable to you by about 3%?
John Stauch: No. If you go with me, you could do the math just to reverse that. If you go to Randy's slide, where he talked about full year Pentair performance on page 7, you could see the impact of the currency was $51 million favorable.
Brian Drab - William Blair & Company: Okay.
John Stauch:  Okay.
John Stauch: On the revenue side?
Brian Drab - William Blair & Company: Yeah.
John Stauch: You can do kind of calculation there, it rounds to two points but nothing and so if you take a look at where it is this year, most of Q4 was less than $1.30 to the euro we have experienced in, in the first part of the year, okay.
Brian Drab - William Blair & Company: Okay, sounds good so in terms of volume when your, I guess if you could say that you are expecting to be down in the high single digit range and also. And then one last question could you give us a break down of volume and price for the segments for the most recent quarter here in Water and in Technical Products?
John Stauch: That's on the chart as well.
Brian Drab - William Blair & Company: I think you just have total growth with no break down.
Randy Hogan: Right.
John Stauch: The price in Water about 2%.
Brian Drab - William Blair & Company: Okay.
John Stauch: And probably Technical Products is about 2% to 2.5%. And just one point of clarification just to make sure you have it right Brian. You think price in 2009 are zero. That basically, just that you know means that we give up price in 2009 because the tail end of our price actions for 2008 would naturally give us about 1.5 of price in 2009 with well tell us if its right you are getting the same.
Brian Drab - William Blair & Company: Yeah.
John Stauch: Yeah.
Brian Drab - William Blair & Company: Okay.
John Stauch: So let's take data that we basically have some price erosion naturally happening.
Brian Drab - William Blair & Company: Okay thank you very much.
Todd Gleason: How many more do we have in the queue because I think we have 5 minutes left. 
Operator: Yeah, few more in queue.
Todd Gleason: Okay let’s go ahead finish them.
Operator: Okay. And your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham of Landenburg, your line is open.
Scott Graham - Landenburg Thalmann: Good afternoon.
John Stauch: Hey, Scott.
Scott Graham - Landenburg Thalmann: There are several questions for you on when you do your walk through on the operating margin by segment, can you guys explain how operating income has green growth graph boxes to them when we have.
Randy Hogan: I got to answer this.
John Stauch: Yeah, bet. You got to answer this one, go ahead Randy?
Randy Hogan:  Right. When they gave me the chart, I had the same question. Basically, our volume is down, but price was positive. Price has a 100% margin, so that's how that works. So the growth on the op income side, growth includes the acquisition, it includes volume growth and it includes price, so that's how it works.
John Stauch: If I do the math, you said 40 percentage on the conversion of the downward side of volume, and then you add back the price component 100% as Randy said, that's how you get small positive for growth.
Scott Graham - Landenburg Thalmann: That was pretty good conversion. Next couple of questions are, any chance you guys can give us an idea what the restructuring charge assumptions are as we roll through 2009?
John Stauch: Yeah. Right now we have taken some sizable actions in the tail end of 2008. And so everything that you are seeing today encompassed in the slide has been taken and accrued for as we exited 2008.
Randy Hogan: So Scott, our outlook for 2009 is that we are only now going to be doing the pay as you go expenses, which is $1.70 to $2, so as we move assets and other things that we are just now, we call that pay as you go, we are not going to charge that off.
Scott Graham - Landenburg Thalmann: Okay, so when you say in your press release that the heightened restructuring activity in the first quarter, back to pay as you go. Those are not charges?
John Stauch: Correct, things like scrap, its negative efficiencies on moving it from one plant to another, it’s a physical relocation cost of the capital expensing and its consulting contracts related to ERP migrations et cetera.
Scott Graham - Landenburg Thalmann: Here is one for the, maybe the longer term which will be nice to talk about converse at the current environment, you guys have some very healthy expectations to grow out to size of your addressable markets and here we have, this 15% reduction in employee headcount and 17 factories to be closed which I think is up from my 12 or 13 from when we last checked in with you guys and that's great for the current environment because that obviously gets us closer to $150 million savings number versus where you have previously so. But the flip side of course is that in 2010 and hopefully maybe even later this year, when we really want to drive, look to drive the organic through the addressable market strategies. How does that impact us, I mean, how does that impact that strategy and I think just as importantly if volume does improve late in the year, how does the so many closures there are taking place right now, which are probably easier to do on volume declines. How does that, does that dynamic change does that put you in some jeopardy manufacturing wise and does that slow the addressable market strategy.
Randy Hogan: Yeah, let me take that and John you can add to if you want to. First, while we have not talked about the 17 plants they were always in our plan. We through acquisitions we have assembled some nice businesses. But we always had too much structure and it’s always been we have too many, we have had too many plants. So the 17 plants were always on the agenda. What we done is we pulled them in, in particular our Sheboygan and our Cypress factories. We pulled in because of the near-term reality where volumes were. So, we always wanted to reduce our structure and continue to grow in particularly in best cost country and in growing country. So for example, we are increasing our capacity. Right now, we are investing to increase our capacity in our cold line vessels for ROD sale, because we know that's the growth market. We are still investing there, we are still investing in China, we are still investing in our Middle East. So, it's hard on the one hand be taking cost down some places, while you are adding in other places, but we are trying to remain disciplined on that. The second point I would make is, we are on the journey to really become a great company lean creates capacity. Also our cost structure is such that we are not huge capital compared a lot of industries, so we can ramp volume just by adding back overtime, adding back temporaries and adding shifts. So from the production standpoint, we can ramp up pretty well. I would say after we are done with this, we can still probably going 15% without really a lot of capital. There maybe some bottlenecks in a like, but I think that we will be okay from that capacity. Then there is engineering, we haven't cutback engineering that much. We in fact, I would like to get back to continuing to invest in engineering. So that's how we are thinking about it. Mike and John and I and the presidents are committed to being in a position to grow when it ends. And I hope you are right, I hope we actually can talk about growth by the end of '09. That's how we were planning on them.
Scott Graham - Landenburg Thalmann: And there is nothing that you feel Randy that you have done here that will impact these addressable market strategies. You are still incrementally adding some people in feet on the ground kind of thing in the markets that you think are the markets that you should be in?
Randy Hogan: Yes. Now not in the states, not in Western Europe, and we are not adding feet on the street there. But we know we are keeping our investments in China and keeping our investments in India, even in technical products which has gotten lagged and downturn, we are still investing and building a plant in India right now. So I am committed to grow again, but what we have to do is persevere through this.
John Stauch: And Scott, just to dive a little deeper here, if you could recall, and look at our analyst presentation, I mean our G&A is heavy. So a lot of the numbers you are talking about here in G&A they are not in sales and marketing. And in fact, we are very careful as we peal back the onion and looked at the headcount reductions. We went lighter in sales and marketing and lot heavy in the G&A. And then a lot of the one-for-one reduction and the factories are falling out. And what you are seeing here is also netted investment in Reynosa, which is a best cost country production facility for us as well as Suzhou. If you look at the capacity levels of both those plants right now, there is still excess capacity.
Randy Hogan: Well we created more of that, where we sold Spa and Bath. Spa and Bath coming out of a factory and free up space for us.
John Stauch: But I want to add by saying it's a great question, and that's what we are looking as an executive team. And as we continue to look further out and the economy continues to be challenged further out, those are the types of questions we are asking ourselves.
Randy Hogan: And I really look forward to proving that we can do this. That’s going to be a lot of fun.
Scott Graham - Landenburg Thalmann: You sound like you have a lot of confidence on the course side, and I think in this environment that's good enough for me. So, thank you.
John Stauch: Alright, thank you. Anita, if there's no more questions.
Randy Hogan: Is there one more?
John Stauch: Is there one more?
Operator: Sir, there is one more if you have time?
Randy Hogan: We will take that one. 
John Stauch: We will take it.
Operator: Very good. That question comes from the line of John Quealy of Canaccord Adams. Your line is open, sir.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Adams: Yeah, thanks it’s actually Chip Moore for John. Follow-up on that last question a little bit, if you can provide me with some little more color on our export markets. Obviously that's held up relatively well versus the US recent quarters. Just maybe you can talk about the visibility you have there, particularly the Middle East, China, etcetera.
John Stauch: Yeah. When you look at the Middle East, actually Middle East, we serve residential in the Middle East, residential is down in the Middle East. So to give you a sense of the fact that residential is a global phenomenon, and it's even slower in Asia than we would like, as we are a big player in residential. But commercial and municipal, municipal is ruling strong actually for us in terms of backlogs and order rates. We haven't really seen anything flagged there yet. In fact, we have opened up a whole area in Australia, the Philippine and where we are actually bidding municipal jobs for the first time, and we are very hopeful that that will be a positive. Now these are small numbers, they are ones and two bids. But it begins that way right? So municipal, we haven't seen any weakness yet. Commercial, the shipments are good, we are seeing order rates coming up even in Middle East still up at year-over-year, but not at the same rate. So, we are seeing some deceleration, if you will, in Middle East on the commercial side. But then again, we still have a lot of share to get. I still, I am very pleased with the performance of our team in the Middle East. They have done an incredible job of growing from pretty much being nothing to being 2%, 3% of the company now. And then in China, still growing, but at a little slower rate.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Adams: Okay. And I know you talked about municipal there abroad, may be domestically, are you hearing anything, or see anything from distributors.
Randy Hogan: We exited the year with highest municipal backlog we ever had.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Adams: Okay.
Randy Hogan: But what we are doing in our planning, we are assuming that some of this stuff is going to move out. The amount maybe some of it gets accelerated with if the money goes to the right place and the Stimulus Package, but we are assuming that some of these including some of the commercial projects may move out on us, or get out, right cancelled, so we are cautious. Even through we look at the backlog and we are not saying that.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Adams: Okay, great. Thanks.
Randy Hogan: Alright, thank you.
John Stauch: Thank you. Anita, is there anyone else in the queue?
Operator: No, sir. 
John Stauch: I don't want to jump in any conclusions again. Well, I guess we are going to go ahead and conclude if you want to give the replay information that would be great. Thank you for your time, everybody.
Operator: Yes, sir. And the replay of today's conference will be available starting two hours. To access the replay dial 1800-642-1687, and when prompted use the conference ID number from today, which was 80028855. Again, the telephone number for the replay is 1800-642-1687 and today's conference ID number was 80028855. Thank you ladies and gentlemen; this does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect your line.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Meg, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Pentair Third Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. And Mr. Gleason, you may begin your call now.
Todd Gleason - Vice President, Investor Relations: Thanks Meg and welcome to Pentair's third quarter earnings release conference call. We're glad you could join us. I'm Todd Gleason, Vice President of Investor Relations and Business Analysis and Planning. With me today is Randy Hogan, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and John Stauch, our Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, we will provide details on our third quarter results, as well as discuss our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2008. We will also discuss how we're approaching our outlook for 2009. Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company's anticipated financial results, are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as the risks outlined in Pentair's 10-K as of December 31st, 2007, and Pentair news releases. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today, and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results. Today's webcast is accompanied by presentation which can be found in the financial information section of Pentair's website at Pentair... excuse, www.pentair.com. We will reference these slides throughout our prepared remarks. Any references to non-GAAP financials are reconciled in the appendix of the presentation. We would also like to point out that all financial results and references are year-over-year numbers in today's call and presentation are on a continuing operations basis, unless otherwise noted or highlighted. As is our custom, we will reserve time for questions and answer... answers after our prepared remarks. I will now hand it over to Randy, who will take you through Pentair's third quarter results and highlights. Then John will discuss our fourth quarter and full year guidance. And finally, Randy will wrap up by outlining our early view on 2009 and actions we are taking to drive results. Randy?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks Todd and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Let's begin by reviewing our third quarter results shown on slide number 2. The headline is, we had performance in the third quarter. In the quarter, we delivered reported earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.42 which includes non-recurring items predominantly associated with the restructuring actions we announced in July. We'll discuss these items later in more detail. If we remove those items, which get us to the basis of our guidance, we delivered $0.55 of EPS on an adjusted basis. The $0.55 is up to 2% versus the $0.54 in the third quarter of 2007. The $0.55 also bested the high end of our 51 to $0.53 EPS guidance by $0.02 per share. While the economic environment continued to be challenging, sales and operating margins in our Water Group slightly exceeded the expectations we set in July, which enabled us to deliver higher adjusted earnings per share. It also reminds you that our adjusted earnings per share of $0.55 don't include approximately $6 million of expenses related to the integration of our residential water filtration business with General Electric's residential water filtration business. Pentair third quarter sales of $864 million were 5% above the $821 million in sales we generated in Q3 2007. Our organic growth was up 3% in the quarter and up 1% in local currencies. Third quarter sales in our Water segment were up 4% year-over-year. We continue to overcome difficult residential and Pool related end markets with global growth, new products and new vertical market penetrations. Our Technical Products business grew 8% in the third quarter versus Q3 2007, in line with the guidance we provided in July. As the slide shows, margins contracted 100 basis points for the total company. The positive 400 basis point benefit from price and productivity could not offset the negative 500 basis points impact from inflation, foreign exchange and product mix. The negative $6 million expense related to the residential water filtration integration is netted in productivity. Relative to our adjusted EPS, our third quarter effective tax rate was 33%, reflecting the investment we have made to position our global operations more optimally. The 33% rate is the rate we expect for the full year. In the quarter, we bought back shares worth approximately $15.7 million. We have approximately $12 million remaining on our authorization which we expect to fully utilize in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect to deliver full year free cash flow above adjusted net income. In the third quarter, we delivered $70 million of free cash flow, excluding the $23 million net settlement for the Horizon litigation. year-to-date, we have generated a positive $128 million. So those are the Pentair's overall highlights for the third quarter. Now let's turn to slide number 3. Taking back to when we provided third quarter guidance, the world seems like a very different place. Turmoil had yet hit the stock market and the credit markets were still actively humming along. And over the end markets Pentair has been dealing with have been choppy for sometime, especially residential and commercial markets. So while we did have to navigate some new negative forces in the market and proactively manage more uncertainty, we delivered a very solid quarter. As this slide highlights, the guidance we suggested in July had sales between $845 million and $855 million, adjusted operating income between $92 million and $96 million and adjusted EPS in the range of $0.51 to $0.53. Actual sales exceeded the guidance range coming at $864 million. Adjusted operating income also surpassed the range of $99 million, which was nice OI conversion on the additional sales. Adjusted EPS of $0.55 was $0.02 higher than the top end of our range and is a reflection of the additional operating income we just mentioned. It's pretty straightforward. The diversity of our portfolio has been an asset all year. This quarter proved once again that global balance and end-market diversity pays dividends when environments become less predictable. We certainly look forward to residential markets improving someday. But we have yet to see positive trends beyond some moderating declines in a few of the residential markets. I think it's also a testament to our organization that we continue to proactively go after our cost structure and internal opportunities rather than just react after markets deteriorate. I'd like to thank all our employees for that commitment. Now, please turn to slide number 4. And we'll review our third quarter performance in more detail. Starting with Water. Since we're going to cover a fair amount of information today, this is one of our standard slides. I'll just hit some of the highlights. On the top of the slide, you can see we provide our standard sales and operating income walks. We'll refer to these as we describe the performance of the Water Group. Overall, Water sales were up $20 million to $566 million, up 4% versus last year sales and flat organically. As you know, approximately 40% to 45% of our Water Group is exposed to residential markets. Those businesses continue to be down double digits as softness in the U.S. and European residential markets continue to impact our sales. Most of our other major markets continue to grow nicely as we have invested to grow in emerging regions and non-residential vertical markets. Our Global Flow Technologies business grew 7% as commercial, municipal and agriculture, each had nice growth. We continue to expand into new international markets which will enable our commercial flow segment to drive strong double-digit growth in spite of the U.S. slowdown. The new products for our agricultural pump markets around spraying and crop protection have positioned this business for a sustainable growth. Global filtration was up 10% in the third quarter versus last year as the group benefited from the newly created Pentair residential water filtration business venture with GE. Excluding the sales related to this combination, filtration sales were basically flat year-over-year. Several key vertical markets, such as food service and industrial continue to grow nicely but those verticals cannot overcome declines related to residential filtration market. Global Pool and Spa was down 10% in the quarter as residential pool permits in the U.S. continue to be down over 30% led by declines in major markets, such as Florida, California, Arizona and Nevada. While we remain cautious regarding the Pool segment, our sales decline improved from down 22% in the second quarter to the aforementioned down 10% in the third quarter. More importantly, we're beginning to get a sense for the early buy program which occurs each fourth quarter. While it's too early to say definitively how the program will finish, so far we're on track with our expectations. Internationally, sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa or EMEA were essentially flat when you remove foreign exchange. We've seen a slowdown on Western European markets which negatively impacted our sales in the region. Sales to the Middle East and Eastern Europe continue to expand to double-digit growth rates. In Asia, Water sales were up over 20% as we continued to see strong system sales in China which were up over 40%. Let's shift gears and discuss operating profits and margins for Water Group. On the top right, you can see our year-over-year operating income walk for Water. Adjusted margins were 10.8%, down 130 basis points year-over-year. Inflation impacted Water margins by over 440 basis points that could not be overcome by productivity, price, and product mix. Our third quarter adjusted margins include the $6 million associated with the pay-as-you-go expenses for our restructuring actions and the integration costs associated with the GE combination. Those are some additional expenses that will no longer be with us as we enter 2009. The adjusted margins of 10.8% are towards the high end of the guidance we provided in July. We continue to drive solid productivity in the face of ongoing softness in residential construction and residential pool markets. We're taking significant actions to rationalize our global footprint, reduce structure and drive growth opportunities. We expect these to reverse the margin declines once the actions are all complete. So we continue to take the right steps in a challenging environment. Now, turn to slide number 5 and I'll review Technical Products. Technical Products results in the third quarter remained solid as we grew sales 8% and delivered adjusted margins of 16.2 % which were down slightly versus the third quarter last year. In last year's third quarter, it was extremely strong as the division produced record sales and margin levels for the period. So essentially matching some pretty good costs. As you look at our sales results for the third quarter this year, our Global Electrical business grew 9% versus last year. We continue to benefit from a very diverse set of vertical markets. On last quarter's earnings call, we provided detail on the diversity of our Technical Products vertical markets. And we reinforced that at our September 10th Analyst Day which is available on our website. So I won't repeat that detail here. Clearly, some key verticals have exhibited weakness, such as automotive and machine tools which remains one of our largest verticals. But others such as networking, energy and continuous flow remains strong, help [ph] to maintain nice sales momentum. Our Global Electronics business grew 7% led by strong growth internationally. Europe grew single digits, excluding exchange, and Asia grew in the mid-teens in local currencies. In the U.S. electronics sales were down in the high single digits. Looking at Technical Products margins, growth and productivity together contributed 380 basis points of margin expansion. This could not quite offset the impact of the negative 410 basis points from total inflation which was impacted by higher steel prices. In the quarter, we paid approximately $200 more for ton of steel than we were paying earlier in the year, an increase of about 25%. So while steel prices have begun to pull back recently, we'll still pay higher steel prices for a few more periods on a year-over-year basis. We executed well on the 2007 restructuring actions which included the shutdown of facilities outside Chicago and one in the UK. By reducing our Technical Products footprint, we believe, we will get even better operating leverage, even if markets contract. Given increases in metal prices, we initiated several price increases this year which has enabled us to largely offset commodities. So in sum, Technical Products delivered a good top-line helped by price increases and a great execution to deliver solid bottom-line and results in Q3. Now I am going to hand it over to John Stauch, who will provide additional detail on the quarter as well as discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2008. John?
John L. Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Randy. I am going to start on slide number 6. As we typically do each quarter, we'd like to highlight cash and ROIC, which is shown on the chart with the red box around the figures. As mentioned earlier, we generated $70 million of free cash flow in the third quarter, excluding a $23 million net payment related to settling the Horizon litigation. We continue to make progress in regard to working capital. But in a period that was the use of cash, as we have built inventory and advanced several important customer programs that are currently in our Water and Technical Products backlog, we have more working capital from the GE transaction. If we take a look at the components return on invested capital, ROIC, to the right of the slide, you see our fourth quarter trailing adjusted net operating profit after-tax or NOPAT was $277 million. Our average invested capital was $2.90 billion which gives us an after-tax ROIC of 9.3%. This is up 60 basis points versus the same period a year ago. We continue to focus on improving this metric. Our total debt was just over $1 billion for a debt to total capital ratio of 33.6%. As a reminder, the non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation of these calculations and numbers are included in appendix to this presentation. As we just discussed our debt position, let me take a few minutes to discus our balance sheet and debt in more detail. Please turn to slide number 7. Given the uncertainty in the credit markets, we felt it was important to highlight Pentair's debt and credit position which is a very good position. Our debt levels are healthy. And we expect to reduce debt to about 930 million by the end of the year. A majority of our debt is fixed with rates of approximately 6%. The only notes we have maturing in the near term is our $134 million October 2009 bonds. As the slide demonstrates, we have ample coverage in our borrowing capacity and strong banking partners in Bank of America, JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bank and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi supporting our credit facilities. So Pentair's balance sheet and credit facilities are in great shape which allows us to focus on operations, growth and our markets rather than securing debt or other concerns. Please turn to slide number 8, which reconciles our reported to adjusted EPS. Let me try to summarize a few of the moving pieces. The slide is divided into three sections. The top section provides you with our reported GAAP EPS earnings for the third quarter and year-to-date as well as our outlook for the balance of 2008. We then walk across the adjustments to our year-to-date results as well as expected adjustments in the fourth quarter of the year. This middle section reconciles the GAAP to adjusted EPS, so you can better understand our operating performance. The third section towards the bottom summarizes the same period in 2007 for GAAP EPS and adjusted EPS results for comparison. Starting at the top, our third quarter reported GAAP EPS was $0.42. Walking down to adjusted earnings, you would add back the unfavorable restructuring charges, which cost Pentair $0.13 per share in the period. We had forecasted we would take significant restructuring actions in the second half of 2008, and this represents a portion of those actions. But after adjusting for these items, third quarter EPS is $0.55, up 2%. The next column proceeds down the same path but with notable other items which we described in great detail last quarter. Our year-to-date reported EPS is $2.34. Excluding the $0.86 gain from GE transaction, along with the legal settlement for Horizon and restructuring charges we took in the first nine months of 2008, our year-to-date earnings on an adjusted basis is $1.76 which is up about 12% versus last year's year-to-date EPS. For the fourth quarter, we are forecasting the reported results of $0.17 to $0.20 per share which includes an expectation that the negative charges for restructuring other items in the fourth quarter will be about $0.35 per share. We forecasted we would take significant action in the second half of 2008 on the July earnings call. Given the slower economy, we are prepared to move proactively to address our global structure which is what we are doing. We have a number of headcount and facility actions underway and more being considered and the expected fourth quarter charge represents those items. So, by summing up all the quarters, full year reported EPS would be between $2.51 and $2.54. By adjusting the full year impact to these restructuring items, we now expect our adjusted full year EPS to be between $2.28 and $2.31, up about 10% versus 2007. As we stated last quarter, this adjusted EPS does include the incremental pay-as-you-go costs related to the GE transaction and restructuring actions in Water and Technical Products. Let's review the fourth quarter and full year earnings outlook in more detail on the next two slides. Please go to slide number 9. Let's review our outlook for Q4. Overall we expect sales to be up 3% to 4% to $840 million to $850 million, adjusted operating income of $96 million to $100 million and adjusted EPS of $0.52 to $0.55. We expect Water sales to be up slightly. Technical Products sales growth is expected to be similar to the third quarter or up about 8%. Overall we expect Pentair adjusted margins to be about 11.5%. Our margin expectations include the pay-as-you-go restructuring related impacts. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 32 to 33% and interest expense to be lower than Q4 2007 by about $2 million. Our share count is expected to be close to 99 million shares, down over 1% year-over-year. And we expect to generate over $120 million in free cash flow. So we've maintained steady growth in margins, despite heavy investments for restructuring and also increased investments in our global business unit structure and key growth initiatives. We expect these investments will have nice payback in 2009 and beyond. Please turn to slide number 10, as we'll update you on our outlook for the full year. To summarize, we are essentially maintaining the view we had previously communicated, but we are tweaking our adjusted EPS guidance range slightly. Previously, we had a range of $2.28 to $2.33. We are updating the range $2.28 to $2.31 as we increase our restructuring investments and also recognize the markets have softened. We have trimmed about 1% off of our sales growth outlook for the full year as a result. For the year, we expect sales to be up 3% or 4% to approximately $3.5 billion. Adjusted operating income is expected to be at least $410 million and as we've just highlighted, adjusted EPS of $2.28 to $2.31. We expect sales on Water to be up slightly for the year, and we continue to forecast Technical Products revenue growth of low double digits. Overall, Pentair margins are expected to be up modestly as we continue to overcome difficult residential markets and high commodity costs. Also, in this margin assumption are the expenses associated with the integration of the residential water filtration business and the pay-as-you-go expenses for restructuring actions. We expect our tax rate to be 33%, as previously mentioned, and interest to be about $60 million. Our diluted share count is expected to be close to 99.4 million, down 1% year-over-year. And we expect free cash flow to be greater than adjusted net income, excluding the negative impact of the Horizon settlement. Our debt position at the end of the year is expected to be approximately $930 million providing a debt to total capital of about 32%. And we fully intend to conclude our purchase of 50 million of our shares under our authorization. As the takeaway highlights, 2008 has been and will continue to be a year in which we're proactively navigating challenges. I'd like to add that we have been navigating these challenges for about 24 months and getting adapted to doing so. We expect our markets will not recover in the near term, which Randy will articulate next. So we're taking prudent actions to ensure we are positioned to endure the challenges that lay ahead. So with that, Randy.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, John. Please turn to slide number 11. Before we review Pentair's early view of 2009 and how we're approaching our plan, let me provide an update on our current environment and year-to-date results. From a financials results perspective, our execution has been pretty solid. Third quarter results exceeded guidance in a high quality way. We continue to invest in growth and also are aggressively cutting our cost structure. And John showed our balance sheet is in great shape. So we're committed to execution in delivering on our commitments. As we think about some key accomplishments, I would like to highlight a few of the major actions our company has driven. We are successfully integrating our residential water filtration business with GE's and that remains on track and on budget. And over the past few years, we have consistently been reducing our factory footprint and moving to best cost regions. These actions are important to drive our profitability in the face of challenging end markets. Also on September 10th, we had a well attended investor and analyst day which highlighted a number of our key growth and productivity initiatives. It was great to see many of you there and the feedback received was positive. So we thank you for your participation. The presentation material for that event is available on our website, and I encourage every one to take a look at it. And finally, we continue to launch a number of exciting new products, many of which were highlighted at the analyst day. Our new energy and environmentally efficient Enviro Reverse Osmosis filtration product, the LT [ph] dry industrial filtration product designed to dramatically improve hydraulic performance like the loop system in wind mills. We also highlighted our Aqua line [ph] pre-filtration solution that will reduce capital requirements as well as improve the life expectancy for pre-filtration systems in a number of applications, including desalination. There were many other new products displayed and we will keep you updated on the progress of these leading applications. Our perspective on the current environment, which is highlighted in the upper right quadrant, is that globally many markets, such as residential and pool remains soft while many other markets, such as commercial and industrial are generally weakening. Clearly we expect markets to slow, and we're prepared for it. So going forward, let me clearly state we're ramping our cost take-out measures and monitoring our markets through our daily order reports and quotations and bid rates. We've been navigating through very difficult end markets for over through two years. Residential and pool construction market problems are well known, and in 2007 we had difficult electronic end markets. So we've grown accustomed to operating in difficult environment. With that as a backdrop, let's discuss how we are approaching our 2009 planning process. Please turn now to slide number 12. We, like many companies, initiate our next year planning process in late summer and early fall. Since kicking of the planning sessions, the global economy and credit markets have experienced the high level of turbulence. As this line indicates credit markets have tightened, recessionary environments are more real for the U.S. and Western Europe, and many items, such as commodities and foreign exchange have been bouncing around in terms of valuations. These elements introduced tremendous amount of uncertainty and challenges in the planning cycle. So, while our typical process is to introduce next year's guidance on our third quarter earnings call, we're going to hold off until we have completed our final business reviews and allow for some uncertainty to become clearer. We would say, however, that the focused actions we had always planned to take in 2009 remain the same. We've consistently viewed 2009 as another difficult year in many end-markets, which is why we initiated the aggressive restructuring actions in July of this year. At the same time, many of our growth investments, such as desalination, food service, industrial filtration, water reuse and others remain attractive and will continue to receive the investment they deserved. So not much need for change inside Pentair from a big picture perspective, and we remain committed to delivering shareholder value during these times. Please turn to slide number 13, which outlines many of the cost actions and related planning assumptions we're taking for 2009. The top half of the slide summarizes many of the cost actions we have already announced and are implementing, and will have a meaningful impact to 2009. We anticipate the 11 plants we are closing in 2008 and 9, coupled with additional headcount reductions and the formation of our global business units, should deliver about $0.15 of earnings per share in 2009. Additionally, we expect the actions we're initiating in the fourth quarter to reduce our G&A structure to yield another $0.10 per share, next year. So in the aggregate, we're taking actions in 2008 and we believe will have a $0.25 positive impact to earnings next year. I will discuss our outlook for growth on the next slide. But it's good for you to know we're taking actions in '08 and will make a meaningful impact to '09. The lower half of the slide introduces some additional actions we're talking as we formalize our 2009 plans. First, we're having each of our businesses create two six month plans, so we can adjust quickly as we feel it is necessary. This approach will allow us to be more flexible in uncertain economic times and also provides an incentive model to ensure all of our businesses remain active and in the game, delivering the best results throughout the year. As we will discuss in more detail over the next few slides, we're planning for slow to no global growth markets. Thus, the facility rationalization and other cost take-out measures we're driving are imperative to ensure we deliver the highest level of earnings. We also have an opportunity to improve our net sourcing savings with potentially a period of key material deflation. So we're being proactive and assuming a challenging environment, which we believe is realistic. Now please go to slide number 14. While we are not giving official guidance, we felt it would be helpful to indicate how we are viewing our end markets at this point. I'm not going to read all the detail, but each one of our major end markets is listed along with their expected market growth or declines. Depending on how they materialize, the swinging global markets could be considerable. This could drive Pentair as slightly negative growth on the low-end to modestly positive sales growth on the high-end. The detail on the right side of the slide is similar nature to the previous slide. And if there are a number of growth items we have already accomplished in 2008 that we expect to provide a benefit in 2009. For example, we anticipate the residential water filtration deal with GE will add $40 million of sales to 2009, representing the other half of the year we didn't have that business in 2008. Additionally, 2008 price increases will recognize a full year of sales benefit. And while U.S. residential will likely be negative again in 2009, we may not see the same 30% decline in new home starts. So moderating decline will be less of the headwind in 2009. With more new products and opportunities in global resale [ph], global municipal and other vertical markets, we have areas of growth that we expect to be beneficial to 2009 as well. However, it is much more difficult than normal to predict how the consumer-led recession will impact global markets. And if the dollar continues to increase in value versus the euro, we may see a negative impact to exports which we expect will hurt our Technical Products business and commercial and industrial water businesses. These important factors reduce our ability to forecast 2009 sales growth at this time. But again, we are being realistic. Now let's talk about the cost side of the 2009 equation. Please turn to slide number 15. Each planning cycle includes the determination on cost inputs as well. Some key inputs are listed on the slide towards the top. You can see, we have listed some preliminary assumptions that certain items like wages, benefits and investments for growth are likely to be higher. There are few other items such as commodities and other material inputs that are uncertain at this time. Our view is that given lower oil prices, resins and distribution list... logistics costs may be deflationary items next year. The lower half of the slide puts it all together in several scenarios. When we do provide 2009 guidance later this year, we will refine our full year assumption on what type of environment we most likely expect. Regardless of the environment, we remain confident we can deliver on the cost take-out actions we outlined earlier, which we expect to offset areas of negative earnings or add to earnings growth with the right brakes. Depending on the market environment, we will take different actions and plan accordingly. For example, in recessionary environment we would clearly anticipate declining volumes and more difficult pricing environment, we will also see the benefit of material deflation. And in environment like we've been dealing with over the past 18 to 24 months about the mid-case shown here, we would expect the mixed environment with some markets up and some markets struggling. In this case, volumes would be down slightly but not to the same extent as the full recession. Since Pentair has been dealing with some difficult markets already for the past few years, we have a lot of practice. And finally, we list the high case where global economy somehow escape recession and instead see slightly below average growth. While the expected impact to our planned EPS has shown under each set of assumptions, it's far too early to be comfortable with what outlook is most likely yet. We hope these past few slides have been helpful in understanding how we see our company developing in 2009 under various conditions. Now let's wrap up with slide number 16. To summarize, we had a solid third quarter driven by our business diversity and global mix. While end markets are becoming more unpredictable, we have a lot of experience navigating these types of environments. We have been very proactive regarding cost takeouts. We have a great balanced sheet. So you don't have to spend time worrying about Pentair during this credit crisis. While some markets are close to turning for the worst, some markets are stabilizing or improving and some cost inputs will also be beneficial in 2009. While it's too early to forecast 2009, it's not to early to take action and assure we're proactively positioning the company to maximize performance under possible market conditions. Thanks for your attention. Now we'll turn over to the operator to open it up for questions, Meg? Question And Answer
Operator: Okay. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from the line of Deane Dray with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs: Thank you. Good day gentlemen.
John L. Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi Deane.
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs: Just quick... this is for Randy or for John, just to clarify the whole steel dynamic within Technical Products. You suggested that the steel prices benefit might not come through for the next couple of quarters. Is that because you have locked in supplier agreements or are you less open to spot pricing?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: No, we've been... we haven't really locked in. We've been expecting a decline. It just takes a while to work through the... working through the books... with FIFO.
John L. Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We use the capitalized variant system Deane as our accounting methodology. So some of the --
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: About a quarter lag.
John L. Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: So we sometimes have a month or too lag on the favorable pricing working its way through the system.
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs: But maybe I just misheard Randy, you said... I thought you said a couple of quarters, what... you mean a couple of months or quarters?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I think I said a couple of periods. I probably should have said a couple of months.
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs: Okay, good. That's helpful. What about the... how sticky will the prices be that the price increases you were able to get over the past year, what have you seen in the past about being able to hold price?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well one of the things we do is our prices go into our base. We don't do surcharges and the like. So it goes into our base pricing, and 80% of what we sell, we sell through distribution. And prices tend to be pretty sticky for distribution. I think it's evidenced in the fact that we were able to get as much price as we did if you compare that to other business that weren't quite as capable of getting as much price to offset commodities. I don't think that was... that was so much execution differences, that is industry structure differences. So, our planning would be that a lot of that price will stick, won't stick everywhere. But a lot of it will stick. And so that we will get some good read-out material productivity next year, which frankly we haven't this year because of the inflation.
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs: That's helpful. And then we fully appreciate the fact that it's going to be hard to nail down a specific guidance range for '09 at this stage. So, you've actually provided some good level of detail here in terms of some of the end-markets. If there was one that it kind of stuck out, that might be a little in need of explanation is in the water markets, municipal/desal are being up 5%, my guess is it's more of the desal dynamic than in municipal but if you split those two what would the dynamics be?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, it's really global. Our municipal business covered 100 million bucks. Most of those sales are in the U.S. today on the flow side. We got $100 million of quotes outside of the United States this year. So I mean we are so small. We believe we can grow with a decent hit rate in those and our backlog in CodeLine, the vessels for desal mostly outside the U.S. is really quite strong.
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs: So when we see municipal, we are taking more U.S. but you're talking just water treatment overall?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We have been investing enormously and the team has done a great job of getting focused outside and taking the capability we have outside. Now we have had the advantage of fairly favorable dollar. And that's why I referenced in my prepared talk that the dollar strengthening could be a headwind for those businesses. But obviously really good to have that quote backlog going from zero to $100 million in pumps.,. municipal pumps outside the U.S.
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs: And just last question if I could, on the early buy-program I know that it's always hard to gauge at this stage of the year because it can be... surprise you the upside or the downside. What are your expectations and where do distributor inventories sit today?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, if you take a look at... we were down as I said... full equipment business was down some 22% in the second quarter. It was down... the group of that we used [ph] only down 10% in the third quarter which we think reflects more of the market now. So we don't think that the inventory came down much, and at least as a way we set our expectations for the fourth quarter that John just went through assuming that we would see kind of a market level decline in the early buy and everything we see is consistent with that.
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs: Great thank you.
John L. Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Deane.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Cox with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.
Michael Cox - Piper Jaffray: Hi, good morning. Thank you very much for taking my question, and thanks for all the details provided this morning.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: You're welcome.
Michael Cox - Piper Jaffray: My first question is on Municipal spending, and domestically I was curious what you're seeing on that front, given what we're seeing on in terms of state level budgets, and just the local budget process as well.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I'll give you a couple of data points. On the flow side, we still have a good backlog. We haven't seen any cancellation in the order and the order rate has remained pretty good. On Tech Products which also serves the public sector, we have seen a slower growth, it went from being double digits to single digits. So we're seeing it there on that Tech Products side.
Michael Cox - Piper Jaffray: Okay, that's helpful. And on the Water side, with the margins down in the quarter, I understand largely from the GE transaction, but as you look out to 2009 from the first of all, you're looking into do you see the Water segment margins being relatively flat, is that a realistic expectation? And how much of the drag in Water margins is just coming off the Pool segment right now?
John L. Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It's a good question. I mean, we really think we have the ability next year even in a down market to expand our Water margins. We've taken a lot of structure out. We continue to migrate the factories. And so we would expect to increase the margins. Pool equipment, which is a part of the Pool Spa business, is roughly around a 10% margin business today. And we would like to say that we're near the bottom of the trough, right? So I think it's reflective of the hard work that that team has done. And we've seen those margins continually tick up as the volumes come back. So we kind of like our core cost position. So we would say that we're bullish on the Water margins, because we got aggressive with the actions early in 2008, and we continue to address our cost structure.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: And after two years, flat we feel like up to then.
Michael Cox - Piper Jaffray: Sounds good. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Schneider with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Good morning guys.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hey Mike.
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Maybe we can focus on Technical Products, for a minute. Just look back... look through the '01 and '02 challenges, and I'm just curious if you could at least compare the business today to what we saw then. And just as a refresher, I think Technical Products revenue was down 29% peak to trough, earlier this decade and margins basic I cut in half from 12 to 6. As you look at the business now with the acquisitions with the pricing contributions, et cetera, what's kind of... what's your recession expectation for that business and compare to what's going on in the past cycle?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I won't jump the [indiscernible] and tell you, I think it's going to be that bad. Let me tell you what the theme is... the theme is that we will not be immune in Tech Products at this downturn. That we're all expecting to need to plan in. And let me tell you what's different. We actually have a much more variable cost structure. We had a lot more structure. We had about six more plants than we have now. And that cost structure was a heavy load. As you recall we had to shut down a lot effective gone, and we have been through lean to be able to grow the business. We have a more variable cost structure. So I think that's important and will help us manage margins. The second thing is we are lot more global than we were. We really weren't active in Asia, and I think towards the amount of growth that we have, the insight in Asia even if Asia softens a little bit or slows... grows at a slower rate, we still get a lot of market penetration there, though... albeit that is lower margin than our U.S. business. But... and the last is that we have a much more diverse vertical market set. We talked a lot of about how we've broadened the business. For instance, we are much more involved with continuous flow. We are much more involved with a deeper and more engaged in energy. And I think energy spending will stay up. And we've already suffered some pretty big slowdowns in automotive in there. So I think the more diverse markets that will help a lot. The other thing is that I think we have... look at the performance we've delivered with the kind of commodity inflation that we've had, and that's going to go away. I mean if we have a recession, there is no place the commodities will go but down and our business has proven, our Tech Products business has proven that they managed really well in their material costs. So I expect. So I will tell you this. I don't think that the best days are behind Tech Products. I think that our team will manage it well. We've had a lot of discussions about getting prepared for it and they are. So while we'll have a little bit of headwinds, so I think we will... we won't see a repeat of the 2001.
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: And can you just based on your experience in this channel... can you discuss if that... if the price inflation that's occurred over the last three, four years, does that create more risk to margins over the next two years if indeed we go through a recession or is it less of a risk?
John L. Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I will jump in [ph] and I'll let Randy... Mike, it's John Stauch. I think there is two halves. Right, we got to remember electronics. We've been challenged by going out in bidding and wining jobs on pricing. And we've lost on the material inflation on those fixed price jobs. We've been able to price in the distribution side and the electrical side and capture most of the commodity increases that we've seen by. So it actually will reverse right? I mean if we take a look at the distribution side, we may or may not see price decreases but will have the ability to realize that price inflation. On the electronic side, we won't be caught the way we've been squeezed through this --
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Should get us some relief in productivity.
John L. Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We got to figure it all out Mike, and we are just clearly going through our planning cycle and running a series of scenarios around what that looks like. And we're trying to balance that with the fact that we haven't seen these markets drop significantly yet. And so we're challenging our teams to assume that they will.
Michael Cox - Piper Jaffray: Okay, thank you again guys.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Okay, thanks Mike.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Curt Woodworth with JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Curtis Woodworth - JP Morgan: Hi, good afternoon. Just want to talk a little bit more about some of the cost actions that you outlined on in the presentation. For your fourth quarter slight deck, regarding the new actions you're talking about $50 million of annualized takeout which is about $0.34 a share. And then on your other slide deck, you talked about $0.25 of total cost benefit to be realized in '09 partly from what you are planning to do in 4Q which is sort of $0.10 and partly from the 1Q to 3Q actions of 15. So is the annualized number that you are throwing out in the fourth quarter slide... is that really kind of the run rate you expect to get to by the end of '09 or how do I think about reconciling some of these numbers?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Curt, we've been... just to hit it head on, we've been dealing with what we are going to do with Spa Bath all year. And in Q4 some type of action related to Spa Bath. Don't know exactly what that action is yet, but we are forecasting either major restructuring or some type of adjustment. And that's why you are not seeing the same payback that you are seeing from the Q1 to Q3 actions.
Curtis Woodworth - JP Morgan: Okay but that would be embedded in the $0.10 benefit that you outlined for 4Q?
John L. Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: The $0.35 cost that you're referring to, correct.
Curtis Woodworth - JP Morgan: Okay, got it.
John L. Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We won't see that benefit until 2009.
Curtis Woodworth - JP Morgan: Okay. And then in terms of the price raw material conversation, if you look at this quarter on Water, it looked like that hurt you by at least $0.05 a share. So I'm wondering would you expect to get some relief on that metric at least in the short run as commodity prices go down and maybe you can get to more of a neutral or even positive position?
John L. Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, clearly we're looking at those commodities, as Randy mentioned in his remarks, they are bouncing around right, but we're waiting for them to settle and we would expect that we see more deflationary environment in Water.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah Curt, when I look at Water, I look at the details. We have some pretty, pretty good cost reduction actions and supply just didn't read out because the inflation was that much worse. I think that process will deliver in space next year without in fact inflation and then the turbo charged by deflation for Water.
Curtis Woodworth - JP Morgan: Okay, and then I guess a follow to Mike's question on the Technical Products. If you look at... I think Randy, you commented on the call that you think you could see better operating leverage even in a down market. So what would the sensitivity be? I know there is lot of moving pieces, but can you help frame maybe what the margins would look like under a flat unit volume growth scenario or down say 5% or down 10%? What... just in terms of thinking about how bad margins could theoretically get next year if volume was to go down 5 to 10?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, I think we'll give when we do give guidance later this year. I think we will go into a little more detail. And we're thinking about that. But in a flat environment, I think margins can stay wherever they are, because between productivity and particularly materials productivity, I think there is still a lot than these that can go better in tech products, particularly on the electronics side. So I think in a flat environment, they could do better I think in a down environment they... we can build a plan to be flat, but I don't want to jump the gun [ph]. We got meeting schedule of the team over the next week, who work through the scenarios. But I don't Mike said it well, I mean in last in downturn we went from a 12 peak to a 6 and now actual are peak 17. So we are up five points from that peak. And I don't think we necessarily, I don't... there is now way we will drop 30%. I would hopefully it would even drop to 6 points. So that sort of fills my expectations.
Curtis Woodworth - JP Morgan: Great. Okay, thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of John Quealy with Canaccord Adams. Your line is open.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Adams: Thanks. This is actually Chip Moore for John. You talked about slowing conditions in Western Europe. Wondering if you can go through what you're seeing from the commercial, industrial, residential markets, et cetera. And kind of how that... what you saw versus your expectations and what you see going forward?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, we actually expected the decline when we set the third quarter. One reason we beat quarter revenue was, we actually were expecting the decline we can see it coming. We're skewed residential in water, Europe. So residential is down in Spain, Italy, France and UK. All those residential market were down. So we are seeing slowing commercial and industrial as well, which is before, because residential decline stared earlier but the commercial and industrial, we saw that decline. That said, the European team has done a great job on margins and we've implemented a safety system and that they've leveraged nicely. They have been supporting a lot of growth in the Middle East and in Eastern Europe. So, I think we still have a opportunity.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Adams: Great. Thank you.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I think you agree [ph]. Thanks.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Chris Glynn with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Chris Glynn - Oppenheimer: Thank you. On the restructuring front, the $0.25 is that all water?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: In which period, for next year?
Chris Glynn - Oppenheimer: Yeah, just the benefits you are looking for in '09, from the restructuring actions?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We're... we took more aggressive actions in the first part of the year in the water, but we are certainly looking to do something in technical products as well and the technical products business is reviewing those actions, and they'll be presenting us some ideas here in Q4.
Chris Glynn - Oppenheimer: Okay. And just in terms of restructuring beyond what you've laid out, would you expect a couple of factories a year type of thing, or prospects for another significant sort of action strategy? And then specifically, with respect to your China or Eastern European footprint, are those appropriate comfort level with the ground expertise in those areas?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, I think we've presented some thoughts on that at the Analyst Meeting, as you recall. We continue to see the need, we have a lot of plans. We need to continue to have a more productive footprint, and particularly get to what we call best cost countries which isn't just surely chasing the low lay birds, it's having the best cost plans to serve the markets we're serving. So well, we like our position in China. We like the position we're building in India. Our Poland factory in tech products is finally profitable, and in helping us in Europe. It's in fact actually in Europe, we were up in tech products in the third quarter, so we haven't seen the market decline there yet. And I think one of the reasons is that the Polish factory is giving us a more competitive cost position to grow by itself. We like the position... we have a nice position in Brazil as well, with our tech products business, we're leveraging in the Water.
John L. Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And the teams they are solid, Chris and I think what we've planned to do is take this tranche of savings and continue to divest annually and constantly getting after the cost basis on a more continued basis.
Chris Glynn - Oppenheimer: Okay and then just lastly, at Pool, what's the mix of newbuilds versus after-market shaking out at these days?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: It's getting close to a 100.
John L. Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: About 75
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah we'd estimate 75-80% right now, as after market.
Chris Glynn - Oppenheimer: Well. Okay, thanks a lot.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: And you have another question coming from the line of Mike Schneider with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: I'm just curious on the ballot this fall, the California legislature is going to take up this issue of banning water softeners. Have you... can you give us an update just on your market analysis around that and maybe what your exposure is, if indeed this becomes one of the green phenomenon?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Senator Larry [ph] took it out and Governor Schwarzenegger vetoed it. That said, water softener is a fairly small part of the salinity problems in the water in California. The big problem in California is it does not enough water. And so you'll see right now the State of Washington is looking at banning personal car washes and lot by checked a... a lot so. I don't think there they lack of water and so wash. But I think there is long-term trend towards there is more restrictions on water use and that's a long-term trend that is favorable for us for water reuse is favorable for us for filtration and it's favorable for us actually fluff. So we're... I think the largest provider of products into water conditioning and water softening. So we pay for a lot of attention to things like what's going on in California. And we view long-term that probably would be a saltless way to de-ionize water. None of those are viable now both economically or technically. But one of the things that we're working on with GE is that technology. That's all we're thinking about.
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Okay. And as far as the GE deal goes; given that the world has changed just even in the last three weeks, four weeks. Have you gone back to your GE modeling assumptions for the joint venture and made any material adjustments to that?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: No, when we form that venture it was really a shared view that we had with GE that the residential markets would be viable and exciting in the future and why not build now during this weak time, a world beating company to winning it. So that's really what we are. We had a review yesterday actually, our monthly review and status is quite good from a plant restructuring standpoint. The thing I am most excited about is the growth strategy that they are building. So we don't see any need with recent events to change the assumptions are on that venture. If anything I am more confident that we will be, when residential comes back and I'm not picking a date or time, but I will tell you I'm bullish on our prospects when it comes back.
Todd Gleason - Vice President, Investor Relations: Mike this is Todd Gleason. I just want to make sure, we are able to get to everybody in the queue. And I know we have about five minutes left on the scheduled time. But we want to take it over. How many people do we have in the queue?
Operator: Actually Mr. Schneider's call... question was the last question.
Todd Gleason - Vice President, Investor Relations: Okay. Well Mike go ahead. Do you have anything else Mike?
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: No, that's it. Thanks, guys.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Thanks Mike.
Todd Gleason - Vice President, Investor Relations: Great thanks.
Todd Gleason - Vice President, Investor Relations: Okay. Well, it sounds like we have no one else left in the queue. And if that's the case, then we will go ahead and wrap up today's conference call. Thank you very much for joining us. And if you have any questions, let us know. Again our presentation material is on our website and hopefully you have access to that. Thank you very much.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks.
John L. Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.

As is our custom we will reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. I will now hand the call over to Randy, who will take you through Pentair's second quarter results and highlights, provide detail on significant actions and initiatives we are driving and provide his summary for our first half results. Then John will conclude our formal remarks with an overview of the impact of various actions we are undertaking in the year as well as discuss our future guidance. Randy?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Todd. Thank you all for joining us today. Let's begin by reviewing our second quarter results shown on slide number two. Looking at our second quarter, we had solid performance as we'll walk you through on the call we embarked on a number of new important initiatives that will continue to enable our organization to deliver on our commitments. Let's walk through the highlights. In the quarter, we delivered reported earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.39, which includes a number of non-recurring items. The first is a non-recurring gain of $0.86 per share associated with the transaction we completed with GE to combine our residential water filtration businesses. The reported EPS also includes a negative non-recurring $0.14 per share impact from settling the Horizon legal case. And reported EPS includes a negative $0.01 per share impact from severance and restructuring actions taken in the quarter. If you remove those non-recurring items, which we feel is the most accurate way to evaluate our true operating performance, we delivered $0.68 of EPS, on an adjusted basis. That $0.68 is up 11% versus the $0.61 in the second quarter of 2007. The $0.68 also bested the high end of our EPS guidance of $0.64 to $0.67 by $0.01 per share. Strong performance in our technical products business enabled us to offset weaker results in our water segment driven from our pool business. We will provide additional detail on each business in a few minutes, but first here are some more of the headlines. Pentair second quarter sales of $910 million were up 1% above the $899 million in sales we generated last year. Our organic growth was flat in the quarter or down 3% in local currency, a strong growth in our technical products segment could not completely offset declines in residential water segments. Second quarter sales in our water segment were down 6%, year-over-year. The segment details will demonstrate we've had a tail of two cities in water. One camp is growing sales nicely while those exposed to residential end markets continue to be challenged. Our technical products business achieved record sales levels and grew 18% in the second quarter versus Q2 '07. Technical products has been firing in all cylinders and we continue to be bullish on the growth prospects for our various technical products vertical markets. As the slide shows, Pentair expanded margin, 50 basis points. Looking at total company margins year-over-year, the positive impact from volume, price, and product mix coupled with solid productivity provided 360 basis points of margin growth in aggregate. This offset a negative 310 basis point impact from total inflation in foreign exchange. Our second quarter effective tax rate was 33%, reflecting the investments we have made to position our global operations more optimally. The 33% rate is the sustainable rate we expect for the full-year. In the quarter, we bought back shares worth approximately $9 million, we have a little over $28 million remaining on our authorization, which we expect to fully utilize in 2008. And as expected, interest expenses provided a year-over-year benefit of $0.01 of EPS versus last year as our debt levels are down significantly. We continued to be on track to deliver full-year free cash flow above adjusted net income. In the second quarter, we delivered $135 million of free cash flow, which brings us to a positive $57 million year-to-date. So, those are the Pentair level highlights for the second quarter. Now lets turn to the slide number three, as our press release highlights, we had a busy quarter with lots of moving parts. When I think about our results in the quarter versus the guidance we provided in April, this slide pretty much sums it up. The guidance we suggested in April had sales between $910 million and $925 million, operating income between $114 million and $120 million, and EPS in the range of $0.64 to $0.67. So actual sales hit the low end of the range at $910 million. Operating income came in comfortably within the range at $118 million. And adjusted EPS was $0.68 as our tax rate improved slightly versus our guidance. But there is good news here, because as I just mentioned, this 33% rate is sustainable going forward. Despite this pretty simple sounding performance explanation, there were some pretty large variances within some of our business results. In April, our expectations for our pool and spa business were for sales to be down low double digits. While customer sell-through activity was in line with that expectation, several key distributors aggressively drew down inventory in the second quarter which created a larger revenue decline for suppliers. This revenue shortfall hurt us by $0.07 per share versus guidance. On the flip side, throughout the second quarter we continued to witness stronger than expected demand in our technical products business. We capitalized our ability to meet customer demand in our lien driven productivity culture delivered outstanding margins. The upside in technical products delivered about $0.07 per share of benefit versus our April guidance, enough to offset the decline in our pool and spa business. We've highlighted the expanding diversity of our portfolio over the past three to four quarters. The result of our quarter provides additional proof of that broader balance. A few years ago, a $0.07 miss in our pool businesses largest quarter may have been insurmountable. Today, we have a more balanced global presence, stronger exposure to attractive vertical markets and a rigorous productivity culture that is driving hard in many difficult environments. In sum, we endured the worst pool season in Pentair's history. We continue to navigate through various soft residential markets and we've executed extremely well in non-residential water and technical products to deliver outstanding results. In order to insure long term results and control our own destiny we continue to aggressively improve our portfolio and execution culture. Let's review some of the major actions we accomplished or announced in the second quarter. Please turn to slide four. This slide highlights four major events or actions, each one uniquely improves the position of our company. First, as we highlighted last month, we combined forces with General Electric in the Residential Water Filtration business. We have several slides on this topic in a minute, so to highlight a few key takeaways, I'd just say both Pentair and GE are excited about the growth prospects of Residential Water Filtration. We expect this new combination will produce strong sales, meaningful cost synergies and tremendous value to our customers globally. Second, we're happy to announce we settled the longstanding Horizon litigation. Today's Press Release is the first instance since I've been CEO that we do not have to include Horizon litigation in our risk discussion of our forward-looking statement. By putting this case in the rear view mirror our shareholders can cross off an uncertainty that has been associated with our shares for many years. We're still working to recover an additional $10 million in insurance associated with this case. This was not included in the charge, so any recovery would be a future benefit that we would spell out at that time. Third, we continue to address our cost structure by taking aggressive actions. In the second quarter, we shut down two European facilities which created a non-recurring $2 million charge. In the third and fourth quarter of this year, we've announced the closure of six more factories as well as taken action to reduce our G&A structure and consolidate distribution centers. We'll be talking more about the timing and location of these actions in a few minutes. The last major item is the bond tender we announced earlier this month. We reached out to holders of our 7.85% bond due in October 2009, soliciting for early retirement. Our goal is to retire a significant portion of this note and use our credit facility which currently has rates under 4%. By essentially refinancing this portion of our debt, we reduced exposure in 2009 when it would normally be due and while this action will result in a charge of approximately $0.03 per share, we expect to have lower interest expense of about $0.01 per share, starting in fourth quarter this year. Let's go to slide five and discuss the Residential Water Filtration transaction we completed with GE in more detail. As a very simple snapshot, here is what each side contributed to create the Residential Water Filtration business. The new business will start with annualized sales of approximately $450 million and high teens operating margins. With 13 combined manufacturing facilities, we're taking immediate action to rationalize our production locations. We'll have access to GE's technology for the residential market, which hasn't been a priority for them and have access to the GE brand. So by combining Pentair's sizeable strength and distribution along with GE's technology and brand and great people, we're confident Pentair's Residential Water Filtration business will be a stronger business with improved growth potential. Pentair will consolidate the revenue and operating income of the combined business and account for GE's percent of the profits as a minority interest. Now, please turn to slide six to review our revenue growth and cost take-out strategies in the new Residential Water Filtration business in more detail. On the left side of the slide you can see we detail a number of revenue growth opportunities. We're excited about current solutions that the combined businesses have such as Ultra Filtration Whole House Systems and Tankless Reverse Osmosis Systems, but we're also eager to introduce a number of products and systems for emerging regions with proprietary technologies. As we merge the two businesses, we must ensure our customer service and quality levels remain very good. By combining the businesses, we expect to improve customer education about water quality, marketing and invest more heavily in filtration technology to benefit residential customers. On the Cost Take-out side associated with the Residential Filtration business, this week we announced the closure of five factories. Sheboygan, Wisconsin, Rockford, Illinois, Limay, France, and two in Asia. Our integration team is driving for quick results and we expect to not only reduce manufacturing in G&A structure, but also take advantage of pre-existing supply agreements and other programs to maximize results. Bottom line, we believe through identifiable and actionable growth and cost synergies the new Residential Water Filtration business can produce an additional $0.27 per share by 2010. And that's our commitment. Let's transition back to review our second quarter performance in more detail, starting with an overview of our water results. Please turn to slide number seven. We're covering a lot of information today and this is one of our standard slides. Let me just hit some of the highlights. Overall, water sales were down $37 million to $605 million or down 6% versus last year. As we discussed in April when we provided guidance, we got a difficult year-over-year comp in our Flow Technologies business. Last year we sold $21 million of municipal pumps to the core engineers for the City of New Orleans. So that's a piece of our sales decline that we expected. However, the biggest reason for the contraction in water sales was the poor sell-in this pool season for our Pool and Spa business. As I said earlier, end market demand was inline with our down 10% prediction adding end of the quarter. However, additional pressure came as distributors reduced inventory levels earlier and more aggressively than we expected. This pushed our pool sales down 22% versus last year. 8% growth in filtration coupled with 20% growth in Asia and single-digit growth in EMEA could not overcome this dramatic decline in pool and spa. We're going to discuss our water growth in the next slide, so let's skip over to our operating income walk. On the top right you can see our year-over-year operating income for water. Adjusted margins were 13.3%, down 60 basis points year-over-year, inflation impacted water margins by over 310 basis points, it could not be overcome by productivity, price and product mix. I'd point out that the Horizon legal settlement and non-recurring restructuring charges have been adjusted from our 13.3% margins. The impact of these non-recurring items are shown in the chart as a $23 million charge. While we're disappoint in margin contraction in the quarter, we endured a very difficult pool season and we're taking significant actions to rationalize our global footprint, reduce structure and drive growth opportunities. These will reverse the margin declines once the residential market settles out. Let's take a closer look at our water segment by comparing sales growth rates between our different Markets. Please turn to slide eight. Approximately 40% of our water business is exposed to residential markets. This slide shows you the year-over-year comparable sales growth rates we experienced in the first half of this year along with our expectations for the second half and full-year 2008. Sales declined approximately 15% in the first half of 2008 residential markets, including pool and spa, flow technologies and residential filtration. Our second half sales outlook for these residential markets is down 7%, while still negative the sequential improvement is primarily the result of a higher sales from the GE combination. For the year, we're forecasting a 12% overall decline in sales for residential water markets, when extrapolated out the impact of total Pentair is approximately negative, four points of sales decline for full-year 2008. Conversely, the growth in our non-residential and international water businesses continues at solid levels. As the slide shows, in the first half of the year our non- residential sales grew 12% year-over-year in aggregate. When we add the impact from foreign exchange, in the Q2 2007 New Orleans project, which we had removed from municipal core growth, non-residential water was up about 13%. We expect about 8% growth in the second half of this year in non-residential and international markets or up about 10% including foreign exchange. When you take that out for the full year, we see about 10% growth in non-residential and international markets, which provides about five points of growth to total Pentair. So we have solid growth in non-residential and international markets being masked by continued sales declines in soft residential markets. This provides you with a different segmentation of water sales and one which we think may be of interest as we, at some point, begin to lack the most difficult comps on the residential front. Now, lets turn to slide number nine to review our technical products second quarter 2008 results. As usual we provide you with total business sales and operating income walks at the upper half of the chart. Technical products results in the first quarter were outstanding as we grew sales 18% and adjusted margin to 16.4%. Let's review what enabled our businesses to have better than originally expected performance in the quarter. As we look at our sales results, our global electrical business grew 14% versus last year as we continue to take advantage of a strong and diverse business model. Our thermal and networking vertical markets each grew double digits as we continue to see solid performance in our core Hoffman channels. We'll evaluate technical products major vertical markets in a few minutes. Our global electronics business grew 24%. Every region posted positive growth, paced by our Asian Pacific electronics business, which grew 39%. Looking at technical product's margins, growth and productivity together contributed 530 basis points of margin expansion. This easily offset the impact of a negative 300 basis points from total inflation. Our lean driven productivity actions continue to produce solid results. We're executing well on the 2007 restructuring actions, which included the shut down of facilities outside Chicago and one in the U.K. By reducing our technical products footprint, we believe we'll get even better operating leverage, even if we see lower growth markets. Given the increases in metals prices, mainly steel for technical products we recently introduced new price actions in the segment. We believe these actions have been accepted by our customers and are appropriately sized to offset commodity pricing pressures. So in sum, technical products delivered a strong topline and had great execution to deliver outstanding bottom line results in Q2. We believe this segment is well positioned for the balance of the year. Now let's review the major vertical markets within technical products. Please turn to slide ten. Rather than read all of the numbers, let me just highlight a few items. First, we want to share with you the technical products has more diversity and balance than even just a few years ago, which is one of the key reasons we have experienced tremendous growth over the past 12 months. In particular, the energy and infrastructure verticals have been performing very well, as our new products in networking and commercial markets. The business continues to invest in new product introductions and global expansion. And while we expect sales growth in the second half of the year to moderate versus Q2, we remain confident in our ability to outperform our end markets. I leave you with the observation that having this vertical market better positions our organization to attack the appropriate markets with the appropriate strategies. Also, it helps us ensure our financial forecasts are based on end market realities. So we see strength continuing in several major end markets within technical products and also some end markets where we expect some slowing, but in total this will be a great growth year in tech products. Let's turn to slide number 11 which shows our financial metrics. I'd like to highlight cash and ROIC which are shown in the chart with the red box around the figures. As mentioned earlier, we generated $135 million of free cash flow in the second quarter, about $11 million less than the same period of 2007. We continue to make progress in regard to working capital, but there's still a lot of opportunity to improve it further particularly in inventories. If you take a look at the components of return on invested capital to the right of slide, you see our four quarter trailing adjusted net operating profit after tax, or NOPAT, was $292 million. Our average invested capital was $2.96 billion, which gives us an after tax ROIC of 9.9%. This is up 40 basis points versus the same metric a year ago. We're continuing to move this metric in the right direction with several quarters of sequential expansion now. Our ending working capital was $463 million, an increase of $24 million versus Q2 2007. About $15 million is related to inventory we acquired as part of the GE transaction. Our five quarter moving average working capital was $432 million, which is 12.7% of four quarter trailing sales. Our total debt was just over $1 billion for a debt to total capital ratio of 33%. As a reminder, the non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliations of these calculations and numbers are included in the appendix to this presentation. Before I turn it over to John, let me share my summary thoughts about our performance and outlook. Please turn to chart number 12. We've touched on most of these themes already, so I'll be brief. Our performance of technical products has been fantastic and they continue to set records for sales and margins. And while we continue to see double-digit growth in non-residential and international markets... international water businesses, the residential market declines have masked much of our solid performance in the rest of water. We had the worst pool season in Pentair history. We also believe that in difficult times, strong companies can get stronger. Our pool and spa business has launched new restructuring actions and continues to invest for future growth. Commodities remain stubbornly high, the recent price actions have mitigated the inflation to date. However, with higher costs and several of our key markets remaining soft, we believe aggressive productivity is the only way to insure we can meet or exceed our commitment to you, our shareholders. So we'll continue to focus on productivity as well as actions to improve our portfolio, like our first quarter divestiture of National Pool Tile and the formation of the Residential Water Filtration business with GE. It's been a busy first half of 2008 and one filled with significant accomplishments and real challenges. Now I'll turn it over to John and he will help you understand how we are thinking about the second half of the year and how we're positioning our businesses to drive even more improvement. John?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President: Thanks, Randy. As mentioned earlier, we have a lot going on at Pentair. Let me try to summarize a few of the moving pieces. Please turn to Slide 13. This slide is divided into three sections. The top section provides you with our reported GAAP EPS earnings for the second quarter and year-to-date as well as our outlook for the balance of 2008. We then walk across the adjustments to our year-to-date results as well as expected adjustments in the second half of the year. This middle section reconciles the GAAP to adjusted EPS so you can better understand our operating performance. The third section summarizes for the same period in 2007, the GAAP EPS and adjusted EPS results for comparison. Starting at the top, our second quarter reported GAAP EPS was $1.39. Walking down the adjusted earnings, you would move with the non-recurring $0.86 per share benefit from the gain created from the exchange of 20% of Pentair's residential filtration business for 80% of GE's residential filtration business. This gain was the result of a low double-digit multiple being applied to each company's trailing 2007 EBITDA results. The multiple is at the lower end of the range of filtration transaction multiples. Continuing to walk down the chart, the second quarter also included an unfavorable non-recurring charge to earnings related to the Horizon settlement. As Randy mentioned, it is nice to not have to reference the previous uncertainty any longer in our 10-K's, 10-Q's or forward-looking statements. The net impact to the settlement after accruals already taken and insurance coverage was $0.14 hit to Q2 earnings. This negative impact does not include a potential insurance recovery of approximately $10 million to one of our previous insurance carriers. The net cash impact to the third quarter from this settlement will be approximately $18 million net of insurance and tax benefits. Finally, the last adjustment to the second quarter is related to restructuring charges, which cost Pentair $0.01 per share in the period. Thus, after adjusting for these non-recurring items, second quarter EPS is $0.68, up 11%. These results included a second quarter tax rate of 33%, we now expect our full-year sustainable rate will be 33% for 2008. Since we do not have any adjustments for the first quarter these adjustments carryover to the year-to-date column, so by adding the $0.53 of EPS we delivered in Q1 plus the $0.68 of adjusted Q2 EPS you get to $1.21 of EPS year-to-date, up 17% [ph] versus 2007. For the second half, we are forecasting reported results of $0.52-$0.57 per share, which includes an expectation that the negative charges for restructuring and other items in the second half will be between $0.50 and $0.60 per share. This would produce a full year reported EPS of between $2.44 and $2.49. By adjusting the full year impact of these restructuring charges, we now expect our adjusted full-year EPS to be between $2.28 and $2.33. This adjusted EPS does include about $0.07 of incremental cost related to the GE transaction and restructuring actions in water and technical products. This amount was not contemplated in guidance we previously provided because we had not embarked on these actions. You can think of this $0.07 as expenses that would fall into [inaudible] bucket associated with restructuring charges. The $2.28 to $2.33 range would provide full-year EPS growth of between 9% to 11% for the year. Please turn to slide 14. Starting with our second quarter guidance on the April earnings call, at that time we anticipated $0.64 to $0.67 for Q2 and between $1.10 and $1.23 for the second half. This would have delivered a full-year EPS of between $2.30 to -$2.40 for 2008. Based on our actual results in Q2 being at the high end of guidance, coupled with our current business performance and the expectation that our effective tax rate will be approximately 33%, our full-year outlook before incremental actions has moved slightly higher to between $2.35 to $2.40. This number is shown in the top section of the slide with a circle around it. Having weathered the difficult pool season, we'll also continue to see strength in our technical products segment as well as international water and non-residential water businesses, we feel this reflects our core business performance for the year. This also takes into consideration that our price actions which continue to be successful, offset material inflation for the year. However, as we said on the last slide, based on the impacts from the GE transaction as well as the expenses associated with our announced restructuring actions our full-year 2008 adjusted EPS range reflects an additional $0.07 of expenses, which brings our new range to $2.28 to $2.33. Let's walk through some of the details quickly because as you'll see, we feel this investment has an attractive pay back. Please focus on the middle section of the slide 14. These are the major actions that we recently announced and that we feel are going to accelerate Pentair earnings in 2009 and 2010. Starting with the GE transaction, we have announced the closure of the GE Rockford, Illinois residential filtration plant and the closure of the Pentair Sheboygan, Wisconsin plant. These sites will be consolidated into existing Milwaukee area facilities as well as Suzhou, China and Reynosa Mexico over the next 12 to 18 months. In addition to these two Milwaukee plants we also announced the closure of a French operation in two China locations, which will be absorbed into existing Pentair facilities within the same region. Also we expect to realize the benefit of more leveraged and reduced structure from both businesses. The impact of these integration activities are [inaudible], and will cost us about $0.02 of EPS in both Q3 and Q4 of 2008 and another $0.06 of EPS in early 2009, but will yield an expected 2009 benefit of $0.15 of incremental EPS to Pentair in 2009 and $0.25 of EPS when all actions are fully implemented in 2010. Inventory step up and intangibles amortization in connection with GE transaction will cost us another $0.04 of EPS in 2008 and amortization will continue to impact EPS by $0.04 annually. Net-net, the impact of the GE transaction in residential filtration is expected to negatively impact Pentair adjusted EPS by $0.08 in 2008, be $0.05 accretive in 2009 and it's expected to be $0.20 accretive in 2010. We focus on the next section of slide 14, you could see the impact of the other actions we recently announced. These expenses are not restructuring charges, but similar to the GE transaction, they are pay as you go expenses associated with these transitions. In this section, they're related to actions we are taking in pool and spa, flow technologies, filtration and our Western Europe water operations. This primarily reflects the closure of our Cypress, California operations within commercial filtration. The net impact of these rooftop consolidations are expected to result in a reduction or transfer of significant number of manufacturing positions and shifting from higher to lower cost locations. We have also reduced non-manufacturing positions throughout water and in the North American and EMEA electronics businesses within technical products. The net impact of these already determined actions is expected to be neutral to 2008 results and $0.06 to 2009 expectations and an ongoing benefit of greater than $0.15, on an annual basis. Offsetting these actions is the potential interest benefit of our bond tender action recently announced. We are seeking to repurchase 7.85% coupon bonds due in October of 2009. Swapping out this high fixed debt for more favorable variable debt is expected to yield about a penny benefit per quarter based on a 50% tender of the bonds. So if you add the full-year 2008 impact from the two middle sections you get the $0.07 of negative EPS impact associated with these actions. Therefore adjusted EPS guidance drops from what would have been $2.35 to $2.40, down to $2.28 to $2.33. It's important to note these actions yield a sizeable benefit starting in 2009 and accelerating in 2010, as the right two columns indicate, we see $0.15 per share benefit in 2009, net of expenses and anticipate up to $0.40 per share benefit in 2010. We appreciate you taking the time to let us grind through some of this detail, but as you could see, we believe the impact of actions we're taking today will have a meaningful pay back and when you consider we continue to prove our tax rate, we have removed the uncertainty associated with our Horizon legal case and we continue to invest in global growth, I think you'll see a continued strong performance from Pentair. Let's turn to slide 15. This is a summary look at current sales and EPS guidance versus the initial guidance we offered at the beginning of the year. Just quickly, in the upper left portion of this slide, our initial revenue guidance for continuing operations has been negatively impacted by sharper decline in the pool market as well as the North American residential exposed portions of our filtration and flow businesses. Technical product sales have exceeded our initial guidance and the rest of our operations sales are about as planned. In the upper right hand corner of the slide you can see our initial EPS guidance has also been impacted by the steep downturn in the pool market as well as a continued downturn in North American residential. However, this has been offset by strengthened technical products as well as a non-North American residential exposed water businesses. Benefits from pricing actions have offset incremental raw material inflation and benefits to the tax rate and interest have also helped offset the residential downturn. And, while it's not listed specifically on this slide, our cash outlook remains on track to exceed 100% of adjusted net income. Turning to slide 16, let's review our outlook for Q3. Overall, we expect sales to be up 3% to 4% to $845 million to $855 million. Adjusted operating income of $92 million to $96 million and adjusted EPS of $0.51 to $0.53. We expect water sales to be up about 3% on a reported basis and down a few points, excluding FX. Technical products faces tougher year-over-year comparison, but is still expected to grow mid-single digits. Overall, we expect Pentair adjusted margins to be about 11%. Our margin expectations include the residential filtration related impacts as well as the previously discussed restructuring actions. We expect our tax rate to be 33% and interest to be about 14 million. Our share count is expected to be close to 99.3 million shares, down over 1% year-over-year. And finally, we expect cash flow to be between $50 million and $75 million. Turning to slide 17, let's review our outlook for the full year. Overall, we expect sales to be up 4% to 5% to approximately $3.5 billion. Adjusted operating income is expected to be in the range of $415 million and as we've discussed in detail, adjusted EPS of $2.28 to $2.33. We expect water to be up about 1% for the year, technical products revenue is expected to be up low-double digits. Overall, Pentair margins are expected to be up modestly as we continue to overcome difficult residential markets and high commodity costs. Also in this margin assumption are the expenses associated with integration of the residential water filtration business and the pay as you go expenses for restructuring actions. We expect our tax rate to be 33%, as previously mentioned and interest to be about $60 million. Our share count is expected to be close to 99.4 million shares, down 1% year-over-year and we expect free cash flow to be greater than $235 million. Our debt position at the end of the year is expected to be approximately $940 million, including the purchase of 50 million of our shares under our authorization and debt to total capital is expected to be 31% to 32%. We appreciate your time and attention as we walk through a tremendous amount of detail. In summary, we continue to strengthen our business portfolio and persevere through the challenges of certain end markets and commodity pressures. Our updated EPS guidance reflects the cost of the actions we are taking today to yield a great pay back over the next 12 to 24 months. As a reminder, our 10-Q will be filed today so you can be on the look out for it. That concludes our review. Operator? We'll now open it up to questions. Question and Answer
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jim Lucas with Janney Montgomery Scott.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott: Thanks, good afternoon guys.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Jim.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott: And thank you very much for all the detail today. Two questions here, on technical products you touched on the end markets, but could you speak a little bit about some of the benefits if your getting them already of the GBU, combining electronic and electrical given some of the historical fits and starts you had on the electronic side.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Right, we got your comments. As you were referencing we combined the electronic and the electrical under [inaudible] the longtime leader of the electrical side of the business. The first benefit is he has done lot of G&A consolidation leveraging the expertise and capability in electrical to help take the cost out. The SG&A actually its higher in electronics, even though the margin in lower. So, it's clearly a big opportunity on the SG&A side. The second is, is that we had electrical plants, particularly owns in Mexico which were frankly running at 98% capacity in the electric side and running at 50% to 60% on the electronic side. So we are getting better leverage of the utilization there and also we are taking a broad technical products view on the growth side, so there is inferences in India and in China we are well rescued towards electronics, right now we are getting more of an effort on electricals. I think they are off to a really, really good start to get more cost benefit and growth benefit from it.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott: Okay. And from a strategic standpoint, I mean, clearly this was a very nice transaction with a new joint venture, you had the one divestiture earlier in the year, can you talk about from a managerial standpoint, how you are feeling about the portfolio today and are you in a position to pursue or are you even looking at anything along this scale, currently?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: You mean something of a similar size?
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott: Yes.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: The opportunity to merge the residential businesses into one business, we had a lot of sense to us and our team has worked really well. The nice thing about it is we picked up some great people, including the GM of this business actually comes from the GE side. And so we've actually picked up talent. We have also beefed-up our operating leadership under my Mike Schrock to better handle client consolidations and I think we have a really, really good plan for that. So the filtration business is going to be pretty tied up with this residential venture, but it is not going to slow us in terms of our organic growth investment and really in flow technology hasn't been affected by this and actually selling the National Pool Tile business, like we did is allowing our pool and spa business to focus on the heavy lifting they have to do their, given the downturns. So I don't feel like they were management constraint to do other deals. That said, my main focus is to build the same kind of organic growth culture in water that we've proven we have in technical product.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott: And finally on the Young acquisition, could you just bring us up-to-date there of how that integration has proceeded and has it delivered on what you had targeted when you made the deal?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Yes, they are slightly ahead of plan versus our acquisition plan, they have great product line, they've had solid growth, they've been everything we thought they could be in terms of helping us in Eastern Europe. I think there is more we can do in taking that product in the Middle East, I think there is more in that... I am not complaining because our Middle East business was up over 60% in water in the quarter. But I think there is still even more opportunity to leverage that. And as we solidify the GBU structure, I think that there is more we can do with the technology and their product lines globally. So, financially good, sales good and strategy still more opportunity.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott: Great, thank you very much.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Jim
Operator: Your next question coms from the line of Deane Dray with Goldman Sachs.
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs: Hi, gentlemen, you had kind of stepped us through the commentary, you said it twice that this was the worst pool season in the history of Pentair. So, just take us through where you think end market demand went during the course of the quarter, I mean, there is some replacement cycle that should still be somewhat resilient. So what's happening really in sell through, are you losing share and with distributor inventories being this slow, wouldn't that suggest that we're going to see a little bit further demand coming out of distributors later on?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Yes, Dean, let me start with the end market, as I mentioned, that is you pointed it out. The end market sales are sales out of distribution into the actual... in the actual pools came in about where we thought it would be, we thought it would be down about 10% driven largely... we are between 55% and 60% replacement, but with housing starts down so steeply, particularly where we have our largest market share. We are the largest market share player in Southern California, Las Vegas, Arizona, Texas, Florida. With the exception at Texas those are all the markets that have been impacted the worst in terms of the housing slowdown. That came in about like we thought. In terms of the end market sales, the replacement is happening, but the upgrades that we might expect to have happened isn't, people aren't upgrading like... they're not upgrading controls the way they... we'd like to see them do. So, I think we have an opportunity to do some better marketing and sales on the replacement cycle, but they are replacing pumps and they are replacing filters. So, in terms of the distribution drawing down inventory, I think part of that was the weather, it was a little bit of a slow start to the summer. So, I think they were over inventoried and that was one of the factors, but I also think they are being very cautious because they didn't see the pick up and together managing their own cash. So, I think we... I don't think we were bullish about what would happen with inventory, but I don't think we anticipated this. We anticipated later in the year, they typically take their inventory down at the end of the third quarter, which gets to maybe your last point, your last question, which was shouldn't the inventory be done, shouldn't that bow low for the second half. I wanted to put that... we wanted to that on the upside, we didn't want to count on this, so when we say that we expect the business to be down in the second half to 15%, we are not expecting a big inventory to climb, but that's also worse than a 10% run rate sell through. So, I'd say that our outlook is the sober one on that. I don't think we are losing share, I think that the markets that have slow down less are where we have lower share. So, I view that as an opportunity to be beef up [ph] our share, I am talking about the Midwest would stay right as strong where Pentair isn't such a strong brand. In the Northeast, Hayward is still the Number 1 brand, I think we have opportunities to beef up our share there.
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs: What about new products, I know in previous pool seasons there was a lot of commentary about the launch of new products in vitality index and it was awfully quite this quarter with regard to... last quarter, with regard to the expectations on new product contributions. Did that get dialed back or was there just not a contribution that you might...?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: No, they... I wish they were bigger. They are about in line, given... the whole problem is being down 22%, they couldn't really hold sway. We are being able to sell those in markets that are more sensitive, I think there is still more marketing we can do. When we did the marketing in Southern California, for instance, on the Intelliflo Pump and the IntelliTouch Controls, we did well. I think that we can do more of that. That said, we've been scrambling the deal with the 22% downturn. So, I think if the mix is about what we thought it would be. The uptake in the replacement market is a little softer than we'd like in some of these newer technology, but we are within... we are within striking distances when we thought we'd be volume lines on the new products.
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And just over line the joint venture, could you describe for us, I mean, you referred to the economics and a little about the scope of the joint venture, but how about on the product side in what markets specifically are you attacking jointly with this combination and where does the line on the joint venture end and where does the traditional some pump and paradigm that has residential exposure, where does that end?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Yes, actually, this is... let me just bound it for you. It's really one business, we're operating it as the vision of Pentair, we have a majority share owned by GE. But, we like that idea of keeping GE in a game because what they're bringing is the brand and they're bringing technologies, they're investing in some very good technology, residential isn't their focus, their market. So, they like the idea of getting a little bit up, check on some of their technologies they have developed. In particular, the technologies that they are bringing into this venture that we like, the home point or home springs, excuse me, the home spring whole-house ultrafiltration, which came from the Zenon acquisition and then the what's called [inaudible] RO system, which, we think both of those products have opportunities if they were more broadly distributed through the pro-channel, because it's a pro-channel kind of sale for most of those firms. So, we see real opportunity of that and we also see some other technologies that they are developing for the industrial and municipal space. They can triple down to the residential space. The scope of this is water conditioning valves, tanks, water filtration products, there are now some pumps there that none of our flow technologies business went into this venture. So, that's the scope around there. So, no well pumps and no well pumps. That set to the extent that we can leverage distribution like we've been trying to do and we've had some success of preferences with our industrial trust, between flow and filtration. I think we will do that, there certainly won't be any impediments to do that, though the cells were obviously can either get booked and flow technologies are in the residential filtration business.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President: So, do you know that that is an exclusive channel for residential in the market that Randy shared with you and it's a prepared supplier into the commercial, industrial side and each RDG and Pentair will continue to bring its own sales force to the industrial, commercial and municipal market.
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs: Thank you.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Schneider with Robert .W. Baird.
Michael Schneider - R.W. Baird: Good morning guys.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Michael Schneider - R.W. Baird: May be first, we could just focus on international water, curious when you look at the growth rates, by geography, international has been up about 10% according to the slide eight. And then the domestic business is municipal and commercial have been up about 12.5%, call it on on average. I'm curious why the domestic pump business is still not growing international given your lesser penetration overseas, its been a focused now for several years, Young pump that was growing strongly. Is there any particular constraint on the growth rate there?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Yes, we are going to refine that by the way, because its, I think there is still some export numbers getting booked in, and we're trying to separate them by vertical end market, but I think in particular in the pump arena where still lot of that product is getting booked as domestic even those going export for instance. Our...if you just take a look at our commercial pump business in North America, it grew up about 10%, we actually grew in the U.S. in flat market, commercial market we see as flat it actually grew mid-single digits, but it grew 50% exports. So, I don't think, we're probably don't have that split quite right yet, the reason ... Europe that's without the benefit of FX, those growth rate. And Europe, Western Europe has slowed to being single-digit kind of growth, so that drags it down. Asia continues to be the 30% kind of grower in China and India that we've been seeing and as I mentioned Middle East actually has grown over 60%. So, we are continuing to put efforts against that. So, I think when we have our Analyst Day, which is coming up, our Investors Day, we are going to refine these numbers more fully. So, I wouldn't say that there is much more than that, just find the difference.
Michael Schneider - R.W. Baird: Okay. And then could you just dig one level deeper and talk about Aurora and Fairbanks Morse domestically? Have you seen pressures on municipal budgets or project delays at all begin to unfold in those businesses?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Well, we've seen... I was talking about Aurora actually when I gave you those numbers before. It was over 5%, [inaudible] 5% and 8% growth in domestic commercial sales, although we think commercial construction was flat. So, we think some of our new products at variable speed and some of our other new products have actually helped us gain share in the US and as I mentioned, exports are way up. So... and that is Asia and that is Middle East where those exports are going. So, that's how we view Aurora. Aurora is really probably, I don't the exact number, but probably approaching 40% non-US now, which is outstanding. In the municipal side, if you take out the big New Orleans whale [ph] and look at year-over-year, our municipal backlog is up and our order rate has been really, really strong even excluding the additional efforts we've done outside. So, we haven't seen any slowing in municipal, not in our book of business.
Michael Schneider - R.W. Baird: Okay. And then in Technical Products, the growth rates on slide 10 show that you are expecting the growth [ph] from 16% to 9% first half to second half. It looks like... and at least we heard from your distributors there was another price increase that went out effective mid-year. Did you enjoy a pre-buy in Q2 that would have detracted from what's coming in Q3?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: We've probably picked up a little of benefit, Mike, but not significant order rates. We are pretty good all through the quarter, strong all through the quarter. And frankly the first couple of weeks of July were pretty good too. So, my guess was we thought we might pick up a little, but... we probably did, but it's not... it's not really significant in my mind.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President: It would probably be a point or two, Mike. I think the one thing to remind you is that if you take a look at electronics last year, we had a difficult first half of 2007 and we began recovering in Q3 and Q4 of 2007. So, part of the year-over-year delta in the growth rate is a squeeze in the electronics contribution in second half of the year. Electrical, we are forecasting to be a little slower growth and we are anticipating that the price increase hold a couple of points as mentioned from Q3 into Q2.
Michael Schneider - R.W. Baird: And then similar question on margins. Is it... is it the case where pricing in the first half has actually outpaced or preceded your raw material inflation curve such that it looks like you are actually forecasting down margins in the second half, is that just raw materials now actually flowing through inventory in the income statement?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Well, we do think we'll see greater inflation in the second half, which is one of the pressures on margin. But the other big one, Mike, is we are assuming that electronics is going to play a bigger role in global and they have lower margins than North American electrical by a lot, as we've talked about before. We still haven't gotten electronics close to the 10% goal that I have for that business for those segments. So, I'd say it's probably as larger mix as the increased inflation in the second half.
Michael Schneider - R.W. Baird: Okay. Then John, just a nuance on the income statement regarding the GE joint venture, will there be a new line item there in the equity income being detected below the line going forward?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President: No. We already have that line right now for the paradigm, where we put the paradigm in the minority interest. So, we will put this through that same line. It's still exploring exact answers that Mike [ph], but that's our intent right now, and if you guys needed, I mean you could see the paradigm piece right now, and the delta will be with the GE pieces.
Michael Schneider - R.W. Baird: Yeah, okay and in my writings, it's going to run four plus million a quarter, is that sounds right ?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President: No, that's probably a little high, I mean right now if you are taking a look at a forecast number there... they are going have to observe about 20% of the DNA and 20% of the inventories step-ups and 20% of the integration as well. So it's more in the $2.5 million range for Q3 and Q4 and then it would ramp up to the number that you are referring to and the '09 in 2010 timeframe.
Michael Schneider - R.W. Baird: Got it. Thank you again.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President: Thank you, Mike.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Curtis Woodworth with JPMorgan.
Curtis Woodworth - JP Morgan Curt: Hi, good afternoon, guys.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President: Hi, Curtis.
Curtis Woodworth - JP Morgan Curt: In terms of the facility rationalization of the six plants you commented on, $0.40 of cost saving that associated with that, can you walk through the timing and when you expect all those facilities to be fully rationalize?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President: Sure. Let me start with the residential filtration business first. We announced the Rockford and Sheboygan plants yesterday, and those are the two large ones within resin filtration piece. Rockford, we would expect that we'd be able to get after that in about a year time frame. We are anticipating on the Sheboygan side that that's probably more than 18 month closure because of the certifications required due to the tanks in the water filtration that we are make in that particular plant. Sheboygan pieces the commercial and residential plants. So we are moving the commercial products to some of our locations locally and also overseas, as well as we move into China and Mexico on both Rockford and Sheboygan. So, call it 12 months for Rockford, about 18 months for Sheboygan. The France consolidation will be record over six months, a type of transition and the easier moves that Randy mentioned will also be within that six months time frame. There are pretty much least facilities closed to our locations, and we should be able to move the assets relatively quickly. The other large factory that we mentioned is our Cyprus, California, and that's in our industrial filtration business that probably posted the one year time frame for closure.
Curtis Woodworth - JP Morgan Curt: Okay. So, in terms of the $0.40, how much of that would be additive to the savings you identified with the GE joint venture?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President: I think we broke it out. Net charge is about $0.20 related to the JV and the rest related to non-JV [inaudible].
Curtis Woodworth - JP Morgan Curt: Okay. So that... that encompasses then kind of the aggregate of all these moves, the joint venture and...?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President: Yeah, we try to break them out [inaudible] to say, okay, $0.20 comes from the residential, but $0.16 comes from these factory and G&A structure moves and then the $0.04 comes from the bond.
Curtis Woodworth - JP Morgan Curt: Got it, I got. And then in terms of the outlook and back half of the year for the commercial and industrial segments, you are basically articulating the similar growth rate in the first half of up 10%, I guess for U.S. and Europe, can you walk us through, how that analysis was made, I mean it seems that from a conservative outlook on the global economy, the growth rates, you would think that there would may be a little bit lower or similar what you are seeing in technical products, I am just curious, what you are seeing, how your backlog is looking to give you the confidence in that number?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President: I mean, I think, we are pretty comfortable with the numbers we gave. I mean we have certain end markets like agricultural, certainly oil and gas, a lot of those markets are really doing well and continue to be robust. As to remind everybody, Porous Media is still a fantastic operation that we have acquired and they are benefiting from the energy and the [inaudible] as well and ahead of plan. So, we have some good tailwind in some of the end markets we're servicing. And other than what I would say... and food service continues to be stronger as well.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Food service is a great story. I mean we are up double digits in food service, and I think by all rights and measure, I don't think the food service industry is growing right now. So, I think if the testaments are new products and our ability to gain market share, these numbers on the charts are sales, so for instance our commercial markets, we think commercial probably be down as the market, but we have new products both in water and in tech products, which we think will still allow us to grow in the single digit kind of category. Okay?
Curtis Woodworth - JP Morgan Curt: Okay. And one final question on the water margins, if you would have tried to normalize for the pool business, the incremental margins are very high there in 2Q for pool, could you give us a sense for how the water margins would have looked this quarter or said in another way, what was the margin hit from pool?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Well, it was the $7 million just from... well, if you took it all out, it will be more than $0.07 a share, and it will be more than that.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President: I would think of it as, our pool equipment business was roughly a 10% margin business. It is a easier math, I would just think a 30% conversion.... on the job.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: If you go to page seven and you look at the lost sales, that's largely $30 million in the… and you take 30% that's $9 million and $9.642 million would have been a... we are actually been up year-over-year in margin.
Curtis Woodworth - JP Morgan Curt: I got. Okay. Great, thanks very much.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President: Thanks, Curt.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer & Co.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co: Thank you. Most of mine have been asked... hey, how are you?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President: Good.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co: Most of mine have been asked, just on the price, I was thinking maybe inching that closer to two, maybe you are not getting some areas little tougher to get the price you may be anticipate a little earlier in the year?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President: No. I would say that in technical products, we came out of the gate, three technical products with the price increase early and as Mike mentioned we also went in within our Q2. I would candidly say I think our water businesses were a little bit more optimistic on the benefit of sourcing early in the year and by the time they got the price increases in, it was towards the tail end of Q2.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Because when they did, they did with expecting a little bit lighter inflation. So, and now we are adjusting, we will increase the price action to cover the impact of the raw materials.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co: So more price in the second half?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Correct. Yes.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co: Okay. And on the sourcing, what kind of start out there held it back?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: I think, primarily the... there's two-fold. One is the impact of the raw materials and is not much any of us can do to control the inflation that's happening out there in certain core products, especially things like motors and that would be an area that we have lost ground on and then the second one is any time you are losing volume, you have less scale to go out and to negotiate from, and with the downturn in the volume in some of the water core markets, we are struggling a little bit with the commodity negotiations.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co: Okay. So nothing in terms of feed on the Streeter exploring the opportunities in low cost regions or anything like that?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President: No. I assure you we're all over that and we will definitely, Randy, Mike, and I have all turned up to eat on that and...
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co: I agree.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President: The source index and we got to make faster progress here.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: All right. I mean the resin, steel, motors, they are all higher so a lot of the productivity has to come with innovation to change one of the things, Mike [ph] was talking about changing the bronze in color to stainless steel, and that's a re-design we make, we have that product line, but it's a different sale for the customer. So it's just... it's a steeper help, but we got good ideas.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co: Okay. And just one book keeping, the six facilities cited in the restructuring in the press release and the five through the GE JV, those are... there is overlap there, right?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President: I am sorry, say it again, Chris.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co: Yeah. The restructuring announced in the press release showing six facilities and then in the slides five facilities related to the GE JV?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Five related to the residential filtration business plus the Cyprus, California plant is the sixth. And that's an industrial filtration.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co: Okay. Great, Thanks a lot.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President: Thank you.
Todd Gleason - Vice President, Investor Relations: Chris [ph].This is Todd. We were comfortable in overtime. Just to want to check to see how many people are in the queue?
Operator: You have one more person.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President: All right. You go. Do that and close that.
Operator: And your next question comes from Francesca McCann with Stanford Financial.
Francesca McCann - Stanford Financial: Hi, [inaudible].
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Francesca.
Francesca McCann - Stanford Financial: I'll be pretty quick here. Do you think you can walk us through any additional detail in terms of what actions you are going to take for pool?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President: Yeah, I will be specific and brief. I think the one area that we continue to explore is what we can do about Spa and Bath and our Spa and Bath business just like our pool equipment business is exposed to a difficult market, and we are exploring all options there from monetizing the athletes to taking a look at what we can do to more effectively run the business in its current operation. And we want to make the right economic position and our team is all over. We have a great leader who is driving the process and we continue to make progress.
Francesca McCann - Stanford Financial: What about actions related to pool non-Spa, I mean ...we've known for a long time that Spa business is not a very good business, so what about for the rest of the business?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Well. We have been aggressively taking cost out of the factories. We've maintained our investments in new product developments and actually we've increased our investment in the commercial pool area, which is actually not declined as we've seen growth in that, and it's not reading out because of the big downturn in residential. Structurally, the pool business, we owned that for ten years, this was the worst quarter in ten years, and for 8.5 of those years, the pool business was our fastest growing, most innovative, and frankly most attractive part of water. And the last 18 months has proven, it is not recession-proof, particularly after an 18-year party, but this business had in terms of growth. And, my view is as I said in the script, I think, I am expecting this business to be stronger coming out. I expect them to have a... maintain their leadership and the sales force that we have, maintain the leadership in the product innovation that we have, and to improve our share in some of the markets where we are weaker mostly in the North, which hasn't had this steeper decline as the South... in North America. So, I think we... it's the one thing I didn't mention is that the Pool has never read out as one of our great manufacturing operations. I really like to see them come out of it as being at least average.
Francesca McCann - Stanford Financial: Okay. And once we finally do so see some turnaround in the housing market, what kind of time delay do you anticipate with some uptick in... for you in pool?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: My bet, and I've been through a downturn in the pool, so my bet would be as soon as the market comes back [inaudible] inventory and it could come back pretty fast. I don't anticipate that in the second half.
Francesca McCann - Stanford Financial: Right. But say another three or four quarters, you think that Pool sales would kind of be automatically correlated with an improvement in the housing market?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President: I think we are in from six to nine months or twelve month delay and I think housing market come back, that's been benefit our flow and filtration businesses quicker, the housing starts [inaudible] behind the new house or house within a year time frame, and we will see that lag slightly for Q4 of 2009, I think we will be the telling quarter for us and what would be the early buyers for the 2010 anticipation. And we will probably have indications of any inventory built prior to that. Will you add, Randy?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: I would, but I will bet it's faster than that.
Francesca McCann - Stanford Financial: Okay. Yeah I just wanted your take on that, and then one other question, you're looking out longer term, kind of overall margin about a year, year and half ago, you had been talking about margin goal of 15%. I know that we will see more volatility coming up, but looking at adjusted margins for all of the restructuring efforts that you are putting in, where do you see kind of broken down between water and technical products margins being in near longer term?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President: I think as I said to you, Francesca, and said to many and all, I think our water business is a 20% plus margin business, I mean that's what our expectation is, and 15% as a point along the way, and I think the actions that we've laid out today clearly identify a pretty clear path to 15% plus, and as Randy mentioned earlier, technical products, which today is 16% has a significant amount of opportunity in global tech products, especially with electronics. So, I think both of these businesses will be high teens and heading to $0.20, that's kind of where we are hoping to drive them and that's our expectation.
Francesca McCann - Stanford Financial: And that's over the next two, three years or beyond?
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President: Three to four.
Francesca McCann - Stanford Financial: Three to four. Okay. Alright I think that's it for me. Thank you.
John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President: Alright, thank you. Todd?
Todd Gleason - Vice President, Investor Relations: Yeah, okay Crystal [ph], thank you for helping us host the call and everyone thanks for participating on today's call. We will be around, if you have any questions, feel free to give us a call and also we hope to see everyone here in Minneapolis on September 9th and 10th for our annual investor and analyst day. Thank you.

Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risk and uncertainties, such as the risk outlined in Pentair's 10-K, as of December 31st, 2007 in Pentair news releases. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could different materially from anticipated results. Today webcast is accompanied by a presentation, which can be found in the Financial Information section of our website at www.pentair.com. Please go to the Webcast section, its located there. We will reference these slides to our prepared remarks. Any references to non-GAAP financials are reconciled in the appendix of the presentation. I would also like to point out that all financial results and references to year-end numbers in today's call and presentation are on continuing operations basis unless otherwise noted or highlighted. As is our custom, we will reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. I will now hand the call over to Randy, who will take you through Pentair's first quarter results and highlights, highlight key growth drivers and initiatives, provide his perspective on the markets in which we operate and describe some of the actions we are taking to ensure we deliver expected results this year. Then John will conclude our follow remarks with an overview of our second quarter of full year forecast, Randy?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Todd and thank you all for joining us today. Let's begin by reviewing our first quarter results shown on slide two of the document Todd just referenced. Summarizing our first quarter, we had very good performance and we are off to a great start in 2008. We delivered $0.53 per share of earnings from continuing operations on revenue growth of 6%. The $0.53 is up 26% versus the $0.42 clocked in the first quarter of 2007. Additionally, the $0.53 bested the high end of our EPS guidance of $0.46 to $0.48 by $0.05 per share. You can think about this as a $0.04 beat from the strong growth and resulting margin leverage in our technical products business, and $0.01 beat from water margins. We will provide additional detail on each of the businesses in a few minutes. Now to review the highlights of our first quarter performance overall; Pentair first quarter sales of $840 million were 6% above the $793 million in sales we generated in the first quarter last year. Our organic growth was 3% in the quarter or flat in local currencies. The diversity of our businesses and investments for growth in international, commercial and municipal markets enabled us to overcome the much headlined softness in the North American residential markets. Acquisitions added another 3% to our top line versus last year. First quarter sales in our Water segment were up 3% year-over-year. Water margins were 11.6%, flat when compared to first quarter 2007 after adjusting for the sale of National Pool Tile in both periods. We will walk through the Water sales and margin details in a few minutes. Our Technical Products' business grew 13% in the first quarter versus Q1 2007, as our electrical business and international electronics businesses achieved double-digit growth. Our North American electronics business grew single-digits versus last year. Overall, for Technical Products with 13% sales growth and the continued strong results from our lean driven productivity efforts enabled us to expand first quarter operating margins an impressive 340 basis points. As the slide shows, overall, Pentair expanded margins 120 basis points. Looking at total company margins year-over-year, the positive impact from volume, price, acquisitions and mix, coupled with solid productivity, provided 380 basis points of margin growth in aggregate. This seasonally offset a negative 260 basis points impact from total inflation and foreign exchange. As expected, our first quarter effective tax rate was lower. The 34% rate reflects the great work our team has done. We bought back shares worth $12.5 million in the quarter and we have $37.5 million remaining on our authorization, which we expect to fully utilize in 2008. As the slide shows, interest expense hurt us by $0.01 of EPS versus last year, as the 2007 acquisition of Jung Pump and Porus Media resulted in higher debt levels. We had a nice start to the year in free cash flow despite the fact that there was a usage cash of $78 million. As you know, receivables and inventories grow in our first quarter as we prepare for seasonal sales in the coming months. First quarter cash flow is also typically impacted by the dispersion of bonuses and customer and distributor rebates. The negative $78 million in free cash flow results met our expectations and we're on track to deliver at least 100% conversion of income from continuing operations. So those were the Pentair level of highlights for the first quarter. Now let's turn to slide number three, which highlights the divestiture we completed in the first quarter of National Pool Tile. As we announced in the first quarter, we sold the National Pool Tile business, or NPT to Pool Corp. NPT is a distributor of Pool related tile and decking products for the North American pool market. It's been a great growth business for us during the pool boom, but it's not central to the equipment business. By selling NPT, we honed our Water portfolio to better match our strategy of focusing on core equipment solutions and the business has a better home, where it's part of their core strategy. In 2007, NPT generated approximately $68 million in sales and lost a few million dollars in operating profit. Removing NPT from continuing operations improves Water margins approximately 30 basis points. 1The transaction is classified as discontinued operations and results in negative $0.08 earnings per share again in the quarter. Of which $0.07 was the loss on the sale of business and $0.01 related to NPT's financial results during the portion of the first quarter, while we still owned it. So a good distribution asset for Pool Corporation and a good move for our portfolio. Now, let's dive in our ongoing Water business and discuss first quarter results. So please turn to slide four where we'll cover that. Overall, Water Group sales $15 million to $555 million, up 3% versus last year sales. Organic sales were down 4%. The composition of our total water sales are shown on the top left section of the slide. In the walk you can see we had a fairly sizable decline in volumes versus the first quarter last year. Of that $22 million decline, about $15 million was because of the timing benefit we received in Q1 2007 for some of our Q4 2006 early buy orders carrying over into 2007. We highlighted this during last year's Q1 earnings call and it makes up the bulk of our sales decline year-over-year. Now let me give you some color on our Water Global business unit. Starting with Flow Technologies, GBU; sales grew 8% globally or up 5% when you adjust for the 2007 acquisition of Jung Pump. Flow continues to see strength in commercial, agricultural and municipal markets. Flow's commercial pump product line shipped a record number of units in the first quarter, in large part because of strong international sales. We expect over 30% of commercial pumps produced in the United States to be sold internationally this year. This is up over 10 percentage points in international sales since the end of the 2005. Flow's residential markets remain soft in the first quarter as expected. The weather was a positive factor, the heavy rains and snowfall helped drive residential sump pump sales. Our Faradyne joint venture continues on a positive trend as our customer acceptance of our Pentek model pumps remains greater than 90%. In municipal we continue to have record backlog of 20% year-over-year. This is particularly impressive when you take into consideration that last year our back log included the $21 million in New Orleans job. If you exclude that project our backlog is up over 60%. We made nice progress developing our global municipal pump strategy, so we anticipate continued growth in this space. In a few minutes we will highlight one of our new leading energy efficient municipal pumps that enabled us to win a key project recently. We're just beginning to introduce this technology at desalination projects and are starting to bid on the multitude of opportunities in that space. Our Filtration GBU was up 8% versus last year, but down single-digits when you exclude the 2007 acquisition of Porus Media. The organic sales decline was driven entirely by softness in the North American residential market, where demand for water treatment systems is down double-digit. We continue to have good growth in our food service and industrial filtration product lines, which were both up approximately 10%. We'll highlight more about our food service and industrial filtration solutions again in a few minutes. Our Pool GBU was down 10%, year-over-year a little worse than expected. Adjusting for the $15 million in 2007 first quarter carry over sales, our pool business was flat despite pool and spa markets being down double-digits. Key pool markets such as California, Florida, Arizona and Texas are all experiencing pool permit decline in the 20% to 60% range. Despite these battered markets, our pool business continues to maintain solid performance as our energy efficient and environmentally sensitive EcoSelect initiative continues to drive sales volume. We continue to invest in new applications and look to maintain our position as the leader in new product development. In fact approximately 50% of the business' technology budget is spent on new products, many of which are new to the market, not just new to Pentair. In commercial pool we grew sales over 30% in the quarter. We will highlight this segment more in a few minutes when we review our global growth initiatives. So our outlook for the residential pool and spa market is very cautious. We continue to invest in new products, distribution and global solutions for our commercial applications. We believe these actions couple with the divestiture of the National Pool Tile business better position our pool business for future growth. You can see on the chart that we provide growth figures for our international regions. We continue to make solid progress integrating our region or regional teams and strategies to realize true global business units. However, we intend to still provide you with these regional figures so you can track the progress of our international growth. The Europe, Middle East and Africa or EMEA was up 17%, but about flat when you remove the positive impact of foreign exchange and acquisitions. However, Eastern Europe and the Middle East grew almost 50% in the quarter. The flooring tiles [ph] and other investments in these fast growing areas and we expect continued strong growth in 2008. Asia continues to grow and was up 23% year-over-year. More importantly, orders were up over 40% in the first quarter. This growth demonstrates the continued success we're having in the region. Another item I'd point out is that our GBUs are working closely together to leverage each others strengths in distribution and technology. For example, our desalination backlog associated with our CodeLine vessels is at historic highs and our quote book is also at record levels. We're working to leverage our CodeLine knowledge and contacts within desalination and now have a quote backlog in our flow technologies business associated with numerous exciting desalination opportunities. So the major growth focus, we'd like to stress is that we continue to invest heavily in our global business unit structure and products for key markets. This is a journey, we're having success and we expect more growth throughout 2008 and more in 2009 from these investments. On the top right, you can see our year-over-year operating income walk for water. Margins were 11.6%, flat year-over-year, despite declining volumes in our North American residential related products, high materials inflation and tough comps in pool. We had a nice impact from productivity, which contributed a positive 220 basis points. Our lean initiatives are yielding positive results and we continue to work to reduce our fixed costs. In aggregate, growth in productivity offset a negative 270 basis point impact from total inflation and enabled us to achieve first quarter Water margins of 11.6%, a bit better than our expectation. If you normalize for the $15 million in Q1 early buy benefit, last year's margins expanded 40 basis points, which is highlighted in the bullet point. We point out that the sale of NPT does improve margins about 30 basis points from what we reported in water last year. So we feel good about improving our water portfolio. We continue to take new actions to improve our profitability and footprint. In the quarter, we initiated the shut down of a factory in UK. Additionally, we are making good progress on the restructuring actions we took in the second half of 2007. Let's now move to slide number five and review our Technical Products business. Similar to water, we provide you with total business sales and operating income loss of the upper half of the chart. Technical Products results in the first quarter were outstanding, as we grew sales 13% and achieved margins of 15.9%. Let's review what enabled our businesses to have better than originally expected performance in the quarter. As we look at our sales results, our global electrical business grew 10% versus last year, as we continue to take advantage of a strong and diverse business model. Our Thermal And Networking vertical market, each grew 30% year-over-year. We continue to see solid performance in our Hoffman channels, which serve over 20 different vertical markets. Our global electronics business grew 18%, every region posted positive growth and our Asia Pacific electronics business grew 46%. Looking at Technical Products' margins, growth and productivity together contributed 520 basis points of margin expansion. This easily offset the impact of a negative 180 basis points from total inflation. Our lean-driven productivity actions continued to prove solid results as we have excellent conversion from the 13% sales growth. We are executing well in the 2007 restructuring actions, which include the shut down of facilities outside Chicago and one in the UK. By reducing our technical products footprint, we believe we will get even better operating leverage, even if we see lower growth markets. Given the increase in the metal prices, mainly steel for technical products, we recently introduced new price actions in the segment. We believe these actions have been accepted by our customers and our product really sized to offset commodity pressure. We are also making great progress integrating our electric and electronics organizations into one global business unit. By leveraging best practices in sourcing and lean and leveraging administrative functions, we believe we can continue the momentum we started to build in technical products margin expansion. So in sum, Technical Products delivered a strong top line and had great executions to deliver outstanding bottom line results in Q1. We believe this segment is well positioned for the balance of the year. Let's move to slide number six, which shows our financial metrics. In particular, I would like to highlight cash and return on invested capital or ROIC. As mentioned earlier, we had a usage of $78 million of free cash flow in the first quarter, roughly equal to our result in same period of 2007. We continued to make progress in regard to working capital, but there is still lot of opportunity to improve further, particularly in inventories. If we take a look at the components of return on invested capital to the right of the slide, you see our fourth quarter trailing net operating profit after tax, or NOPAT was $274 million. Our average invested capital was $2.89 billion, which gives us an after tax or ROIC of 9.5%. This is up 50 basis points versus the same metric a year ago, and we continue to drive for steady improvements in this key metric. Our ending working capital was $512 million, an increase of $26 million versus last year and our five quarter moving average working capital is $437 million, which is 12.9% of fourth quarter's trailing sales. Our total debt was just over $1.1 billion, for a debt to total capital ratio of 36%. As a remainder the non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliations of these calculations in numbers are included in the appendix of this presentation. Now please turn to chart number seven. The next three slides are designed to highlight how we view and are seizing market opportunities for growth. Throughout 2008, we will provide an update on market opportunities and our growth initiatives. These next few charts lay the foundation for future quarterly update. This slide highlights global growth driver that have attractive long-term growth characteristic. As the chart show, they are energy efficiency, which represents the global demand from more cost effective solutions. The environment, which represents a growing awareness and willingness to pay for new technical solutions that will reduce the impact on our global environment. Infrastructure, which is the major opportunity for the companies like Pentair, they're going to assist emerging reasons develop industrial, commercial and residential infrastructure as well as aid in the replacement of ageing infrastructure in developed nations. Regulation, which represents the changing and more stringent legislative actions that are being put in place to better husband our water resources. Health and safety, which is garnering even more global awareness as developing areas often need advanced solutions to stave off diseases. Also as global weather pattern shift, there is a need to defend flood zones and protect coastal cities. And finally, industrialization, which is happening rapidly in Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. These regions require water and natural resources for industrial development, which is driving mining and exploitation needs as well. These processes are opportunities for our filtration, flow and technical product solutions. These global growth drivers aren't new and certainly we are not the only company to focus on these as growth opportunities. But we highlight them today to animate why we are performing well. We aren't just a residential focus company. You can see we have placed check marks next to each growth opportunity, as the next few slides demonstrate, we are successfully providing specific solutions in each of these areas and we have strategies to capture more growth. Now let's turn to slide number eight. This slide shows our seven key growth initiatives. To give you some history on these initiatives; 18 months ago, as we began to see the decline in residential markets, we prioritized these seven areas as key opportunities for Pentair based on the growth drivers. Now clearly, we have many other growth initiatives within our businesses, but these are ones where we've put additional resources and established global teams that have high level oversight, with either Mike Schrock or me, reviewing them on a monthly basis. You can read the information on the charts. I'll just quickly walk through some of the detail. The segment of Industrial Filtration we are focusing on is a large and growing $20 billion market. We've more than doubled our size in this space when we acquired Porus Media last year. This area specifically addresses industrialization and environmental global themes. We expect to grow our $100 million Industrial Filtration business by another 20% this year, similar to our organic growth rate in 2007. The second key growth initiative is food service. I know we've made a pretty big deal about this segment over the past year, that's because it is a big deal for us. First, it is our most global business. Also last year, we crossed the $100 million mark in this market. We have tremendous partnership with Eco Lab and with our customers such as Starsbucks, McDonald's and others. Restaurant and food service providers are more concerned about health and safety and increasingly about the environment. Our food service products help water with purity and efficiency within the food preparation process. We see double-digit growth in 2008 and our global expansion in this area continues to be very impressive. The third initiative is RO/Desalination. We continue to grow our CodeLine product line where we have the leading market share in desalination installations. As we aggressively introduce new pumps and pre-filtration applications, we are leveraging our project intimacy to get at bat for those products and we expect to grow even more rapidly in this $5 billion market space. The fourth initiative is Technical Products, India. While currently very small in terms of revenue, we think the market is at least $400 million, and not many companies are as uniquely qualified to participate as our technical products business. We have invested in sales and distribution; we are going establish a dedicated manufacturing facility in the country by year-end. The fifth initiative is Commercial Pools, which plays into the energy efficiency and health and safety platforms. Most hotels have pool or spas. The equipment installed in most of the world's pools is much less efficient than our current platform of EcoSelect products. Last year, we grew 30% in this $50 million market segment and have lots of room for growth, since we estimate the market size at $1 billion globally. The next initiative is our growth investment in Latin America, which is increasingly expanding its infrastructure in industrial footprint. We currently sell about $80 million into the region and we have the ability to go rapidly there. We expect double-digit growth in 2008 and our team is making real progress with sales channels and distribution. Our seventh key initiative is water reuse, which is becoming a hot topic with the growing crisis around water availability in more and more places. In Australia, there are a number of regulatory measures being considered that would require increased water reuse. We have integrated pump and filtration solutions and more are being developed. The market is estimated at over $1 billion, but until major legislation is passed, it is truly hard to estimate the size for the potential. These seven key growth initiatives play into the global growth themes that we highlighted on slide number seven. As you can see, we continue to make real progress with each initiative. Let's turn to slide number nine and review a few specific products or initiatives at a more granular level. As we drill in a little deeper, here's how we are changing what we do to get after these opportunities. This slide shows four examples of programs or products driving our key growth initiatives. Starting with industrial filtration, our Porus Media product line has developed leading filtration products to serve the oil and gas extraction, refining, in petrochemical end markets. Porus is heretofore focused on U.S. opportunities almost exclusively. Now we are leveraging this technology to provide similar solutions in the Middle East, Europe and Asia. The product's improved up time was socialized several multiple higher than existing approaches and reduced disposal on operating cost by as much as 50%. On the top right of slide we highlight one of our thermal solutions that we are driving in technical products. Many outside observers of Pentair may not be aware of this growing thermal product line within technical products. These products are becoming more critical as the power of electronics increase and as the global economy reaches new industrial areas. Many of these emerging regions and deployments have harsher environments, whether its temperature or other demanding environmental conditions. Our Thermal Enclosures provide energy efficient, cooling or heating devices to protect and extend the life of the critical electronic equipment. This is one of the fastest growing areas of technical products, as we mentioned it grew over 30% in the first quarter and it has double-digit margins. As I mentioned earlier we are leveraging our CodeLine market knowledge within the desalination market and we've introduced a line of large pumps that have three to four points of energy efficiency advantage for desalination projects. In fact, while not a de-sal project, the city of New York purchased these pumps through their Crotonville, New York municipal treatment center, based on this greater efficiency. Finally, our commercial pool applications are being installed with great success. Last year, we showed you that we installed one of our hotel pool equipment solutions at the Shanghai Marriot we saved the hotel 85% on their energy and maintenance cost. We believe we are well positioned for our new construction, a retrofit for energy and environmental upgrade. So this is just a few of the many exciting applications we have deployed to help our customers and to participate in the major global growth of things. Before I turn it over to John, let me update you on our outlook for our major markets in 2008. On slide number 10, you can see our current view of the major markets versus how we initially planned. We also provide update on our original market expectations as well as the market performance in 2007. To be helpful, the pie chart in the left of the slides are geographic and market mix as we exited 2007. This is from our fourth quarter earnings presentation. Taking a look at our markets, we would say the U.S. residential markets are in a more pronounced downturn in 2008 than we originally expected. We planned for down 15% to 20% in this market, we now expect at least a negative 25%. This encompasses a number of variables including housing starts and pool permits. This negative 25% for example assumed 2008 housing start of around 700,000 units. So it's pretty dismal. Other than this market which you can see is red versus our initial outlook, we would also point out that our other markets while not always expanding as strongly as 2007 are generally in line with our planning assumptions and remember we pointed out that many of our market assumptions were from moderating growth in key areas like commercial, industrial and Europe. As I mentioned earlier, we are also increasing price in many of our product lines to reflect the increased cost associated with metals and other commodities. So our planned price increase of 1% to 2% was too low and we're stepping up to a higher level. I'm sure we will see market segments both outperform and under perform our current out look, and we feel we are closing moderating the key trends that impact our business and we will adjust our forecast and actions accordingly. Now I turn it over to John for our second quarter and full year guidance overview. John?
John L. Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Randy. Let's start by reviewing slide number 11 and take a look at our expectations for the second quarter. Our Q2 and full year forecast reflect our outlook that the North American residential market will not improve in 2008 and may even further contract, particularly in our pool equipment in our North American residential water treatment businesses. In water, we expect sales to be flat to down. We continue to see strong export related shipments in our industrial and commercial segments, but these are not enough to offset the continued softness in North American residential. Additionally, last year in the second quarter, we sold $21 million of municipal pump to the city of New Orleans. That project coupled with our expectation at the pool market will remain down high single to low double-digits; suppressed our outlook for growth in the water business in the second quarter. Overall though, we would say that 2008 Q2 is in line with our planned expectations including our corporate contingency. Our forecast for sales growth for first half of 2008 does not properly reflect the organic growth run rate in water due to the year-over-year headwinds. We believe water's real ongoing growth rate is around 3% for 2008 and once we begin to experience even a modest market recovery in North American residential, we expect to feedback to our 5% to 8% targeted water organic growth rate. We continue to fund our selling, marketing and R&D investments to serve the global demand in water for our products in growth regions. As for Technical Products, we expect moderating markets to impact sales in the second quarter, although we enter the quarter with solid order trends. Our forecast for the GBU is high single-digit growth as compared to low teen growth in the first quarter. We would suggest that our rebound in electronics is based on a few factors. As you may remember, the first half of 2007 was down dramatically because the market consolidation and the timing of certain orders in our business. Second, we continue to diversify and broaden our vertical market offerings which provides for more balance. In electrical, the strong U.S. industrial cycle continues. As a weak dollar provides insulation from other parts of the U.S. economy, driving an increase n export shipments. We have planned and forecasted for moderating growth in many of our verticals, therefore we continue to implement cost controls and pricing actions, which we think is prudent. Moving on, we expect the operating income to be between $114 million and $120 million. This should produce operating margins of about 12.5%, about flat with 2007 second quarter margins. We expect margins to benefit from additional productivity, driven by our lean initiatives, benefits from our growing pipeline of sourcing actions, our moves to emerging regions and a continual focus on reducing structure. Also the acquisitions we made in 2007 provide margin support as they continue to perform very well. We expect to maintain a 34% tax rate, as we continue to realize the benefit of a European water business move to Switzerland in 2007, and the shift of manufacturing to more favorable tax regions. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $16 million, down about $2 million year-over-year, as our debt levels are expected to be reduced by cash generations. Finally, we are forecasting second quarter free cash flow to at least $125 million, as we drive toward our full year target of at least 100% conversion of income from continuing operations. So, as we previously mentioned, we expect second quarter EPS between $0.64 and $0.67, up between 5% and 10% on a year-over-year basis. Another way to look at our second quarter performance is to consider how we expect to do given some of our year-over-year hurdles. Please turn to slide 12. As we mentioned earlier, last year in the second quarter, we had a nice pick up in the large flow technologies municipal pump project in New Orleans. We continue to see solid results in our municipal vertical market and our municipal orders and backlog, are up double-digits even after the completion of this project. The upper two-thirds of this slide provides an analysis comparing our current second quarter forecast versus last year, with and without this large New Orleans job. We are not apologizing for the lumpy nature of these municipal projects, but we thought it might be helpful to evaluate the second quarter year-over-year this way. You will also note that at the bottom of the slide we highlight our second quarter guidance, also reflects the softer markets in pool and residential construction as well as higher than originally planned metals inflation. Despite these market conditions, we continue to invest in our GBU growth initiatives and new technologies. We still have a solid line of sight toward achieving our full year outlook. Let's turn to slide 13 and take a look at our EPS walks for the first quarter and for the balance for the year. In the interest of time, I am not going to go through all the details, but hopefully you will find the information helpful. As you can see in the first quarter we received $0.11 of year-over-year EPS from what we call above the line items, i.e. the positive impact from organic growth, '07 acquisitions and productivity net of inflation. This represents all of our EPS gain versus first quarter 2007 as our below the line items from share account, interest, equity and tax rate in aggregate netted to zero. The next several columns indicate that for the balance of 2008, we expect to see more benefits from the below the line items, which we invested in throughout 2007 and continue to drive in 2008. Our tax rate should deliver more year-over-year EPS benefit throughout the year and our share count will be more meaningfully balanced. Additionally, as we get into the second half of 2008, we expect our debt levels will be down versus 2007 and that lower interest expense will be a nice pick-up. Meanwhile, our above the line items remained steady, but is slightly less favorable levels than the first quarter. We expect to see roughly the same levels in net productivity but the second half will have less positive benefits from the 2007 acquisition as they were more fully integrated in last year's second half results. The middle section of the chart shows the impact we could or the impact that more difficult economic and inflationary situation could have on our results. We indicated that we were holding contingency for unknown economic impacts, such as a more pronounced downturn in North-American residential or perhaps higher commodity inflation. Both of which may now be more likely to occur. Meanwhile, we continue to invest in new technologies, global markets and then the completion of our global business unit organization. So this middle section should provide you with some balance to how we see our ability to offset a world that never sits still versus our original expectation. We also continue to evaluate and implement new price actions and businesses that continue to be hit with higher commodity cost. And in our mostly dealer distributor model, we typically can implement inflation related price increases through the channel rather effectively and will do so if necessary. The final observation we would like to make is that we feel we have the right initiatives and contingency plans in place to meet our commitments for the year, and we believe we are investing as needed to position your company for a solid 2009. Turning to slide 14, let's review our outlook for the full year. I might be jumping ahead to the key takeaway, but as you saw in our press release this morning, we have raised the lower end of our full year EPS guidance to $2.30. This updates our guidance to $2.30 to $2.40, up 10% to 14% year-over-year. We get to the new full year EPS by seeing sales growth of 2% to 4%. Given our view of the markets, we believe we have the right level of growth initiatives to produce these results. Our water business continues to drive great growth in its key initiatives, but we maintain an outlook for flattish organic growth as residential and pool markets remain very soft in North America. Technical products continued to grow nicely, and we see the full year of at least mid-single digits. We expect to increase both our operating income and margins and our forecasting overall margins of approximately 12%, up versus last year on a continuing basis. We expect the combination of margin expansion in conjunction with a lower tax rate of around 34% fewer shares outstanding and lower interest expense should produce earnings per share of $2.30 to $2.40 for the full year. Again, this represents EPS growth of 10% to 14% versus adjusted 2007 earnings per share of $2.10. Finally, we remain committed to our annual goal of generating cash in excess of income from continuing ops that continue to drive towards improving after tax ROIC. In summary, we are improving our guidance range for the full year based on solid start to the year and we feel we will continue that momentum through out the balance of 2008. As, a reminder, our 10-Q will be filed today, so you can be on the look out for that later this afternoon. That concludes our review. Operator, we will now open it up to questions. Question And Answer
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from Curt Woodworth of JP Morgan.
Curt Woodworth - JP Morgan: Good afternoon.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hi Curt.
John L. Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi, Curt.
Curt Woodworth - JP Morgan: In looking out for water margin guidance for the second quarter of 13% to 13.5%, it looks like that's going to be down, no roughly 100 or 50 to 100 basis points and is that after adjusting for NPT and is that mainly a function of just the tough comparison within municipal and then kind of the higher margin pool market weakness?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Exactly. I mean ... we have ... if we go back and adjust for the MPT to your point, we have somewhat close to 14.8%. We had a really, really good quarter last year Curt because the New Orleans pump job was in there as well, which was a high margin job that we identified. That coupled with the softness in the pool marketing in Q2 which is the pool season.
Curt Woodworth - JP Morgan: And residential --
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Which is a high margin business, which as we said was weak in the first quarter.
Curt Woodworth - JP Morgan: Okay, and do you still feel confident in your 13% margin target for the year?
John L. Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I don't know if we have to have 13%, I want to make sure that point's clear, Curt I mean truly --
Curt Woodworth - JP Morgan: Okay.
John L. Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We want to do water margins because it's going to be drive ROIC. But we also want to improve water growth. so we are going to continue to invest in our water business. We are experiencing some pretty good technical product strength right now, which is allowing us to invest in that water growth. But we want to continue to drive margins. I would say we are probably close to the 13% margin right now, depending on how soft the North-American residential markets get.
Curt Woodworth - JP Morgan: Okay, great and then in terms of residential filtration, I mean couple of years ago, this was definitely listed as key growth opportunity for the company, we had two years where I think you have seen negative growth in that market and clearly no longer kind of priority for the company. Can you help us understand why that shift has occurred, what's... kind of what's happened in that market relative to either overall market trends, or your market share?
John L. Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Let me... I would say that... I wouldn't say it's no longer our priority. I think you got to get growth where you can get it and we are a leading provider of equipment in the residential water treatment and filtration space and it's a space we are committed to. We just haven't been putting a lot of our resources to growing that because the degrees of freedom for growth there are as great as they are elsewhere, our market share was much lower in Food service and industrial, for example and we are investing to globalize residential filtration. So I think one of the reasons that we are down in growth, we did have some market share losses because we lost some of the OEM business in the residential arena. We haven't really offset that and secondly I would tell you that the impact on residential with the market downturn is harder or worse than we anticipated it would be. And that's sort of like to receive wisdom was that it wouldn't be impacted as much as it has been. So I would tell you that its not that we are de-emphasizing it, it's just that we are flowing our resources to where the growth is to get.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Curt, I mean there is... you are talking about our new housing number a few years ago with 2 million plus to drop into less than 700,000. So we realized that impact in the filtration business and water treatment doesn't generate the amount of after market revenue differences our residential pump business would have. So I think we've experienced a steeper downturn in that particularly market segment, but even despite that we still have average margins over 17 to 18% in that space at this level. I will talk about having the right technologies and the right solutions when the market turns out to be there for the customer.
Curt Woodworth - JP Morgan: Okay, great, and in terms of the performance in North America, this quarter I mean EMEA and its specific result, very strong. Would that imply that North America... the Americas you were down organically probably high single digits, this quarter on water?
John L. Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: If you include the pool downturn, which we are not trying to make excuse for that, but we carried that revenue over, yeah, we'll be down about 6% in North America and that would be despite some view that North America benefits after distributor and export sales as one.
Curt Woodworth - JP Morgan: Right and I guess you normalized for the pool, pre-buy from last year, it's probably more like low single digits
John L. Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah that's break up three points.
Curt Woodworth - JP Morgan: Okay, all right, thanks.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Kurt.
Operator: Your next question is from Deane Dray of Goldman Sachs.
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs: Your question on the Enclosures, technical products margin and that was a pleasant surprise this quarter. Can we address how sustainable these margins are and how... I know you are going to say the business is different this time because it certainly is, but if you go back to the last recession, you saw some mid single digit margins, lots of Mike Schrock type improvements there, but what gives you the confidence about the resiliency of those margins in an economic downturn?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: There is two things, I would summit are different from before. We have a much more diverse set of end-markets that we don't think they all are going to move together, for example the public market, and the energy market, and the food beverage and pharmaceutical markets, as specific radical markets that we serve now as a security defense. They are moving with the overall markets and in fact last time every market went down, I can give you all the data on that if you want, but I think you remember. Everything went down all over, and I don't think that will happen again and evidence of that right now, I know our markets are moving the same way right now. The second thing is this, we had cost structure in place at that time to be a $1 billion dollars, and if you recall the peak was $780 million or something like that and then we went down from there. So we hade a lot cost more structure than we had... than we have now and we have a lot better lean discipline and we continue to take cost out even though we are performing at decent level with the closure of Chicago factory in one in the UK. So those are the differences, those are the differences I would say now, that doesn't say that we can sustain 16%, if there is a big down draft, but I'll be disappointed if it didn't stay double digit.
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs: Got it and then how about... help us understand what the impact of foreign exchange is... I mean you did the earnings walk by segment you could see the top line of that of foreign exchange, but is that ... is then it gets modeled in with the productivity and effects pocket on the operating income line. So what the operating income of effect on CapEx?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, I would for us and I won't take you through the map, I will have Todd do this with you, believe it or not it's a very little impact to us, because some of our units were actually hurt on the way that the purchasing product and the impact of the foreign exchange as they buy it and were pretty dollar denominated with a lot of our products. So, here is like India which is a global business, we are selling in Dollars but we are taking our cost in Rupees. So very little impact, $5 million positive for us on the foreign exchange from an operating income line which is less than a penny.
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs: Good, that's helpful and then how about some... am I correct that Porus is going to be part of your core revenue growth in the second quarter and how has that core growth been and what does that do to your core growth for water, because it's more than industrial business as well.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: It is its all industrial and actually medical too.
John L. Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well I could say I will answer the first question and let Randy tell you strategy. Industrial filtration which is part of the slide Todd was showing you and Porus is the leading partner, industrial filtration is up about 10% year-to-date and we are seeing a continued nice trend there and I will let Randy take--
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well Porus Media is the big driver of that growth going forward on the organic basis. We really have some great technology in Porus Media also not just in industrial Porus Media technology is what we are using in the pre-filtration solution that we are introducing in desalination right now. So, I would say that Porus Media is helping to drive double digit growth and industrial is going to help drive double digit growth in products beyond CodeLine and desalination and its going to help us drive growth globally. And the markets that they are serving, Dean are not under the same type of challenges that the rest of the North American residential markets are facing. They serve a lot energy in markets, which are up nicely right now.
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs: Okay and then last question. Just on the pool business down 10% you may have addressed this, just want to make sure I am clear, is that what was the effect of the early buy this year versus previous years. Did you pull in how much of business into the fourth quarter?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, we didn't really pull in. If you recall back in 2006 when we adjusted our cost structure down we sized our Q4, 2006 early by production level to about... I think it was about $85 million or so and it turned out that the early buy was better than that by about $15 million. So we had to push it out. This year we sought last year in 2007 for early buy we sized our production level to a more normal level. So we carried over $15 million last but we still carried over some early buy into this year I have to get the exact numbers, you remember John.
John L. Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No, I don't, but we can get it to you Dean. The real answer is that we are not pulling in.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well my answer wasn't that.
John L. Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No, it was right. I am just saying, all right, I wanted to make sure
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs: That's a good point there.
John L. Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I just want to make sure, we are not pulling in here its really indicative of the markers in the dealer channel and as Randy mentioned the pool permits are down significantly. So our distributors aren't stocking up or bringing in inventory into the channel like they normally would do.
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs: Okay, that's helpful, thank you.
John L. Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I think Randy's answer is better, Dean --
Operator: Your next question is from Mike Schneider of Robert W. Baird
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Good morning, guys.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Mike.
John L. Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hey, Mike.
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Maybe we can stick to water for a second, just in the chart on page 10 where you identify the North-American replacement market and just the change from your plan, you identify that as a little less. Does that relate to replacement sales that Ever Pure?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Not Ever Pure, that's... let me get this, this is a little lighter and Ever Pure is not a... they don't do much in residential, Mike. The split there that should... if there was more over, I would say North-American residential replacement. We separate residential replacement there. Ever Pure globally is... is doing just fine, it's a little softer in North America then it is in other markets because there's some... its interesting in particular... the consumer spending has hit what we would call the mid level restaurants and which is a big customer base for food service so... so it's a little bit slower on the turns there. But, actually the quick serve, the fast foods and the high end restaurants are doing just fine. So, a... and we saw a lot of momentum in terms of new placements.
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Okay and then you reduced the forecast by water as you said from about 3% organic to flat for the year, which is about $70 million. Is that really all coming out of pool mainly or there's some other just minor reductions across the board?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, we really are taking it out everything related to residential and whether it's pool, its filtration and its flow [indiscernible].
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Okay, and then Europe... did I hear you correctly that Europe was flat in local currency?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Correct.
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: In water?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Correct.
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: And can you give us some sense of what the trends are there... is that also residential?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, yeah, exactly. It's very much... I think you might have heard this from other companies, residential has slowed in Europe and residential is the big segment of our European water business. When I look at industrial, it's looking pretty good and food service is looking good but... and we want to a push Energy with of course Media there. So we think residential is going to stay flat, we don't expect any kind of down draft as we seen in North America.
John L. Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And Mike, I mean to fall back up with you, we're getting better at some of the reporting, but some of our, for instance Middle East revenue will shift from distributors out of the states or direct from North American --
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Oh, yes true.
John L. Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: But to your point, Western Europe has slowed in our view, Eastern Europe is still strong and areas like the Middle East are still booming.
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Okay, and then just final question on margins in water. You point out that margins were up 40 basis points if you exclude kind of this pool pre-buy that occurred and which implies 12%. I'm curious there if you are able to really scrub Porus and the acquisitions in their entirety out of that water operating income, were water margin actually down for the core business?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I have to get you that. I mean you are right but Jung and Porus definitely helped and we would say we have already fixed this properly stated by the way the prior year would be the one that would be a little lower, because of the pool.
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Sure.
John L. Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And it's hard to just isolate those things, because you can pick a couple of others for instance because weather was strong in flow technology, we had the sump pumps a lot of that goes to retail, retail is not as profitable channels as pro channel, and there's lots of moving parts and I think they're probably worthwhile to have that explore out of type. Because it isn't just those things, it's the fact that their water treatment was down at a greater proportion and its one of the most profitable businesses. So there lots of different mixtures, I wouldn't punch it to just one or two things but I guess it's important to understand all about it.
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Thank you, again.
John L. Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Mike.
Operator: Your next question is from Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer.
Chris Glynn - Oppenheimer: Thanks, Good afternoon.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hey Chris.
Chris Glynn - Oppenheimer: Just talk a little bit about the Asia markets, some pretty good growth there obviously and give us an update on how the infrastructure is around that business as well as the competition around some of the product lines and if you're shifting your emphasis among the sectors and end markets you are targeting there.
John L. Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes ... I know we've been investing there. We talked about that before, we invested in sales and distribution and technology. We've highlighted a number of different focuses and what I would tell you is our focus is beneath a lot of the competition. We are not focusing on the big infrastructure, we are focused on the smaller infrastructure. So I would say we're focused on buildings and construction. We're focused on food service and we are focused on residential. In particular and we are focusing on bundling our products into solutions. So, for instance we recently won the Beijing Financial Centre, we have 92 HVAC pumps in there. It's just a very, very large program and it's something that we can focus on and sell our value. Similarly on hospitality, it's not just the pool business that we are driving there, we are driving the flow technology and filtration business, we mentioned before the Beijing Airport for instance where we're providing the portable water filtration system. So we are trying to if you will in a more granular level on our focus particularly in China versus what I would call our larger competitors. We are focusing on larger infrastructure. And we think we are in the right position because we got the products and we built that sales and distribution to serve those. Couple of other things we are focused is schools and we are focused in residential there, we're focused on the built out of someone what I would call the middle class where they need water softeners and the water filtration in their homes. So, it's a very tailored strategy that John Ma and the team in Asia are driving in and it's going very, very well. At the same time we've had a rebirth really of our Australia business and we've seen a little bit of growth finally in Japan. So, it's really quite satisfying to see the progress we made there. It's all part of us really becoming a global company and I think we almost have earned the right to be able to say we are. But I am not quite there yet.
Chris Glynn - Oppenheimer: Okay, and then just on the pool guys, it sounds like it's for the same kind of year-over-year dynamic as we just supported for the first quarter. The comps dramatically easier and you have the commercial pool kind of a new dynamic then maybe we've ever seen it before?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, commercial pools really interesting because it does go particularly with the global trust and Middle East and China in particular where they are building out hotels at a great clip and we have superior solutions. So for us it's a matter of getting there, and while we reported our $50 million and I am sure we have more business going in the commercial applications. We just aren't tracking it that well as it goes through distribution. All we are tracking there is these programs and projects that we really focus on driving. Our Eco Select line which reduces the use of chemicals, it gives you cleaner water and it reduces the energy and gives remote control and monitoring. It's all very-very well received. So we expect the growth of that to continue, and it's largely outside north America where we see a lot of that growth coming.
Chris Glynn - Oppenheimer: But that's not an offset --?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: That's not big enough to offset the residential decline and we're talking about a business that's 15% of the size of North American. North American residential pool is the single biggest pool market.
Chris Glynn - Oppenheimer: Right, but with the much easier comp coming up in the same sort of 10% decline for cash, or are we just seeing --?
John L. Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We are struggling with that a little bit; I mean we actually had a decent pool year last year, Chris because we grew 4% on the pool equipment business. So the 10% down draft that we're talking about in Q2 was a pretty significant down draft for us.
Chris Glynn - Oppenheimer: Yes, so real time that's just kind of quickly deteriorating further?
John L. Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: But you can take a note, I think next years Q2 would be easier comparison.
Chris Glynn - Oppenheimer: Noted. Thank you.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: Your next question is from Mike Hamilton of RBC.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Mike, hello?
Mike Hamilton - RBC Capital Markets: Are you there?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, here we are, Mike.
Mike Hamilton - RBC Capital Markets: Was wondering if you could just comment a little bit on what you are seeing on the municipal side given some of the concerns on pipeline freezing, and ability to get financing and whether you think that becomes an issue or your business is just too much in demand on the part of municipalities. So it's not really a lot walk through buy on their part?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I have got a review on Friday and that will be something we'll drill into a little deeper, but I already know, the backlog is firm, we don't report things in the backlog unless they are firm and we have got a good view all the way through into 2009 and when you take a look at lot of these projects, there is... they are real projects, they are urgent projects and I mentioned in my script because I been around the water business for well 31 years after a big hiatus. People are willing to pay for water now. It's the first time I have seen it where the people are willing to pay. So I don't think there is an issue of the projects we have firm in our backlog. At the same time, we are building out the capability to grow municipal globally. We put in three or four distributors in Southeast Asia, who are excited about selling our products with the dollar where it is, Kansas City is becoming a low cost producer. And so we actually can compete with product coming out of other areas of the world and we have superior technology and great technical applications. So to tell you truth, no I am not worried about municipal.
Mike Hamilton - RBC Capital Markets: Okay, thanks, Randy.
Operator: Your next question is from Francesca McCann of Stanford Financial.
Francesca McCann - Stanford Financial: Hello, everybody, good afternoon.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hello, hi there, how are you doing?
Francesca McCann - Stanford Financial: Doing all right, thanks.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Can you speak up a little, we can't hear you.
Francesca McCann - Stanford Financial: Sure is this... I hope this is better.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah its better
Francesca McCann - Stanford Financial: Follow up to my question on the European markets, you kind of said Western versus Eastern Europe and than the Middle East. Can you break down a little bit more kind of country by country for us what you are seeing particularly in Western Europe?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I think that will be difficult to do, right here all those specifics, I mean could we look at ... our look at in terms of Western Europe sort of the established markets and then Eastern Europe and Middle East. Middle East is the highest growth region and Eastern Europe is excellent, as we mentioned Western Europe is flat for water. I don't know whether you want to add anything
John L. Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I say we are happy to follow up with you and Todd's got that data, I know your scheduled call in what so we can do to get to by the time the call is because you really got to look at the technical product and water and they combine in this varying degrees, I can't give you percentages because numbers are small.
Francesca McCann - Stanford Financial: Okay, that's fine, we can follow up on that, and then on the pricing pass through as you said kind of anticipating that you have been anticipating doing the 1% to 2% increase, now you are planning on doing more, what push back do you get with that?
John L. Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well the ones... we have implemented a number in the first quarter, and the people never liked it. But the fact is this... the oil hit ... talking at 116, we got top carbon steel up almost 60% and these are real inputs and because of the structure of our business through distribution, they tend to stick. So nobody ever likes the price increase so we don't have to ask them about ... we buy about $148 million or so $150 million what we call metal in that steel which is the largest component by $80 million for us and walking down from their stainless steel will be about 30 and we only do about $12 million in copper about $10 million pig iron. That's relative to $1.2 billion direct material buy and so part we've not been significantly impacted because we can divide forward and we block into certain capacities. So, we are anticipating the second half is going to require us to do some actually down in the market place and where we would do these our businesses in which we have a distributor type of model and which we imagine most people are experiencing exactly what we are experiencing and there will be everybody raising prices due to where we are struggling. I think everybody is anticipating it Francesca.
Francesca McCann - Stanford Financial: Okay. So possibly more in Q2, but definitely in second half.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Correct.
Francesca McCann - Stanford Financial: Okay, and then I guess just a little bit of commentary on what you are seeing on the acquisition landscape, partly in terms of valuation, partly what you see out there.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Right now we ... our focus is on ... we've a lot of opportunities that I characterized here on the call today, they are really organic in nature and we are flowing a lot of resources there. We are still in the flow of event but there is nothing that I see on horizon that obviously I wouldn't mention anything unless, but besides both arms and as I have said before would we be interested, we don't need to buy capacity. In fact we have plenty of capacity, but market entry and capability expansion would be the only thing I am interested in. The Jung Pump and Porus Media both were examples of that, they pricey examples of that. But they were examples of that and so I guess I just leave it at that for now--
John L. Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And I would add on the evaluation side franchise I don't think the valuation on deals that weren't to be done or could done have dropped at levels that we would be interested in.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: That's a good point too.
John L. Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And I think that's going to have to be a realization somewhere along the line especially with the weak dollar in the global market.
Francesca McCann - Stanford Financial: Okay, that's great. Thank you.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from James Lucas of JE Janney [ph].
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hey Jamie, [indiscernible] how are you doing?
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott: Two questions, guys. First of, Randy can you give us an update on the technical products, GBU with electrical now following the ... the electrical and electronic together, kind of a early read on what your seeing there and is it delivering what you had hoped for putting the businesses under one GBU and, secondly if you could just provide any color. As you might want to on the commercial construction market both domestically and abroad?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes sure, thanks James. First I am... of all the GBU's I think the tech products one is not surprisingly given the dominical and it is off to a great start. And the synergies we see in terms of running it's more directly as one GBU or one business was the fact that Hoffman is our greatest practice of lean. Hoffman is better than electronics on sourcing and their vertical market focus is outstanding. All of those practices are being rolled out, at the same time we are looking at how we can consolidate backroom to reduce cost and structure. The other thing is we have electrical factories that are bursting at the seams and we had electronic factories that were underutilized and electrical opportunities that we weren't going after as aggressively. That hasn't met out in the first quarter but our ability to leverage those electronics facilities more directly to electrical opportunities, I think is a big deal, and getting the thermal business which is part of Hoffman more integrated with electronics is going to be a big deal that help drives accruals. So, I think the early returns are good, I think the ... I mean the early ... the early reports are good. But they're not even reading the benefits aren't even reading out the numbers yet. So I said I'm very... I'm very bullish on the GBU. In terms of commercial because there's a lot of focus on commercial, just to give you a little perspective. In commercials less than $18 million out of the $286 million of sales in the business so its 6% of our sales.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott: But also as it relates to water.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Oh, water is bigger than that I don't have that data in front of me.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott: But, just if I add that overall margin.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Commercial has slowed in North America. In fact in only in the electrical GBU it was flat similarly when we look around in water, its slowed to single-digit, but commercial globally has got... is really strong, and that's what I was mentioning before... in our Aurora pump business which is the one I was referencing. The exports are just screaming right now and we don't see that abating. Those are exports to mostly the Middle East and Asia. So, commercial as we mentioned on our charts is coming in about where we thought, we thought it was slow in North America and it is. But that's sort of within our expectations. No, I would say no surprises there.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott: Okay, great thank you.
John L. Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Okay Jim. Before... we are probably time is running on little lower, I don't know how many people left in the queue, but definitely there's time for at least one more.
Operator: Thank you. Your final question is from John Quealy of Canaccord Adams
Chip Moore - Canaccord Adams: Thanks, this is actually Chip Moore for John. You touched briefly on the opportunity to improve working capital. I am wondering if you could just give us sense of where channel inventories stand and how you see those progressing over the next couple of quarters.
John L. Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, I was going to say, I will speak to the channel inventories, I mean the channel inventories in most of our markets we would say are relatively modest, primarily because we have been experiencing some significant down turns in North American residential and everybody has spent a little bit queasy to add inventory in this particular down cycle. Our particular inventories are doing okay with the exception of the areas where we are into this submersible pumps where we carry a fair amount of inventory, both of our stuff and for others --
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Probably still too much in the channel.
John L. Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And there is still too much in the channel there and then the second area we would tend take to take on more inventory, specially in Q1 is pool, because even though pool will have a year-over-year drop in the pool season, there is still a huge ramp-up from Q1 to Q2 from the seasonality of that market. Other than that, we have done a pretty good job of taking our inventories out but I would say we had at least $75 million to $100 million more to go before we would say we have done a good job. But the channel inventories with the exception of the residential pump, we would deem as pretty light right now.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Adams: Great, thanks.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: You are welcomed, okay is that is.
John L. Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks everybody.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Okay now, thanks a lot and for every one we will be around all day, we will be speaking with you this afternoon and the rest of week. Thank you.
John L. Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.

On today's call we will provide details on our fourth quarter and full-year 2007 results. As well as update you on Pentair's outlook for 2008. We also introduce first quarter 2008 guidance. Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company’s anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties such as the risks outlined in Pentair's 10-K as of December 31st, 2006 and Pentair news releases. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results. Today’s conference call is accompanied by a presentation, which can be found on the financial information section of Pentair's website at www.pentair.com. We will reference these slides throughout our prepared remarks. Any references to non-GAAP financials are reconciled in the appendix of the presentation. As is our custom we will reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. I will now hand the call over to Randy who will take you through Pentair's Fourth Quarter and full year 2007 results and highlights, provide his perspective on these results of our businesses, and the markets they serve. And provide an overview on how we're driving to deliver more results in 2008. Then John will conclude our formal comments with additional information regarding 2007 financials, provide first quarter 2008 outlook and wrap up with some more color on full year 2008 guidance. Randy?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Todd. And thank you all for joining us today. Let's begin by reviewing Pentair's fourth quarter highlights shown on slide number 2. Overall, Pentair fourth quarter sales of $830 million were 12% above the $743 million generated last year. Our organic growth was plus 7% in the quarter or up 4% in local currencies. The diversity of our businesses and markets enabled us to grow despite softness in North American residential markets. Fourth quarter sales in our Water segment were up 13% versus last year or up 6% organically. Water sales were led by success in our key growth initiatives, such as foodservice and industrial filtration and strong sales growth in pool equipment and Water International. Our Technical Products business grew 9% in the fourth quarter as sales in our electrical business were up double digits, and our Asia and Pacific region posted over 40% growth once again. As the slide shows, Pentair expanded margins 330 basis points, both Water and Technical Products contributed significantly towards this margin expansion. Looking at total company margins year-over-year, the positive impact from volume and price coupled with solid productivity, foreign exchange, and a nice contribution from acquisitions provided 600 basis points of margin growth. This easily offset a negative 270 basis point impact from total inflation. The company delivered $0.48 per share of earnings from continuing operations on revenue growth of 12%. The $0.48 of EPS includes the $0.01 benefit from a non-recurring tax item as well as a negative $0.04 impact from additional restructuring and a legal settlement we had in the fourth quarter. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.51, up 65% versus the fourth quarter 2006 adjusted earnings per share of $0.31. Also in the quarter, the company significantly modified its long-term defined benefit and retiree medical plans. The change provides greater flexibility and control to our employees while reducing the uncertainty regarding the company's long-term liability. The change triggered an immediate curtailment benefit that was partially offset by additional one-time cost actions we took in the quarter. The impact of the curtailment benefits and costs provided a positive $0.02 of EPS, which is included in our $0.51 adjusted earnings per share and it's approximately 50 basis points of the margin in the quarter for the total company. John will provide additional detail on the benefit plan changes a little later in the presentation. Finally, a great success in '07 was the tremendous free cash flow delivered in the quarter and the year. Fourth quarter free cash flow equaled $96 million and for the year, we generated $285 million of free cash flow, an improvement of $104 million year-over-year and well above our goal of $250 million. So those are the highlights for the fourth quarter. Now, let's turn to slide number 3 and review our Water business in more detail. In the fourth quarter, Water grew sales $65 million to $566 million, up 13% versus last year’s sales. Organic sales were up 6% or up 4% in local currency. The composition of our total Water sales are shown on the top left section of slide 3. Let me give you some color on our sales by business and region. In our international operations, we continue to see impressive results. Our European Water business was up 51% year-over-year or up 12% after removing the impact from the Jung Pump acquisitions. Eastern European and Middle Eastern sales, each expanded approximately 20% in the quarter. In Asia, we continue to drive strong double-digit growth in the fourth quarter. Our Asian Water sales were up 28% year-over-year driven by sales in China for Filtration and Pump Systems and also in India led by sales of commercial pumps, food service solutions and rural water systems. One of the most exciting developments here is the success we are beginning to have in selling systems by focusing on application based solutions. Examples include the drinking water system for the new Beijing airport and the drinking water and commercial pool solution at the Shanghai World Financial Center. Pentair was selected as the Partner of Choice in Shanghai as we were the only company that could provide both the drinking water solutions and the commercial pool solutions that customer was looking for. Now, let's shift to discussing our domestic water businesses. First, we recently renamed our pump business, flow technologies. The new name better reflects our global growth strategies as exemplified by our system wins in China. In our North American flow technology business, sales were flat, as solid growth in commercial and municipal vertical markets, new products, and pricing actions offset declines in residential markets. Commercial and industrial market sales will remain robust with growth in the double digits. While we also continued to have double-digit growth in our Fairbank [ph] municipal pump markets where we finished with a record backlog of orders. Our North American pool and spa sales were up 11% compared with Q4 of last year. As we stated in our last quarter's conference call we expected to see solid sales growth in pool equipment in the fourth quarter as our order pace was good and year-over-year comparisons were less challenging. Our leaning energy efficient and noise reducing IntelliFlo pump and related products continue to yield double-digit growth. While the market remains down, our growth demonstrates the power of our distribution channel and the importance of our new products. As you know the fourth quarter is also the period when we, in the industry offer the early buy program to keep our factory's level loaded during the normal off-season in winter. The result of this year's program exceeded our initial expectations and was significantly higher than 2006. Despite this we remain cautious with regard to the pool market. We are aggressively managing our inventory levels and we maintain a laser focus on productivity and lean initiatives. North American filtration sales were up 11% driven by the Porous Media acquisition. Organic sales were down slightly as continued momentum in our commercial, food service and industrial markets could not offset declines in residential water treatment. Let's review our Water margins. You can see our Water operating income walk on the top right section of the slide. As it shows, water margins were up 450 basis points on an adjusted basis. We had a strong impact from growth, which contributed a positive 290 basis points, productivity added 450 basis points as our efforts derived lean and reduced our variable and fixed-cost structure yielded solid results. Included in this productivity is a positive 80 basis points associated with the aforementioned change to our long-term defined benefit in retiring medical plan, net of cost actions. In aggregate, growth and productivity more than offset a negative 290 basis point impact from total inflation and enabled us to achieve adjusted water margins of 12% for the quarter. Before we transition to technical products, I would point out that we have some modest restructuring charges in the quarter. In our flow technologies business we consolidated our product line associated with our residential pump business. This will improve our cost position longer term. We also settled a portion of the horizon litigation by agreeing to pay the claim for legal fees from the original trial in 2000. We will continue to update you on the status of this litigation in our SEC filings. Restructuring charge and the legal settlement are included in the final component of our operating income walk and allow you to bridge adjusted to reported operating income. So in summary, we continue to make solid progress in our Water business despite turbidity in the North American residential market. We're working on the right things to move our margins higher while also investing for future growth in the most attractive vertical markets. Now, let's move to slide number four and review our Technical Products business. In short, Technical Products had another great quarter. We grew sales 9% and expanded adjusted margins 150 basis points to 15.7%. Looking at Technical Product sales results, our international business continue to grow nicely. Technical Products Asia grew 44% led by electronics growth in China, and European sales grew 8%. In North American electronics our sales were down 3% because of lingering effects of contraction and consolidation in the telecommunication market. Our North American electrical business grew 10% versus last year as we continue to expand our vertical market presence and gain share in a strong market. And we exited 2007 with double-digit order rates in our electrical business, which continues to see strong demand. Technical products margins are highlighted at the top right section of slide number four. Together, growth and productivity contributed 360 basis points of margins expansion. This easily offset the impact of a negative 210 basis points from total inflation. Our Lean-driven productivity actions continue to produce solid results as we had excellent conversion on a 9% sales growth. As we announced in October, we took action to exit our electronics factory outside Chicago. The pre-tax charge associated with this action as shown in the walk is a negative $2 million item. The bridge is adjusted and reporting operating income and margins. This action will improve our North American electronics cost structure as we continue to right size this business given the drop in sales volume. So, Technical Products delivered a strong top line and executed well by delivering another outstanding quarter. We are carrying good momentum in 2008 and see continued strong electrical performance and strengthening in global electronic market. Please turn to slide number 5, our 2007 full year financial summary. In a few minutes, I'm going to detail our observations on the full-year key accomplishments. So let me quickly just touch on the financial highlights for 2007 on this slide. Sales for the full year grew 8%. 4 points of growth came from Porous Media and Jung Pump acquisitions, which have been seamlessly integrated into our businesses and are exceeding expectations. Sales in both water and technical products were up mid-single digits on an organic basis as our key growth initiatives yielded tremendous results and the power of our brands and channels allowed us to get price in most businesses. Total year growth was very good given the significant slowdown in the North American residential markets, which impacted Water and the North American telecom and datacom markets, which impacted technical products, particularly in the first half of the year. We made significant improvements in our water margins ending the year at a little over 12% as our Lean initiatives and cost actions on structured G&A and supply chain are producing results. Technical products maintained margins in the range of 15% as volume conversion and continued progress with Lean and cost actions made a nice impact. We were able to overcome escalating commodity costs mainly stainless, steel early in the year and soft telecom and datacom markets in North America. We improved our ongoing tax rate by approximately 100 basis points and we exited the year with a more efficient tax structure driven by our European business structure and low-cost China operations. In the year, we took action to reduce operating cost structure by closing three high-cost manufacturing facilities and several distribution centers, which in aggregate reduces headcount by over 450 people. The benefits from both tax and restructuring will really play out in 2008 and beyond. And finally, we grew earnings per share at 21% on an adjusted basis to $2.08. This increased income along with better working capital management enabled us to generate $285 million in free cash flow, a record for the company and over 135% conversion of net income. So across the board, we certainly feel we made significant progress and we say we had a very good year in 2007. Let's move to slide number six, which is one of our standard earnings chart. I am not going to spend a lot of time on this one but I would like to point out some of our key performance metrics. As I just mentioned, we generated $285 million of free cash flow for the year. Please note the areas highlighted in yellow. The first highlight shows that we were much more efficient with regard to working capital, that was one of our goals for the year. You can see we had a year-over-year improvement of about $95 million in working capital, used it from 2006 to 2007. The second highlight is to point out that we continue to invest for growth in new products as demonstrated by the $62 million of capital expenditures in 2007, an $11 million increase year-over-year. If we take a look at the company's… take a look at the components of return on invested capital on the right side of the slide, you see our fourth quarter trailing net operating profit after tax or NOPAT was $262 million. Our average invested capital was $2.76 billion, which gives us an after-tax ROIC of 9.5%, a 10 basis point improvement over last year. We are on our path towards improving this metric, as we aggressively drive our operating results and remain very prudent regarding our use of cash. We finished the year with a 36% debt-to-total capital ratio and we are very comfortable with our current debt levels. As a reminder, the non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation of these calculations and numbers are included in the appendix to this presentation. Now please turn the slide number seven. I would like to share my observations on a few of the key items we accomplished in 2007. Rather than read them through item by item, I would summarize them in the following way. We entered 2007 with the priority that we would make stronger operational improvements, this need with on the heels with a sudden and pronounced decline in the North American residential markets during the second half of 2006. At that time we expected this market would decline another 10% to 15% in 2007. That residential market forecast proved optimistic as the market actually declined over 25% in the year. Additionally, we did not anticipate the commodities would escalate as much as they did earlier in the year. So versus our original outlook, we were forced to weather even more negative headwinds. Yet we were well positioned to overcome these hurdles and we did. As you may recall, we took immediate and aggressive actions in the second half of 2006 to better position our company for choppy economic conditions. Also rather than rely on growth, we centered our forecast on execution and productivity through lean initiatives, G&A reductions and manage investments for focused growth opportunities. This commitment to the fundamentals really paid off throughout the year. We did grow sales in 2007, led by double-digit growth from our key initiatives, industrial filtration, food service, desalination and commercial pool, and in global markets, as well as our electrical business, which grew high-single digit. However, the bigger drivers of our earnings growth were productivity and our streamlined cost structure. Many of these accomplishments are areas we will continue to turn on as we head into 2008. For example, we continue to staff up and lean with 60 new positions dedicated to our businesses since the end of 2006. And now, we have over 120 dedicated lean specialists in the company. As many of you know, lean is a journey. We made measurable progress in 2007, yet we have much more room to eliminate waste, improve effectiveness and serve the customer better. The accomplishments from lean sourcing and other productivity actions enable us to expand full-year margins in Water by 140 basis points and helped us to maintain the 15% margins that we have in Technical Products. Additionally our tax rate was a point lower as a result of the successful investment to structure our Swissco [ph] organization in Europe. And we have a good debt structure, thanks to the tremendous free cash flow in 2007, that impressive $285 million I like talking about. We also are proud of continued commitment to our dividend record. About a month ago, we announced a 13% increase in our dividend to $0.68 per share in 2008. This is the 32nd consecutive year that Pentair has increased dividend. So in summary, we made substantial progress in 2007, and we have momentum in our key initiatives and productivity actions as we head into 2008. Now, please turn to slide number eight. We wanted to compare 2006 and 2007 snapshot of our geographic convertible market mix to highlight the composition of our businesses and the success we're having in reshaping them. As we have discussed, their focus has been to flow our resources to our most attractive opportunities, it's working. We have been driving strong international growth and we acquired German-based Jung Pump. In 2007 for the first time Pentair had over $1 billion in sales outside the US. While sales in the US remains 68% of total company revenues, that level is a reduction of five points versus 2006. We continue to have a goal to achieve 60% US sales and 40% international sales in a few years. Bottom half of the slide shows a similar story. Residential markets represented about 35% of Pentair sales in 2006. As we exit the year, we have a more balanced market portfolio and currently residential markets represent only 30% of our sales. In 2007, municipal, commercial and industrial markets grew and we feel we grew in excess of the market rates there. The success of our key growth initiatives, which are focused on industrial, commercial and municipal global opportunities collectively added approximately $50 million of sales and grew over 15% in their our right. We are steadily transforming in already diverse set of businesses into a more attractive set of businesses. We look forward to updating you next year and expect to show even more balanced diverse Pentair in 2008. Similar to the previous three quarters, I would like to highlight one of our businesses. This quarter we highlight technical products on slide number nine. Technical Products is a $1.1 billion global business unit, it combines two businesses, a $650 million electrical business and a $400 million electronics business. Each business manufactures and distributes enclosures to a variety of markets, customers, applications and geographies. These enclosures get very widely from small standard metal enclosures to sophisticated systems to provide thermal protection, shielding or other performance features. Electrical and Electronics combined generated operating margins of about 15% and an after-tax return on invested capital of approximately 20%. In electrical markets, you have the premier North American enclosures brand Hoffman. This world-class business is a leader in North American commercial and industrial markets and fast growing in the datacom field. But the lean enterprise culture and a deep knowledge of the various vertical markets it serves, this business has a strong position. Distribution, as we have the commercial and industrial electrical channel. While mainly leveraging our North American distribution network, we are building the business globally. The combination of electrical and electronics under the long time Hoffman leader, Del Nickel into one GBU will enable these two businesses to better leverage international distribution, manufacturing facilities and vertical market knowledge. Our electronic business sells predominantly direct to OEMs. Electronics is slowly improving from our first half of 2007 bottoming out of sales and margins. We have become too projects... too big projects centric and lost our focus on a few more attractive segment. We were too tied to the big Telecom datacom market and when consolidation began to occur in that market, many of large projects were delayed or cancelled. We reinitiated more discipline in the business with focus on growing our presence in military, aerospace and medical applications. We expect the combination of electrical and electronics will take advantage of excess capacity in the electronics business, and we have already taken action to reduce capacity with enhanced closure of our Chicago facility. To summarize, the foundation of Technical Products is strong. We have a tremendous operating culture within Electrical, and we expect the combination of these two businesses under one technical products GBU and continue to improve margins and keep growth heading in the right direction. Now, please turn to slide number 10. We'll just spend a few minutes discussing one of our global business unit's technical products. Early in my comments, I addressed Water and we have also formed three global water businesses. Flow technologies, pool equipment and filtration. As you begin… begin to consider Pentair's global position in these markets, we thought this overview might be helpful. GBU has scale and real growth opportunities. We continue to invest in new products, vertical market teams, and sales and application coverage. We look forward to updating you on the success each of these GBUs achieves going forward. Now please turn to slide 11, which is my last slide before I turn it over to John. Back in October, on our third quarter earnings call we introduced full year 2008 guidance. We also highlighted our view of the major markets we serve. We're 100 days older and wiser and we maintain much of the same outlook. Certainly, the markets haven't improved since we last spoke. We also know that when markets do change, it can be sudden. We see the North American residential market continuing to be negative and we're forecasting a moderating growth in commercial and industrial in North America. John will provide more detail associated with 2008 financial guidance but let me discuss the underlying Pentair drivers here. Building on our performance in 2007, we're starting with a productivity first view. In the second half of 2007, we took significant additional restructuring actions that will yield benefits in 2008. We also are beginning to see more momentum from our sourcing initiatives and the fourth quarter 2007 run rate is a very encouraging tailwind. In 2008, we'll continue to manage our G&A costs aggressively and we expect to benefit from lower interest expense, lower tax rates, fewer shares and the removal of step up charges associated with our Porous Media and Jung Pump acquisitions. We're excited about many growth actions and investments too. Our key growth initiatives are strong and getting stronger. The telecom and datacom markets we serve in electronics are improving and it shows in our order rate. The reorganization of our business to global business units will open doors for increased international opportunities. Additionally, we're prioritizing and investing in our best growth initiatives and geographies by staffing them with our best talent. So while our current view includes modest assumptions for growth, we have significant opportunities, actions, and good momentum as we head into 2008. I'll now turn it over to John and let him provide some additional color on 2007 financials, Q1 outlook for '08 and full year '08 financial outlook. John?
John Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Randy. Please turn to slide number 12. Similar to last quarter, we designed this slide to help reconcile full year and quarterly-reported or GAAP earnings to adjusted earnings. If you start at the top of the chart, you can see our reported EPS for the fourth quarter 2007 was $0.48. This compares very favorably to the $0.39 we reported in the fourth quarter of 2006, which is noted in the bottom section. Our 2007 adjusted EPS is found in the middle section of the chart. We delivered $0.51 of earnings per share in the fourth quarter when you remove the $0.01 benefit from non-recurring tax items and add back the negative impact of $0.04 related to restructuring and a legal matter that Randy mentioned. The $0.51 is up 65% versus 2006 adjusted EPS of $0.31. In the middle of the chart, you can see we highlight the benefit associated with the change to our long-term defined benefit and retiree medical plans. Here are the details of that change. In Q4, we announced a significant modification to these plans effective January 1st, 2008. New employees hired after January 1st will not participate in these legacy retirement plans. Pentair employees participating in these plans before January 2008 will continue to accrue the exact same benefits for the next 10 years at which time, the plans will be frozen. The change to these plans will dramatically improve the variability of the associated expense, but more importantly, significantly reduce the overall pension liability, driven by discount rates and investment returns. For 2008, these changes coupled with a higher discount rate of 6.5% is expected to lower pension related expense and reduced our liability by about $50 million for year-end 2007. The result of these curtailments was worth about $0.05 per share net of implementation cost to the fourth quarter. I would also highlight that we are increasing the company contribution to employee 401(k) plan by 1 percentage point of additional matching dollars. This gives our employees affordability in the retirement plan that they desire. This increase will go into effect in 2008. So, qualified employees will have a higher company paid 401(k) contribution if they elect to participate. Separately, we took additional action to prove over cost structure going forward. These cost relate to non-severance related plant closure costs and market related adjustments to reserves. These actions cost $0.03 per share. Therefore the net impact of these actions is $0.02 and is included in our adjusted earnings per share of $0.51. The far right column of the chart shows the impact certain items had on our full-year 2007 earnings per share versus 2006. For the year, we generated $2.10 of EPS on a reported basis, up 16% versus 2006. Removing the impact of non-recurring items, our full-year adjusted EPS was $2.08. This was up 21% versus full-year 2006 adjusted earnings per share. This reconciles reported to adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter and full-year 2007. Please turn to slide number 13. This slide provides another way to look at our performance in the fourth quarter. We provide two columns. The first column walks adjusted EPS year-over-year and the second column walks reported EPS. You can see we had a $0.05 per share positive impact from volume and acquisitions. Sales growth in Technical Products and Pool & Spa along with our acquisitions of Porous Media and Jung Pump were the drivers of this performance. Price and productivity more than offset inflation and investments and led to a $0.12 EPS benefit. We continue to make nice progress with productivity. In 2007 price increases helped to offset escalating metal inflation, the next item related to the curtailment benefit net of cost actions. Finally, our ongoing tax rate continues to improve as we have completed the work associated with migrating to a European Swissco structure and moved manufacturing to China and other more favorable tax regions. This lower tax rate provided a $0.01 per share benefit. That detail walks you through the $0.51 of adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter 2007, up 65% when compared to last year's $0.31. You can see the same items applied to our reported earnings per share count although the starting and ending points are different. This difference is highlighted in the restructuring, legal and tax item detail provided towards the bottom of the wall. As you can see, a net negative $0.03 is associated with restructuring and legal items in the fourth quarter 2007. Also removing non-recurring tax items from both years yields a negative $0.08 to reported earnings. This bridges you to our $0.48 of reported earnings in the fourth quarter 2007, an increase of 23%. Let's move to slide number 14 and review our outlook for the first quarter 2008. We are forecasting sales to be up 3% to 6% with acquisitions expected to be approximately three points of this growth. We continue to see solid mid-single digit sales growth in Technical Products, international sales are forecasting continued growth, and our growth initiatives in Water expected to maintain double-digit growth rate. However, we have a difficult comparison in our pool and spa business, as the first quarter 2007 was strong, as timing associated with early buy programs in 2006 rolled over to first quarter of 2007. This will provide a small headwind in 2007 for our water segment. As we think about margins, the midpoint of our income range has total company margin expansion of approximately 50 basis points. We see Water margins of about 11%, and Technical Products maintaining 15% margins in the first quarter. During the first quarter of 2008, we'll transition to our global business unit structure and this investment will be behind us as we move into the second quarter. We're forecasting an ongoing tax rate of approximately 34% in the first quarter and for the full-year of 2008. This is an improvement of over a 100 basis points. This benefit will be more than offset by higher interest expense, which we expect to be up approximately $2 million year-over-year, due to Jung Pump and Porous Media acquisitions completed at the end of Q1 and beginning of Q2 2007 respectively. As a result of these items, we expect earnings per share between $0.46 to $0.48, or up approximately 12% using the midpoint of the range. And finally, as is typically the case in the first quarter, we expect free cash flow to be negative for the period. So, steady progress to start the year, as we expect to improve margins and transition to our global business unit structure. Let's move to slide 15, we put the slide together to provide more prospective on our full-year 2008 EPS guidance range. The first columns are 2006 to 2007 full year EPS walk on an adjusted basis. Rather than walk through all the details, you can see the impact growth, productivity, inflation and investment we had on our full-year. You can also see the impact from interest expense in ongoing tax rate in shares. Moving to the next two columns, entitled 2008 low-end and 2008 high-end, you can see our assumptions. This is designed to help you understand the factors that could push results in either direction within the guidance range. Let me highlight a few things. First, we expect to have a same year-over-year impact from the following items in both scenarios. 2007 acquisition should use $0.05 per share and this is really just a stub period, when we didn't have these businesses in our portfolio in 2007, as well as the absence of step-up charges. We're forecasting price increases worth $0.20 per share. This represents about 1% price appreciation versus 2007. This is half the price increase we generated in 2007. So I do not feel we're being too aggressive here. G&A productivity is expected to yield $0.05 per share. Finally, interest expense, tax rate and share count in aggregate should yield $0.08 per share. The variance between our low-end guidance of $2.25 of earnings per share and our high-end $2.40 is the following. The low end assumes volume declines of $0.16 per share year-over-year. This would be the equivalent of negative 2 to3 points of sales volume or contraction. If this transpires, we expect to see negative $0.10 per share of net manufacturing productivity as factory conversion and capacity would be negatively impacted. You can see this is reflected in the $0.05 for sourcing, manufacturing, and productivity. However, if those market dynamics occur, we would manage our selling and marketing initiatives and investments to a different rate, which would limit them to a negative $0.10 per share impact year-over-year or less if needed. In the high-end walk, volume provides $0.04 per share of EPS growth. The additional $0.20 of volume versus our low-end guidance will allow for our net manufacturing productivity to fully offset inflation. Thus sourcing and manufacturing would yield a positive $0.15 per share benefit in 2008. We may then elect to more heavily invest in selling, marketing and R&D initiatives, which is shown on the chart. So, we will continue to monitor the markets, our volume growth and then of course manage our investments accordingly. Either way, we continue to have a tremendous opportunity to improve sourcing, G&A cost structure and our manufacturing operations, which is our primary focus in 2008. Please turn to slide 16, which highlights our view for the full-year 2008. This is our last slide, so I will quickly walk through the details and then we'll open it up for questions. You can see our sales growth of 3% to 5% reflects annual sales between $3.5 billion and $3.6 billion. We expect to expand margins approximately 50 basis points for the total company, led by 75 to 100 basis point expansion in Water margins. We're forecasting Technical Product margin expansion of about 50 plus basis points. Full-year 2008 earnings per share will benefit from lower tax rate, share count and interest expense. In total, we would see 2008 EPS growth of between 8% and 15% versus 2007 adjusted EPS. Our targeted free cash flow is 100% of net income, and we hope to do better by driving improvements in working capital, mainly inventories. We also expect in 2008 with an after-tax ROIC of 10.5% up 100 basis points versus the end of 2007. Our Board recently authorized a $50 million share repurchase program, which we fully intend to utilize in 2008. So, in summary, our 2008 guidance remains fundamentally unchanged versus last quarter when we introduced it. And we're aggressively working to achieve our goals. We hope the information on this call was helpful and we look forward to answering any questions you might have. Operator, we will now open it up to your questions. Question and Answer
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Deane Dray with Goldman Sachs.
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Dean.
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs & Co.: First of all, the level of details in the slides and your assumptions is very, very helpful. So I appreciate that. And specifically regarding the '08 guidance, last quarter when you introduced the guidance, you talked about a 25% coming from growth investment and contingency, maybe your wording has changed a little bit, but does that contingency go away and how is that reflected into our guidance?
John Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No. Deane, you are right. I mean we didn't mean to change it up too much. We just probably would provide further details. But the contingency has really changed into investments, and we have now got, I think a more conservative view of price. And nothing has changed in that guidance. We just thought the high-end and the low end would provide everybody to be able to choose their assumptions based upon their own view of the markets. And the other thing is we had quiet growth last time.
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Right. You split that that out. So just for the fourth quarter, the volume price lift for Water and Technical Products, so for Water, you had 2 percentage points. How does that split between volume and price?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Repeat the question please.
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs & Co.: For the fourth quarter, you grouped together volume and price as 2 percentage points. How does that split out? So I'm going to ask the same question for technical products so --?
John Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Okay. Let me just grab this real quick. If you go to Water and take the volume and price component within water.
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes.
John Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: About 1.5 of that is price, 2.5 of volume and the technical products is about one point... it's about... let's say, about two points of price and three points of volume.
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, good. And then over on the filtration side, what's the expectation regarding some of the CapEx spending of your customers, there was a pretty high profile announcement from Starbuck's is going to back CapEx. That's a big customer of yours. Will that weigh at all in terms of the growth expectations [inaudible] you've ever appear in your Ecolab joint venture?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I would say, not. Obviously we are intimately watching what our customers do. But the announcement of McDonald and a number of other customers who are actually investing in copy service, the penetration we are making in the restaurant space as well as the success in growing our other channel like Ecolab, I think, are much more important to us than what any one customer might do in their CapEx spending. Plus most of that business has replacement cartages once you get them placed I mean they have to replace the cartages, so that’s one of the beauties of food service.
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And last question on the pool business and the impact of the early buy in the fourth quarter. What was driving it, just better terms, better price, new products and then what was the EPS contribution?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, there were no... there were... we didn't get any benefits in terms of terms being better this year versus last year. As you may recall, last year we set our production rates at a low level, and in fact orders came in a little bit better. So we ended up carrying more backlog from the early buy program into the first quarter because we wanted to get stable production and we didn't allow the business to ramp up in the fourth quarter of '06. That's the biggest difference year-to-year. We actually… this year, we saw the orders a little bit earlier. So we were able to hold our production rate to a little bit higher level. And so it's about $15 million swing year-to-year. So there's no economic difference.
John Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: As far as your question, I mean, I would say versus where we thought Q4 would line up, that was probably about a penny incremental contribution from a little bit more in the early buy. And obviously as you know we take a look at those programs and manage what the earlier... try to understand what the earlier in the standard buy is... so it's hard to tell at any given time when you get a little more early how much impact it has in standard. And so we're looking at sell through data. We've worked with our key distributors and customers, and just monitoring that market every day.
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Curt Woodworth with J.P. Morgan.
Curt Woodworth - JP Morgan: Yeah. Hi, good afternoon.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hey.
John Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hey.
Curt Woodworth - JP Morgan: John, I think I may have missed this, but in terms of the high-end of your guidance, what was the organic growth assumption built into that?
John Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We would say, the high-end is probably closer to 4% all in organic growth.
Curt Woodworth - JP Morgan: Okay. And that's basically the midpoint of what you have in terms of what you're talking about on slide 16, the up three to five... ?
John Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Right.
Curt Woodworth - JP Morgan: And in terms of looking at the Water--?
John Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Curt, not to... I mean we are trying to give a guide with a goalpost here. I'd say, the mix of our businesses mean something. If electrical continues to have significant growth, that means a really lot to us. Right?
Curt Woodworth - JP Morgan: Because the incrementals are much higher there or yes --?
John Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Exactly. And if we get some shift in pool and spa business or some are lower-margin business, so we're trying to give guidelines here. But to frame it, we still think organic growth for the company is closer to 3.5 to 4.5, somewhere in that range.
Curt Woodworth - JP Morgan: Okay. And… okay then I guess within that in terms of thinking about the incremental margins on the business lines, can you give us a sense for what you are thinking about for growth for Pump, Pool and Filtration for '08?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure, we're expecting all three to grow, but Filtration is our most global business and in next year, our global growth is really important. So I would say that global filtration and global flow technologies are the areas where we would expect to see the higher growth less so in Pool, it's the most North American. One of the reasons we gave the chart that we did in terms of the GBU split, the data on there once you get a chance to take a look at it shows you the present exposure to different markets by geography and also gives you some rough targets of what we think ROS would be. But I'm expecting flow technologies and filtration growth internationally to be higher.
Curt Woodworth - JP Morgan: And --
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I think electrical is no… we see no evidence that electrical is going to slow. They're doing really well in petrochem and a number of other segments. We read the same things everyone else does. We certainly are not on a mission, but right now our momentum is good, so I would expect electrical to be stronger. And I've taken a cautious view of telecom. They tell me telecom is going to come back and wait and see.
Curt Woodworth - JP Morgan: Great. And you do expect the Pool markets to be up for you?
John Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We've got --
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: No. No. Flat, flattish.
Curt Woodworth - JP Morgan: Flat, I got it.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Just around a tad.
Curt Woodworth - JP Morgan: Okay. And then just lastly looking at productivity in the fourth quarter for Water up, it's about a 450 basis point benefit on no low-volume leverage. So I guess the question is looking out to 2008, if you assume that you get no volume leverage and I assume you still get the annualized benefit of the productivity that staggered throughout this year, would it be fair to say under that assumption that margins in Water should still grow, all those being equal?
John Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Curt, I mean when you take a look at Q4, it was the first quarter for both Water and the company where sourcing outpaced inflation. So a significant piece of Q4 was finally starting to get ahead on the sourcing pipeline versus where we've been behind all year on the inflation, so nice overlap there.
Curt Woodworth - JP Morgan: Okay.
John Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: If you extrapolate that into Q1, Q3 and four next year, that's why we feel confident we've made progress finally on the sourcing deck. And also in 2007 and 2006 as Randy mentioned, we were doing some significant investment in lean and rearranging our factory footprint and we are beginning to see some benefit of that in Q4 and we think we'll see further benefit of that in 2008.
Curt Woodworth - JP Morgan: Great. Thank you very much.
John Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Schneider with Robert W. Baird.
Michael Schneider - R.W. Baird: Good morning, guys.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Michael Schneider - R.W. Baird: Maybe just sticking with the Water Group organic growth, so it looks like you're looking for 3%, which is down just a hair from the 4% in 2007. Which group are your actually expecting to decelerate more? Is it the municipal businesses?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, year-over-year, it's Pool. If you take a look at Pool, you think about that, we carried $15 million of extra early buy from '06 to '07 that we got in the first quarter. And then we had that… and then we had… we were up 11% or so in Pool in the fourth quarter. A lot of that's share, but a lot of that is… a lot of that was just the timing in early buy. So if you think about that swing right there it... '07 was higher in volume and that reads out in the organic growth. So that difference is probably all of it, I would say, will you John?
John Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, I would. I think if you take a look at what we... by business I mean I think, we think North American residential pump experienced as you are aware, a double hit in 2007.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, actually, in '07 residential filtration was worse than we thought, residential pump was worse than we thought, residential pools was better than we thought, and as going into the year, and then not surprisingly we understand why the markets were worse than we thought they would be. And we're still taking a pretty sober eye view of the North America residential market in '08.
Michael Schneider - R.W. Baird: Okay. Then on the North American pool business then because you benefited from a delayed buy in Q1 kind of a pre-buy in Q4, I guess give me your thoughts then just given the trajectory of housing renovation spending, why you believe pool could actually be flat in volumes and price?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Let me call it a little bit down, obviously we use that as the base expectation. Couple of things, our success with new product is extraordinary. The IntelliFlow program along with one of our other environmental focus programs are doing really, really well, they are growing double-digit. In fact we take a look at what the markets did versus what we did even factoring out the early buy, we gained a lot of share. We also had some major wins I'm not... rather not point out who they are yet. But we converted one of the largest distributors in the country to Pentair in '07, and we get the benefit in '08 and we converted one of the largest pool builders in the country. And I don't think there is much overlap between those two. So, the... that helps. The other thing is we saw a lot of momentum in commercial pool, and the content is going up. In fact what I took this out of the… as long as you asked about pool, I took this out of the script because it was a little long. So we launched a new solar guard control, which basically integrates all of the efficient products along with this new controller, which can control a solar heater for pools, which we think is pretty cool. So we continue to innovate there. And 60 to 65% of the business is replacement to begin with, so --.
Michael Schneider - R.W. Baird: Okay. And then just on slide 15 on the walk through on the guidance, John, maybe you can just address specifically the price mix line is $0.20 to the low end of it to the high end. In this environment, I guess can you give us some sense of where the price would be coming from, because there is sort of volume pressure out in the marketplace today, especially in residential. It seems optimistic to get $0.20 additional in pricing on top of the $0.40, you got in '07 and maybe you can drill down as the specific what business units drive that?
John Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, I would say I would actually look at the other way I mean I think I felt we are being a little conservative because most of our price agreements right now are done and concluded. And I put in a little bit of push in for if we have to go back and soften those reductions, which we have not had to do yet. But were we still getting prices, raw material prices have eased as far as change, they have not softened or been reduced, and we're still gaining material push through in some of our markets and channels. Certainly, the market you are aware of, which I would say is residential submersible pumps is not price gaining market.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: That would be a net negative.
John Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: That would be a net negative. But most of other markets right now are holding in as far as our ability to gain price. And we [inaudible] we have the systems to track it and we keep an eye on it.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I think I mentioned before, one of the prima facie evidence that you're in a good market is what kind of pricing degrees of freedom you have. And so that we actually track, as John said, really closely what our business can do. And we judge our businesses attractiveness in terms of investments based on… one of the things we look at is their ability to control their own destiny with price. So, we think… we don't think we are being aggressive as John said.
John Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: So, Mike, I'll give you some quick ideas without putting our business at jeopardy here in their markets, but we gain price in electrical, we're doing well. We are giving up price in some of the electronics markets in which we serve. We are experiencing pricing difficulty from our European based businesses competing against China, sourcing and/or North American sourcing. But as you are aware, we also make a lot of those products that ship into Europe from North America and to have in some cases with some of our products duplicate, product to offer from a lower source of the United States and we are benefiting from that on the other end. And so, we would say that we are probably experiencing similar to what the rest of the world is experiencing that the high euro is impacting our competitiveness from localized businesses in Europe. But, given the fact that we can compete out of United States in China, we are finding alternate ways to win that product.
Michael Schneider - R.W. Baird: Okay. And then just by contrast. It seems like you are being conservative on the volume FX line on that same walk through basically down $0.16, up $0.04, if organic growth is going to come in at 3.5 to 4.5 for the total company, why wouldn't there be more leverage on the volume?
John Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I think you would see more leverage on the volume. And I think just trying to provide you that would see a down sourcing of manufacturing line and I think what we tried to give you was identification of what we can see today and kind of what we can count on.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: And the reason we added that was because, since we gave our guidance, it's pretty clear that the markets aren't better as I mentioned in the script. They are… they may come out a little bit worse. So, what we've been working on is to make sure that we have a plan that makes sense in the environment we see today. And these numbers are what I would call, as John called them a little earlier, guide posts that make sense. And this is not a 100% mathematically pure, right? So there is a tuck here and there and so, to Dean's question he asked earlier where the hedge go, it is in there.
Michael Schneider - R.W. Baird: Okay. Thank you again.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Quealy with Canaccord Adams.
John Quealy - Canaccord Adams: Good afternoon.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Good afternoon.
John Quealy - Canaccord Adams: Going into Q4, just a quick question again in Water, North America residential water treatment, Randy, I don't know if you talked about it, how much was it down in the quarter and then also, what are your expectations for that piece of business in '08?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: It was actually not down when you looked at commercial residential. Residential was down, commercial was up. The residential, again, it was weak and probably mid-single digits, 4%, 5% down residential.
John Quealy - Canaccord Adams: And I would assume that is sort of the outlook for that particular residential line in '08?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. I mean, we are not… in our assumption, looking forward, we are not assuming any kind of market moves, moving the number. They have to based either on one of our global growth initiatives or on market rates, but that are more positive like Latin America or Middle East.
John Quealy - Canaccord Adams: Great. And my last question on the buyback, you mentioned that it is going to be enabled throughout the year. Any particular trigger points, evaluation or timing that you're looking out there?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We intend to do it all, to take the $50 million and we'll put it to work. But I don't think I would give any guidance as to what, where and when.
John Quealy - Canaccord Adams: Thanks guys.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Lucas, Janney Montgomery Scott.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott: Good afternoon guys.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Jim. How are you doing?
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott: A couple of questions here. First, following upon something Michael touched on Fairbanks. With the growth you have seen there in the backlog, is that a share market dynamics, can you just give us a quick update on the municipal side and on the flow business, have you seen any signs of slowing in any pockets on the commercial side?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I would say on the municipal side, that we would counter the share but what I think we are doing is we are reaching into more segments that we might not have been competing in before. So, for instance we've had some nice wins on the some water reuse programs out in California. We have got more business that we are doing in the Middle East. So I would say that, I would say we have more add backs [ph] which is really encouraging and by the way and there is more add backs we need to go get. That I think… that's an opportunity, that business is one that we can globalize, we have begun to globalize and our Fairbanks Morse team has done a great job with that. So I would say that, I think we are growing in fact we have grown our backlog faster there but I would not say it is a win rate. I would say it's the number of add backs, that's the way I think about bid businesses. And then in terms of commercial, our commercial business has remained strong because they are doing more and more export and we have seen a moderating volume in North American commercial. But at the same time our export business has increased.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott: Okay. And the switching gears on the acquisition side, two unrelated questions. One, can you just, you have talked with regards on the capital allocation about the share repurchase, but if you could just give us the thought process of how you are approaching the M&A market going forward and secondly with your commentary about the acquisition being ahead of expectation, could you just talk briefly about where those expectations have been exceeded?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, first your first question, acquisitions have always played a role in our strategy, they continue to and we continue to look in the places that support our strategy, which we have talked about before. In particular those areas are today can extend our reach globally and get us into new markets or to extend our reach vertically in terms of vertical markets that we want to be in or technical capability we want to be in. So if you look at Jung Pump, it basically extended our flow technologies business globally with a great brand and a great franchise position in Germany with a window on the Eastern Europe. And that in case of Porous Media it extended us into industrial filtration, raised our technology profile, gave us nice windows in the oil and gas and strengthen us in industrial filtration. So you can expect more of the same around technology and around global expansion would be my priority areas I would look at, but anything that supports all four of the GBU are investable. So anything that supports those four GBU strategies like McClain [ph] did a number of years ago for technical products would be something we would look out as well. The second part of your question was about --.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott: Integration and --.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Oh the integration of the two businesses. Right now, I would say Porous Media is beating on both bottom line and top line and in particular there is a number of growth initiatives that have frankly exceeded plan. One of them we have talked about is the pre-filtration product that basically they have invented for desalination plants, which we have in test right now. That product is called Aqualine and there is a number of other areas were their technology is applicable in food service and actually in some things in tech products that we are looking at right now, which is kind of interesting, but early on more the experimental stage. But they have also achieved the growth we expected them to achieve in the core markets that they are in which are oil and gas and medical. So in that case… and in the case of Jung Pump, I think they have exceeded it… about matted [ph] on the top line and they have beaten it on the bottom lines of greater productivity is the source there. And we are just beginning to get after the Eastern European opportunities that Jung presents to us, so. That's why I am feeling really good about both.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott: Okay. Thank you very much.
John Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Jim.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Francesca Mccann with Stanford Financial.
Francesca McCann - Stanford Financial: Hi, good afternoon.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, there.
John Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi.
Francesca McCann - Stanford Financial: Good year.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Francesca McCann - Stanford Financial: Looking at Europe quickly and kind of a break down of your business in Western Europe versus Eastern Europe versus the Middle East and then also what do you see when you're looking at those different markets?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: They are looking up the numbers specifically. While they are doing that, just in terms of where we see it. For the Middle East it's largely for us the Turkey down through Saudi Arabia. We saw, as I mentioned, 20% growth. That business for us is growing very well in commercial markets and in what we would call municipal here, but I would call the infrastructure there, food service is a big opportunity and we continue to invest to grow there and I would be disappointed if we don't do another 20 plus percent in the coming year. Eastern Europe, we are growing well but it's still too smaller base. So one of the things that I would like to see from our GBUs is more resources deployed to grow Eastern Europe faster. The business if you look at it from a Water standpoint… from a technical product standpoint, it's probably 90% to 95%. It's still in Western Europe, and so they have a big opportunity. That's excluding Israel, actually they have a pretty good business in Israel. So it’s probably closer to the 90%. And then for Water, it's still probably about 80% in the Western Europe with the Middle East being 5 to 10 and Eastern Europe about 5.
Francesca McCann - Stanford Financial: Okay. And then if you can kind of go into detail on what you are seeing in Western Europe and even country specific, what the outlook there is?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I can't get any company... country-specific. Basically in Western Europe, we have some of the best growth we have ever seen in Western Europe in '07 but there is some moderating growth there and with the Euro where it is, you can be nothing but cautious. I mean, they are losing their competitiveness globally. So we... when we talked about having a cautious outlook on volume, I would say Western Europe is also one more cautious about not just North America.
Francesca McCann - Stanford Financial: Okay. And for both Water and Technical Products then?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, although Technical Products did not have a great year growth in Western Europe. They actually had more promising growth now than they had in '08. So my comment about the greatest year... a great growth year was really a Water product.
Francesca McCann - Stanford Financial: Okay.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: In '07.
Francesca McCann - Stanford Financial: Okay. So overall then again just to reiterate the Western Europe growth perhaps flat or perhaps kind of minimal growth in water and flat or maybe declining in Technical Products?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: No, I would expect it is going to be up in '08. Because again they didn't have a good Western... they didn't have a good growth in '07.
John Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Electronics and Technical Products is more project-specific, Francesca. And if you take a look at Water, it is more market dependant. So I think where we see it, we know kind of where our program wins are on the electronic side in Western Europe. Your comments about us being flat to modestly up in water are appropriate.
Francesca McCann - Stanford Financial: Okay. Great. And what about India? If you can tell us what you are seeing there and what growth opportunities and timeframe you see looking at that market?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, India is three things for us, it's our largest engineering center, which we continue to grow in Delhi, and they are integrated into our global product development activities. There is Goa, which is our factory and the base of our in India business. It's our global base for CodeLine, which is the vessels for our reverse osmosis. And then it is the base for the business that we are building in India. Actually both for Technical Products and for Water right now. Technical Products is growing very nicely from a very, very small base. And we are looking there at what we need to do in order to expand our capability in the country, but obviously country is important in the communication space as India is a big technical products market opportunity for us. And then in Water, we had very solid growth from a bigger base and in particular our focus is on commercial and we had good success with our rural water program that we have put in place. So, mostly the commercial arena and we are trying to get bigger than industrial. We pulled back on our residential activities in India.
Francesca McCann - Stanford Financial: Okay. Great. And then last question just some update on the Franklin Electric [inaudible] situation?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: It is what it is. I mean it continues to be a tough battle in a market that’s down. We have over 90% acceptance rate on our Pentech motored pump and we are out there doing hand-to-hand combat. So it has gone according to oil and it's not what I spent a lot of time worrying about.
Francesca McCann - Stanford Financial: Okay. All right. Thank you so much.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Todd Gleason - Vice President, Investor Relations: Latonya, this is Todd Gleason, how many more people do we have in the queue?
Operator: Looks like we have two more questions in queue.
Todd Gleason - Vice President, Investor Relations: Okay. Let's try and answer those then.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of David Whang with Lehman Brothers.
Dan Whang - Lehman Brothers: Good afternoon. Actually it is Dan.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Dan.
Dan Whang - Lehman Brothers: How are you.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We knew that.
Dan Whang - Lehman Brothers: Okay. Well thanks for taking my question here. On slide number 10 you have the break down of the different business segments with their current margins and I guess you have [inaudible] 10% and a flow and filtration at 14%. So as you expect a 100 basis point improvement in margins in '08, I mean where will be… will we be seeing those margin improvements, is it primarily flow in filtration with the pool, I guess the volumes are still expected to be flattish?
John Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, given then our business are listing, we clearly expect it from everywhere. If you think about externally, when we take a look at it, I think the biggest opportunities we see are continuing to expand the flow and those are global margins. So, clearly we think we have significant upside there. Pool and spa has been doing a lot of work on lean and manufacturing and sourcing enhancements. So, despite our view of a flat market, we think there is significant opportunity in the pool and spa side. And then filtration of water, we are getting the operational improvements, but to Randy's earlier question, it's also our most amount of investment on strategic marketing and R&D. So we are probably in the 20 to 30 basis points in filtration. And in the others, we are expecting 50 to 100.
Dan Whang - Lehman Brothers: Okay. And so in terms of Pool, I mean where it is the margin gap between the other two segments. Is there anything structurally different… backlog?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. I mean the pool business… the pool and spa business is made up of basically pool equipment, which is the thing we all think about behind people's homes and in hotels. There is the Spa business, which is basically pumps and fittings for Jetted Tubs and Jacuzzi type Spas that everyone is familiar with and then there is National Pool Tile, which is our distribution business that sells tile and other related products in the pool industry. The margins are very different between those three. Pool equipment is really quite a bit higher than that 10% and the other two can't see 10% from where they are. So they have a mixed issue.
John Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Does that answer your question.
Dan Whang - Lehman Brothers: It certainly does. The second final question is, obviously we are seeing faster growth in Europe and Asia in Pool segments, and I think particularly just honing in on Water, I think historically you've had more favorable margins in the European business and just wanted to just get a better feel in terms of the relative margins, the North American Water versus Europe, Asia and currently and kind of the trends expected going forward?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, Asia is the lowest. Just staying with Water, Asia is lower margins, North America is the middle and Europe is indeed higher in margins and quite well in the two biggest businesses there in filtration and flow technology. And our focus there is, we want to make sure that we grow. So we want to invest and I don't want to say, we don't want margins to go up in Europe, I would like margins to go up in Europe. But I really want to see us invest, to grow and I think our opportunity in the Middle East is vast. And one that we could put and should put a lot more resources against and Eastern Europe as well. So I don't necessarily project the margins in the Eastern Europe and the Middle East to be the same as in Western Europe.
John Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And as we mentioned, Dan, I mean we have access capacity in North America, but quite frankly, we are proud of the way our teams have moved to take people out and we are keeping patience margins despite the softer value in North America. And I think we are going to be well positioned when the market returns with a much better cost position that we can continue to grow from.
Dan Whang - Lehman Brothers: Got it. Thank you very much.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Your last question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
Chris Glynn - Oppenheimer: Thank you.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Glynn.
Chris Glynn – Oppenheimer: Hi. On the tech products, electronic side you got a pretty nice ramp in the margins, in the third quarter, maybe in the second half kind of the trough quarters, how much variability and dynamism is there still there or do you feel you are kind of… at a new sustained kind of stability even if it’s well below the electrical side?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: There is still more margin improvement to get in electronic. Right now, if you look at electronics, actually our highest margins are Asia and our lowest margins are North America. So, we still have ways to go in terms of getting North American margins up. The trend is good, but North America in particular isn't close to what we believe they should be running at. So, and in Europe, I wouldn't mind seeing some more margin expansion there. Asia, good margins, let’s grow some more.
Chris Glynn - Oppenheimer: Okay. So you don't see much risk of market dynamics causing regression to those kind of trough quarters?
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: No.
Chris Glynn - Oppenheimer: Okay. And then, just on the organic growth again, I think that someone asked a question about the 3% or 4% guidance versus this year, and the delta was pointed to the interesting year with a strong thrust in fourth quarters for pool. Just another delta, it sounds like I think you called for softening in the commercial industrial North America markets, is that just something that's kind of factored… how is that factored in?
John Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We have seen moderating growth, but not significant downturns there. And so, I'm not even predicting a significant impact to us, if that makes sense, but I don't think we're going to count a double-digit growth in those space even.
Chris Glynn - Oppenheimer: Okay.
John Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I mean, just to summarize Randy's comments and Todd will certainly work this through with everyone. If you take a look at the growth by the three water businesses, we are highlighting that pool had a fantastic year and that's what we're trying to identify, that they had a great year with energy efficiency, the programs Randy mentioned and really growing share. I don't think it's prudent to expect that we continue to do that in this type of marketplace. So we are not expecting significant downturn, just moderating. Conversely, I think pump is going to have a better year than we had in 2007, primarily because I think they had a dual impact of a residential downturn and significant amounts of inventory out of the channel. And I think we would expect a little bit better North American flow here. And filtration has anniversaried on several customers issues that they had and are beginning to see momentum on their growth side as well. It's just the residential water treatment of their business is a fairly large impact to them. So I would expect them to be a little bit better as well.
Chris Glynn - Oppenheimer: Great. That's helpful. Thanks.
John Stauch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.
Randall J. Hogan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Thank you all. Operator, we will close it out now if you give the callback number, if anyone wants to listen.
