Once our call concludes, the IR team will be available to answer any further questions. With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Leonard Schleifer. Len?
Leonard Schleifer: Thanks, Ryan, and thanks to everyone joining today's call. For my remarks, I will review some of our key performance drivers, then briefly discuss some pipeline advances we have made this year. I will then hand the call over to George, who will provide additional insights on our pipeline. From there, Marion will review our first quarter 2025 commercial performance. And finally, Chris will detail our financial results and provide an update on our 2025 financial outlook. Let's get to it. Regeneron's performance in the first quarter was mixed, with some difficult news related to our retinal franchise, offset by encouraging news relating to the rest of our commercial portfolio, as well as advances in our robust pipeline of differentiated clinical candidates. Beginning with EYLEA and EYLEA HD. On a macro basis, in the first quarter of 2025, the overall size of the branded anti-VEGF category contracted due to an increase in the usage of low-cost off-label repackaged Avastin, likely driven by patient affordability issues because of a funding gap at copay assistance foundations. With respect to EYLEA, first quarter 2025 U.S. net sales were $736 million, down 39% compared to the first quarter of last year and down 38% compared to the fourth quarter of 2024. However, physician unit demand decreased by 14% sequentially, with the balance of the decline primarily attributable to lower wholesale inventory levels, which ended the quarter in the normal range. With respect to EYLEA HD in the United States, first quarter 2025 sales were $307 million, up 54% compared to the first quarter of last year and were essentially flat on a sequential basis. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2024, EYLEA HD physician unit demand grew by 5%, which was offset primarily by a modest wholesaler inventory drawdown. On the regulatory front, last Wednesday, we were disappointed with the FDA's decision to issue a complete response letter for our submission seeking approval for the EYLEA HD pre-filled syringe. Since receiving the CRL, we have held several teleconferences with the FDA to better understand the contents of the CRL, and believe the key outstanding issue relates to a question posed by the FDA to a third-party component supplier. This component supplier has expeditiously responded to FDA requests for information. The CRL did not identify any issues with respect to the safety or efficacy of EYLEA HD, the usability of the device, proposed labeling or pre-approval inspection findings. We also recently announced that the FDA had accepted for priority review an sBLA for EYLEA HD to treat macular edema following retinal vein occlusion or RVO and for monthly dosing in approved indications following the use of a priority review voucher. We believe these product enhancements will strengthen EYLEA HD's position in the competitive anti-VEGF category, if approved. Moving to Dupixent. First quarter 2025 net product sales grew 20% globally on a constant currency basis versus the first quarter of 2024, reflecting strong growth across all approved indications in all groups -- in all age groups, I should say, and in all geographic regions. In the U.S., where net product sales grew 19%, Dupixent now leads in both new-to-brand prescription share and total prescription share across all of its approved indications, with the only exception being chronic spontaneous urticaria or CSU, which was approved by the FDA only 11 days ago. The COPD launch in the U.S. continues to gain momentum with prescribers increasingly appreciating the role of Type 2 inflammation in certain patients with COPD, coupled with greater urgency to identify and treat eligible patients. Payers are increasingly recognizing the value that Dupixent offers and have implemented broad and favorable coverage decisions for commercial and Medicare patients. With those pieces in place, we now look to drive patient awareness of Dupixent as a new treatment option for COPD through a recently launched direct-to-consumer campaign. Libtayo in the U.S. grew 21% compared to the first quarter of last year and has established itself as a cornerstone therapy for advanced non-melanoma skin cancer, while its share of the lung cancer market continues to increase. In the highly competitive first-line advanced non-small cell lung cancer market, Libtayo is now second in new-to-brand prescription share despite launching years after other competing therapies, reflecting its differentiated clinical profile and our commercial strategy. We expect Dupixent, EYLEA HD and Libtayo to continue delivering significant growth for the foreseeable future through additional penetration in approved indications, potential future indications, potential combinations with other pipeline candidates, as well as other potential product enhancements. Now, briefly moving to our pipeline, which now includes approximately 45 product candidates in clinical development. We continue to make significant investments in R&D, which have yielded notable progress across several key programs so far this year, including four regulatory approvals and nine regulatory submissions. For the remainder of 2025, we anticipate U.S. regulatory approvals for linvoseltamab in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, odronextamab in late-line follicular lymphoma, Libtayo in adjuvant CSCC, Dupixent and bullous pemphigoid, as well as differentiated enhancements to the EYLEA HD U.S. label. We also now expect to read out pivotal or proof-of-concept data across programs in immunology, oncology, hematology, internal medicine and rare diseases, programs that George will discuss in a minute. In closing, Regeneron remains in a very strong position scientifically, commercially and financially, enabling us to invest heavily in R&D and deliver scientific breakthroughs, maximize growth opportunities from our in-line brands, successfully launch new products and indications and return capital directly to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We look forward to providing updates on these efforts as we move through the remainder of 2025. With that, I'll turn the call over to George.
George Yancopoulos: Thanks, Len. 2025 is shaping up to be an exciting year for advancing our broad and differentiated pipeline, and we look forward to reporting several pivotal or proof-of-concept datasets from multiple programs. I would like to briefly highlight these significant opportunities and discuss additional pipeline advancements. Starting with Dupixent, which continues to set a high bar across multiple Type 2 allergic diseases. Earlier this month, Dupixent was approved for the treatment of adults and adolescents with chronic spontaneous urticaria who remain uncontrolled despite antihistamine treatment. This approval marks the seventh Type 2 allergic disease for which Dupixent has been approved by the FDA and is the first new treatment option for CSU patients in over a decade. Dupixent was also accepted for priority review for the treatment of bullous pemphigoid, with the PDUFA date of June 20. Bullous pemphigoid represents yet another first-in-class opportunity for Dupixent, which is the only biologic to achieve significant improvements in disease remission and symptoms in this setting. And finally, Dupixent became the first-ever biologic medicine to be approved for COPD in Japan, marking the 45th country in which the COPD indication has been approved. We are eagerly awaiting the pivotal readout for itepekimab, our interleukin-33 antibody for COPD and former smokers regardless of eosinophil levels, with data expected in the middle of 2025. In addition to COPD, we recently initiated a Phase 3 program for itepekimab in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, an indication with strong genetic validation, as well as a Phase 2 study in chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps. In addition, next year, we are expecting proof-of-concept data for itepekimab in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. Turning now to oncology efforts. We recently submitted U.S. and EU regulatory filings for Libtayo in adjuvant CSCC, where Libtayo became the first immunotherapy to show a benefit in a high-risk population. In early June, these data will be presented in an oral presentation at the American Society of Clinical Oncology or ASCO Annual Meeting, highlighting a 68% reduction in the risk of disease recurrence or death compared to placebo, with no new safety signals identified. This dataset underscores our belief that Libtayo provides a best-in-class foundation for combinations with our other oncology assets. And in this regard, Libtayo is being tested in combination with fianlimab, our Lag-3 antibody in several solid tumor settings. In melanoma, early clinical data have suggested that this combination can provide substantial additive benefit compared to PD-1 monotherapy without exacerbating safety. An ongoing Phase 3 trial in first-line metastatic melanoma evaluating this combination compared to KEYTRUDA monotherapy is expected to read out in the second half of this year. We reiterate that these data confirm best-in-class activity in melanoma, it will increase our confidence for this combination in other cancer settings. In first-line advanced non-small cell lung cancer, a pre-planned interim analysis was conducted this month on two ongoing Phase 2 studies evaluating this combination. Due to limited follow-up, the Phase 2 portion of the studies will continue unchanged until additional data are available. The next analysis for these studies are expected in the first quarter of 2026, in which a decision whether to advance to Phase 3 will be made. No new safety signals were observed in either study. Turning to our CD3 bispecifics, the European Commission recently granted conditional marketing authorization for Lynozyfic or linvoseltamab, or BCMAxCD3 bispecific for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, who have received at least three prior therapies, marking Lynozyfic's first global regulatory approval. In the U.S., our resubmission of the linvoseltamab BLA for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma was accepted by the FDA with the PDUFA date of July 10. We believe linvoseltamab has the potential to be the best-in-class BCMAxCD3 bispecific due to its differentiated clinical profile, dosing, and administration. Our broad clinical program in earlier lines emphasizes monotherapy and limited combinations and continues to advance with a confirmatory Phase 3 LINKER-MM3 study in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, now fully enrolled. At ASCO, also in oral presentations, we will present initial results from the Phase 1/2 LINKER-MM2 trial, evaluating linvoseltamab in combinations with casirivimab and with bortezumab in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Both combinations demonstrated a high rate of deep and durable responses with a safety profile consistent with the individual drugs, supporting further development. For odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific, the FDA has accepted the BLA resubmission for relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma with a PDUFA date of July 30. odronextamab has demonstrated potentially best-in-class efficacy in this late-line setting, and our differentiated clinical development focuses on monotherapy and limited novel combinations in earlier line and continues to advance. Turning to hematology, we are rapidly advancing our Factor XI program, where we are investigating two different antibodies that target different factor XI domains to create a tailored approach to anticoagulation, offering the potential for improved blood clot prevention and lower bleeding risk. We remain on track to enroll patients in pivotal studies this year, both in settings with large patient populations and longer follow-up, as well in settings with smaller populations and shorter follow-up that may provide a quicker path to market. Moving to our obesity efforts. Regeneron has decades of experience in muscle biology, growth factor signaling pathways and genetics. We are capitalizing on this expertise to position ourselves as a key player in the rapidly expanding obesity market by investigating agents that enhance GLP-1 weight loss by maintaining muscle mass. Our muscle-sparing Phase 2 COURAGE study is investigating the addition of trevogrumab, our GDF8 antibody to semaglutide with and without garetosmab, or activin A antibody with the goal of improving the quality of weight loss. We expect to report data for the 26-week primary endpoints, including percentage of weight loss and percentage of fat loss compared to baseline in the second half of this year. At the upcoming American Diabetes Association meeting in June, we anticipate that Lilly will present Phase 2 data from a very related program evaluating semaglutide combined with an antibody that binds to Activin Type 2 receptors, which blocks myostatin and Activin signaling. The weight loss, lean mass preservation, overall metabolic profile, along with safety and tolerability, will help inform next steps for our programs as well. And finally, moving to our Regeneron genetic medicines pipeline, our novel C5 siRNA and antibody combination has demonstrated rapid, complete, and uninterrupted inhibition of C5 as seen in our ongoing pivotal program in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. These profound findings increase our confidence in seeing robust improvement in generalized myasthenia gravis, where pivotal results from an ongoing Phase 3 program are expected in the second half of this year. Our unique mechanism of action provides more complete C5 inhibition than observed with other C5 approaches that are approved in this indication, as well as the potential for more convenient subcutaneous regimens. In summary, Regeneron continues to deliver scientific firsts and drive innovation. Our unique R&D capabilities have allowed us to build one of the most prolific pipelines in our industry, and we look forward to reporting multiple impactful readouts later this year. With that, let me turn it over to Marion.
Marion McCourt: Thank you, George. Despite a challenging environment in the first quarter, our commercial teams are positioned to capitalize on multiple near-term opportunities across the portfolio, including product enhancements and launches of both new medicines and new indications for previously approved medicines. Looking to the future, as George highlighted, our pipeline is poised to deliver the next wave of significant commercial opportunities that may provide innovative medicines to even more patients. Beginning with our first quarter results for EYLEA HD and EYLEA, combined U.S. net sales were $1.04 billion, down 30% sequentially, primarily reflecting lower wholesaler inventory levels for both products, which declined during the quarter to the normal range, as well as continued competitive pressures. In aggregate, sequential physician unit demand for EYLEA HD and EYLEA declined by 11%. We believe there was a significant negative impact in the branded anti-VEGF category due to an ongoing funding gap at not-for-profit patient assistance foundations that provide co-pay support for eligible patients with retinal diseases. Consequently, low-cost off-label repackaged Avastin increased its anti-VEGF category share by approximately 6 percentage points to 32%. Despite these challenges, EYLEA HD and EYLEA captured 41% of the anti-VEGF category, maintaining market leadership. For the first quarter, EYLEA U.S. net sales were at $736 million, primarily due to lower wholesaler inventory levels, lower physician demand, as well as increased competition. While we expect competitive pressures for EYLEA to persist, our focus remains on promoting the ongoing adoption of EYLEA HD, which has the potential to become the new standard of care. EYLEA HD was the only branded medicine in the anti-VEGF category to maintain U.S. net sales quarter-over-quarter, achieving $307 million and growing 54% year-over-year. In August, we anticipate potential FDA approvals of EYLEA HD and retinal vein occlusion and for every four-week dosing across all approved indications. If approved in RVO, EYLEA HD would be the first and only treatment that can be dosed up to every eight weeks, which is twice as long as any other product in the category. In addition, with the potential approval of every four-week dosing, EYLEA HD would offer physicians the most flexible dosing options in the category. With these label enhancements and anticipated approval of the prefilled syringe, we expect to see an acceleration in EYLEA HD demand. And now to Dupixent. In the first quarter, Dupixent achieved global net sales of $3.7 billion, representing a 20% year-over-year increase on a constant currency basis. In the U.S., net sales grew 19% to $2.6 billion based on robust demand across all approved indications. In the first quarter, U.S. net price was unfavorably impacted by the annual reset of commercial insurance deductibles and the implementation of Medicare Part D redesign. Dupixent continues to live up to its potential to dramatically improve patients' lives with approvals in seven indications, four of which have achieved blockbuster status globally. Dupixent's unique mechanism of action makes it the only medicine that addresses the underlying drivers of disease and treats multiple comorbid Type 2 conditions. Despite increasing competition in established indications, Dupixent remains the market leader. In atopic dermatitis, increased promotional spend from competitors has accelerated market growth, with Dupixent continuing to capture the vast majority of new patients. In asthma, Dupixent continues to lead all biologics, a new to brand share, and is now the category leader in total prescriptions. Momentum in new indications continues to build, and COPD uptake is accelerating. Most pulmonologists have extensive experience in prescribing Dupixent for asthma and are increasingly prescribing it for COPD. Many have remarked on Dupixent's ability to reduce exacerbations, rapidly and meaningfully improve lung function, and reduce the need for oxygen therapy. With physician and patient awareness building and strong reimbursement established, the COPD launch has outperformed all other Dupixent indication launches in cumulative new-to-brand prescriptions with the exception of atopic dermatitis. Earlier this month, Dupixent was approved to treat patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria or CSU, where we estimate there are more than 300,000 patients in the U.S. with disease inadequately controlled by antihistamines. Dupixent is the first new targeted treatment for CSU in over 10 years, providing a new treatment for patients that previously had limited options. The launch is underway, and early feedback has been favorable. Our Dupixent team is also preparing for potential approval in bullous pemphigoid, which would represent the fourth approval in a chronic and debilitating skin disease driven by Type 2 inflammation. Nearly 30,000 adults in the U.S. suffer from this difficult-to-treat condition, where current care is limited to corticosteroids and immunosuppressants. These treatments have core clinical efficacy as well as safety concerns, particularly in older patients. If approved, Dupixent would be the first and only targeted medicine to treat this disease. In summary, Dupixent is now firmly established as the standard of care across a range of Type 2 conditions and has substantial growth opportunities in both existing and new indications. Turning now to Libtayo. First quarter global net sales grew 8% year-over-year on a constant currency basis to $285 million, with U.S. net sales reaching $193 million, up 21%. First quarter results reflect typical seasonality dynamics and the timing of shipments and lower inventory levels. In the U.S., demand continues to increase across both non-melanoma skin cancer indications and lung cancer, and we are seeing growth in approved indications internationally. We look forward to the potential FDA approval of Libtayo for adjuvant treatment of high-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, where we estimate there are approximately 10,000 patients in the U.S. who may benefit from this treatment. Our oncology teams are excited about the potential to launch two new hematology products later this year, linvoseltamab in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma and odronextamab in relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma, both have demonstrated best-in-class clinical profiles in these later-line settings. In summary, our commercial portfolio is well-positioned to capitalize on many near-term growth opportunities, enabling us to deliver more treatments to more patients. With that, I'll turn the call over to Chris.
Chris Fenimore: Thank you, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. First quarter 2025 total revenues were $3 billion, inclusive of higher Sanofi collaboration revenue, driven by Dupixent growth and higher U.S. net sales of EYLEA HD compared to the prior year. First quarter diluted net income per share was $8.22 on net income of $928 million. Beginning with collaboration revenue, revenues from the Sanofi collaboration were approximately $1.2 billion, of which $1 billion related to our share of collaboration profits. Regeneron's share of profits grew 27% versus the prior year, driven by volume growth through Dupixent and higher collaboration margins. The Sanofi development balance was approximately $1.5 billion at the end of the first quarter, reflecting a reduction of approximately $180 million from the end of 2024. Moving to Bayer. First quarter net sales of EYLEA and EYLEA 8 mg outside the U.S. were $858 million, up 5% versus the prior year on a constant currency basis and inclusive of $146 million of EYLEA 8 mg sales. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $344 million, of which $317 million related to our share of net profits outside the U.S. Now to our operating expenses. R&D expense was $1.2 billion in the first quarter. Modest growth versus the prior year was driven by continued investments to support Regeneron's innovative pipeline, including higher personnel expenses and clinical manufacturing costs. First quarter SG&A was $537 million, down 8% from the prior year. The decline was driven by lower general and administrative expenses, while selling expenses were flat year-over-year. First quarter 2025 gross margin on net product sales was 85%. The lower gross margin versus the prior year reflects higher inventory write-offs in the first quarter of 2025 and a changing product mix. Our effective tax rate increased versus the prior year, primarily driven by a lower benefit from stock-based compensation deductions. Regeneron generated $816 million in free cash flow in the first quarter and ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $17.6 billion and debt of approximately $2.7 billion. We continue to monitor developments regarding pharmaceutical sector tariffs. While we do not expect previously enacted tariffs to have a material impact on our business, any potential impact from sector-specific tariffs is not quantifiable at this time due to uncertainty around the details of implementation. Regardless of any potential tariffs, Regeneron has always been committed to making significant investments in the United States to expand our R&D and manufacturing capabilities. We recently announced a new agreement with FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies in North Carolina to invest over $3 billion to nearly double our U.S. large-scale manufacturing capacity. This agreement, along with our $3.6 billion expansion of our Tarrytown, New York, R&D and preclinical manufacturing facilities, our fill/finish facility in Rensselaer, New York, and the acquisition of an additional property in Saratoga Springs, New York, represent planned U.S. investments of over $7 billion. These investments will enable us to continue to grow in the U.S. and support our differentiated R&D engine, while significantly increasing our ability to manufacture both clinical and commercial supply. Beyond these investments, we continued to return capital to shareholders in the first quarter, both through share repurchases and the payment of our recently initiated quarterly dividend. We repurchased approximately $1.1 billion worth of our shares in the first quarter, with approximately $3.9 billion remaining available for share repurchases as of March 31. We continue to see share repurchases as an efficient use of capital and remain opportunistic buyers of our shares. In addition to share repurchases, our newly initiated dividend program allows us increased flexibility to return capital to shareholders. We paid our first quarterly dividend last month and the Board of Directors has declared the next dividend of $0.88 per share, which will be paid in June. Finally, we have updated our 2025 gross margin guidance to be in the range of 86% to 87%. This change is primarily driven by higher-than-expected inventory write-offs in the first quarter. A full summary of our latest guidance can be found in our press release issued earlier this morning. In conclusion, Regeneron's strong financial position will allow us to continue to invest in our differentiated R&D capabilities and pipeline to deliver new medicines to patients and long-term value to shareholders. With that, I'll pass the call back to Ryan.
Ryan Crowe: Thank you, Chris. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call for Q&A. To ensure we are able to address as many questions as possible, we will answer one question from each caller before moving to the next. Josh, can we go to the first question, please?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tyler Van Buren with TD Cowen. You may proceed.
Tyler Van Buren: Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks very much for the question. Regarding the EYLEA HD CRL for the pre-filled syringe, can you elaborate further on the question posed by the FDA and perhaps more importantly, compare the situation to the original EYLEA HD CRL as that speed to resolution was very quick, about 2.5 months, if I'm not mistaken, which would still be ahead of the RVO and every four-week dosing PDUFA in August?
Leonard Schleifer: All right. Tyler, thanks for the call. It's Lens speaking. I think you have to understand a little bit of detail on the processes and what happens in that, when you're reviewing -- when the FDA is reviewing your submission for an approval of a new device, we don't necessarily make all the components. And in this case, we don't make all the components. You might be buying a stopper from somebody, some glass from somebody else, a needle from somebody else and so forth. And we have the design, and then we have an assembly. When the FDA has questions about one of the components, it's -- that's what's referred to as a drug master file. They go to the holder of that drug master file. Let's say it's somebody who makes one of the components, the FDA has a question, well, how do you guys do this? And then the holder of the master file responds to the FDA. By rule, we are not party to that up and back between the FDA and the third-party component supplier. The reason we're not party is because most of the time, these questions relate to general practices where -- in which the supplier is not only supplying Regeneron, they might be supplying 20 other pharmaceutical companies, which is in fact the case in some of these DMFs we're dealing with here. So that's the general tone of things, the questions get asked. In this particular case, the -- based on our phone calls after we received the CRL last Wednesday, we realized that nobody had gotten these questions until the day of the CRL or day before, literally after the CRL. In any case, based on our conversations with the FDA, we believe that there's one key issue that is left to resolve. There are a few other minor ones, which I think were just clarifications. But the one key issue relates to a supplier and the supplier has told us that the FDA asked for some data, they have all the data, they expeditiously supplied it. Now, of course, we don't know the data because we can't be involved by rule in that process. We take it, not word that they think that they have satisfied the agency. Of course, the FDA has to review this. That could be up and back. You said this, well, we really wanted that, maybe have more of this, and so forth. So, that leads to a little bit of uncertainty on how fast this could all get resolved. We do have commitments from the FDA that they will move expeditiously as well. That doesn't mean they'll approve it, but they will review quickly the data that's submitted and have an up and back because they recognize, I think, the importance in advance of the pre-filled syringe being a better way of administering the product than out of a vial for patients getting intravitreal injections. So, boil all that down, how long can this take? It could go quickly. As you said, the last time this happened, it took a few months. It could go longer. We don't think there's a reinspection involved. It's not an issue related to that. So, we don't think there'll be these internal long timelines for that. But we'll know more in the coming weeks or months, and we will hopefully get it across the finish line in a short while, but we'll try and keep you posted once we know what the FDA is really up to. I'm sorry that that's a little indefinite, Tyler, but that's the nature of the process.
Ryan Crowe: Thanks, Len. Let's move to the next question, please, Josh.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alexandria Hammond with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.
Alexandria Hammond: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I want to pivot a little bit. And I'm curious on the pipeline. So, on your Factor XI antibody, it's how do you prioritize which indications to go after? And how should we think about the timing of launches? Can you provide any follow-up, too, on your discussions with regulatory authorities on aligning trial design? Thank you.
George Yancopoulos: How do we prioritize? I couldn't hear…
Leonard Schleifer: Factor XI indications.
George Yancopoulos: Indications. Well, we're doing a combination of indications that are maybe to be expected and will take a little bit longer, as well as some indications that we haven't disclosed that we think we might be able to get across the finish line sooner. In terms of our approaches, what we're trying to prioritize are indications and studies where we'll be able to show the benefit not only of the anti-coagulation profile, but of the differentiated bleeding risk profile of both of these antibodies. And the hope is to actually show that one or both of these antibodies have very favorable anticoagulations, as well as substantially lower bleeding risks than available options for patients. So, we haven't disclosed all the indications, we haven't shown the timing of them, but there's a variety of them. And there -- some of them will be coming in sooner, some of them will be taking a little bit longer and we hope that they will be emphasizing, as I said, the potential for really addressing what's holding back a lot of patients in this field from receiving anticoagulation therapy, which is minimizing the bleeding risk that these people invariably suffer from. As we've announced, we are beginning to enroll Phase 3 studies this year.
Ryan Crowe: Okay. Thanks, George. Let's move to the next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. You may proceed.
Chris Schott: Great. Thanks so much for the question. I just had one on EYLEA and the foundation funding. Appreciate the color on the call. But just any updated thoughts on when we could think about the foundation reopening, and how quickly once it's reopened, we could think about some of these volumes moving from the generic Avastin back to branded agents? Thanks so much.
Leonard Schleifer: Chris, thanks for the question. Just for the benefit of everybody, let me just remind everybody how all this works. When you're under commercial insurance and you're younger than 65, if you have a co-pay in your insurance program, sponsors that people like Regeneron can directly to a patient supply copay assistance in the form of a coupon, et cetera, et cetera. When a patient turns 65 and if they go on Medicare, which most of our patients getting intravitreal injections are, those patients are responsible for a copay, typically around 20% if they're in plain old Medicare, it varies somewhat if they're in Medicare Advantage. Some people, many people, have insurance, supplemental, gap insurance, AARP, whatever you want to call it, which covers these copays. But there are still others who don't have the insurance and can't afford the copay associated with an injection of an anti-VEGF agent, for example. The government has indicated that companies can be part of this safety net, if you will, to help patients who need financial assistance. And the way this works is that companies and others can support independent charitable foundations who then assist patients with retinal disease, regardless of the drug they need. The foundations take in financially eligible patients and give out the assistance that they can afford to give out on a first-come, first-served basis. And so, there is no direct relationship. If we give money to a foundation, it could go to support Vabysmo, it could go to support Pavblu, it could go to support EYLEA, it could go to support in fact, in these funds as they're constructed today, it could go to support the drugs for geographic atrophy. There's no connection as there shouldn't be in what we give and then what the -- how the foundations dole out the resources. We would like to help as many patients as we can. It turns out we prime were the -- if not the sole, the vast supporter of these foundations in the recent history. We're talking about having given large sums of money in the neighborhood of over $400 million last year to do this charitable work. As our commercial outlook in the field has changed, as our resources have changed, we looked at this and said, you know, we'd like to continue doing this, but we can't do it all ourselves. We'd like to help as many people as possible. And so, we're trying to come up with a way where others and Regeneron could make sure that people in need get the drug copay support without regard to what drug they actually choose or their doctors choose. And one of the things that we've come up with is sort of a standard thing that's done, and we all have seen this in our charitable philanthropic efforts. We're considering a matching program where Regeneron would put up and say, we'll put up X dollars to some amount, and that people depending upon other people putting up, we would match their contributions. We would hope that this might stimulate others to be more philanthropic than they've been. We are working through the mechanics of this with the foundation. When this all can get launched, we hope in the not-too-distant future, whether or not others will step up to the plate, I'm not sure, but we certainly hope because patients do need this. I hope that answers your question. And since this is such an important issue, if you -- Chris, if I haven't answered it, we'll give you another question to drill down on this a little further.
Ryan Crowe: Okay. Well, we'll move on for now. Chris, if you'd like to ask another question, please hop back in the queue. Josh, let's move to the next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.
Terence Flynn: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask an additional one on the prefilled syringe. Len, thanks for all the details. But can you confirm that this component is something that's used in your prefilled syringe that's already approved in Europe? Or is this a different component, or is the component used in any other prefilled syringes? Just trying to understand the novelty here and why this might be a hang-up. Thank you.
Leonard Schleifer: Yes. This is the same device, same design, and the same components that was approved in Europe last year and has been safely used for months. So we don't think there is any issue whatsoever with the approvability of this, but the FDA has their own set of questions. They want to know, did you do this or where is the data for that, and that sort of thing, and they don't just automatically approve it just because Europe has approved it. But yes, your question is a good one, Terence. It gives us all some confidence that these issues should be resolvable because they were resolved for European approval.
Ryan Crowe: Okay. Thank you, Len. Let's move to the next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Akash Tewari with Jefferies. You may proceed.
Akash Tewari: Hi, thanks so much. So you mentioned $400 million in patient assistance to Good Days. Can you comment on what percent of your U.S. patient base received funding in 2024? Is 25% a fair estimate? And just to kind of drill into the specifics, from what you've seen in Q1, what percentage of those patients are dual covered or have supplemental insurance, so they would be able to get back on to EYLEA without help from Good Days? And then Len, assuming that other -- Roche and some of these other players don't -- aren't receptive to this matching program. What are you -- what is your team going to do, right? Is there a situation where funding to Good Days doesn't return at any point in 2025?
Leonard Schleifer: A lot of questions embedded in there, but the first series of questions we can't answer. We don't do any correlations about our contributions and the implications for EYLEA usage. That's not permitted, it's not appropriate. And the people who make the decisions that Regeneron are not the commercial people; this is not a conduit of any shape, manner or form, and that's not permissible under the rules. So we don't -- we can't answer any of those questions about EYLEA. In terms of what our game plan is, well, I think you've heard it. We want to stimulate a community of givers. You mentioned one, it doesn't have to be. It could be somebody else. If Elon Musk wants to give, that's good by us, too. We're not targeting anybody in particular. We're just saying that we would like to stimulate others. And I should just leave it at that.
Ryan Crowe: Okay. Thanks so much. Let's move to the next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Carter Gould with Cantor. You may proceed.
Carter Gould: All right. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Sorry to come back to the regulatory operations, and I appreciate all the color and nuance on the pre-filled syringe. But Len, this is your fourth CRL and as well as a delay in the past sort of 12 months. Is there acknowledgment, this performance is unsatisfactory across the regulatory group? And maybe you could highlight any steps you've taken to improve regulatory performance? I recognize there are idiosyncrasies, and if I'm being unfair, please correct me, but the rate of CRLs and delays really stands out versus peers. Thank you.
Leonard Schleifer: Well, that's a tough one. Well, if anybody is going to take responsibility, it's going to be me. I'm not putting this on our regulatory group whatsoever because I think they've done a spectacular job, as has some manufacturing group. We have a lot of activity at the FDA. I can't remember what we said in the nine submissions, and -- so, we're going to have more than our share of regulatory interactions. I think our team is first-rate. The kinds of issues that have come up are reflecting, in my view, an increased scrutiny by the FDA post-COVID on contract manufacturers performing a variety of functions. All of our CRLs -- I should say not all, but for the vast majority of our CRLs, they relate to these issues at third-party suppliers, which the FDA recognized were woefully behind the times during COVID. There wasn't enough of them. They were flanking inspections. And so, I think the FDA is trying to step up the game, if you will, of these contract manufacturers. And since we're so active, we see more. I don't think it's a -- I'll acknowledge for sure that we're unhappy about this. And if there's a blame, I'm happy to take it personally, but it's certainly not the reflection on our regulatory group or manufacturing people who are working really hard to get this right. Now, in some cases, the rules have changed sort of the mid-game. We had a CRL where we hadn't quite enrolled enough people. And why did the FDA change that sort of approach was because other manufacturers weren't bothering to enroll anybody over a 10-year period until they said we're not going to do these accelerated approvals. So, we got caught up in that, but we've rectified that. And we're expecting that approval to come. There was another CRL related to a manufacturing thing with originally with EYLEA out of our control. We got that. And I don't want this to sound like excuses. We own the issues because it's our product, but it is reflective, I think, more of what is going on at the level of the contract manufacturers.
Ryan Crowe: Okay. Let's move to the next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams with RBC. You may proceed.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, this is [Joe] on for Brian. Thanks for taking our question. So for itepekimab, has there been any further evolution of our understanding in IL-33 as a therapeutic target since its Phase 2 COPD data and the mechanistic rationale behind itepekimab's more pronounced benefit in former smokers? And as you expand itepekimab development, how will the COPD results guide the further expansion? Thank you.
George Yancopoulos: Well, a lot of our insights into IL-33 come from genetics in the pathway. As you know from our Regeneron genetic center, we have a large number of human sequence. We can actually see variation in the IL-33 pathway. And what we actually see is that patients who are genetically deficient in this pathway are protected from COPD and those who have excess IL-33 activity are more prone to COPD, as well as a series of other diseases, some of which we've described, we're investigating with additional clinical trials. So, that's where the whole rationale and the whole idea comes from, which indications we go after. As we've already said, our Phase 2 study showed an overall reduction in exacerbations that was driven by this former smoker population. We think we might be understanding a little bit about that mechanism, but nothing definitive and new up until this point. And I do remind you that these Phase 3 studies did pass an interim analysis about halfway through the program, which gives us additional hope and confidence. So, the genetics is strong here. The Phase 2 data was strong here. And the fact that we passed an interim efficacy barrier gives us confidence here. But obviously, we'll be getting the data in a short period of time and that will be definitive.
Ryan Crowe: Any thoughts on future indications based on the COPD results?
George Yancopoulos: Well, we announced, as I just described in my comments, a few ongoing studies and a few studies that we're initiating. We're also very excited about the opportunity in asthma because the data is very strong there. And I think that depending on the COPD results, we might be considering moving into that space as well because the genetics there is also very, very strong.
Ryan Crowe: Thanks, George. Let's move to the next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from William Pickering with Bernstein. You may proceed.
William Pickering: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. On the EYLEA HD monthly dosing submission, the ELARA safety trial just completed enrolling in March and I believe that you submitted the filing before that. So, what percent of the total enrollment was included in the submission? Did you have alignment with the FDA? This would be sufficient? And what's your overall level of confidence in this submission at this point? Thank you.
Leonard Schleifer: I don't think we're going to get into the details of all of that. Suffice it to say that they've accepted our submission and therefore, there's no deficiency. Say, like we didn't have enough numbers or something like that. Now, it's a review issue and we'll see how that process goes. And we'll let you know when we know something. But in terms of whether or not we've satisfied the requirement for evaluation, we did pass that hurdle because it was accepted for review.
Ryan Crowe: Let's move to the next question.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. You may proceed.
Evan Seigerman: Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. I want to pose one for you, Len. Hypothetically speaking, if you could redesign a way to provide patient assistance without the use of charities and current legislation aside, how would you structure that program for Medicare? Would it be direct kind of co-payments for patients who need it, or other kind of mechanisms? How do you think about that?
Leonard Schleifer: Yes. That is a great question. And I addressed that, I think, recently on a CNBC interview that I gave, but let me revisit it. Just to level set everybody, remember, the point being is that we cannot do direct patient assistance to people who are having their drugs paid for by government funding. I suggested with the stroke of a Presidential pen that they could choose to allow sponsors to provide copay assistance directly, the way we do for commercial patients. The notion that somebody is going to take an expensive drug that requires treatment for cancer, let's say, or an ejection in the eye or something like that, because they get copay assistance seems to me ill-founded. And maybe it might increase utilization perhaps, but far more importantly is it means patients will get the best drug that they and their doctors choose for them. There is lots of evidence, and we just had it this quarter that we -- most retinal specialists will tell you that Avastin is not the best drug to treat patients with variety of retinal diseases. Yet people who are poor, who can't afford copays, wind up getting that in a disproportionate number, as you saw when there was no copay assistance here. And that's really the wrong that needs to be righted. And where I designing this, I would allow copay assistance buy directly from sponsors to patients, I think one could literally do this. If the President wanted to do this, he would get millions and millions of seniors would be greatly appreciative that they weren't fussing and worrying and figuring out, am I getting the best treatment that's going to make me not lose my vision or am I getting the right cancer treatment so that I can live to see the next year and so forth. I think that, that would be a great thing for the President to do.
Ryan Crowe: All right. Let's move to one more -- next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.
Salveen Richter: Good morning. Thank you. You tightened your capital expenditure guidance for this year. Can you help us understand this in the context of your recent manufacturing announcements and cadence here for forward spend, noting the current environment?
Chris Fenimore: Yes. Thanks, Salveen, for the question. We lowered the top end of the range by $25 million. There's nothing really to look through that other than just some timing and of the way we see the expenditures going out, but we're committed to our capital plans and nothing has changed accordingly.
Ryan Crowe: Okay. Let's -- I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Risinger with Leerink Partners. You may proceed.
David Risinger: Yes, thanks very much. So, Len, I'm hoping you can address a big picture question. The industry is facing three major U.S. government risks, specifically actions that are harming biopharma innovation, including FDA disruption, questioning of proven medical science, evisceration of the NIH, in addition, tariff threats, and then finally, the Trump administration's agenda to take down drug prices more than the Biden administration. So, considering what appears to be a lack of appreciation in Washington of the benefits that the biopharmaceutical industry brings to Americans, could you please comment on how you and your executive team and board are engaging differently today with Washington leadership to change the political agenda for the better? Thank you.
Leonard Schleifer: Great question, David. Look, I think during this transition period, there is a lot of disruption in Washington. There is loss of personnel, reduction in force, new people in charge, new focuses, and so forth. I told the President that I thought that RFK Jr, while he thinks outside the box, needed some assistance on the science front. I said that straight out and offered to provide that. And I think that there are others who feel similarly as I do, that we can't lose the ability to do science. Does that mean that the way science has been done in this country, the way grants have been given out, is done exactly right? No, there is room for improvement across all of what we do. We saw that during COVID when one of our antibodies didn't get the kind of indication, it clearly should have based on the science. Why that happened? Somebody wasn't following the science. So there's room for improvement. But of course, there's risk, David, as you point out. If we take a path where we just stop following science and we give up on tried and true methodologies, I think we could be in trouble. If we take a fresh look at things, but still get guided by scientific principles, I think things could improve. Obviously, experience does matter, and I really hope that we do not lose really good people at the FDA in the rank and file or even at the policy level. I think that would be deleterious. So, I think that we don't get to set the policy. We hopefully get to influence a little bit, and we try and work through it. But the company spends a fair amount of effort trying to keep people on a path that will serve the health of our citizens as best it can.
Ryan Crowe: Okay. Thank you, and thanks to everyone who dialed in today for your interest in Regeneron. We apologize to those remaining in the Q&A queue, who we did not have a chance to hear from today. As always, the Investor Relations team is available to answer any remaining questions you may have. Thank you once again, and have a great day.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-04 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Tawanda, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Ryan Crowe, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.
Ryan Crowe: Thank you, Tawanda, Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening to everyone listening around the world. Thank you for your interest in Regeneron, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2024 earnings conference call.

Once our call concludes, Chris and the IR team will be available to answer any further questions. With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Leonard Schleifer. Len?
Leonard Schleifer: Thank you, Ryan, and thank you everyone for joining today's call. Regeneron capped 2024 with a strong fourth quarter, highlighted by 10% revenue growth, reflecting the strength and durability of our key franchises, primarily, Dupixent, Libtayo, and EYLEA and EYLEA HD. 2024 was also a year in which we made significant investments across our broad pipeline, which yielded notable progress across several key programs. For my remarks today, I will review some of our key performance drivers, then briefly discuss a few of our more differentiated pipeline opportunities and close with a few comments on capital allocation. After my remarks, George will provide further updates on our pipeline; Marion will then review our commercial performance; and finally, Chris will detail our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2024 and our guidance for the current year. To start, I would like to share my perspective on the current state of Regeneron. From the beginning, our focus has been on science and innovation, developing cutting-edge technology platforms that repeatedly yield scientific breakthroughs. These efforts have led to 13 products that have been approved or authorized worldwide, several of which are driving revenue growth and hold significant future potential. Our approach has already delivered five blockbuster drugs, a leading pipeline of approximately 40 product candidates across various therapeutic areas, and a world class DNA sequence linked healthcare database, providing us with unparalleled insights into key drivers of disease. At the JPMorgan Conference last month, we detailed 10 differentiated mid and late pipeline opportunities that could collectively address a total market opportunity of over $220 billion. Given these opportunities, the strength of our early stage pipeline and our turnkey technology platforms, we have never been more confident in Regeneron's future and we are incredibly excited about what lies ahead. Moving to our quarterly results. Dupixent continues to be a transformative medicine with over 1 million patients on treatment around the world across seven approved indications. In the U.S., Dupixent remains the leader in new to brand prescription share across all of its approved indications and continues to be well positioned for future growth, given the potential for further penetration in approved indications, the ongoing launch in COPD, and potential 2025 launches in chronic spontaneous urticaria and bullous pemphigoid. Regarding the ongoing launch in COPD, where Dupixent is the first and only biologic approved, we and our partner Sanofi have made great progress securing broad payer coverage and reimbursement, positioning us to drive uptake over the course of this year and beyond. EYLEA HD and EYLEA continued to lead the anti-VEGF category and our commercial efforts remain focused on driving EYLEA HD uptake, while preserving share for EYLEA in an increasingly competitive category. Over the course of this year, we expect continued competitive pressure on EYLEA, while strengthening the profile of EYLEA HD by offering it in a more convenient prefilled syringe administration, broadening its label to include macular edema following retinal vein occlusion or RVO and adding more dosing flexibility, including every four week dosing as well as extended dosing intervals of up to every 24 weeks for certain indications. With these anticipated label enhancements, EYLEA HD will offer the broadest set of retinal disease indications with the greatest dose and flexibility of any product in the anti-VEGF category, positioning it to become the new standard of care in the category, and we anticipate these enhancements will lead to an acceleration in EYLEA HD uptake starting in the second half of this year. Libtayo became Regeneron's latest blockbuster product in 2024, and we are looking to build on that by expanding shared metastatic non-melanoma skin cancers along with making further inroads in lung cancer. We also plan to seek regulatory approval for high risk adjuvant cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, a setting in which KEYTRUDA failed and over the longer-term could represent a blockbuster opportunity globally in and of itself. Moving to our pipeline and focusing on the upcoming year. We expect regulatory approvals for linvoseltamab in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, odronextamab in late-line follicular lymphoma, and the aforementioned Libtayo indication in adjuvant CSCC. In addition, we expect to read out pivotal or proof-of-concept data this year from several other programs, including our pivotal AERIFY studies for itepekimab, our IL-33 antibody, in former smokers with COPD. Pivotal data for the fianlimab-libtayo combination in first line metastatic melanoma are also anticipated in 2024. We also expect pivotal data for our C5 antibody siRNA combination in generalized myasthenia gravis. Finally, we expect to learn more about our potential opportunity to improve the quality of weight loss in obese patients on semaglutide by blocking myostatin and Activin A. George will soon discuss these programs in more detail and provide updates on many of the other programs in our broad and differentiated pipeline. Finally, regarding capital allocation, this morning, we were pleased to announce the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend program and an additional $3 billion share repurchase authorization, increasing our total current buyback capacity to approximately $4.5 billion. These decisions reflect our Board and management's ongoing commitment to returning capital to shareholders, but this does not change the core of our capital allocation framework. Importantly, our dividend will not impact the way we plan to heavily invest in our business and pipeline going forward, does not impair our ability to do business development in the future and we anticipate that share repurchases will remain the primary means of returning capital to shareholders. However, initiating a dividend reflects our continued confidence in the future cash flows from our business, provides more balance to our approach to capital returns, gives us flexibility in how we return capital in the future, and expands the pool of potential Regeneron shareholders to include funds with a dividend mandate. In closing, Regeneron remains in a very strong position scientifically, commercially, and financially, enabling us to invest heavily in R&D and deliver tremendous innovation from our pipeline, maximize the growth opportunities from our in-line brands, initiate a quarterly dividend, and significantly increase our capacity to repurchase shares. We look forward to keeping you updated in these innovations throughout 2025 and beyond. With that, I'll now turn the call over to George.
George Yancopoulos: Thank you, Len. At last month's JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, we showcased our robust R&D efforts and the promising opportunities within our pipeline that have the potential to revolutionize the practice of medicine across several different disease areas. This year holds the potential to be transformative for Regeneron, as we hope to capitalize on several of our scientific and technological breakthroughs. We anticipate reporting pivotal or proof-of-concept data from multiple programs across diverse therapeutic areas, including in oncology, COPD, and obesity, while also rapidly advancing our Factor XI antibodies to multiple Phase 3 trials. These programs represent significant opportunities for Regeneron to address substantial unmet needs across large commercial categories, positioning Regeneron for long-term growth. Let me highlight some of these opportunities and recent pipeline advancements. Starting with EYLEA HD, in December, we and Bayer reported positive data from the Phase 3 QUASAR study in retinal vein occlusion, where EYLEA HD demonstrated non-inferior vision gains within every eight-week dosing regimen compared to the standard-of-care 2 milligram EYLEA dosed every four weeks. Additionally, approximately 90% of EYLEA HD patients were able to maintain eight week dosing intervals throughout the 36 weeks. These data together with our recently presented long-term follow up data from the PULSAR and PHOTON studies in wAMD (ph) and DME, respectively, continue to support EYLEA HD's best-in-class clinical profile. We remain on track to submit a supplementary BLA for this indication later in the first quarter. We also plan to seek approval from the FDA to potentially include every four week dosing, maximizing EYLEA's HD dosing flexibility for physicians. Along with the submission for a prefilled syringe and the potential FDA approval in April to extend dosing intervals to up to 24 weeks, the longest intervals in the category, EYLEA HD is set to provide the greatest dosing flexibility across the broadest indication set of any anti-VEGF therapy, all in a convenient prefilled syringe. Next, immunology, and starting with Dupixent. In November, Dupixent was approved in Europe to treat eosinophilic esophagitis in children as young as one-year-old, making it the first and only medicine indicated for these young patients in the U.S. and the European Union and further highlighting Dupixent's exceptional safety profile. The supplementary BLA resubmission for chronic spontaneous urticaria was recently accepted by the FDA with a target action date of April 18, potentially making it the first new target therapy for CSU in a decade. Finally, a supplementary BLA was submitted for bullous pemphigoid late last year, marking another first, as Dupixent is the only biologic to achieve significant improvements in disease remission and symptoms for this indication. While Marion will discuss the ongoing launch of Dupixent in COPD, I want to remind you of another potentially significant opportunity in COPD with itepekimab, our interleukin-33 antibody discovered by Regeneron. We anticipate reporting pivotal results in former smokers from the AERIFY program in the second half of this year, a partially overlapping (ph) and distinct population from that treated with Dupixent. As part of our long-term commitment to improving the lives of patients with allergic conditions, I would also like to highlight the compelling initial data from our ongoing Dupixent plus linvoseltamab trial for severe food allergy. These two agents have the potential to eliminate immunoglobulin E or IgE, the key driver allergic reactions and prevent IgE from returning, thereby reversing severe allergies. Last month, we shared initial clinical data from the first patient in our proof-of-concept study, which showed greater than 90% reductions in both total and food specific IgE levels following initial treatments at low doses. This trial is continuing to enroll patients and we plan to provide updates throughout 2025. Turning now to oncology, where we continue to break new ground. Last month, we announced positive data for Libtayo in high risk adjuvant CSCC, becoming the first immunotherapy to show a benefit in this high risk population. At the first pre-specified interim analysis for disease free survival, adjuvant Libtayo demonstrated a 68% reduction in the risk of disease recurrence or death compared to placebo with no new safety signals identified. This is the same setting in which Merck reported last year that KEYTRUDA had failed, highlighting that antibodies even within the same class do not always produce the same treatment effect. We plan to submit these data to the FDA in the first half of 2025 and present these results at a medical meeting later this year. This dataset reinforces our belief that Libtayo provides a best-in-class foundation for combinations with our other oncology assets. Data from early clinical trials in melanoma suggests that fianlimab, our LAG-3 antibody when combined with Libtayo, might be the first combination to demonstrate meaningful additive benefit compared to PD-1 monotherapy without exacerbating safety. This combination is being studied in an ongoing randomized Phase 3 trial versus KEYTRUDA monotherapy in first line metastatic melanoma with results expected in the second half of this year. If these data confirm best-in-class activity in melanoma, it will increase our confidence for this combination in other cancer settings. Turning to our CD3 bispecifics. We are pleased to announce that we have recently resubmitted the BLA for Linvoseltamab, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma following the resolution of third-party manufacturing issues. Linvoseltamab has the potential to be the best-in-class BCMAxCD3 bispecific, due to its differentiated clinical profile, dosing and administration with nearly double the reported complete response rates at similar duration of follow-up. Given the strength of the data in late lines of therapy, including the observed level of efficacy and favorable safety profile of Linvoseltamab, we are pursuing a differentiated approach in earlier lines of therapy, emphasizing monotherapy and novel limited combination approaches. For odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific, we are pleased to announce that we have resubmitted the BLA for relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma, where odronextamab has also demonstrated potentially best-in-class efficacy and we expect an FDA decision in the second half of 2025. In December, at the American Society of Hematology Meeting, we presented initial results from the safety lead in portion of the confirmatory Phase 3 OLYMPIA trial. Odronextamab monotherapy delivered complete responses in all 12 patients evaluable for efficacy with previously untreated follicular lymphoma. As a reminder, the standard-of-care regimen in this setting, rituximab plus chemotherapy has historically achieved complete responses in approximately 67% of patients. Based on this impressive monotherapy efficacy for odronextamab in both late line and first line patients, we are once again exploring a differentiated program in early lines of therapy, highlighted by our head-to-head evaluation of odronextamab monotherapy compared to rituximab plus chemotherapy in our Phase 3 OLYMPIA-1 trial, which has already achieved over 40% enrollment. Our CD28 co-stimulatory bispecifics for solid tumors are also progressing. We're working to mitigate safety concerns related to their combination with PD-1 blockade while prioritizing combination with CD3 bispecifics. The science suggests that this approach may enhance efficacy with fewer immune mediated adverse events. We will provide updates on these innovative combinations later this year. Moving now to a rapidly advancing Factor XI program. We're employing a two pronged approach to anticoagulation that offers the potential for improved blood clot prevention and lower bleeding risk. Supported by genetic data from the Regeneron Genetic Center, our approach has delivered two antibodies with unique profile to meet different market needs. REGN7508 (ph), which targets the catalytic domain of Factor XI may provide improved efficacy compared to standard-of-care options, offering patients who need significant anti-coagulation activity, a potentially more effective option. On the other hand, REGN9933, which targets the A2 domain is expected to carry a lower risk of bleeding, potentially making it a viable option for patients with the highest bleeding risk who would otherwise not be candidates for currently available anticoagulants. Late this year, we reported positive proof-of-concept data for the prevention of venous thromboembolism following total knee replacement with both antibodies demonstrating robust anti-thrombotic effects. REGN7508 was superior to enoxaparin and non-inferior to apixaban, while REGN9933 was numerically better than enoxaparin. These data support the advancement of both antibodies into broad pivotal programs across multiple indications and patient types with initial Phase 3 studies expected to begin enrolling this year. Moving briefly to obesity, where we are progressing early clinical programs and an expansive pipeline of preclinical assets. Our muscle-sparing Phase 2 COURAGE study is investigating the addition of trevogrumab to semaglutide with and without garetosmab to improve the quality of weight loss and evaluate the maintenance of weight loss after discontinuing semaglutide. This trial is fully enrolled with data expected in the second half of the year. Moving to our Regeneron genetics medicine pipeline. Starting with our differentiated siRNA plus antibody approach, we have the potential to address multiple complement mediated diseases. In December, at the ASH Annual Meeting, we presented compelling updated results from an exploratory cohort in our Phase 3 program for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. Our combination achieved greater disease control compared to the current standard-of-care (ph) ravulizumab and only our combination lowered mean LDH levels to the normal range. When ravulizumab patients were switched to our combination, their mean LDH levels, which remained higher than normal also became normalized. We are also evaluating this combination in generalized myasthenia gravis with pivotal results expected in the second half of this year. In addition, we recently initiated our Phase 3 program exploring this combination in geographic atrophy in dry age related macular degeneration, where we believe our systemic approach has several advantages over currently approved intravitreal agents. For DB-OTO, our otoferlin gene therapy program for genetic hearing loss, we announced data last month from the ongoing clinical program. DB-OTO is an AAV-based dual vector gene therapy delivered to the inner ear to enable hearing in children suffering from profound genetic hearing deficit. We reported that 10 out of 11 treated children with at least one post-treatment assessment showed a notable increase in hearing with some reaching the normal range. We look forward to continuing to share additional data later this year. Regarding our collaboration with Alnylam, we are advancing several new siRNA CNS programs, including synuclein for Parkinson's and TAU for Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases with trials initiating later this year. And finally, I would like to highlight two recent advances that extend our leadership position in the field of structured big data that will be necessary to allow computational approaches to revolutionize the healthcare industry. Over the past decade, we have become the leader in high throughput human DNA sequencing, enabling us to create the world's largest DNA sequence linked healthcare database encompassing nearly 3 million individuals, all with DNA sequence linked to de-identified healthcare records. We are now emerging also as the leaders in high throughput proteomics as reflected by the selection of the Regeneron Genetics Center to generate the proteomics data for the UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics project, building on our previous selection to provide the sequence data for the UK Biobank. Importantly, our new strategic collaboration with Truveta is expected to dramatically expand our database to include up to an additional 10 million individuals from Truveta's network of leading U.S. Health System, with the opportunity to generate both DNA sequence and proteomics information. While our leadership position in this big data space has already proven invaluable for our drug discovery and development efforts, we believe it can ultimately help us contribute to revolutionizing the field of healthcare analytics and management. In summary, I have never been more excited about the future of Regeneron and our potential to transform the practice of medicine and revolutionize the healthcare industry. Our pipeline is more innovative and exciting than ever, and we anticipate several pivotal or proof-of-concept data readouts throughout 2025, positioning Regeneron for long-term success. Let me now turn the call over to Marion.
Marion McCourt: Thank you, George. Regeneron's fourth quarter performance demonstrates our ongoing leadership across therapeutic categories. Our commercial team is well positioned to optimize our 2025 growth opportunities, driven by new indications, new product enhancements, and new product approvals. Turning to fourth quarter results, starting with EYLEA HD and EYLEA. In January, we announced combined fourth quarter U.S.net sales of $1.5 billion for EYLEA HD and EYLEA, capturing over 46% of the total anti-VEGF category. For the full year, net product sales grew by 1.4% to approximately $6 billion despite increasing competition in the category. EYLEA HD net sales were $305 million in the fourth quarter and $1.2 billion for the full year, representing 20% of the combined net sales for EYLEA HD and EYLEA. Fourth quarter net sales for EYLEA HD were affected by elevated wholesaler inventory levels at the end of Q3, which were absorbed over the course of the fourth quarter. In 2025, our team is laser focused on growing EYLEA HD adoption. Physicians tell us that EYLEA HD has the potential to be the new standard-of-care for retinal diseases and several catalysts occurring this year will put us in a position to grow our competitive share. The team is ready to launch the prefilled syringe and our two year label updates, both of which are anticipated to occur in the second quarter. Physicians eagerly await the prefilled syringe, which has been described as game changing by clinical trial participants. Further, our two year long-term follow-up data from the PULSAR and PHOTON studies in wAMD and DME, respectively, clearly illustrate EYLEA HD's ability to extend dosing beyond any other competitor in the anti-VEGF category. Two other potential FDA approvals are also expected later this year, the RVO indication and additional dosing flexibility. In RVO clinical trials, EYLEA HD dosing could be extended to every 12 weeks following loading doses, making it the only medicine with durability beyond four weeks and also the only medicine to show a numeric improvement in vision for RVO patients compared to EYLEA dosed every four weeks. In terms of additional dosing flexibility across all of our approved indications, we look forward to the potential FDA approval of every four week dosing for the subset of patients who need it, which would mean EYLEA HD has the most flexible dosing schedule of any anti-VEGF medicine. Fourth quarter EYLEA net sales were $1.2 billion, primarily driven by persistent physician demand in spite of a recent aflibercept 2 milligram biosimilar launch. Wholesale inventory levels were elevated at the end of the fourth quarter, and we expect EYLEA net sales will be negatively impacted in the first quarter of 2025 as this increase in inventory is absorbed. We also expect ongoing market dynamics will put downward pressure on EYLEA business. We continue supporting existing and new patients who benefit from EYLEA while prioritizing uptake of EYLEA HD, which has the clinical profile to potentially become the new standard-of-care in the anti-VEGF category. Turning now to Libtayo, which achieved blockbuster status in 2024 with global net sales of $1.2 billion. In the fourth quarter, global net sales grew by 50% year-over-year to $367 million with U.S. net sales reaching $251 million. Libtayo's strong performance was based on growth in non-melanoma skin cancers and steady gains in lung cancer. Looking forward, we eagerly await the submission and potential approval of Libtayo in high risk adjuvant CSCC beginning in the U.S. where we estimate there are approximately 10,000 patients who may benefit from treatment. And next to Dupixent, which continues to deliver exceptional results in Type 2 inflammatory diseases, approved in seven indications worldwide, more than 1 million patients are currently benefiting from Dupixent treatment. Three of these indications, atopic dermatitis, asthma, and nasal polyps have achieved blockbuster status, each generating over $1 billion in annual net sales. In the fourth quarter, Dupixent worldwide net sales grew 15% year-over-year to $3.7 billion with increasing volume across all indications, age groups, and geographies. In the U.S., net sales grew 10% year-over-year to $2.7 billion, driven by a 24% increase in total prescriptions, including the recent COPD launch. As Sanofi noted, fourth quarter results were negatively impacted by one-time items. We continue to see broad growth across all blockbuster indications of atopic dermatitis, asthma, and nasal polyps. Despite new entrants in atopic dermatitis, Dupixent continues to be first choice for physicians who now understand that IL-4 and IL-13 are crucial drivers of Type 2 inflammation. Additionally, there is robust uptake in our recent U.S. launches for eosinophilic esophagitis, prurigo nodularis with current trends suggesting that these indications will likely also achieve blockbuster status. We are off to a promising start in COPD following approvals in more than 30 countries. In the U.S., the FDA approved Dupixent in September of last year, and we are very encouraged by our progress in early market adoption. Together with our partner, Sanofi, we've made significant strides in securing U.S. access and reimbursement for commercial and Medicare patients. At the start of this year, nearly 85% of commercial patients and nearly 90% of Medicare patients have coverage. Additionally, we are pleased that global gold treatment guidelines for COPD now include Dupixent as the only recommended biologic medicine for these patients. We look forward to accelerating the launch of this important indication and to make a significant difference in the lives of hundreds of thousands of COPD patients worldwide. Our teams are also preparing for a potential April launch in chronic spontaneous urticaria pending FDA approval. We believe Dupixent offers a compelling treatment option and if approved, would be the first new targeted therapy in the U.S. in over a decade for the estimated 300,000 CSU patients. In conclusion, we continue to deliver solid performance across our commercial portfolio in the fourth quarter. We also see significant growth opportunities in 2025 and beyond with near and medium term catalysts to drive growth. With that, I'll turn the call to Chris.
Chris Fenimore: Thank you, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Regeneron ended 2024 with strong financial performance in the fourth quarter, delivering growth on both the top and bottom line. Total revenues grew 10% year-over-year to $3.8 billion, primarily reflecting higher Sanofi collaboration revenue driven by Dupixent growth, strong global net sales growth for Libtayo, and modest growth for combined net sales of EYLEA HD and EYLEA in the U.S. Fourth quarter diluted net income per share was $12.07, a net income of $1.4 billion, up 2% from the prior year. On a full year basis, total revenues were $14.2 billion, representing growth of 10% when excluding revenues from Ronapreve. 2024 earnings per share grew 4% from the prior year to $45.62. Turning to collaboration revenue in the fourth quarter. Revenues from the Sanofi collaboration were $1.2 billion, of which $1 billion related to our share of collaboration profits. Regeneron's share of profits grew 18% versus the prior year, driven by volume growth through Dupixent and higher collaboration margins. For the year, our share of profit, net of development balance reimbursement increased to the highest level since initiation of the collaboration, reaching approximately 20% of total antibody net sales. The Sanofi development balance was approximately $1.6 billion at the end of 2024, reflecting a reduction of approximately $175 million from the end of the third quarter, and approximately $700 million from the end of 2023. We continue to expect this balance to be fully reimbursed by the end of 2026, which is expected to result in a significant increase in Sanofi collaboration revenue and cash flow thereafter. Moving to Bayer. Fourth quarter ex-U.S. net sales of EYLEA and EYLEA 8 mg were $888 million, up 2% on a constant currency basis versus the prior year. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $377 million, of which $349 million related to our share of net profits outside the U.S. Now to our operating expenses. R&D expense was $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter. The increase in R&D expense versus the prior year was driven by cost to support advancement of Regeneron's broad clinical pipeline, including our C5 and Factor XI programs in hematology, certain oncology programs, itepekimab in COPD, and our ongoing program in obesity. Fourth quarter SG&A was $681 million with growth from the prior year, primarily reflecting investments to support the launch of EYLEA HD and our international expansion. Fourth quarter 2024 gross margin and net product sales was 86%, up slightly from the prior year quarter. Now to cash flow and the balance sheet. Regeneron generated approximately $3.7 billion in free cash flow in 2024 and ended the year with cash and marketable securities less debt of approximately $15.2 billion. In 2024, we deployed $2.6 billion towards share repurchases, including a meaningful step-up in the fourth quarter during which we repurchased nearly $1 billion of our shares. Consistent with our capital allocation framework, we are investing heavily in our R&D capabilities to drive long-term growth, exploring business development opportunities and returning capital to shareholders. This morning, we announced an additional share repurchase authorization of $3 billion, increasing our capacity for repurchases to approximately $4.5 billion as of today. In addition, we are enhancing our approach to returning capital to shareholders. As announced this morning, our Board of Directors has authorized the initiation of a quarterly dividend with the first dividend payable on March 20 to shareholders of record as of February 20. The dividend will be $0.88 per share, equivalent to $3.52 per share on an annual basis. We are confident in the long-term growth of our business, our innovative R&D engine, our differentiated pipeline, and the durability of our cash flows, all of which support the initiation of our first quarterly dividend and the announcement of an additional share repurchase authorization. I'll conclude with a review of our 2025 financial guidance. We expect 2025 R&D spend to be in the range of $5 billion to $5.2 billion. The increase versus 2024 is driven by cost to support our expanding late stage pipeline, including Phase 3 programs for our Factor XI antibodies and Heme-onc bispecifics as well as programs in obesity and genetic medicines and the advancement of multiple new assets into the clinic. We expect 2025 SG&A to be in the range of $2.55 billion to $2.7 billion, representing 3% growth at the midpoint of this range versus 2024, driven by investments to support multiple potential oncology launches. We expect our gross margin on net product sales to be in the range of 87% to 88%. This guidance reflects a changing product mix as well as ongoing start-up costs for our new fill/finish facility and investments to drive future efficiencies across our manufacturing network. We expect cost of collaboration manufacturing to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.15 billion in 2025, primarily driven by higher Dupixent volumes. Recall that we are reimbursed for these costs as revenue, making them generally neutral to net income. We expect 2025 capital expenditures to be in the range of $850 million to $975 million, primarily related to ongoing expansion of the R&D facilities at our Tarrytown headquarters and investments to increase both manufacturing capacity in the U.S. and Ireland to support our expanding pipeline. Finally, we expect our 2025 effective tax rate to be in the range of 11% to 13%. In summary, Regeneron delivered solid financial results in 2024 and our strong financial position and prudent capital allocation enables Regeneron to deliver long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll pass the call back to Ryan.
Ryan Crowe: Thanks, Chris. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call for Q&A. To ensure, we are able to address as many questions as possible, we will answer only one question from each caller before moving to the next. Tawanda, can we go to the first question, please?
Operator: Thank you. Please standby for our first question. Our first question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams. Your line is open.
Brian Abrahams: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Consensus numbers suggest expectations for annual sales erosion of about 7% annually over the next few years for the EYLEA franchise. Just given what you've been seeing on the ground and some of the dynamics you described, including competitive pressure, but a potential acceleration in HD with some of those approvals. Do you think that these expectations look reasonable? And I know you guys don't typically provide guidance, but I just -- I think any directionality might be helpful here just to understand whether folks are looking at dynamics here the right way or if expectations may be way off? Thanks.
Marion McCourt: So, as you pointed out, we don't give guidance. I wanted to give you a summary today of how we see the market. And certainly, as it relates to EYLEA HD and the strengthening of the profile that we hope with additional FDA approvals this year related to delivery system with the prefilled syringe, indication with RVO, dosing flexibility, and then also the clinical data that further cements EYLEA HD as the product with the greatest durability. We believe that combination of factors for EYLEA HD and the fact that already in the year -- this past year in the market, EYLEA HD at $1.2 billion in net sales is a blockbuster product, we see that as a very compelling profile. But I did want to be very realistic and my comments indicated we do expect to see additional competitive pressure on EYLEA. Obviously, there is a biosimilar in the market today. So, that is a factor that needs to be considered as well. But overall, we certainly believe we have a very strong position. I also noted today that our category share in the fourth quarter was at 46%. So obviously, we have a very strong position in the marketplace.
Ryan Crowe: Thank you. Next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Van Buren with TD Cowen. Your line is open.
Tyler Van Buren: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thank you very much for taking the question. So the dividend initiation is an exciting disclosure and earlier than some might have expected. So I'm curious, why you guys decided to institute the dividend now as opposed to when the Sanofi development balance is paid off by the end of next year and whether you plan to increase it from these levels over time?
Chris Fenimore: Thanks, Tyler. Thanks for the question. So obviously, we publicly were talking about initiating it at the end of the repayment of the Sanofi development balance. I think for a variety of reasons, we have a lot of confidence as we reiterated on the call today that would be paid down. It's also obviously a differentiation in our capital allocation strategy to sort of migrate a little bit away from share buybacks, although, as Len indicated in his remarks, that will be the primary purpose of returning capital to our shareholders, but allowing us a little more flexibility of starting the dividend. And it also opens up a larger base of shareholders. So there are a lot of funds out there that have a dividend mandate and this will give them the opportunity to invest in Regeneron that they wouldn't have otherwise in the past been able to do.
Ryan Crowe: Thanks, Chris. Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with Evercore.
Cory Kasimov: Hey. Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask on the adjuvant CSCC Libtayo readout that you toplined in January. How critical is it that the product also hits an overall survival in addition to the DFS you top lined, and can you kind of comment as to how you see this the opportunity here from a commercial perspective relative to the indications you already have? Thank you.
George Yancopoulos: Well, because these patients are relatively earlier stages of their disease, they tend to have long survival times from their initial surgeries and so forth. So there are very few survival events. That said, of course, the FDA will be looking at the data to make sure that at least numerically things are not going in surprising or wrong directions. But we have confidence that the package is going to look pretty attractive.
Marion McCourt: And then just adding on the commercial perspective, as I noted, we obviously have a very capable and talented oncology Libtayo team in the U.S. and in key international markets. But for the U.S., we estimate there to be about 10,000 patients, who may benefit from the adjuvant CSCC indication.
Ryan Crowe: Thanks, George and Marion. Next question please, Tawanda.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs.
Salveen Richter: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Could you just speak to the magnitude of inventory impact on EYLEA HD that played out last quarter and also the dynamics that are happening in the marketplace with Pavblu, the biosimilar?
Marion McCourt: So Salveen, as we had noted last quarter, there had been a build in EYLEA HD inventory and that obviously impacted fourth quarter for EYLE HD burning off that inventory. As to the specific numbers, the range of impact in total would have been in the range of, if we looked at the combined EYLEA HD and EYLEA net product sales for the fourth quarter, the favorable impact was predominantly to EYLEA and that was about $85 million. And that was the result of higher wholesale inventory levels for EYLEA, partially offset by lower wholesale inventory levels for EYLEA HD.
Ryan Crowe: Did you want to comment on the Pavblu impact?
George Yancopoulos: Well, it's really difficult to comment on Pavblu. I will know one thing that very recently, we had some victories at the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, which thus far is leading to the conclusion that there is only one competitor of a biosimilar. If that holds, that really changes the dynamic quite a bit in terms of pricing and things like that. So, having one competitor is quite different than having multiple competitors. So, I encourage you to look at some of the recent wins we had at the federal circuit on the injunctions against other players. In terms of what's actually going in the market, I think maybe you'll be on Amgen's call this afternoon, maybe they can give you a more direct answer.
Ryan Crowe: Thank you. Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.
Taylor Hanley: Hi. This is Taylor Hanley on for Chris Schott. I just had a question on how you're thinking about operating expenses going forward. So with numerous programs advancing to late stage development, how are you thinking about balancing investments across the pipeline? And do you think that there would be the potential to partner any of these programs or should we think about Regeneron keeping everything in-house going forward?
Leonard Schleifer: So I think it's important to note that our primary allocation of our capital is to our research and development efforts. We're in the midst of doing a little interesting exercise that if you compare our investment to other companies and you take into account equity investments and other upfronts and milestones that are essentially buying research and development, I think the data is going to show that we have an incredibly productive dollar-to-dollar pound-for-pound R&D capabilities in the industry. In terms of whether or not we would partner, I think we have always been -- that is a financial partner, perhaps or even a strategic partner on some program, we've always kept an open mind to see what is the best for the program, and how can we best allocate our resources. So we don't manage the business in any fixed allocation way. We don't say, we're going to spend X percent. We look at what's worth spending our money on. We look at what the potential ways to fund our programs are, and we try and make decisions that way rather than having some allocation quotas or the like, that flexibility, I think, has served us well and it will continue to serve us well given that we have more than 40 programs in the clinic and many, many more heading towards the clinic.
Ryan Crowe: Okay. Thank you. Next question, please, Tawanda.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Raymond with Piper Sandler.
Sam Godshall: Hey. This is Sam on for Chris. Thanks for taking our question. On EYLEA, we noticed you had a modest price increase, which is the first time we've seen that for EYLEA. Meanwhile, we've seen Roche have more regular price increases for Vabysmo since they launched. Any comments on your pricing strategy for EYLEA going forward? Is the goal to stabilize average sale price over time? Thank you.
Leonard Schleifer: No comment.
Marion McCourt: Okay. I was going to say no comment. I'll add, you mentioned a price increase for EYLEA, there is also a modest price increase for EYLEA HD.
Sam Godshall: Okay.
Ryan Crowe: Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo.
Mohit Bansal: Hey. Thank you very much for taking my question. Maybe, Marion, just wanted to get a little bit more color on how you are thinking about the cadence of EYLEA HD of the year -- for the year because it seems like you're saying that you expect incremental conversion when prefilled syringe and label expansion comes in. Could you help us understand, I mean, is it like -- is it going to be more incremental or do you think there is an inflection, especially, due to prefilled syringe given the market acceptability of that formulation? Thank you.
Marion McCourt: Mohit, I don't have additional comment at this time. I wanted to give the overall balance that we see, obviously opportunity for EYLEA HD to continue to grow. As you know, the market is probably about 10% naive patients, 90% switch patients going over to EYLEA HD and among those patients that are switching, the source of business is often coming from EYLEA, second, aflibercept, and third, Avastin. But as to the overall market dynamics, I don't have additional comments.
Leonard Schleifer: Yeah. I mean, I would encourage you obviously to look beyond the hyperfocus on EYLEA. We have Dupixent launching away in COPD. We have pivotal data coming up with itepekimab in COPD. We have first-line melanoma -- metastatic melanoma data coming up second part of this year. We've got data in myasthenia gravis coming up. We're starting a trial in geographic atrophy and that could go on and on and on. And I would encourage you to work through those because our strategy is not to be solely dependent on any one thing yet still optimize every single thing. So we will do everything we can to optimize each of our programs, HD, and so forth, but we don't want to become dependent on any one thing, which is why we're so excited about the pipeline. So I would say it's the pipeline. Next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim Anderson with Bank of America.
Alice Nettleton: Hi. This is Alice Nettleton on for Tim Anderson. Thanks for taking our question. Sorry, another one on EYLEA…
Leonard Schleifer: Why don't we come back -- Why don't we come back to that question at the end, so we can get some non-EYLEA questions in? We'll put you at the end of the queue and we'll come back to you. Next question, please.
Alice Nettleton: Sure.
Operator: One moment. Our next question comes from the line of Akash Tewari with Jefferies.
Akash Tewari: I'm not going to ask an EYLEA question. George, I'd love your take on Factor XI. We've seen both [indiscernible] seen in some of the private mab player show issues in preventing ischemic stroke events, with the mab also showing an inverse dose response on bleed prevention. That said, Regeneron is the only company that's shown an incremental benefit in a total knee replacement study versus Eliquis, so can you talk about your confidence on 7508 (ph) and some of the recent data sets in this space?
George Yancopoulos: Yeah. Our strategy from the beginning was take advantage of our understanding from the genetics to design and select two antibodies that have very complementary, but different profiles can address different patients and allow physicians and patients to choose the best antibody for their needs. So our antibody that -- the 7508 that you mentioned that hits the catalytic domain in side-by-side comparisons is biochemically the strongest blocker and has the strongest anti-coagulant activity of anything in this class, and that would be designed for the patients who need the most anti-coagulant control. And as you said, it performed very impressively in the initial proof-of-concept studies with regard to that functionality. The 9933, which affects the A2 domain is designed to be slightly gentler and the genetics suggests it may have very little, if any bleeding risk, but perhaps a little bit less anti-coagulation activity. So that's designed to give alternatives or options for the patients and the physicians who are most concerned in that setting about bleeding risk. So we think this is a very powerful optionality and flexibility to be able to offer both physicians and patients who struggle between solving the dilemma about how do I control anticoagulation without causing bleeding and all of those concerns that go with that, and this way, we'll have data and we'll have comparative data in multiple settings to allow the physician and the patient to hopefully choose the best approach for their situation. And we think that certainly the patients, the settings are really crying out for this sort of optionality and flexibility. This is why so many patients in so many indications, not only in atrial fibrillation but across the entire spectrum of diseases in which thrombi and clots are a problem are left untreated or not maximally treated. So we're hoping to address that huge unmet need by evaluating and getting data on these two genetically validated approaches.
Ryan Crowe: Thanks, George. Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of William Pickering with Bernstein.
William Pickering: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. It's about your complement programs. So it seems like your antibody siRNA combo has potential to deliver really leading efficacy, but on safety, you've seen some Grade 5 AEs so far. Can you discuss how you see these combos fitting into the MG and GA treatment landscapes? And for GA specifically, anything about the design of the Phase 3 trial that would kind of minimize some of those safety events that you've seen so far? Thank you.
George Yancopoulos: Yeah. So first of all, the safety events are consistent with what's been seen with the class in general. Right now, we don't really have evidence to suggest that it's different than the other approaches vis-a-vis safety. In terms of efficacy, it's an incremental benefit that is able to drive many more of the patients into the normal range. So the current drugs can achieve in some patients as deep a complement inhibition as we're seeing, but they don't do it for all the patients. We're doing it for a much higher percentage of patients. So, we're not really lowering complement to much lower levels. We're just driving more of the patients to the levels that are already being achieved. This is consistent with the safety profiles being analogous to what's already been seen with the class. But very importantly, it's the uncontrolled patients, which are causing the problems, whether it be in PNH or perhaps some of these other complement media diseases who are being sub-optimally treated, which we hope we now have a solution for. For those patients, roughly 30% of the populations even with the best standard-of-care who are left sub-optimally treated. That said, complement inhibition for an elderly or older AMD patient is certainly a concern with any approach. And as you said, we are doing a variety of things that are somewhat standard for the class to try to choose, first of all, enroll patients who are not as high-risk to make sure, for example, they're vaccinated against the organisms of risk and of course, monitoring them closely. But we have to balance that, of course, with the concerns and the safety events that have been happening with the intravitreal approaches. I mean, these are designed to slow down slowly progressing vision-threatening events, yet the safety events can cause catastrophic immediate vision loss in patients. So, that's a little bit of a dilemma. Do you take a prevention that can make you immediately blind to slow down your eventual blindness? We're hoping to offer another option for these patients that might not risk their vision, but as you said, we'll have to balance the safety infectious types of events, which as I said, are a class specific type of problem.
Ryan Crowe: Thanks, George. I think we have time for two more questions, Tawanda.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dave Risinger with Leerink Partners. Your line is open.
David Risinger: Yes. Thanks very much. So my question is, on obesity. George, could you please discuss the need to combine myostatin with an Activin blocker to treat obesity and optimize body composition? I ask because I'm curious about whether if the Activin doesn't have the right benefit-risk profile, whether you could develop a myostatin as a standalone or not? Thanks very much.
George Yancopoulos: Yeah. You pretty much summarize exactly our strategy based on our previous data in humans, including in sarcopenic individuals, the combination can grow more muscle. However, we do have some concerns with the Activin A blockade. The GDFA blockade now based on both genetics and what we've seen looks to be exceedingly safe in terms of all the early data. We don't have as much data with the Activin A, and so we're left with more concerns. So, we're testing the combination, but we can fall back on just single approaches, which might have a little bit less efficacy in terms of muscle preservation, but might be safer. So, that's why we're exploring these individually, but also together to understand the best benefit risk profile. I want to remind you that, for example, at Lilly, they're trying a receptor blocker that not only blocks these two growth factors, but more than a dozen other related growth factors. So, that may yield good efficacy, but the concerns there is not only you're blocking the myostatin the Activin A, but a dozen other factors as well and what are the potential side effects you'll see here? That's why we like our program that we can actually target the two most important factors as we've shown preclinically and clinically for muscle preservation, while also trying them individually. So that way we'll have, once again, the most flexibility as a lot of our programs are designed to dissect and separate individual agents in various processes to understand best the benefit risk profile, where you might trade efficacy for safety and vice versa.
Ryan Crowe: Thanks, George. I don't see Bank of America in the queue. So we'll just go to the next question in the queue as our final question.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley.
Unidentified Participant: Thank you. This is Chris on for Terence. Just a question on your LAG-3 plus PD-1 combo in the non-small cell lung cancer program. What is the efficacy bar on the duration of response or PFS that you need to see for you to advance that into a pivotal program? Thank you.
George Yancopoulos: Yeah. As we've seen from the small dataset with our friends at Bristol, in terms of their combination, those datasets are very small and they're hard to really make convincing conclusions on. That's why we are more focused on our melanoma data. If the melanoma data really delivers the sort of efficacy profile -- safety and efficacy profile that we've seen in our proof-of-concept studies when we read-out the Phase 3, I think that's going to generate enormous excitement both for the potential to really help first line melanoma patients, but also to extend this combination to a variety of other cancer settings, including potentially lung cancer. So, I think that the bigger dataset in the Phase 3 study is going to provide the most insight and the most potential confidence as opposed to the smaller Phase 2s and proof-of-concept studies, which obviously can generate excitement, but they're not really definitive as we've seen from our own data, but also from our friends at -- who have other related programs going on. So I really point to the pivotal melanoma data. If that really emerges as the new standard-of0care in melanoma, it's going to -- I think it's going to provide a lot of interest and excitement in other cancer settings as well.
Ryan Crowe: I see Bank of America is back in the queue, so we will take our final question from them as promised.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim Anderson with Bank of America.
Alice Nettleton: Hi. Thank you. This is Alice on for Tim. So back to my question on EYLEA. We talked to one big purchaser of EYLEA recently, who said that Regeneron essentially hasn't sweetened the contract terms on standard dose in an effort to compete with Amgen's product yet. So can we infer from this that you are likely to hold the ground on price and pricing concessions with the goal being that doctors will start using high-dose more once the label and product enhancements come through? Thank you.
Marion McCourt: Alice, thank you for your patience. We don't comment on pricing strategy, but I certainly will complement our very talented market access and pricing team, but no comment.
Ryan Crowe: With that, we will conclude the call. Thank you and thanks to everyone who dialed-in for today's call. We apologize to those remaining in the Q&A queue. We did not have enough time to hear from you, but we're always happy to follow-up. We're available to answer any remaining questions you may have. Thank you once again. Have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Once our call concludes, Chris and the IR team will be available to answer any further questions you may have. With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Leonard Schleifer. Len.
Leonard Schleifer : Thank you, Ryan, and thanks to everyone for joining today's call. Regeneron had a strong quarter, highlighted by 11% revenue growth and 8% non-GAAP earnings growth, along with continued investments and advances across our broad-pipeline. For my remarks today, I'd like to review some of our key performance drivers and then briefly discuss near-term pipeline opportunities. After my remarks, George will provide further updates on our pipeline. Marion will then review our commercial performance. And finally, Chris will detail our quarterly financial results. Third quarter, 2024 total revenues grew 11% to $3.72 billion, primarily driven by higher Sanofi collaboration revenues reflecting the continued strong performance of Dupixent, continued growth for Libtayo, and growth for combined EYLEA HD and EYLEA in the United States. Dupixent had another strong quarter with global revenues of 24% on a constant currency basis to $3.8 billion. With this latest quarterly result, global Dupixent revenues are annualizing at over $15 billion, with over 1 million patients currently on treatment around the world across seven approved indications in patients as young as six months. In September, the FDA and Chinese regulators both approved Dupixent for patients with uncontrolled COPD and an eosinophilic phenotype. These approvals, along with the approval in Europe in June, enabled Dupixent to address several hundred thousand patients that are currently uncontrolled on maximal inhaled triple therapy. As Marion will discuss, early launch indicators have been positive with strong physician interest and initial favorable US payer coverage decisions. As the only approved biologic for COPD, we anticipate these ongoing launches will represent a meaningful driver for depictions continued growth in 2025 and beyond. Net product sales for EYLEA HD and EYLEA combined were $1.54 billion, up 3% compared to the prior year. EYLEA HD generated $392 million in its fourth -- full quarter on the US Market. EYLEA HD and EYLEA maintained antiVEGF category leadership with combined share of approximately 44% compared to 45% in the second quarter of 2024. As Marion will discuss, we have focused on increasing EYLEA HD share, while preserving share for EYLEA in an increasingly competitive category, including a near-term biosimilar aflibercept 2-milligram launch and the recent launch of a branded pre-filled syringe. The EYLEA HD clinical profile continues to look differentiated relative to EYLEA and other antiVEGF products. As George will soon detail, results from the recently reported photon extension study in DME further underscore EYLEA HD's unprecedented durability while achieving vision gains and a safety profile typically seen with EYLEA. Moving to our pipeline, we're excited about several upcoming readouts later this year and in 2025 to further inform programs that could support significant long-term growth opportunities. By year-end, we expect to share interim Phase II lung cancer beta for the combination of fianlimab, our LAG-3 antibody plus Libtayo, as well as proof-of-contact data for our Factor XI antibodies in thrombosis, both of which will inform our Phase III plans. Looking ahead to 2025, We expect to read out the results of our pivotal AERIFY studies for itepekimab our IL-33 antibody in former smokers with COPD. We will also learn more about potential opportunity to improve the quality of weight loss in obese patients on semaglutide by blocking myostatin and/or Activin A. Pivotal data for the fianlimab-libtayo combination in first-line metastatic melanoma are also anticipated which could support regulatory filings in this setting. In addition, we expect to provide periodic updates on our novel treatment approach for reversing severe food allergies, involving linvoseltamab, our BCMA by CD3 bispecific and Dupixent. In closing, our pipeline continues to generate innovative and differentiated opportunities and now had approximately 40 programs in clinical development spanning many distinct therapeutic areas. We view our pipeline as the key to driving medium and long-term shareholder value and our antibody platform technologies and the Regeneron Genetics centered database of over 2.5 million sequenced exomes linked to the de-identified health records is expected to provide an enduring competitive advantage that we will continue to invest in. With that, I'll now turn the call over to George.
George Yancopoulos: Thanks, Leonard. I'll start with EYLEA HD and the data from the Photon extension study in diabetic macular edema, that were recently presented at the American Academy of Ophthalmology Annual Meeting. In addition to demonstrating that the vision gains and anatomic achievements or improvements with EYLEA HD over two years could be sustained over a third year of treatment at EYLEA HD, the results of the extension study provided the first data for patients who switched from EYLEA to EYLEA HD. For these switch patients who were dosed for 88 weeks with EYLEA every eight-weeks following five initial loading doses, retinal fluid re-accumulation was substantially slower after a single EYLEA HD injection at week 96, as compared to these patients' previous rate of fluid accumulation with our EYLEA 2 milligram. In addition, after one year of EYLEA HD treatment, 83% of these switch patients had a last assigned dosing interval of at least 12 weeks. Importantly, mean visual and anatomic achievement improvements achieved with EYLEA were sustained following the switch to longer dosing intervals with EYLEA HD. For Photon, patients assigned to EYLEA HD treatment groups at baseline, visual gains and anatomic improvements achieved in the first two years were all sustained in three years, but many of these patients were able to meaningfully extend the dosing interval. At the end of three years of treatment, nearly half were signed the final dosing interval of at least 20 weeks. In summary, EYLEA HD achieved consistently longer dosing intervals, as well as notably slower fluid re-accumulation as compared to EYLEA, a first for the category. When all other antiVEGF agents were compared to EYLEA and head-to-head studies, these agents did not demonstrate slow fluid re-accumulation. The safety profile of EYLEA HD has continued to be similar to EYLEA through three years and remain generally consistent with known safety profile of EYLEA HD in its pivotal trials. Altogether, these data support our belief that our EYLEA HD has a best-in-class profile. Now moving to Dupixent, which achieved several first and only clinical and regulatory milestones since our second quarter earnings call in early August. First, we are pleased to receive US regulatory approval for Dupixent as an add-on maintenance treatment of adult patients with inadequately controlled COPD and the eosinophilic phenotype marking the first ever biologic approved to treat this disease and represent to [Dupixent 6] (ph) indications approved in the United States. Also in COPD, as Len mentioned, we're looking forward to pivotal results in the second half of next year for Itepekimab, our interleukin-33 antibody. If approved in the United States, EU and Japan, Itepekimab could address approximately 1 million former smokers with COPD regardless of eosinophilic phenotypes. In terms of potential future indications for Dupixent, the Phase III ADEPT trial in moderate to severe bullous pemphigoid patients met the primary and all key secondary endpoints. Five time more Dupixent patients achieved sustained disease remission at 36 weeks compared to those on placebo. Dupixent patients were far less likely than patients on placebo to relapse following steroid taper or need rescue therapy during the treatment period. Based on these data, Dupixent is the first and only biologic to achieve significant improvements in disease remission and symptoms in bullous pemphigoid, and is the first medicine to show significant steroid sparing in this disease. We anticipate this Phase III ADEPT trial will support regulatory approvals around the world with the US supplementary BLA submission expected by the end of the year. We also announced results of a second Phase III study of Dupixent in biologic-naive patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria, or CSU, confirming the results of a prior Phase III study in the same population. In this most recent study, treatment with Dupixent met the primary endpoint and in addition, resulted in a nearly 50% reduction in itch and urticaria activity scores from Baseline. With 30% of Dupixent treated patients reporting a complete response or no urticaria by week 24 compared to only 18% of those on placebo. These data, along with the data generated in the first CSU study evaluating biologically naive patients supported our supplementary BLA resubmission earlier this month, and we look forward to a potential FDA approval early next year which would mark the first targeted therapy for CSU in a decade. Moving to oncology, starting with Libtayo, which provides a best-in-class foundation for combinations with our other oncology assets. At the World Conference on Lung Cancer, we announced five-year results from the final prespecified overall survival analysis of the Phase III EMPOWER Lung 1 trial, which evaluated the entire monotherapy as a first-line treatment for adults with advanced non-small cell lung cancer with more than 50% PD-L1 expression. The late-breaking data showed that at five years, Libtayo monotherapy nearly doubled median overall survival and reduced the risk of death by 41% compared to chemotherapy. There were also no new safety signals observed their five years among those patients. These 5-year outcomes data in advanced non-small cell lung cancer compare favorably cross trial to other PD-1 or PD-L1 antibodies and further support Libtayo's position as the anti-PD-1 backbone for Regeneron's ongoing oncology efforts. Moving on to one such Libtayo combination. At the recent ESMO meeting, we presented updated results of the [fianlimab] (ph), or LAG-3 antibody in combination with Libtayo in adults with advanced melanoma across three independent expansion cohorts of our first-in-human multi-cohort trial. With longer follow-up, these latest results showed persistent and deepening tumor responses across all cohorts. In post-hoc pooled analysis, 50% -- 57% of patients responded with 25% of these patients achieving a complete response. Median progression-free survival was 24 months. Median OS was not reaching any of the individual cohorts on when the results were pooled. These fianlimab-libtayo proof-of-concept data showed nearly double the complete response rate with more than 5 times greater median PFS than previously reported for anti-PD-1 monotherapies. The fianlimab-libtayo combination also showed robust clinical activity in subpopulations where there is currently no established standard-of-care, such as in patients previously treated with the anti-PD-1 therapy in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting. Of the 13 patients in this subgroup, six patients or 46% response to therapy. Among patients receiving any adjuvant or neoadjuvant systemic therapy 11 of 23 or 48% respond to the therapy, including six complete responses. The safety profile of the fianlimab-libtayo combination was generally consistent with the safety profile of the libtayo monotherapy and other anti-PD-1 agents, except for higher rates of treatment-related adrenal insufficiency. Ever since the exciting early data with individual checkpoint inhibitors were presented more than a decade ago, it's been widely hypothesized that combining multiple classes of checkpoint inhibitors might meaningfully enhance antitumor activity without exacerbating safety issues. [Yet] (ph) progress to-date has been broadly disappointed. We believe the results generated so far in advanced melanoma for fianlimab and Libtayo suggests it might be the first checkpoint inhibitor combination to demonstrate meaningful additive clinical benefit without significantly exacerbating safety. Our ongoing randomized Phase III trial of the fianlimab-libtayo versus Pembrolizumab monotherapy in preciously treated, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic melanoma is ongoing with pivotal data expected to readout next year. In addition to melanoma, we're exploring this combination in a variety of other cancer settings that have historically been responsive to anti-PD-1 therapy, including lung cancer, initial Phase II data for which are expected to read out under this year. Next, to our bispecifics for hematology-oncology. We are pleased that the European Commission approved Ordspono or odronextamab, or CD20xCD3 bispecific for relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, marking the first regulatory approval from our bispecific antibody platform. We continue to work on enrollment of our confirmatory studies to support resubmission of our BLA for follicular lymphoma, which we now expect to achieve in the first half of 2025. linvoseltamab or BCMAxCD3 bispecific for myeloma, data from the ongoing linker MM1 study in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma continue to mature with responses continuing to do recall that 14 months of median follow-up among 117 patients, linvoseltamab continues to demonstrate a potentially best-in-class profile in terms of efficacy, safety, dosing as well as hospitalization burden with 71% of patients respond to therapy and 50% achieving a complete response or better. Perhaps the most differentiating about our clinical development program for both our odronextamab and linvoseltamab, in earlier line settings is our plan to evaluate each agent as monotherapy, as well as in limited combinations. While competing CD20 bispecifics are evaluating combinations with linvoseltamab and plus rituximab in first-line follicular lymphoma regardless of tumor burden, our Phase III OLYMPIA 1 study is evaluating odronextamab monotherapy compared to R-CHOP. Similarly, in first-line multiple myeloma, our ongoing Phase I/II LINKER MM4 study is available in linvoseltamab monotherapy. Furthermore, we are also conducting Phase II studies for [linvoseltamab monotherapy] (ph) in precursor conditions such as smoldering myeloma and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance or MGUS in an attempt to prevent progression to myeloma. Now to our non-oncology hematology pipeline, starting with our C5 program, which is the first combination of an antibody and siRNA that targets the same protein. We expect to present updated results for one potential indication Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria, later this year and expect to read out pivotal results and generalize Myasthenia Gravis in the second half of next year. We also initiated our Phase III program in geographic atrophy in dry age-related macro degeneration with initial patient screening now underway. We believe that our systemic approach has several significant advantages over currently approved agents. First, it may avoid the risk of rare but severe eye inflammation irreversible vision loss that has been observed with currently approved intravitreal treatments. And our systemic approach is the potential to offer convenient treatment of bilateral disease as well. Regarding our Factor XI antibodies, we remain on track to report top-line results by year-end of our proof-of-concept studies for our A2 domain targeting and our catalytic domain targeting antibodies in the setting of prevention of venous thromboembolism following knee replacement surgery. Results of these studies will inform whether to proceed to registration-enabling studies with one or both of these antibodies with the possibility that both antibodies will advance to Phase III, but in different thrombosis indications or in different patient populations. In summary, we continue to drive forward our innovative development pipeline and anticipate reading out several pivotal and proof-of-concept data sets in oncology, immunology, obesity hematology and genetic medicines over the next 12 to 18 months while our early research engine has never been more productive with multiple novel programs potentially advancing into the clinic over the same time frame. And with that, I will turn the call over to Marion.
Marion McCourt: Thank you, George. Our third quarter performance demonstrates Regeneron's ongoing leadership across therapeutic categories. We continue to advance the strength and diversity of our product portfolio. And as George described, our pipeline is advancing with several potential regulatory filings and approvals on the horizon, creating both near and longer-term opportunities. I'll begin with EYLEA HD and EYLEA. In the third quarter, combined US net sales were $1.54 billion, a 3% year-over-year increase. EYLEA HD and EYLEA net sales were favorably impacted by approximately $40 million, as a result of higher wholesaler inventory levels for EYLEA HD at the end of the third quarter partially offset by lower inventory levels for EYLEA. As a result, we expect fourth quarter EYLEA HD net sales to be negatively impacted as this increase in wholesaler inventory is absorbed. Together, EYLEA HD and EYLEA captured 44% of the total anti-VEGF category in the third quarter, demonstrating retina specialists experience and confidence in both brands. EYLEA HD net sales grew 29% sequentially in the quarter to $392 million, driven by ongoing adoption across treatment experienced and treatment-naive patients as treatment Experience grows, retina specialists reporting to EYLEA HD's durability, coupled with its efficacy and safety as important clinical differentiators. Recent late-breaking data presented at American Academy of Ophthalmology's annual meeting highlighted EYLEA HD's potential best-in-class profile. As George highlighted, diabetic macular edema patients who switched to EYLEA HD, consistently achieved longer dosing intervals and slower retinal fluid re-accumulation. While we anticipate the anti-VEGF category to continue to be highly competitive with both branded and biosimilar products in the marketplace, we plan to further strengthen the EYLEA HD product profile through the anticipated launch of our differentiated prefilled syringe by mid-2025 and a potential approval of the RVO indication, which is registration-enabling data are expected by the end of this year. In the first year since launch, positive physician and patient experience has propelled EYLEA HD to achieve billion-dollar brand status. With additional growth catalysts expected in 2025, our team is focused on helping even more patients benefit from EYLEA HD. Turning to Libtayo. We continue to make significant progress in the third quarter with global net sales increasing 24% year-over-year on a constant currency basis to $289 million, and the US net sales grew 35% to $195 million in non-melanoma skin cancer, our work to expand the immunotherapy market has resulted in an even greater number of Libtayo patients. And in lung cancer, we continue to gain market share. Outside the US, net sales were $94 million, which does not include $20 million in distributor purchases that shifted to the fourth quarter. We continue to see opportunities to increase Libtayo demand in 2025 with new launches in several markets. And finally, to Dupixent, which continues its remarkable growth trajectory. In addition to the positive data readouts and regulatory updates that George mentioned, we've reached an impressive milestone. Dupixent has now surpassed 1 million patients on therapy across 7 indications worldwide. In the quarter, Dupixent achieved global net sales of $3.8 billion, a 24% year-over-year increase on a constant currency basis, driven by uptake across all indications, age groups and geographies. In the US, net sales grew 19% year-over-year to $2.8 billion, and Dupixent continues to be the #1 prescribed biologic for new-to-brand patients in all of its approved indications. It's widely recognized by prescribers that Dupixent's differential dual mechanism of action targeting IL-4 and IL-13 addresses the underlying cause of these type 2 diseases. Demand is strong across the blockbuster indications of atopic dermatitis, asthma and nasal polyps, and there is opportunity for ongoing market penetration based on unmet patient need. Uptake is also increasing across our recent US launches, new-to-brand prescriptions for prurigo nodularis are up approximately 30% compared to the prior year and EOE new-to-brand prescriptions, including the pediatric indication, are up approximately 40%. In September, Dupixent's label was expanded to include patients as young as 12 years of age who have inadequately controlled chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, and we estimate approximately 9,000 additional US patients can now benefit from Dupixent. In recent months, Dupixent has been approved to treat COPD in more than 30 countries. We are excited about the opportunity to extend Dupixent's leadership in respiratory KR, which we estimate may benefit more than 300,000 patients in the US alone with inadequately controlled COPD and an eosinophilic phenotype. In the first weeks of the US launch, we've been encouraged by the enthusiasm from physicians and patients for Dupixent as a treatment option in this underserved population. Educational efforts are underway to highlight the importance of type 2 inflammation in COPD and supporting patient identification by prescribers and motivating patients to speak with their physician about Dupixent. We've made significant progress in securing access and reimbursement for patients, many of whom are covered under Medicare. With Dupixent's unique clinical profile and first biologic to market advantage, we anticipate the COPD indication will drive meaningful growth for Dupixent. In summary, Dupixent continues to transform standard-of-care in lives of patients worldwide. In addition to current approvals, we look forward to future potential launches in diseases, including COPD in Japan, pediatric EoE in the EU and chronic spontaneous urticaria in US, as well as global regulatory filings for bullous pemphigoid. In conclusion, our commercial team continues to deliver on our goal to provide Regeneron medicines to an ever-expanding number of patients worldwide. There is significant growth potential within the current and future indications of our medicines and our pipeline provides meaningful opportunities for growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Chris.
Chris Fenimore: Thank you, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Regeneron delivered strong financial performance in the third quarter with continued execution driving top and bottom-line growth. Total revenues increased 11% year-over-year to $3.7 billion, primarily driven by higher Sanofi collaboration revenue, continued growth for Libtayo and US growth of total EYLEA HD and EYLEA. Third quarter net income per share grew 8% from the prior year to $12.46 on net income of $1.5 billion. Third quarter revenues from our Sanofi collaboration were $1.3 billion inclusive of $1.1 billion related to our share of collaboration profits. Regeneron's share of profits grew 26% versus the prior year driven by volume growth for Dupixent and improving collaboration margins, with collaboration profitability reaching another all-time high in the third quarter. The Sanofi development balance was approximately $1.8 billion at the end of the third quarter, reflecting a reduction of approximately $200 million from the end of the second quarter and approximately $520 million from the end of 2023. Moving to Bayer. Third quarter ex-US net sales of EYLEA and EYLEA 8 mg were $932 million, up 9% on a constant currency basis versus the prior year. Total buyer collaboration revenue was $391 million, of which $368 million related to our share of net profits outside the US. We recorded $35 million of sales for Inmazeb, our antibody cocktail for Ebola in the third quarter related to deliveries to the US government under our existing agreement. We still expect 2024 Inmazeb sales to be in-line with 2023 sales of approximately $70 million. Other revenue in the third quarter was $114 million. We expect other revenue will increase sequentially in the fourth quarter of 2024, but on a full year basis, is expected to be lower than 2023. Now to our operating expenses. R&D expense was $1.1 billion in the third quarter. The increase in R&D expense versus the prior year was driven by ongoing investments in our pipeline, including late-stage oncology programs and increased clinical manufacturing costs to support ongoing programs. SG&A grew 15% from the prior year to $613 million in the third quarter, primarily reflecting ongoing investment to support the launch of EYLEA HD. Third quarter 2024 gross margin on net product sales declined to 89% compared to 90% in the prior year, primarily reflecting higher start-up costs for our fill/finish manufacturing facility. Now to cash flow and the balance sheet. Regeneron generated approximately $2.6 billion in free cash flow through the first nine months of 2024 and ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities less debt of approximately $15.6 billion. Through the first nine months of 2024, we have repurchased over $1.6 billion of our shares, including $738 million in the third quarter. Given our long-term growth potential, we continue to see share repurchases as an efficient use of capital and had approximately $2.9 billion available for repurchases as of the end of the third quarter. Finally, we made some minor changes to our full year 2021 financial guidance based on our year-to-date results, narrowing ranges across most guidance items. A complete summary of our latest full year 2024 guidance is available in our press release issued earlier this morning. In summary, Regeneron delivered strong financial results in the third quarter, and our focused investments continue to position us to drive long-term growth. With that, I'll pass the call back to Ryan.
Ryan Crowe: Thank you, Chris. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call for Q&A. [Operator Instructions]. Shannon, can we please go into our first question.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Taylor Hanley: Hi. This is Taylor Hanley on for Chris Schott. We just had a question on EYLEA. So with Amgen launching their biosimilar, how are you thinking about EYLEA going forward? And what levels can you pull to potentially accelerate conversion to high-dose EYLEA? And how are you thinking about pricing for the franchise more broadly? Thank you.
Leonard Schleifer: So [may] (ph) -- may have some extra comments on that. But look, EYLEA is a fantastic product. We have delivered probably somewhere in the neighborhood of around 100 million or more injections with EYLEA. And so the performance and safety of the product, our transparency with safety issues that may arise over the past decade, I think has given physicians and their patients, a lot of comfort with EYLEA, and you see some stickiness of that product. Nonetheless, we think that EYLEA HD is a differentiated product, and we are continuing to work on using the standard approaches of education and informing the doctors about the potential use in patients, providing them with more data, as George referred to some of the long-term data is rather striking. We know that there is a biosimilar in the market for EYLEA, not for EYLEA HD, and we know it will be competitive, but we think we'll be able to compete well.
Ryan Crowe: Okay, next question, please Shannon.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Ryan Crowe: Evan, we don’t hear you. Maybe we’ll come back to Evan. Shannon, why don’t we go to the next.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Van Buren with TD Cowen. Your line is now open.
Tyler Van Buren: Hi, guys. Good morning. Congrats on the quarterly results and all the progress. Can you reiterate your confidence in EYLEA HD quarter-over-quarter growth going into Q4 despite the negative impact due to wholesaler inventory? And are you seeing a tailwind with the overall franchise yet due to the removal of product from a major supplier of Avastin?
Marion McCourt: So let me take both of those, Tyler. First, as I described to you the performance in the quarter showed growth for EYLEA and EYLEA HD? And then more specifically to your comment related to EYLEA HD, we have very strong confidence in the product profile, the interest of the retina community, the quality of our safety, clinical data durability are all being seen. But I did want to call out that we did see an inventory matter take place in the quarter that I wanted to comment on. We're not going to give fourth quarter guidance. But specifically, I wanted to be an awareness related to the favorable impact of approximately $40 million as a result of higher wholesaler inventory levels for EYLEA HD. At the end of the third quarter, partially offset by wholesaler inventory levels that were lower -- a bit lower on EYLEA. So we wanted to share that information, but certainly we have every confidence in EYLEA HD performance, but that inventory obviously will be used in the fourth quarter of this year.
Leonard Schleifer: Looking forward, Tyler, to next year, I think Marion may mentioned that bringing our prefilled syringe to market around -- by the middle of the year, I think will be a nice catalyst for acceleration I think that we've taken a lot of pain to make sure that when we bring something to the market, it is going to withstand the test of millions and millions of injections our competition may have brought something forth that, for example needs a [filter needle] (ph) because they must be trying to filter something out, we presume. We are hoping to not have to have that issue and we are looking very carefully to make sure that we bring something that really will not result in inflammation. Remember that in this marketplace, products have been really killed if you have too much inflammation, which leads to potential for retinal vasculitis and even occlusive retinal vasculitis with loss of vision. So we are very sensitive to all that. I think doctors will be sensitive to that with any new launch despite biosimilars. They're going to probably want to look carefully and they know EYLEA and EYLEA is something I think they can trust in. So we will be methodical about how we do this, and we're in this for the long game.
Marion McCourt: Tyler, I also want to cover your question related to [Pine] (ph) and they are coming away from support of Avastin in the marketplace. So we're very well aware of that. And certainly, our teams are actively involved in retina offices supporting staff and working with them on any challenges that present I would share that at this point, there still is Avastin inventory from Pine in the market. I think it's anticipated to run out within a couple of weeks. So we haven't seen a material uptake in EYLEA HD or EYLEA related to that yet, but we're staying very close to that situation and support to our customers.
Ryan Crowe: Thank you. Next question please Shannon.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Brian Abrahams: Hi, there. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. On the HD prefilled syringe, can you talk about the potential inflection in use that, that could catalyze next year, including how the differentiation of that prefilled string might resonate. And maybe also elaborate on some of the gating factors to development there, time line sounds like they've been pushed out a little bit. Thanks.
Leonard Schleifer: Yes. As I said, we anticipate bringing that to the market by the middle of next year. I believe already or almost immediately, Bayer will be bringing the same device to the market with EYLEA HD, outside of the United States. So we have a high degree of confidence. There are some additional requirements that you have to do inside the United States, which we are working through. And as I said, we think we'll have a differentiated product opportunity there. So you're right, Brian, it's possible that there could be an inflection when that comes to market because there is a preference for the prefilled syringe.
Ryan Crowe : Okay. Thank you. Next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Carter Gould with Barclays. Your line is open.
Carter Gould: Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe for Leonard and Chris, just now in the [wake] (ph) of sort of Amgen potentially being on the market has driven any sort of change in conservative conceptually how you're thinking about the pace of R&D investments going forward or your capital allocation priorities, you're potentially leaning into buybacks or further rolling out or delaying a potential dividend? Any color on that front would be helpful.
Leonard Schleifer: Well, we're -- they say imitation is the best form of flattery. So we're glad to be flattered by Amgen that they're spending their time imitating our products. We're spending our money trying to bring new products to market which where we think is what this industry really is built for. It's really not built -- biosimilars are fine, but we think the industry is best built and Regeneron is best built to bring innovative products to market. As I mentioned, we have over 40 products in clinical development, many of which are in Phase III. As George detailed, there are a lot of exciting programs in there with lots of data readouts. We're not going to gate spending based upon a biosimilar entry, we're going to spend what's appropriate based upon the opportunities that we see. We have a strong balance sheet. We have good earnings. We have the capability to make significant investments. And George has built, I think, the most prolific research and development organization in the industry. So it would be full hardy not to invest in that, and you'll probably see some investments to go up. The big question in this game always is, will these investments pay-off I think our past performance will not guarantee to anything in the future, the more than 10 or 12 products that George and [indiscernible] have bought market there's a good harbinger of things to come. And as I said, with more than 40 things in development, we couldn't be more excited about our future product profiles.
Ryan Crowe: Thanks Len. Next question please Shannon.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Terence Flynn: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I know you have some upcoming Factor XI readouts here before the end of the year. Maybe you could just tell us what you're looking for to make the decision about whether to advance those into a Phase III program and how you're considering them versus each other and also versus the standard-of-care. Thank you.
George Yancopoulos: Yes. This is George. We're very excited about our Factor XI program because we think it's very different from anything else that's out there. we chose to take a different approach where we attack Factor XI in two different ways, what we call our A2 domain antibody or catalytic domain antibody. Our A2 domain antibody is not a complete blocker of Factor XI, it actually is more like a complete Factor XII blocker. It's expected to not have as profound effect on the coagulation pathways, but to have a much milder safety profile. In contrast, we believe that our catalytic domain antibody is the best-in-class blocker of Factor XI will come with the best ability to control coagulation among all agents that are attacking this pathway. But of course, it will also have presumably a higher safety load than our A2 domain antibody. So we think it's very exciting to have these two parallel but very distinguished approaches. We actually hope to be able to show that both of these substantially controlled thrombo formation in the clinical trials that we now have running. And we hope to then in the future, decide based on how well they each control and their expected safety profile, we expect the ability to consider multiple indications that we can evaluate each one for different potential indications for one versus the other. So these are sort of a pipeline in and of themselves able to attack, we believe, a variety of different coagulation settings, and each one of them can be used differentially and provide a different profile of efficacy versus safety as might be needed in the different clinical settings.
Leonard Schleifer: One second. I just wanted to add to that. What George has taught me over the years is that not all antibodies are created equal. And I would not -- not all blockers of the pathway are created equal. And we have in-house pharmacodynamic data, which suggests that the antibodies that Regeneron has created and selected, we really have a competitive advantage in how we do that outperform other Factor XI antibodies or small molecule competitors. Of course, with the small molecule competitors, it's hard to get to the high dose because you have off-target problems. And with the antibodies, people can't always get the best antibodies. We think we have the technology and these things are not all created equal. So the proof of the pudding, will be in the eating, when we get the data and see how that performed.
Ryan Crowe: Okay, thank you. Next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.
Christopher Raymond: Thank you. Maybe just a follow-up on the last and supply issue with Pine and potentially others exiting the market. Maybe just stepping back, compounded Avastin has seen supply and quality issues before. Do you see this episode as different from prior disruptions? We had a KOL tell us that he believes this marks sort of the beginning of the end for Avastin. I'd love to hear your thoughts on that. And maybe as a follow-up, if Avastin is likely to play less of a role here, does this not provide more of an opening for a biosimilar option?
Marion McCourt: So Chris, let me take the impact and the situation with Pine and say that I think that probably what we're hearing is that because of the prior Avastin shortages last year around this time that the same thing occurred, offices and practices are getting used to how to deal with the situation. And obviously, the confidence in Avastin goes down in the supply. So certainly, it's important. And I see -- I think the evolution that you're hearing is because it's a situation that has been dealt with before. We certainly want physicians to have choice in prescribing the anti-VEGF category product brand that they think is best for their patients. And certainly, I think it is a competitive marketplace, but as we show in growth of our franchise, this quarter, we did last quarter as well, we certainly think that both EYLEA HD and EYLEA are both positioned very well in this competitive marketplace.
Ryan Crowe: Thanks Marion. Shannon, next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Salveen Richter: Thank you. Good morning. Can you just elaborate on the drivers for the pricing pressure noted for EYLEA HD and whether these pressures are going to be ongoing on the Ford? And just in that context, maybe discuss kind of your outlook for overall growth of the branded anti-VEGF market in the context of the biosimilars. Thank you.
Marion McCourt: So as we reflect on anti-VEGF category pricing pressure, that is something, Salveen, that has an impact on all products in the category, branded products, biosimilar products as well, and it's not inconsistent with other competitive categories. What's really important to note though is what often prevails is the product that physicians most often want to prescribe, meaning what has been their experience, what is the safety profile of the product, what is the efficacy? And now in the case of bringing EYLEA HD to the marketplace, the durability. So we think those factors are very important and allow us to compete successfully in the anti-VEGF category. As to overall category growth, I would say that it is probably roughly in -- and this is overall, not just branded, it is roughly in the mid-single-digit range. And then come back again just to say a little bit more about the pricing pressure. Obviously, that's something that's been more apparent for EYLEA and probably the product now having been on the marketplace for over a decade is understandable. The differentiation for EYLEA HD is the clinical profile, the product that is giving physicians the opportunity not only for the confidence in clinical aspects, results and safety as they have with EYLEA, but also now this really demonstrated durability that we're seeing more and more of. And obviously, our clinical data is supporting in the longer term as well.
Ryan Crowe: Thank you. Next move to the next question please Shannon.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Mohit Bansal: Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. I just want to understand how high does EYLEA uptake so far is tracking versus your own internal expectations, given that, I mean, it seems like about 25% conversion has happened yet at point. And at the same time, compared to -- this has been growing really rapidly. So just trying to understand what are the dynamics that we need to look at here and if there are any levers you can pull going forward to help increase uptake?
Leonard Schleifer: So Mohit, thanks for the question. Obviously, we don't give specific guidance on conversion or the size of the market, but we do talk about what we think the catalyst can be -- and I do feel that we have a bunch of catalysts next year, the potential approval and data for RVO, more importantly, perhaps the prefilled syringe by mid-year. So I think that next year, we could see a little bit of an acceleration. Obviously, we're working very hard. It's a great product. But there are -- these things don't happen overnight because people do love EYLEA. And it is more sticky than one might have anticipated but I think the progress is solid and we expect it to keep going.
Ryan Crowe: Okay, let’s move to the next question please Shannon.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Trung Huynh with UBS.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning. This in [indiscernible] on for Trung from UBS. And thanks for taking all the questions. So I want to switch gears to the obesity program and about the ongoing [Phase II trevogrumab] (ph) plus garetosmab and [GP1 study] (ph) seems like you recently increased the trial size from 620 plus to 1,000 with 3 new arms added. And now the study has a total of 13 investigational arm does seem like you want to very comprehensive to hear. Could you provide more granularity why the protocol changes here are necessary? And why would you like to further expand the trial. Thank you.
George Yancopoulos: Can we have somebody to repeat that question because I really couldn't understand it at all -- Go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Definitely. Yes. Just the ongoing Phase II obesity study of trevogrumab] plus garetosmab,and with and without [indiscernible]. So you recently increased the trial size [indiscernible], previously I think it was 620 plus. You also added two new arms. So why do you think like those protocol changes are necessary. And why would you like to further expand the trial? Thank you.
George Yancopoulos: Yes. I think what you're probably referring to is that we added additional dosing arms in our trial to expand different doses of the -- hopefully, muscle-enhancing treatments. And that's the major reason that the trial was enlarged. So that we would have broader information on different doses and their effects on muscle preservation.
Leonard Schleifer: Right. And just to remember, we didn't see any -- in the healthy volunteer study, we were able to do that because we didn't see any new safety signals. So I think it's just a matter of exploring additional doses.
Ryan Crowe: Trying to find the right mix of antibodies with semaglutide to maximize the quality of the weight loss. Let’s move to the next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Evan Seigerman: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Sorry about the earlier mishap. Just a follow-up on obesity. I know, George, you've spoken a lot about the really need for quality of weight loss, and I think that's very important. Maybe talk to the regulatory environment for muscle or preservation or muscle building assets. I know FDA has been kind of hesitant there. And they're really focused on weight loss, but maybe how you talk about -- how those will evolve in the coming years.
George Yancopoulos: Yes. I guess what you're referring to is obviously we all know, and it's been widely noted and acknowledged that in the setting of the very rapid weight loss that can be caused by these GLP related agents, you get significant lean body and muscle loss up to 30%, 40% of the weight loss, especially because most of these patients actually go off these treatments and then often cycle, this can actually lead to cumulative loss of muscle over time, which can actually be quite catastrophic. We may be creating a secondary problem here over time as people cycle on and off these treatments. So our approaches are intended to maintain the muscle. That said, the agents because they're promoting muscle. Remember, muscle is the major non-essential spender of energy that is renowned for its ability to expand energy. We've seen in the animal models that it can also cause our approaches when you maintain muscle, you are increasing the metabolic rate. So you're actually expending more calories, so you actually can lose more weight while you're gaining the muscle or preserving the muscle because the muscle itself is eating up the calories or using up the calories. So the easiest regulatory path will be if our approach is, as has been seen in the preclinical studies actually result in more weight loss but a better composition of that weight loss. So that one won't even have to actually rely on a muscle regulatory end-point, just on the increased weight loss itself. Of course, one will then hopefully be able to describe, and this is all part of ongoing discussions with regulatory agencies that not only might you be seeing increased weight loss, but the body composition results will be better. So the simplest regulatory path will be just by increasing the actual weight loss, and then you'll be able to show secondary end points that you are doing better on composition of the weight loss as well. That said, we are going to be measuring metabolic parameters. And we're also going to be measuring functional assets as well. And those are, of course, regulatory paths as well that will be more complicated and probably require a larger and longer studies than just the weight loss studies themselves. So of course, we expect to be improving metabolic endpoints. We expect to be improving functional endpoints whether we're going to be needing those as exploratory or descriptive endpoints or whether we're going to end up relying on them for approval remains an open story. But the goal, of course, is to show these benefits in the setting of maintenance of the muscle while maintaining or actually getting greater weight loss. I should also point out that in our pipeline, we have a variety of what we call Unimolecular solutions, a whole series of molecules that have the ability all within the same molecule to do all of these things. And obviously, those will all have their own indifferent regulatory path, some of which might be much more expedient in terms of what endpoints you can use for approval and so forth.
Ryan Crowe: Thanks George. Let’s move to the next question Shannon.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Risinger with Leerink Partners. Your line is now open.
David Risinger: Yes. Thanks very much. So I have -- I'll just keep it to one question, please. Regarding next-gen product development. So clearly, Regeneron was extremely successful in creating EYLEA HD. Could you talk about your efforts to develop a next-gen Dupixent, including whether it would be a less frequently administered product? Thanks very much.
George Yancopoulos: All we can say is that we are constantly working on both improving approaches for something where we already have important products such as in the Dupixent class, as well as coming up with entirely new and different products and approaches as well. And as you might imagine, we delivered with HD, I mean this is what we're trying to do all the time. We're trying to improve the current approaches but we're also trying to come up with an entirely different next-gen approach as well. That's what we do here at Regeneron.
Ryan Crowe: Thanks, George. Time for two more questions, Shannon.
Operator: Our next question comes from William Pickering with Bernstein. Your line is now open.
William Pickering: Hi, thank you for taking my question. Do you think that the rate of biosimilar erosion for Lucentis is a good proxy for what we can expect for EYLEA. I think they saw about 25% of volume switch over in the first 12 months? And are there any important differences in the commercial dynamics to keep in mind? Thank you.
Marion McCourt: Just would say that it's very -- and way too early to comment. And I think that through the conversation today, we've gone through the factors that create such confidence in EYLEA, the demonstrated use of the product on a worldwide basis, but very early to try to make any comment about a product that hasn't been used in the real-world setting yet.
George Yancopoulos: Well, I think it's also important. The situation is very different because at the same time, there are patients on EYLEA who might have a choice of going to a bio similar staying and EYLEA are actually moving to a differentiated product profile, which is EYLEA HD. So that's a very different sort of situation than you had with just the Lucentis erosion situation.
Marion McCourt : Great point.
Ryan Crowe: Thank you. Shannon, let’s take our last question.
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
Cory Kasimov: Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for fitting me in. I wanted to follow up on Carter's question earlier about capital allocation priorities. I'm sure you're pretty frustrated by the market reaction to recent developments around EYLEA. I know you have nearly $3 billion left in your authorized share repo. But have you given any thoughts to an ASR? And what are your evolving views around a dividend given that you already have over $15 billion in net cash on hand? And obviously have another significant inflection in additional cash generation not too far down the road. Thank you.
Leonard Schleifer: So we have lots of discussions on this. We don't really have anything more to add than we've said publicly, which is perhaps the best opportune time to think about the dividend is when we have paid-off the development balance to Sanofi, which we anticipate should be somewhere around the end of 2026. But beyond that, how we repurchase stock, when, whether, et cetera, et cetera, is something that we really don't discuss until it's happening.
Ryan Crowe: Okay. Thank you, Len, and thanks to everyone who dialed in for your interest in Regeneron. We apologize to those remaining in the Q&A queue that we did not have a chance to hear from. As always, the Investor Relations team here. Regeneron is available to answer any remaining questions you may have. Thank you once again. Happy Halloween, happy Diwali. Have a great day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-08-01 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Ryan Crowe, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.
Ryan Crowe: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening to everyone listening around the world. Thank you for your interest in Regeneron and welcome to our Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. An archive and transcript of this call will be available on the Regeneron Investor Relations website shortly after the call ends. Joining me on today's call are Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Board Co-Chair, Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; Dr. George Yancopoulos, Board Co-Chair Co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer; Marion McCourt, Executive Vice President of Commercial; and Chris Fenimore, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks, the remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate today's call will last approximately 60 minutes. I would like to remind you that remarks made on today's call may include forward-looking statements about Regeneron. Such statements may include, but are not limited to, those related to Regeneron and its products and business, financial forecast and guidance, development programs and related anticipated milestones, collaborations, finances, regulatory matters, payer coverage and reimbursement issues, intellectual property, pending litigation and other proceedings and competition. Each forward-looking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected in that statement. A more complete description of these and other material risks can be found in Regeneron's filings with the United States Securities and Exchange commission, including its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30th, 2024, which was filed with the SEC this morning. Regeneron does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. In addition, please note that GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on today's call. Information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP is available in our quarterly results press release and our corporate presentation, both of which can be accessed on the Regeneron Investor Relations website. Once our call concludes, Chris and the Investor Relations team will be available to answer any further questions. With that let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Leonard Schleifer. Len?
Leonard Schleifer: Thanks, Ryan. Thanks to everyone joining today's call. Regeneron continued its track record of strong execution highlighted by double-digit revenue and earnings growth in the second quarter along with important advances across our broad pipeline. For my remarks today, I'd like to briefly review some of the key performance drivers for the quarter and then discuss near-term pipeline opportunities. After my remarks, George will provide further updates on our pipeline. Marion will then review our commercial performance. And finally Chris will detail our quarterly financial results and discuss updates to our full year guidance. Second quarter 2024 total revenues grew 12% to $3.55 billion, primarily driven by sales of EYLEA HD in the United States. Higher Sanofi collaboration revenues reflecting the continued strong performance of DUPIXENT as well as robust growth for LIBTAYO. EYLEA HD generated $304 million in its third full quarter on the US market and continues to outperform recent launches in the anti-VEGF category. Net product sales for EYLEA HD and EYLEA combined were $1.53 billion, representing a 2.3% growth compared to the prior year. We are encouraged that despite increased competition in the anti-VEGF space, we have achieved a strong EYLEA HD launch trajectory while maintaining our category-leading combined EYLEA HD and EYLEA market share of 45%. Our efforts to bring an EYLEA HD pre-filled syringe, the United States market remain a high priority, and we are tracking towards a potential pre-filled syringe launch by early 2025. In summary, we continue to position EYLEA HD as the new standard-of-care for retinal diseases based on its differentiated clinical profile, coupled with strong familiarity and satisfaction among retinal specialists. DUPIXENT global revenues grew 29% on a constant currency basis to $3.56 billion, reflecting strong growth across all approved indications, age groups and geographies. In June, the European Commission approved DUPIXENT for COPD in patients with raised blood eosinophils, marking the first global regulatory approval for DUPIXENT in COPD. This approval enables DUPIXENT to address the approximately 220,000 eosinophilic COPD patients in the EU that are currently uncontrolled on maximum and eligible therapy. The approval also represents the first biologic approved to treat this disease. We continue to work with the FDA regarding its ongoing review for this indication and expect their decision by the September 27 PDUFA date. We and our partner, Sanofi, are prepared for US launch that many pulmonologists, respiratory key opinion leaders and their patients have been eagerly anticipating. There is a high unmet need in COPD with Type 2 inflammation with approximately 300,000 eligible patients in the United States and our potential launch represents a significant driver for DUPIXENT's continued growth. LIBTAYO global net product sales were $297 million in the second quarter, an increase of 43% on a constant currency basis. Despite intense competition, LIBTAYO has maintained its leadership position in non-melanoma skin cancers, while making impressive inroads in non-small cell lung cancer. We are also pleased with the progress we have made in establishing an international commercial footprint to support LIBTAYO and other future products following our purchase of full global rights to LIBTAYO from Sanofi in mid-2022. Regarding linvoseltamab or BCMA by CD3 bispecific for relapsed refractory multiple myeloma, during its review of the linvoseltamab BLA, the FDA informed us that the third-party fill/finish manufacturer for linvoseltamab had unresolved findings from a preapproval inspection for another company's product candidate. While we now believe these findings have been resolved, a reinspection will be required, and therefore, we anticipate any potential FDA approval for linvoseltamab is likely to be delayed beyond the August 22 PDUFA date. The FDA has not informed us of any approvability issues for linvoseltamab related to safety, efficacy or the status of our ongoing confirmatory trial. More broadly on our pipeline, we are excited about several upcoming readouts later this year or in 2025 to further inform programs that could support significant long-term growth opportunities which George will discuss in a moment. In closing, our pipeline continues to generate innovative and differentiated opportunities and now has over 35 programs in clinical development spanning several distinct therapeutic areas. Our commercial team is executing well with our in-market products and is building momentum in competitive categories. Finally, we continue to prudently deploy capital with the goal of delivering long-term value to shareholders. With that I'll turn the call over to George.
George Yancopoulos: Thank you, Len. Starting with DUPIXENT. Regarding COPD, data from our second confirmatory trial, NOTUS was featured as a late-breaking presentation at the American Thoracic Society Conference and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. In NOTUS, DUPIXENT reduced exacerbations by 34%, while significantly improving lung function confirming the unprecedented results from the previously reported Phase III BOREAS trial. Based on data from NOTUS and BOREAS, DUPIXENT was recently approved by the European regulatory authorities for eosinophilic COPD patients uncontrolled on maximum standard-of-care inhaled therapy. Additional submissions are under review with other regulatory authorities around the world, including in the US, China and Japan. Beyond COPD later this year, we are looking forward to data readouts from Phase III studies of DUPIXENT in chronic spontaneous urticaria and bullous pemphigoid. Seven years after its initial FDA approval and with approval in seven different indications around the world DUPIXENT continues to deliver potential new approvals for additional important disease indications. Regarding our small pilot study to potentially eliminate severe food allergies using our innovative approach that combines DUPIXENT and linvoseltamab or BCMA by CD3 bispecific, we continue to expect to see initial data by the end of this year. On itepekimab, our IL-33 antibody in development for certain COPD patients, our two Phase III studies are now fully enrolled, study readouts and regulatory submissions for our second therapeutic candidate for this devastating disease are expected in the second half of next year. Moving to oncology and starting with fianlimab, our LAG-3 antibody in combination with LIBTAYO, at the upcoming ESMO meeting in September, we look forward to presenting longer-term follow-up on the metastatic melanoma cohorts from our first-in-human study. Responses have continued to deepen with the proportion of complete responders and median progression-free survival continuing to improve. These results strengthen our view that fianlimab and LIBTAYO may be the most promising immunotherapy combination in clinical development. As we recently announced, we are looking forward to the Phase III readout in this melanoma setting next year, which could position fianlimab and LIBTAYO as a new standard-of-care in melanoma and eventually potentially other cancer settings. Additionally, we hope to gain insights into the antitumor activity of this combination in non-small cell lung cancer later this year. We are also advancing fianlimab development to earlier lines of therapy with proof-of-concepts in perioperative non-small cell lung cancer and perioperative melanoma now underway with additional indications likely to follow. On to bispecifics for solid tumors. Our costimulatory bispecific antibodies are being tested in numerous studies, including as monotherapies as well as in combination with CD3 bispecifics and with LIBTAYO. At the ASCO Conference, we presented results for our EGFR by CD28 bispecific in combination with LIBTAYO. In microsatellite stable colorectal cancer tumor historically unresponsive to immunotherapy, EGFR by CD28 in combination with LIBTAYO demonstrated encouraging antitumor activity with an overall response rate of 20% in patients without liver metastases. Regarding safety, to-date, we have not observed severe immune-related adverse events with this agent at our recommended Phase II dose. Dose expansion cohorts testing EGFR by CD28 plus LIBTAYO continue to enroll in various solid tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer with or without EGFR mutations, microsatellite stable colorectal cancer, head and neck, squamous cell carcinoma and others. On to our PSMA by CD28 costimulatory bispecific, which has already demonstrated promising activity in late-line prostate cancer when combined with LIBTAYO. We have now initiated combination treatment of our PSMA by CD28 costim bispecific with our PSMA by CD3 bispecific, which based on preclinical studies may maintain the efficacy of served with the LIBTAYO combination that may improve the safety and tolerability profile. We are also testing PSMA by CD28 in other cancers. Next, to our bispecifics for hematology oncology, the linvoseltamab or BCMA by CD3 bispecific, an oral presentation at the European Hematologic Association Conference we presented updated pivotal data, which continue to demonstrate a potentially best-in-class profile in late-line myeloma in terms of efficacy, safety, dosing as well as hospitalization burden. As we expected, responses continue to deepen with longer follow-up. At 14-month median follow-up of 117 patients, 50% achieved a complete response or better with an objective overall response rate of 71%. Additional studies of linvoseltamab are now also underway in earlier stages of myeloma and in precursor conditions such as smoldering myeloma and monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance or MGUS. Developing linvoseltamab in earlier-line myeloma settings presents an important opportunity for us to help patients and their physicians in these diseases, which currently have complex treatment paradigms. Touching on our nononcology hematology pipeline, as highlighted previously, later this year, we are anticipating proof-of-concept results for our two Factor XI antibodies in the setting of prevention of venous thromboembolism after knee replacement surgery. The study for the antibody targeting the Factor XI A2 domain is now fully enrolled and we expect to present results at a medical meeting in the second half of this year. Interim Phase II results for our second Factor XI antibody which targets the catalytic domain are expected by the end of this year for internal analysis. We have also started an additional proof-of-concept study to further evaluate the two antibodies profile for thrombosis prevention in patients, who have a peripherally inserted catheter. Results of these studies will inform whether to proceed to registrational studies with one or both of these antibodies by next year. Moving to obesity. Our most advanced approach is designed to address the potential negative consequences of widespread use of GLP and GIP receptor agonists. As has been widely reported, the profound weight loss caused by these agents unfortunately, it can also result in substantial loss of muscle, which is particularly concerning older obese patients. Our myostatin antibody when combined with semaglutide with or without our active NA antibody, may protect against this muscle loss as previously demonstrated in nonhuman primates. Part A of our COURAGE Phase II study testing a higher dose of trevogrumab or myostatin antibody in healthy subjects has now been successfully completed with no new safety signals identified. Part B of the study, which evaluates our muscle preservation antibodies in combination with semaglutide and obese participants has started enrolling patients assuming a reasonable pace of enrollment, we continue to expect to report top line results, including changes in body weight, fat mass and muscle mass by the second half of 2025. I will conclude with our genetics medicines efforts. At the ASGCT Conference, we presented updated data from our DB-OTO gene therapy program for genetic hearing loss due to mutations of the otoferlin gene. The first child treated with this therapy, an 11-month old girl, who is profoundly deaf at baseline had hearing in the normal range by 24 weeks after treatment. Also initial hearing improvements were observed in a second child dose at 4 years of age at a 6-week assessment with additional follow-up plan. As of July, we have dosed five patients in our study and we are on track to enroll several more patients this year. We also look forward to bringing additional otoferlin gene therapy programs to the clinic in the coming years with the potential to address more common forms of monogenic hearing loss. Regarding our Intellia collaboration, transthyretin amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy, the world's first Phase III program for in vivo CRISPR-based therapy is enrolling at a rapid pace indicating considerable interest from investigators and patients. In addition, we are also on track to be the first to use CRISPR technology to insert a corrective gene in vivo for a deficiency disease, hemophilia B. As noted previously, we have enrolled initial patients in the leading portion of this trial and first patient should be dosed soon. Our siRNA collaboration with Alnylam has not only demonstrated successful silencing of genes in the liver, but also for the first time for siRNA in the brain. This opens up opportunities for us to go after other disease-causing genes in the brain. A study of ALN-SOD in ALS patients with SOD1 mutations recently initiated. Other CNS-directed siRNA programs are expected to enter the clinic shortly, including targeting HTT for Huntington's disease, synuclein for Parkinson's and tau for Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, with regard to our C5 program, our innovative approach involving the first combination of an antibody together with an siRNA both targeting the same molecule is progressing well and we are expecting to present updated data for initial potential indication, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria by the end of this year. We're also looking forward to starting our Phase III program in geographic atrophy in the second half of this year. In summary, we continue to drive forward our innovative development pipeline and anticipate reading out several pivotal and proof-of-concept data sets over the next 12 to 18 months. Our early research efforts continue to be productive with multiple novel programs potentially advancing to the clinic over that same time frame. And with that I will turn the call over to Marion.
Marion McCourt: Thank you, George. Our second quarter commercial results further solidify Regeneron's leadership across therapeutic categories. Our performance demonstrates the ongoing strength and diversity of our product portfolio with continued growth opportunities powered by existing and upcoming product and indication launches across multiple geographies. I'll start with EYLEA HD and EYLEA in the US. In the second quarter, combined net sales for both medicines grew 2.3% year-over-year to $1.53 billion. EYLEA continues its clear category leadership while EYLEA HD remained the fastest growing medicine in this highly competitive category. EYLEA HD continued its launch momentum in the second quarter, delivering net product sales of $304 million, which represents 52% sequential growth. EYLEA HD continues to be the fastest launch of any anti-VEGF therapy since EYLEA more than a decade ago and the trajectory confirms a significant transition to EYLEA HD is underway. The breadth and depth of EYLEA HD prescribing continues to grow with utilization across a broad range of patients, including a treatment-naive population, which has doubled since last quarter. Physicians are also increasingly switching patients to EYLEA HD from other anti-VEGF treatments based on their positive early treatment experiences. And these switch patients, early real-world data indicate that treatment intervals are being extended with EYLEA HD. EYLEA HD's durability, along with the same trusted efficacy, visual acuity and safety as EYLEA represents a meaningful improvement for patient lives and greater efficiency for physician practices. The number of physician offices ordering EYLEA HD during the second quarter increased by more than 50% compared to the prior quarter. We believe this suggests prescriber confidence in EYLEA HD's clinical profile as well as in reimbursement now that the permanent J-code has been well established. Of note, we recognize the importance of providing physicians with a pre-filled syringe option and as Len mentioned, we're excited about our anticipated EYLEA HD pre-filled syringe launch. In summary, we're pleased with our second quarter performance for EYLEA HD and EYLEA and remain on track to achieve our goal of establishing EYLEA HD as the new standard-of-care for retinal disease. Next to DUPIXENT, which delivered 29% growth in the second quarter on a constant currency basis with global net sales of $3.56 billion. We are approaching the important milestone of 1 million patients on DUPIXENT worldwide. In addition, there's substantial opportunity for even more patients to benefit from DUPIXENT based on significant unmet need across indications, ages and geographies. In the US, net sales grew 24% to $2.61 billion, driven by an increased demand across all five approved indications. DUPIXENT continues its number one leadership position and new-to-brand prescriptions across all approved indications. Our commercial team remains laser-focused on pursuing initiatives that drive patient awareness and support prescribing. We continue to see increasing penetration in our blockbuster indications of atopic dermatitis, asthma and nasal polyps. Additionally, recent launches in eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis are exceeding our expectations and new patient initiations are steadily increasing. We hear remarkable stories of patients as young as one year of age with EoE, who are now thriving on DUPIXENT following its approval in January of this year. The European Commission also recently approved DUPIXENT in COPD patients with raised blood eosinophils with patients already getting treatment in Germany. We all recognize that there is significant unmet need worldwide among patients with this debilitating disease and DUPIXENT represents the first biologic medicine for COPD. Our US team is ready for the anticipated FDA approval of DUPIXENT in COPD by late September and estimate approximately 300,000 US patients may benefit from DUPIXENT in this indication separately, an FDA decision for DUPIXENT in adolescents with chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps is expected next month. As George mentioned, there are two DUPIXENT Phase III programs reading out later this year in chronic spontaneous urticaria and bullous pemphigoid. If data from these trials are positive, DUPIXENT has the potential to support even more patients with unmet need. We also made significant progress with LIBTAYO in the second quarter with global net sales of $297 million, up 43% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Strong commercial execution resulted in market share gains across both skin and lung cancers. In the US, net sales grew 40% to $182 million with growth across all market segments and indications. In non-melanoma skin cancer, we continue to extend LIBTAYO leadership with increasing demand and market share. In lung cancer, LIBTAYO is recognized by physicians as an important therapy for their lung cancer patients and continues to gradually gain market share. Outside the US, our teams are delivering excellent results with net product sales of $115 million as Regeneron continues its international expansion. LIBTAYO net product sales in some of these international markets were favorably impacted by approximately $15 million of stocking purchases. Our oncology team is also eagerly awaiting the potential FDA and EU decisions for linvoseltamab in late-stage myeloma. We believe linvoseltamab represents a best-in-class opportunity and we look forward to potential launch. In summary, our commercial team continues to deliver on our goal to provide Regeneron medicines to even more patients worldwide. There is meaningful future growth potential within our approved indications and our robust pipeline provides both near and long-term opportunities to advance patient care. With that I'll turn the call over to Chris.
Chris Fenimore: Thank you, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Regeneron delivered strong double-digit top and bottom line growth in the second quarter. Total revenues increased 12% year-over-year to $3.5 billion, primarily driven by strong execution of the ongoing EYLEA HD launch in the US, higher Sanofi collaboration revenue and continued global sales growth from LIBTAYO. Second quarter diluted net income per share grew 13% from the prior year to $11.56 on net income of $1.4 billion. Second quarter revenues from our Sanofi collaboration grew to $1.1 billion, primarily composed of our share of collaboration profits of $988 million, which increased by 32% compared to the prior year driven by DUPIXENT's continued volume growth and improving margins. Reimbursement from manufacturing and commercial supply, the other component of Sanofi collaboration revenue was $157 million, taking into account increased volumes, offset by manufacturing efficiencies, we continue to expect reimbursement for manufacturing and commercial supply in 2024 to be comparable to 2023 on a full year basis. The Sanofi development balance was approximately $2 billion at the end of the second quarter, reflecting a reduction of approximately $190 million from the end of the first quarter. We continue to anticipate this balance will be fully reimbursed to Sanofi by the end of 2026. Moving to Bayer. Second quarter ex-US net sales of EYLEA and EYLEA 8 mg were $908 million, up 8% on a constant currency basis versus the prior year. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $375 million, of which $353 million related to our share of net profits outside the US. Now to our operating expenses. Second quarter R&D expense grew 10% year-over-year to $1.1 billion, reflecting continued investments to support our robust pipeline, including late-stage oncology and hematology programs. We continue to make thoughtful investments to enable us to move quickly into Phase III programs is supported by data readouts anticipated over the next 12 to 18 months. SG&A grew 19% from the prior year to $666 million in the second quarter, primarily driven by investment to support the launch of EYLEA HD as well as our ongoing international commercial expansion. Second quarter gross margin and net product sales was approximately 89%, which reflected ongoing start-up costs for our fill/finish manufacturing facility. Now to cash flow and the balance sheet. Regeneron generated approximately $1.6 billion in free cash flow through the first six months of 2024 and ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities less debt of approximately $14.8 billion. We repurchased approximately $900 million of our shares through the first six months of the year and had approximately $3.6 billion available for repurchases as of the end of the second quarter. Finally, we have made some minor changes to our full year 2024 financial guidance. We have updated our 2024 gross margin guidance and now expect gross margin to be approximately 89%, primarily reflecting anticipated changes in product mix as well as higher non-product specific costs, including start-up costs for our fill/finish facility. A complete summary of our latest full year guidance is available in our press release issued earlier this morning. In summary, Regeneron delivered outstanding results in the second quarter and is well positioned to continue to drive growth in the near and long-term. With that, I'll pass the call back to Ryan.
Ryan Crowe: Thank you, Chris. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call for Q&A. To ensure we are able to address as many questions as possible, we will answer one question from each caller before moving to the next. Shannon, can we go to the first question, please?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tyler Van Buren with TD Cowen. Your line is now open.
Tyler Van Buren: Hey, guys. Good morning. Congratulations on the great quarter. Regarding the EYLEA franchise, I'm really encouraged to see that the overall franchise is up year-over-year and that the 45% category share is maintained quarter-over-quarter. So do you believe that EYLEA HD is reaching a stage and maturity of its launch, where it will allow the overall category share to be relatively stable in the coming quarters that will allow you to participate in the retinal disease market growth and is the market still growing around 10% year-over-year?
Ryan Crowe: Marion?
Marion McCourt: So Tyler, I'll take it in a couple of pieces. Thank you for the question. First, I did want to comment, we were very pleased to report the total net sales of 1.4, excuse me, $1.54 billion in the quarter. Obviously, as you mentioned, that's a 2.4% increase year-over-year. Additionally, I'll just comment a little bit more on EYLEA HD. We certainly are very much in the launch stage. This is our third full quarter of results that we're reporting today. And certainly, we're encouraged that in the quarter, we had a 52% increase in net sales. And certainly, that calculation represents $100 million net sales increase from the prior quarter, which is very significant in this competitive market. So certainly, we are continuing to progress our launch and see it is important. Certainly, EYLEA is an important source of switch patients for EYLEA HD. Next, we see switches coming from faricimab, also avastin, very pleased as well this quarter to report that we're seeing increased use of EYLEA HD in naive patient population. So all-in-all, we see this indicative that EYLEA HD has the potential and certainly the profile to be the new standard-of-care. I think you also asked me about market growth, overall market growth. Let me cover that as well. I would say probably at this stage in the year, we're tracking more on single-digit growth in the category in the midrange as opposed to double-digit, which I think is what was cited in your question.
Ryan Crowe: That's right. Okay. Thank you, Marion. Let's move to the next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Evan Seigerman: Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question and always congrats on the progress. I want to touch on your work in obesity specifically with leptin. Can you just walk me through some of the rationale of moving this to a Phase II? I know that leptin had been kind of controversial, clearly, you saw some interesting data in earlier trials. But why do you want to add this on top of say, tirzepatide, versus using triple agonist that Lilly is doing some of the other trials. Thank you so much.
George Yancopoulos: Well, we have leptin going forward in a number of different programs. I believe the one that you're talking about is in combination with other weight loss agent. And that's based on results that suggest that the reason leptin doesn't work in normal obese patients is because in those patients who have a high degree of fat and are in fact on the upswing of their obesity profile, their leptin levels are very high. They're already saturating. Once you undergo profound weight loss, the leptin levels drop and you may be getting into the range where the leptin is now providing a signal, which is creating an increased desire in the individual to each. And so in these patients, it may be that some of the weight loss is limited by decreases in the leptin, which is then driving increasing feeding type of behavior. So this might be and at least it's been shown in animal studies to be the situation where leptin might actually be playing an important role. So as you point out, in historical studies in stably obese patients, leptin is already saturated and giving more leptin may not have a benefit. But in these settings where there are falling leptin levels, the falling and low leptin levels may lead to a food-seeking drive and giving leptin in that setting may allow further weight loss on top of that obtained with these other agents, which tend to plateau at a certain point, and that plateau at least based on animal studies may be in part driven by these drops in the leptin. And these studies, as you know, are done in collaboration with a partnership with Lilly. So there -- so we're studying it in collaboration with their agent tirzepatide.
Ryan Crowe: Thanks, George. Let's move to the next question.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Brian Abrahams: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the quarter and all the progress. On linvo, as you prepare for the potential launch there, I'm curious the feedback you're getting on how docs may position it relative to existing therapies, how much appreciation there is out there for the efficacy and administration advantages that you cited in your slide? And maybe you could also elaborate a little bit more on some of the issues with the third-party facility and they're confident if that's resolved. Thanks.
Leonard Schleifer: I'll take the third-party issue and George can cover or Marion, how people are thinking about a BCMA approach and where it might fit in the longer term. There's been a lot of third-party filler type and manufacturing issues with lots of CRLs across our, the biopharmaceutical space. As you know, we had one last year with HD EYLEA and this was a case where the FDA was inspecting our filler for a different product. And they found some observations the observation is needed to be remediated, but because of the nature of the observations, a reinspection is necessary, we believe, based on what we've been told is that the observations have been remediated. But since there's a reinspection required, it might not get done, it's likely not to get done in time for our PDUFA date. That's why we called your attention to that. This is an industry-wide kind of issue. I think the FDA is, in fact, having planning some sort of public hearing on these sorts of things. We're working with the FDA because this is a priority review application to see how we can resolve this in this expeditious manner as possible. George or Marion, do you want to cover these.
George Yancopoulos: Yes, I'll start and then I'll hand it over to Marion. But as we summarize and we've detailed and as we'll continue to be presented, the efficacy data with our bispecific continues to look like it is leading the field as the data matures, and patients continue on treatment, they continue to progress to deeper and deeper responses and where now we have complete response rates at 50% with, we believe, best-in-class PFS and overall survival type numbers. This is obviously really important because what cancer treatment is all about is trying to eliminate the cancer and getting long-term durable responses and survival in the patients. And we would imagine that this is exactly what patients and physicians are focused about. Other aspects of our profile, we also believe in terms of safety and our dosing schedule and hospitalization burden also, we believe, are best-in-class. In terms of how Marion believes the physician community is appreciating the data, I'll ask Marion to comment on that.
Marion McCourt: Thanks, George. And certainly, we're very excited about the potential upcoming approval for linvoseltamab. George describes the differentiated clinical efficacy, safety profile that will be incredibly important to physicians. We have a highly experienced hematology team in place and ready for launch.
Leonard Schleifer: Yes, I would just add, this is Len. I would just add that we're not limiting ourselves, obviously, just to the last line. We are trying to move this aggressively either in monotherapy or in combinations to much early lines of therapy. The rule of thumb has been in cancer that you tend to get more responses as you move to earlier lines. But this would be quite remarkable given what George just told you about the amount of responses we're seeing in the last line. So we're very excited about moving this forward and we'll go -- we'll keep you updated as we do that.
George Yancopoulos: Yes. Just a follow-up on what Len said, obviously, this is why we're moving to these trials in these earlier lines of therapy. Obviously, we won't be commercializing those areas until we get the results from those clinical trial.
Brian Abrahams: Sure. Absolutely.
Ryan Crowe: All right, gentlemen. Let's go to the next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
Cory Kasimov: Thank you, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So we're getting an increasing amount of inbound interest in your Factor XI program. Can you speak to the differences, I guess, probably for George between your two antibodies? And what will be the key aspects you'll be focused on in your upcoming readouts to know you're on the right track? Thank you.
George Yancopoulos: Yes. So very importantly, what we've done is we've created antibodies that split the mechanism of action. One affects the activation domain, the other the catalytic domain. We have developed in both these classes, the only ones in class or the best-in-class type of antibodies, which are best at actually hitting and inhibiting that target based on all of the signs, a huge amount of genetics in part fortified by our own Regeneron genetics efforts and so forth, it suggests that these two approaches will allow us to separate and optimize optimum efficacy and optimum safety. So it's quite possible that we might actually move forward with both of these antibodies for different target populations in some of which where efficacy is the primary driver and others where safety might be most important. So they're very unique in their mechanisms of action. They really are exploring this target both much more precisely by splitting the mechanism of action, but also more powerfully than competitors that have antibodies that can do one or the other of these things. So we're very excited about these programs. As we said, we have some proof-of-concept studies ongoing and we hope by the end of the year to be able to announce the directions we may be taking either or both of these antibodies going forward in the future.
Ryan Crowe: Thanks, George. Let's move to the next question, please, Shannon.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.
Christopher Raymond: Hey, thanks. And just a quick question on EYLEA and the commercial progress. So you guys, I think, were pretty clear in your messaging on the permanent J-code is we should not really see an inflection that was sort of seen maybe with VABYSMO when they got their permanent J-code as there were some other variables such as discounting, et cetera, going on with that example. But we've gotten some market feedback that access barriers remain even with the J-code change and specifically among Medicare Advantage plans. Marion, I'm kind of curious if you can sort of talk about the dynamic there and how you see things playing out with respect to access post permanent J-code.
Marion McCourt: Sure. I'm very, very happy to comment. So certainly, for a portion of the market, fee-for-service Medicare patients, there's open access and freedom of prescribing for physicians. If we go to those areas of the market where there's a payer impact, our teams have successfully opened access for EYLEA HD in a way that covers over 80% of patient lives. So certainly, significant progress has been made and we continue to work through situations where physicians might be having some utilization management or step edits I will share that those are often easily managed when the physician and office staff provide information. But overall, the takeaway message should be that EYLEA HD has a very strong payer coverage. And again 80% of the market where reimbursement is in place.
Ryan Crowe: Thanks, Marion. Let's move to the next question, Shannon.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Akash Tewari with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Katherine Wang: Hi. This is Kathy on for Akash. So for your myostatin program, can you talk about your preference for using a doublet versus triplet combination approach in your Phase III trials? And also where do you think myostatin will stack up versus GIP, GLP, amylin combination approaches, which could show potentially like 90% plus fat versus muscle loss. Thank you.
George Yancopoulos: Yes. Well, once again, what we focused on is creating individual reagents that allow us to best dissect the pathway and separate out which are the most important players. As you're aware, other people, for example, are using an antibody that blocks all the pathways, not only the two that we've targeted, but about 20 others that are irrelevant for muscle and we know are known to have a variety of other potential side effects and adverse effects. So we targeted the two muscle specific pathways in this whole mechanism. And what we want to see is which one might have the best efficacy to safety profile that we believe is very important. Once we determine that, we may move forward with either one or both of these antibodies in combination with the weight loss agents or we also have been developing in our pipeline, a variety of unimolecular solutions that will allow a single molecule to do whichever one of these multiple pathways we want to attack in addition to the weight loss pathway. So what we're hoping to do is by dissecting the pathway as precisely and scientifically as possible, allow us to choose between the unimolecular solutions that we can have to follow on. That said, remember, it's not just a matter of amplifying the weight loss because with more weight loss, regardless of pathway you use, you can throw on the GLP-1 agonist, you can throw on GPR antagonist, you can lay on additional pathways. The more rate loss and the more rapidly occurs, which is what patients want, out of necessity because you're mimicking the starvation to get the pathway, it inevitably leads to muscle loss because of why, because of activation of these very pathways that we're looking at. So any approach right now that focuses on rapidly causing weight loss will of necessity because it plugs into evolutionarily conserved pathways of necessity will result in profound lean body and muscle loss, which can be a huge detriment to these patients especially the older obese patient. And by invoking these agents blocking these specific pathways, we may be able to do two things. We may block this associated necessarily evolutionary conserved muscle loss that accompanies rapid and profound weight loss while also perhaps increasing the amount of fat loss, which is what you specifically want to lose. This is what we've now shown in preclinical studies, including through nonhuman primates and these studies that we're embarking on right now should tell us whether all of these pathways, which are incredibly evolutionarily conserved will indeed pertain in humans and whether we really can optimize not only the weight loss, that's not what's important, but optimize particularly fat loss while maintaining the muscle. And we believe we're the only ones who are properly precisely interrogating the pathways and we'll be able to dissect them to decide on which exactly is the best, safest pathway to give the best benefit to the patient.
Ryan Crowe: Okay. Thanks, George. Shannon, next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Chris Schott: Great. Thanks so much for the question. Just on linvo, DUPIXENT and food allergy. I know it's early but an exciting program. Can you help us just a bit to frame out the number of patients or percent of those with food allergy where you think this could be an appropriate treatment if the data we see later this year and going forward supports moving that combination forward? Thanks so much.
George Yancopoulos: I think that it's all going to be a matter of the benefit to risk profile once again. And this is what, as I've said in these other programs we're focusing on. We believe, based on all the data that we've shown, that we may have a very safe way of eliminating the actual cells that are causing all these allergic responses and then very safely keep them from coming back by giving one of the world's historically most safe biologics, which is DUPIXENT. Of course, we have to prove this in patients. And so we are starting in the most severe food allergy patients. And in these patients where they have, for example, very high unmet need, very high risks and so forth, it warrants undertaking this approach. The more effective it is, but more importantly, the safer we can prove it is then the broader the population can go. And in fact, if ultimately, we really have a very safe way of eliminating all allergy inducing cells and then preventing their rebound. And remember, particularly, most of these patients are also suffering from other allergic diseases, some of them may already be indicated for DUPIXENT. So you're giving them a drug which may actually be helping them anyway and has been shown to be quite safe in terms of as almost any biologic goes. We may be able to go into milder and milder allergy patients. So we can start and we are starting with the most severe patients we're seeing in these patients with a high unmet need, whether this approach is both effective, but also safe and how safe it is and the safer it is, we can broaden wider and wider. There's also ultimately no need to be limited to food allergies, you can actually eliminate essentially all allergies from the most serious to the most mundane, but it depends on the benefit risk and the safety, which is what we're testing in these initial studies. And for the initial studies, we're taking the most severe food-allergic patients who have a very high unmet need and very high risk profile depending on how it goes there, we can broaden to milder and milder types of disease.
Leonard Schleifer: I mean the numbers I get are quite staggering. Looking at -- if you just look at the number of emergency room visits a year, it could be hundreds of thousands of millions of people go to the emergency room for food-based allergies. Obviously, a smaller number for actual anaphylaxis. But just to reinforce exactly what George says, if all it takes is an induction in BCMA to induce the process where you can get on to Dupi, Dupi is a very safe agent, and we've got hundreds of thousands, approaching million of patients on the drug. So we know the profile of that drug. So this is all makes great scientific sense. We just have to take our time, do it safely and see how it develops.
Ryan Crowe: Thanks, Len and George. Let's move to the next question, please, Shannon.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.
Tim Anderson: Thank you very much. I have a question on EYLEA and this DOJ investigation into the marketing practices that emerged since April, where they assert that you guys violate the False Claims Act. Can you provide an update on kind of what happens from here, specifically in the interim and out of prudence, has Regeneron changed any of its marketing practices since April. And is that having any impact even on prescribers. I asked because on Slide 6, you mentioned, other market dynamics that resulted in lower volumes and lower price. I am just wondering what those where.
Leonard Schleifer: There's nothing in the marketplace related to this lawsuit. And frankly we think there's nothing to this lawsuit. And we have not changed our practice, and we intend to fight it vigorously. And I think once you see our papers in court, you'll get a much better understanding of that.
Ryan Crowe: Let's move to the next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Risinger with Leerink Partners. Your line is now open.
David Risinger: Yes. Thanks very much. So Regeneron is obviously a tremendous R&D leader, but there's also substantial innovation happening outside of the company, and the company has a tremendous balance sheet that it's not really putting to work. So my question is, is there an opportunity to leverage Regeneron's eye disease commercial presence by acquiring novel potential blockbuster therapies for severe eye disease. And if so, does the company see any opportunities in the near to medium term to do so? Thanks very much.
Leonard Schleifer: Yes, it's a great question, and it's one we ask every day here. Is there some opportunity that we are -- isn't resulting from our own innovation that we should be trying to acquire. We have not seen any such large scale. Obviously, we've done some smaller scale and hundreds of millions of kind of numbers or a few million and whether or not we would -- we could leverage any of our in-line products or research capabilities, it's certainly something we think about, but there's nothing that we at the moment for late-stage products see an opportunity for.
Ryan Crowe: Thanks, Len. Let's move to the next question please, Shannon.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Salveen Richter: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. On the Factor XI programs here, could you speak to the potential commercial opportunity that are represented and what the future development plans look like here? Thank you.
George Yancopoulos: Well, as I said, we're in the stages of evaluating our Factor XI two classes of antibodies that are attacking this pathway in two different ways. We expect I think we've already talked about. One of them will be more effective at preventing clot formation, but potentially come with slightly more serious side effect profiles. The other might be less effective, but much safer. And as I said, we thought it was important to really precisely interrogate this pathway using these two antibodies that are attacking, two different parts. So this is one enzyme. It has an activation domain, a catalytic domain. And by blocking independently the two different domains, we expect to deliver two different profiles each one with the best-in-class antibody. Once we really understand those profiles, we will understand in which directions to be taken either one or both potentially in antibodies. We can easily imagine taking forward, the more effective one, but for a higher-risk patients, let's say, the less effective one into settings where you might want more safety and clot prevention is not as important. So all of this is going to depend on these profiles. And as I said, we hope to get our key data by the end of this year, and that should better define the efficacy and safety profile how they compare to the various existing agents that are out there now and which direction to take them for which indication. So two antibodies, two distinct profiles we hope to better understand them based on our initial proof-of-concept study. And from there, we'll understand where to take them and what the ultimate opportunity will be. But obviously there's still enormous need here for agents that can block, clot and thrombus formation. And so much depends on safety profiles here, and we're very excited about having the opportunity to have these two very related but distinct profiles.
Leonard Schleifer: Just to amplify a little bit of what George said the direct oral anticoagulant market is a very, very large market. It's about a $20 billion market. if you could bring to part of that market, most of that market or some fragment similar efficacy, but with a better safety profile then you really have a big opportunity here. So that's what we're sort of focusing on. Can we deliver with one or the other antibody in the proper setting, as George was suggesting a same or better efficacy, but with a better safety profile. If we can give you that, if we can give patients that, then we will be able to really have a big large market opportunity.
George Yancopoulos: And there are many settings where you don't use certain agents because of the safety profile, which could create whole new opportunities as well.
Ryan Crowe: Okay. Thank you. Let's move to the next question please, Shannon.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Carter Gould with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Carter Gould: Good morning. Congrats on the quarter. I appreciated the earlier commentary from Len on the pre-filled syringe effort, I guess, but for Marion and the team, just the confidence that the high dose launch momentum won't be disrupted by the relative near-term disadvantage of VABYSMO having a pre-filled syringe and if you wanted to give more specificity on your own time lines, that would be appreciated. Thank you.
Leonard Schleifer: Well, I think I said in my prepared remarks that we're anticipating a launch in early 2025. I'm not sure what the competition is actually going to do about launching, but we're a matter of months, I think, a part if they launch ahead of us. And so I don't think that, that's going to have a significant impact in the marketplace where people really are focused, I think, on the profile of our drug, the durability of our drug, the safety experience they've had with aflibercept, the active ingredient. So we feel pretty confident in the ongoing launch.
Ryan Crowe: Okay. Thank you. We have time for two more questions, please, Shannon.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Chris on for Terence. Just one question from us about EYLEA HD. Given what you have seen in the market dynamics in 2Q. How should we think about the pace of conversion for the second half of 2024?
Leonard Schleifer: You should think hard about it. That's your job. I don't know if Marion wants to have any comment there.
Marion McCourt: I would just say that as I commented earlier, we're very pleased in our progress in the EYLEA HD launch.
Ryan Crowe: All right. Thank you. Let's move to the final question, please, Shannon.
Operator: Our last question is from the line of Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Mohit Bansal: Thank you very much for taking my question, Shannon. I just want to, again, talk about EYLEA HD. In terms of -- Marion, if you could comment on, at this point, how much is switch versus naive patient adjustment? I assume most of them are switch and are they difficult to treat patients in the beginning? And then when you think about going forward, do you think you're in the early innings of conversion? Or do you think there is some other dynamics we should think about from the pricing as well as access point of view as we model EYLEA HD versus standard dose EYLEA going forward? Thank you.
Marion McCourt: So it's always a combination of initiation for EYLEA HD of switch patients and then, of course, naive patients. So I'd mentioned the profile today of switch patients to EYLEA HD, which is very encouraging comes not surprisingly from EYLEA because it's the largest product in the category, secondarily from faricimab. And then the third source of switch patients would be avastin and then there's everything else. But what's really encouraging, as I mentioned in the quarter, is that the utilization among treatment-naive patients doubled from the prior quarter. So we'll continue to see an ongoing combination as does every product potentially, if it's got the right profile in the category, but the evolution of prescribing to EYLEA HD is progressing very well.
Ryan Crowe: Thanks, Marion, and thanks to everyone who dialed in today for your interest in Regeneron. We apologize to those remaining in the Q&A queue that did not have a chance -- that we did not have a chance to hear from. As always, the IR team is available to answer any remaining questions that you may have. Thank you once again and have a great day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-05-02 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Josh, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions].

Once our call concludes, Chris and the IR team will be available to answer any further questions.
 With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Leonard Schleifer. Len? 
Leonard Schleifer: Thanks, Ryan. Thanks to everyone joining today's call. Regeneron is off to a strong start in 2024, reflected in our solid first quarter financial results as well as the progress we have made across our pipeline in the first 4 months of the year. For my remarks today, I'd like to briefly review some of our key performance drivers and then discuss a few of our more differentiated development programs, which have the potential to drive sustainable long-term growth for the company and value for our shareholders. After my remarks, George will provide an update on our pipeline. Marion will then review our commercial performance, and Chris will discuss our financial results. First quarter 2024 revenues grew 7% after excluding last year's revenue contribution from our COVID antibodies. Growth was primarily driven by Sanofi collaboration revenues and Libtayo global net product sales, which grew by 14% and 45%, respectively.  
 Dupixent global net product sales were $3.1 billion, up 24% reflecting strong growth across all approved indications. EYLEA HD generated $200 million in its second full quarter on the U.S. market outperforming recent launches in the anti-VEGF category. Now with the permanent J-Code in place, improving payer coverage, broad prescriber familiarity and satisfaction with the EYLEA HD clinical profile and direct-to-consumer TV promotion underway. We continue to position EYLEA HD as the new standard of care for retinal diseases. 
 Shifting to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD where Regeneron and Sanofi have 2 differentiated opportunities to transform the treatment paradigm for patients living with this debilitating disease. As announced in February, our sBLA for Dupixent for the treatment of COPD with type 2 inflammation was accepted by the FDA for priority review with a June 27 PDUFA date.  
 During its review of our submission, the FDA has requested additional efficacy analyses, including an information request received earlier this week regarding subpopulations from the BOREAS and NOTUS pivotal studies. Our analyses across these requested patient subgroups indicate a consistent and clinically meaningful reduction in COPD exacerbations. While the FDA has requested these analyses to be submitted by the end of May, we anticipate providing them substantially sooner. We and Sanofi are confident that these additional analyses strongly support the approval of Dupixent and eosinophilic COPD. If the FDA determines that they need additional time to review these analyses, a decision on the sBLA could be delayed for up to 3 months.
 We and our partner, Sanofi, are preparing for launch that many pulmonologists, respiratory key opinion leaders and their patients are eagerly anticipating. If approved Dupixent will be the only biologic therapy for COPD and the first new treatment approach for this disease in more than a decade. There is a high unmet need in COPD with type 2 inflammation with approximately 300,000 eligible patients in the United States and another approximately 300,000 eligible patients in the EU and Japan, where we are also seeking regulatory approvals. Turning to itepekimab our IL-33 antibody, which is being evaluated in former smokers with COPD regardless of eosinophil phenotype. We remain on track to report results and enable potential global regulatory filings in the second half of next year.  
 Itepekimab can potentially address up to 1 million patients in the G7 countries, while China also represents a significant opportunity. We are very excited about potentially bringing these important new therapies with COPD patients while expanding our commercial respiratory franchise. In a moment, George will describe another key opportunity in our pipeline involving Dupixent in combination with our BCMAxCD3 bispecific antibody linvoseltamab which we believe has the potential to address any severe allergy and allow the millions of severe allergy sufferers to stop living in fear of an accidental exposure. Moving from linvoseltamab in severe allergy to its differentiated opportunity in multiple myeloma where it is currently under FDA and EMA review in the relapsed refractory setting. In our registration-enabling data set, while cross trial comparisons caveat supply, we believe linvoseltamab represents a best-in-class opportunity because it has the highest objective response rates and complete response rates at similar follow-ups observed across the [ BCMA ] bispecific class to date requires the least number of days in the hospital compared to other drugs in the category and is the only BCMA by CD3 agent currently under review or are already approved by the FDA that evaluated every 4-week dosing.
 If approved, we believe these are all important considerations for patients, caregivers, providers and payers that could drive linvoseltamab adoption. In closing, I'm excited and energized by the differentiated opportunities in our pipeline, which now has over 35 programs in clinical development spanning many distinct therapeutic areas. Our commercial team continues to execute well and is building momentum in competitive categories, and we continue to deploy capital with the goal of driving shareholder returns over time. With that, I'll turn the call over to George. 
George Yancopoulos: Thanks, Len. Since Len covered the status of the Dupixent and itepekimab programs in COPD in great detail, I'd like to start with a bit more about our innovative treatment approach for severe allergies, a first-ever combination of an immunomodulatory antibody that is DUPIXENT with a bispecific antibody. Despite the remarkable benefit demonstrated by DUPIXENT across multiple diseases characterized by allergic or type 2 inflammation, DUPIXENT alone does not immediately reverse severe allergies by itself. These allergies are caused by high levels of an immunoglobulin class known as IgE made by long-lived plasma cells. This has caused some to refer the E in IgE as E for evil. Although DUPIXENT will prevent formation of new IgE plasma cells, it does not eliminate those that have already formed.  
 Regeneron scientists have shown that these allergy causing IgE plasma cells can be rapidly eliminated with a short course of treatment with our bispecific antibody known as linvoseltamab. While Dupixent treatment will then prevent these cells from returning as recently highlighted in our publication and Science Translational Medicine. We have commenced our proof-of-concept clinical trial to explore the potential for this combination approach to eliminate severe food allergy. We are hoping to see initial observations from this small study later this year, which will inform next steps.
 Moving on to oncology and libtayo combinations. Early clinical results of our LAG-3 antibody fianlimab in combination with libtayo suggest that these antibodies represent one of the most promising checkpoint inhibitor combinations in clinical development. Recall, fianlimab libtayo demonstrated potential for best-in-class efficacy in first-line metastatic melanoma with objective response rates of approximately 60% across 3 independent cohorts from our first-in-human study with a safety profile that is similar to that seen with anti-PD-1 monotherapy with longer-term follow-up, these initial responses continue to deepen, including patients converting into complete responses. We look forward to presenting updated results from these expansion cohorts in the second half of this year.
 Encouraged by these initial results, last year, we initiated a Phase II/III study of the combination of fianlimab and libtayo in first-line metastatic melanoma. This study is enrolling faster than expected and will now be conducted solely as a Phase III study with the final analysis to be reported during 2025. These pivotal melanoma data will inform whether fianlimab and libtayo have the potential to emerge as a new standard of care in melanoma. 
 Next, to our bispecifics for hematology oncology. Regarding odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific, as announced in March, we received complete response letters from the FDA for our BLA for relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma and relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The only approvability issue was related to the limited enrollment of these confirmatory trials, which we intend to address as we continue to enroll patients in these studies. The EU decision on odronextamab application is expected in the second half of this year.
 Moving on to linvoseltamab. As Len noted, this bispecific continues to demonstrate a potentially best-in-class profile in late-line myeloma in terms of efficacy, safety, dosing and hospitalization burden. In an oral presentation at the recent AACR medical meeting, we presented results of an 11-month median follow-up of 117 patients. A 71% objective response rate with 46% of patients achieving a complete response or better. We are planning to present updated 14-month follow-up results at the upcoming EHA meeting in which we anticipate observing a further deepening of responses. Regarding the ongoing FDA review, we believe the confirmatory study will be sufficiently enrolled to support approval. We're also evaluating linvoseltamab in earlier stages of myeloma and in precursor conditions such as smoldering myeloma and monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance or MGUS.
 Next, to bispecifics for solid tumors. Our cost inventory bispecific antibodies are being tested in numerous studies, including as monotherapies as well as in combination with CD3 bispecifics and with libtayo. Our EGFR by CD28 bispecific in combination with libtayo, we are planning to present updated dose escalation results in an oral presentation at ASCO, most notably, in microsatellite stable colorectal cancer, a tumor historically unresponsive to immunotherapy. EGFR by CD28 in combination with libtayo demonstrated antitumor activity. 
 Regarding safety, to date, we have not observed severe immune-related adverse events with this agent at our recommended Phase II dose. Based on these data, we are enrolling dose expansion cohorts testing our EGFRxCD28 costim bispecific plus libtayo in various cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer with or without EGF receptor mutations. Microsatellite stable colorectal cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and others. 
 On to our PSMA by CD28 costimulatory bispecific, which is already demonstrating promising activity in prostate cancer in combination with libtayo. We will soon initiate combination treatment of our PSMA by CD28 costim bispecific with our PSMA by CD3 bispecific, which based on preclinical studies, may maintain efficacy but with better tolerability. 
 We're also evaluating our MUC16xCD28 costimulatory bispecific with ubamatamab, or MUC16xCD3 bispecific as well as with libtayo, or CD3xCD28 (sic) [ BCMAxCD3 ] costim with linvoseltamab for myeloma and our CD22xCD28 costim with odronextamab for lymphoma. Moving on to our classical hematology pipeline. Our C5 approach involves a first-in-class combination of an sRNA with an antibody for a more complete target blockade in our initial clinical data supports potential best-in-class efficacy in paroxysmal and external hemoglobinuria or PNH. 
 Results from the preliminary cohort of the PNH Phase III study will be presented at the EHA conference in June with additional results expected later this year. In addition to PNH and myasthenia gravis, which are already enrolling their respective pivotal trials, we are planning on extending the systemic combination approach to geographic atrophy in dry AMD with the first pivotal study in GA expected to get underway this year. 
 We are also anticipating proof-of-concept data later this year for our 2 complementary Factor XI antibodies in the setting of prevention of venous thromboembolism after knee replacement surgery. Depending on these data, 1 or both of these antibodies could remain on a rapid path to registrational studies, which could begin by late 2024 or early 2025. We -- our first-in-class antibody TMPRSS6, a genetically validated target for iron overload diseases such as beta thalassemia, is also making progress. This antibody has potential to meaningfully reduce toxic organ iron in patients whom iron chelation is inadequate or intolerable. 
 Updated proof of mechanism data in healthy volunteers will be presented at the upcoming EHA conference. These results demonstrated deep sustained reductions in serum iron and robust induction of the liver hormone hepcidin, supporting the potential to release iron from organs. We are on track to start a Phase II proof-of-concept study in beta-thalassemia patients in the second half of the year. 
 Moving to obesity. Our most advanced approach is designed to address potential negative consequences of widespread use of GLP GIP receptor agonist. As it has been widely reported, the profound weight loss caused by these agents, unfortunately, can also result in substantial loss of muscle, which is particularly concerning in older, obese patients. Our antibodies to myostatin-related pathways may prevent this muscle loss. Indeed, our data in obese nonhuman primates show that combining semaglutide with trevogrumab, or an antibiotic targeting myostatin with or without [ pertuzumab ], our antibody targeting active NA, or myostatin 2, demonstrated a comparable reduction in body weight at week 20 relative to semaglutide monotherapy, but with improved quality of weight loss resulting in more fat loss while preserving or even increasing lean mass. 
 Part A of our proof-of-concept study in healthy volunteers intended to demonstrate safety of a higher dose of trevogrumab, has completed enrollment note that over 400 subjects, including healthy volunteers in sarcopenic patients have been dosed with trevogrumab throughout its clinical development with no meaningful safety or tolerability concerns observed to date. Part B of the study, which will evaluate muscle preservation antibodies in combination with semaglutide in obese participants remains on track to start enrolling mid-year assuming a reasonable pace of enrollment, we expect to report top line results, including changes in body weight, fat mass and muscle mass in second half of 2025. I will conclude with our genetic medicines effort. 
 At the upcoming ASGCT conference, we will present updated data from our DB-OTO gene therapy program for genetic hearing loss. The first patient treated with this therapy, a 10-month old girl who is profoundly deaf at baseline. Now at 24 weeks after treatment had hearing in the normal range and the second treated patient is following a similar trajectory of improvement through earlier stages of follow-up. We are aiming to enroll several more patients this year, potentially enabling regulatory submissions by the end of next year, and we also look forward to bringing additional auditory gene therapy programs to the clinic in the coming years with the potential to address more common forms of monogenic hearing loss. 
 Our collaboration with Intellia on CRISPR gene editing continues to advance. We have begun to enroll patients in the Phase III magnitude study of Intellia 2001 for a lead indication of TTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. The first in vivo CRISPR program clear to enter Phase III studies in the United States. We're also on track to be the first to use CRISPR technology to insert a corrective gene in vivo for a deficiency disease. We have now achieved clearance from both the U.S. and EU authorities for our insertion program for Factor IX, and we have already enrolled initial patients into the leading portion of this program. 
 Moving on to our sRNA collaboration with Alnylam, which has not only demonstrated successful silencing of genes in the liver, but also for the first time for siRNA in the brain. Additionally, we're excited about potentially initiating later this year a potentially pivotal study for our ALN SOD treatment in ALS patients with SOD1 mutations.
 With that overview, I will turn the call over to Mary. 
Marion McCourt: Thanks, George. Our results in the first quarter demonstrate the strong performance of our commercial portfolio and future growth opportunity. We continue to strengthen and expand our leadership positions across our in-line brands, and we are preparing for potential upcoming launches. I'll start with our anti-VEGF franchise and the ongoing launch progress of EYLEA HD. 
 First quarter U.S. net sales grew 63% sequentially to $200 million as real-world experience with efficacy and safety continues to grow EYLEA HD is delivering on its promise of extending the duration between treatments, but the majority of patients achieving this goal. Retina specialists are highly satisfied with EYLEA HD as demonstrated by prescribing across a broad range of patients. To date, most EYLEA HD patients are being switched from existing medicines most notably, EYLEA and faricimab, and we are also seeing an increase in treatment-naive patients.  
 For the quarter, EYLEA HD and EYLEA together secured 45% of the anti-VEGF category share combined U.S. net sales were $1.4 billion, which includes a reduction in wholesaler inventory of approximately $40 million. This reflects the sequential drawdown of EYLEA inventory that was partially offset by a modest increase in EYLEA HD inventory ahead of the permanent J-code on April 1. Since launch, our team has made significant progress to enhance reimbursement and market access for EYLEA HD. The permanent J-Code has increased prescribers reimbursement confidence, reflected by increased use among existing customers as well as a step-up in new customers ordering for the first time. We're very encouraged by EYLEA HD uptake despite a different payer market today compared to when EYLEA was launched more than a decade ago.
 For example, while more than 80% of medical benefit lives are now covered for EYLEA HD increases in utilization management or step edits are impacting all branded products. We are also highly focused on educating patients about the potential for EYLEA HD to deliver best in category vision and safety benefits with fewer injections. In mid-March, we began our direct-to-consumer TV campaign designed to raise brand awareness among treatment experienced and treatment-naive patients. Since initiating the DTC campaign, retina specialists have reported a significant increase in patients actively asking about and being prescribed EYLEA HD. In summary, the EYLEA HD launch outperformed expectations, and we are on track to establish EYLEA HD as the new standard of care for retinal disease.  
 Turning now to Dupixent. From our first quarter global net sales grew 25% on a constant currency basis to $3.1 billion. In the U.S., net sales grew 17% to $2.2 billion, driven by continued robust demand and the impact of customary first quarter seasonality dynamics, including annual resets of insurance plans. Dupixent is the clear leader in new-to-brand prescription share across all 5 FDA-approved indications and leads in total biologic prescriptions in 4 of its approved indications. 
 More than 850,000 patients are currently on therapy worldwide and 3 Dupixent indications have achieved blockbuster status, atopic dermatitis, asthma and nasal polyps. Across all 3 of these indications, Dupixent is competitively differentiated based on its clinical profile, depth of clinical experience and potential to be prescribed to very young patients as young as 6 months in the case of atopic dermatitis. 
 We continue to see great progress with our recent launches in EoE, Dupixent's GI indication [indiscernible] and dermatology. Patient initiations across both indications continue to reach all-time highs and in late January, Dupixent was approved in pediatric EOE, the brand's fourth pediatric indication. Early launch indicators are positive as Dupixent is transforming the standard of care for these children aged 1 to 11 as it has for adults and adolescents with EoE. In addition to its approved indications, there's great potential for Dupixent in an increasing list of additional type 2 diseases, including COPD. If approved, Dupixent will achieve 2 important first, the first biologic medicine for COPD and also the first new treatment in more than a decade for this devastating disease.  
 In the U.S., approximately 300,000 patients with uncontrolled COPD show evidence of type 2 inflammation. If approved, we will rapidly --  we work to rapidly establish the unique clinical benefits of Dupixent, activate physician adoption, motivate patients to seek treatment and also advance access and affordability. We are confident that COPD will drive meaningful growth for Dupixent, if approved in this indication and see an additional opportunity to address patient unmet need with itepekimab our investigational IL-33 antibody designed to help COPD patients who are former smokers. With significant runway for growth in existing and potential new indications, we are confident in Dupixent's ongoing growth trajectory. 
 And finally, to libtayo. In the first quarter, global net sales were $264 million, up 44% on a constant currency basis from the prior year, driven by our dual focus in skin and lung cancers. In non-melanoma skin cancer, libtayo continues to lead the immunotherapy category in CSCC and BCC with opportunity for continued market growth. In lung cancer, we are making steady progress in capturing category share in both monotherapy and chemotherapy combination patients. Our oncology team is also preparing for the upcoming August 22 linvoseltamab, PDUFA date recently to reinforces that linvoseltamab has the potential to be best-in-class for late-stage myeloma patients, and we look forward to its potential launch.  
 In summary, our commercial team continues to bring important medicines to patients across an expanding range of diseases. We are focused on differentiating our medicines to increase category share and drive market growth, potential upcoming launches across our portfolio, provide the opportunity to extend the benefits of our medicines to even more patients. And with that, I'll pass the call to Chris. 
Christopher Fenimore: My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Regeneron delivered solid financial results in the first quarter of 2024. Excluding contributions from our COVID antibodies, total revenues increased 7% year-over-year to $3.1 billion, primarily driven by continued sales growth and margin expansion from Dupixent and strong global sales growth from libtayo. First quarter diluted net income per share was $9.55 due to higher Dupixent volumes, we expect the amount of these reimbursements to be comparable to 2023. 
 The Sanofi development balance was approximately $2.2 billion at the end of  the first quarter. We anticipate this balance will be fully reimbursed by  the end  of 2026, which we expect will result in a significant step-up in our Sanofi collaboration  profits thereafter. 
 Before moving to expenses, I will mention that despite lower volumes, U.S. Praluent sales  in the first quarter reflected a gross to net adjustment related to a true-up of rebates due to  an adverse change in payer coverage. We now expect U.S. net sales of Praluent to be modestly higher in 2024 as compared to 2023, primarily due to this adjustment. Now to our operating expenses. First quarter R&D expense grew 17% year-over-year to $1.1 billion, reflecting continued investment in our robust pipeline. SG&A grew 13% from the prior year to $544 million in the first quarter, driven by investment to support the launch of EYLEA HD, including direct-to-consumer promotion as well as higher headcount and related costs, primarily for our ongoing international commercial expansion. First quarter gross margin on net product sales was approximately 89%, which was impacted by ongoing start-up costs for our fill/finish manufacturing facility. 
 First quarter COCM was $193 million, reflecting a decline of 22% compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower Dupixent drug substance manufacturing costs. Now to cash flow and the balance sheet. Regeneron generated $1.4 billion in free cash flow in the first quarter and ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities less debt of approximately $14.8 billion. We repurchased approximately $300 million of our shares in the first quarter and had approximately $1.2 billion available for repurchases under our February 2023 authorization at the end of the first quarter. This morning, we also announced a new $3 billion share repurchase program, which provides us with additional flexibility to continue returning capital to shareholders over time, and we remain buyers of our shares. 
 Finally, we have made some minor changes to our full year 2024 financial guidance. A complete summary of our latest full year guidance is available in our press release issued earlier this morning. We now expect 2024 R&D expense to be in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion. The change in R&D guidance is solely due to the inclusion of operating expenses associated with the acquisition of 2seventy bio development programs, which closed on April 1. In summary, Regeneron performed well in the first quarter and is positioned to continue to deliver strong results in 2024 and beyond. With that, I'll pass the call back to Ryan. 
Ryan Crowe: Thank you, Chris. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call for Q&A to ensure we are able to address as many questions as possible, we will answer one question from each caller before moving to the next. Josh, can we please go to the first question? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Colin Bristow with UBS. 
Colin Bristow: Congrats on the quarter. A question for George. George, there's a lot of interest, obviously, in your muscle sparing obesity program. I was wondering if you could speak to how you think this will differentiate versus competitor muscle-sparing programs and then within that, what will you be specifically paying attention to whenever Len decides to disclose the bimagrumab Phase II data? 
George Yancopoulos: Thanks. Great question. As when you block with other approaches like bimagrumab, you're blocking over a dozen members of the so-called BMP, GDF family and so forth. And that raises the concern because only a couple of those are actually involved in muscle preservation that you may end up doing more harm than good. What we have identified over the years is we identified 2 members of this very large family of almost 20 factors, which 2 are specifically involved in muscle preservation and we created antibodies to each of these 2 individually. 
 And we're testing these antibodies individually as well as together. And obviously, in this field of obesity, safety matters almost as much as efficacy here. So we believe we have the best program that is testing specifically just the specific members of this very large family that are involved in muscle preservation where they're blocking either one or both together is going to benefit the quality of the weight loss in terms of preserving muscle and maybe even causing more fat loss while creating hopefully the best possible safety profile.
 So we think that's a big difference between our program and other programs that are blocking as I said, almost 20 different members that are involved in all sorts of things from growth factors for the bone marrow for red blood cells, controlling all sorts of things from clotting to liver function and other things and so anyway, that's the major difference in our program. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. 
Evan Seigerman: Kind of a follow-up to Colin. When you think about endpoints in muscle sparing kind of approaches in obesity, what do you think FDA would accept. Right now, they're not really accepting dexa scans, they're just looking at weight loss. Do you think that they would evolve to look at quality of weight loss as a key endpoint asset space evolves? 
George Yancopoulos: Well, just to remind you, if you look at our paper where we did the nonhuman primate studies and so forth, is the first thing we're going to be looking for is there is the very real possibility of increased weight loss. And that might be the simplest regulatory endpoint of all. After that, if we don't see that, but we see better quality of weight loss, that could be manifested in a variety of ways, though we, of course, recognize that those would perhaps create more complicated ways of being regulated. So obviously, if you increase the fat loss while preserving muscle you should have dramatic benefits in metabolic parameters, which are often used in the field, particularly in people with diabetes and so forth as well as ultimately in terms of function by having maintenance of function as opposed to losing function and maintaining those sort of functional endpoints. 
 So the simplest path might be simply weight loss one could then move into metabolic parameters or muscle actual functional outcome measures. But to us, the most important thing in the Phase II study is to really just demonstrate the quality of the weight loss in terms of fat versus muscle because ultimately, if you're preserving muscle and increasing the fat loss, it has to be much better for patients, and it may avoid a lot of catastrophic long-term effects of widespread GLP-1 use and so if we see that, we think that we have a real opportunity to turn that into real widespread benefit for patients using this class of drugs. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Christopher Raymond with Piper Sandler. 
Christopher Raymond: I have a question on the EYLEA franchise. I just noticed that McKesson bought one of the largest GPOs, U.S. retina earlier this year and there's actually been -- as you guys know, a relatively long march of retina practices being rolled up by various private equity firms over the last few years. So I know this is something that's happening across a number of therapeutic specialty areas, but maybe just talk about how you see this phenomenon impacting the practice of ophthalmology in the U.S. and any changes to your go-to-market strategy? And I guess related, the inventory drawdown, we didn't see that happen last year. Was there any effect from maybe some of these changes in your customer base that sort of drove that? 
Marion McCourt: Sure. So let me take the inventory item first, and then I'll come back to the overall marketplace. But this was in aggregate. As I mentioned, in the quarter, we saw a reduction in wholesaler inventory broadly of about $40 million. So that reflects market-wide. But that was a combination of 2 elements. It was a sequential drawdown of EYLEA inventory that was partially offset by a modest increase in EYLEA HD inventory ahead of the permanent J-Code on April 1. And then I would share on the overall market in all the categories where we participate, we're always very conscious of the segmentation of the market, targeting the market, what's occurring in terms of customer base and certainly, our strategies and our approach to the marketplace is reflective of that. And the range of customers we have, as you point out, in retina and how that market has evolved over time. And I think our commercialization approach has been very effective in addressing that market evolution. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. 
Salveen Richter: With regard to the COPD program here, it doesn't seem like this is an approvability question. So could you just speak to whether restrictions to specific subpopulations could be possible, albeit noting that you had a subpopulation analysis that was consistent with the broader data. 
Leonard Schleifer: Yes, Salveen, thanks for the question. You're right. From our perspective, we think the data broadly supports the entire BLA and as well as all these analyses, the approval of the drug in eosinophilic COPD. As you might imagine, the FDA went anticipating or looking at a new class of biologics is very interested in checking it up and down and down and up and making sure that there's no subpopulation of the study that might be driving the data. So they might -- if one saw that, one might think about labeling it differently, but none of that has occurred. We've looked at all these analyses. We're going to submit them a way ahead of the schedule that they've asked for, and all of the analyses show a consistent and clinically meaningful reduction in the COPD exacerbations across all of these subgroups that have been asked for. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Tyler Van Buren with TD Cowen. 
Tyler Van Buren: For this initial severe food allergy study and the results by year-end, could you elaborate on exactly what will be reported and what you would hope to see to have early clinical proof of concept and how long do you anticipate that these patients would stay on Dupixent in order to maintain low or no IgE levels? 
George Yancopoulos: These are great questions. We hope from the first few patients if the results are as dramatic as they are in the preclinical studies that we'll be seeing meaningful indicators that we are really reversing severe food allergy. Of course, the first thing and the most important biomarker, as I said, is this evil immunoglobulin IgE, which you can both measure, but they are also routinely tested using these skin prick tests, which are how people are actually evaluated for allergies. 
 So we expect, first of all, to be seeing that happening in the study in obvious ways. And then we can follow that up, and it is allowed in the study if we see dramatic responses in these markers of the actual allergy-causing immunoglobulin to then go on and do actual food challenges and so forth in the patients. So it all depends on how obvious the reductions in this [ IgE are ] and if they are really dramatic, we can go on and do additional allergen-challenged tests. But we hope if the humans behave like the nonhuman primate that we might be seeing something dramatic in the initial patients. 
Ryan Crowe: George, can you comment? I think they also want to know how long you have to stay on IgG... 
George Yancopoulos: Yes. The interesting thing is the animal study suggests that the antibodies against the allergens come back as  IgG, G for good antibodies. The whole point of -- if you guys are familiar with so-called immunotherapy or desensitization therapy, all of those therapies, what they're trying to do is induce production of IgG to overwhelm the IgE. That's a much harder thing to do because they're not really getting rid of the Ig. They just have to overwhelm with a lot more IgG. In the animal studies, it suggests that we get rid of the Ig and we replace it with IgG. We don't know, obviously, in the humans, it may be possible that short-term treatment, relatively short-term treatment, may allow patients who have replaced their IgE with IgG, and they will have long-term protection. 
 On the other hand, we may see that to prevent these patients from making Ig and more IgGs in the future that they may have to stay on the Dupixent for substantial long periods of time. The good news about that as we all know and as was highlighted in Marion's comments, Dupixent compared to most other immunomodulatory agents, it's not immunosuppressive. It actually is corrective for the immune system. And as indicated by its labeling to very, very young patients, it's a very, very relatively safe immunomodulator and biologic. And since most people who have severe allergies also have a lot of other concomitant atopic diseases. 
 It may be that it is best for these patients to keep their abnormal atopy or abnormal type 2 inflammation under control. So short answer is it's -- there's a possibility it could be relatively short term, but there's also a possibility at least for some or the majority of patients, it could be relatively long term. But the good news is that they may actually have a long-term benefit for the patients because these patients are almost by definition, what you call atopic patients who might need control of their type 2 excess inflammation. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. 
Terence Flynn: Just had one on your LAG-3 program. Obviously, you guys are aware that Bristol discussed seeing a signal in a subset of lung cancer that benefits from a combination of PD-1 and LAG-3. So I would just love your latest thoughts on how to think about that in the context of both your program and then what you're hoping to see with this Phase II data later this year? 
George Yancopoulos: Right. That's a great question. Obviously, the thing that gets us excited about our program compare to the field is that we've seen levels of activity that haven't been seen in the other LAG-3 programs, particularly in melanoma. If that's true in melanoma, there would be hope that this would be seen broadly in other settings and indications. We are certainly excited to see the follow-up details on the BMS story with potential activity in a specific subpopulation that will certainly help point us in our own studies to see what we're seeing within that subpopulation that they are talking about as well as more broadly. But of course, the hope, as I said, is if it is indeed more active in one setting such as melanoma, the hope is it will be broadly more active across other cancer settings as well. So we are excited to see follow-up on their data. We're excited to see follow-up on our data, both in melanoma and in our lung studies. 
Operator: Next question comes from William Pickering with Bernstein. 
William Pickering: I had a follow-up on the food allergy program. Could you comment on the dose of linvoseltamab that you'll be testing as compared to the myeloma setting? How -- what gives you confidence in the safety profile and if a patient misses a Dupixent dose, would they then need to start over again with linvo? 
George Yancopoulos: Yes, these are all great questions. What we've already actually shown based on a variety of studies that we've done is that normal nonmalignant noncancerous plasma cells, the cells that are the immunoglobulin factory cells are the normal versions of the cells are much more susceptible to the bispecific than our malignant myeloma cells. So in discussions and communications with the FDA, we're actually starting at much lower doses than the doses that are used in the myeloma programs, though there is an intrapatient dose escalation process. So we're literally watching -- we're starting with low doses and we're going up in the doses until we actually hopefully see elimination of the IgE. That said, in terms of the safety, I'd just remind you that the much higher myeloma doses, we came up as Len briefly summarized in this program. 
 We believe that we have a differentiated program in terms of not only efficacy and hospitalization burden and so forth, but also in safety. We have less than 1% Grade 3 events at those high doses in the much sicker myeloma patients. So we hope and we expect that with lower doses in a much healthier population, that this will be a hopefully pretty well tolerated approach. And a much shorter, yes. We think that ultimately, we make it by with a single short course or a very short course of treatment. In terms of whether if somebody takes a holiday, whether one has to then start all over again with the elimination of the IgE cells, we think probably not because it takes a long time to get to those levels of IgE. 
 So just delaying for a short period of time, we may not bounce back to those levels. As I said, you may have converted all of those cells to IgG or good sales by that point anyway. But of course, we have to be doing the studies, and we have to be looking at these patients in the clinic to really understand. When I -- I should mention that the Grade 3 events that I was talking about are reflected by cytokine release syndrome. A lot of that is also thought to be -- due to the load of the cancer cells. And obviously, these normal patients have much less of a load here. So it's just another reason to expect, hopefully, better safety. We're going to be going with lower doses, more gentle treatment, and they have much less load in there, so you would expect much less reason to be seeing things like cytokine release syndrome. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Carter Gould with Barclays. 
Carter L. Gould: I wanted to ask another follow-up sort of bispecifics in autoimmune, but I want to go down a little bit of a different path acknowledging the BCMA in Dupi effort. But we've seen sort of CAR-T efforts and ADC approaches sort of come to the rise in lupus and other autoimmune disorders and naturally, people have then started talking about T cell engagers. This seems like a natural place where Regeneron could leverage its bispecific capabilities, expertise. Are there efforts underway internally on this front? Has Regeneron looked at ways to leverage in that expertise? 
George Yancopoulos: That's a phenomenal question. And first of all, let me remind you that with our long-term collaboration and recent acquisition of 2seventy. 2seventy had exactly the sort of CAR-T programs that you're referring to in lupus and other autoimmune settings, which we are now obviously pursuing together with them but that is one of the reasons why we were excited about turning the collaboration into a situation where we brought all the expertise and the scientists and leadership from 2seventy in-house because we're doing exactly what you suggested. We're hoping to actually literally look in side-by-side studies, how CAR-T approaches in these settings of autoimmune, severe autoimmune disease like lupus and so forth, compare directly head-to-head to our bispecifics. And as you are sort of suggesting, you would think that there would be really little reason to think that the CAR-T solutions would be preferable in this setting, both in terms of off-the-shelf mess and the ability to eliminate the normal cells.
 As I said, it's usually a lot easier to get rid of normal cells than it is malignant cells. So whatever advantages you might have in certain settings of CAR-Ts you would think in the normal disease setting or at least normal cells in autoimmune disease settings that bispecifics might be just as good, much more convenient and much safer. So together with now our internal Regeneron cell medicines group that has involved a lot of the expertise and leadership of 2seventy, we're exploring that exact question. 
 I should also say that as clearly been announced by the company and is available in our public disclosures, we have already initiated separately a variety of studies looking at our bispecifics to decrease autoantibodies and autoimmune diseases in other settings as well. So we were already looking at this, but now we're looking at these in direct comparison to our CAR-T approaches with our now internal Regeneron cell medicines efforts. 
Operator: Next question comes from Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. 
Brian Abrahams: Congrats on all the progress. I know docs are really excited for Dupi and COPD, but it is a new space for biologics. So I'm curious, the amount of education you think is going to be required and how this might affect the initial uptake trajectory. And then how you're thinking the introduction of other biologics, which have also been showing promise might impact the overall long-term market here in Dupi's positioning? 
Marion McCourt: So certainly, we look forward to the potential launch of Dupixent in COPD. There's such unmet need and such opportunity to help those patients with an eosinophilic COPD. Our team, as you know, is very experienced with launches in Dupixent. So work is very much underway at Regeneron and also with, obviously, under our collaboration with Sanofi to make sure that we apply the best practices and launch of new indications. 
 I will share that many of these physicians have already experienced use of Dupixent with tremendous results. We've made great progress, as you know, in asthma leading in new scripts and certainly making tremendous overall performance strides. But we will be very thoughtful on how best to reach physicians, how to make sure that we're aligned with reimbursement and affordability for patients, educating in the way we've come to understand is best for Dupixent in the various markets and indications that we've entered. So we look forward to this opportunity. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. 
Mohit Bansal: I have a question on itepekimab so in our conversation and literature search, it suggests that there may be a potential for disease modification with some kind of remodeling at this mechanism. Just wanted to see if you think that is possible? And what markets would you be looking forward to in the Phase III trial beyond exacerbation when the data come. 
George Yancopoulos: Well, there's always the possibility of disease modification. We actually believe, for example, Dupixent in asthma may be doing exactly that sort of benefit. One of the best ways of actually looking at that is looking at overall loss of lung function over time because, as you know, in these lung diseases as Marion said, in both asthma and COPD, these are diseases of the lungs followed largely by pulmonologists, the same sort of doctors and it is well known that in both of these diseases over time, patients start permanently losing lung capacity and lung function. We are and have been and have early data suggesting that Dupixent may prefer that in asthma, and we'll certainly be looking at those sorts of things for not only Dupixent but itepekimab in the COPD patients in terms of modifying disease and long-term preservation and prevention of this otherwise unstoppable lung function loss. 
Operator: And our last question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. 
Unknown Analyst: This is Taylor on for Chris Schott. So we were wondering, would you elaborate a little bit more about how you're thinking about the linvoseltamab launch as we approach the August PDUFA and then thinking about the field more broadly in myeloma, how are you thinking about MRD negativity as a surrogate and thoughts on how you might be able to move into earlier lines in myeloma faster? 
Leonard Schleifer: Mary can take the question on the launch and everything. I mean, obviously, the MRD negativity as endorsed by that panel gives an opportunity to get these kinds of drugs to patients earlier in a variety of settings. So we are looking forward to applying that approach in our future studies as we move towards earlier in different lines of therapy. Marion on the launch? 
Marion McCourt: Sure. So we're certainly preparing for the potential launch with the August 22 PDUFA date. And we're really excited because as I've mentioned before, the recent data reinforces linvoseltamab as potentially a best-in-class product for late-stage myeloma patients. So it's a wonderful opportunity to extend our oncology franchise in the new disease area. 
Ryan Crowe: All right. Thanks, Len and Marion, and thanks to everyone who dialed in for your interest in Regeneron. We apologize to those remaining in the queue that we did not have a chance to hear from. As always, the IR team here at Regeneron is available to answer any remaining questions that you may have. Thank you once again, and have a great day. 
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-02 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Ryan Crowe, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.
Ryan Crowe: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening to everyone listening around the world. Thank you for your interest in Regeneron, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. An archive and transcript of this call will be available on the Regeneron Investor Relations website shortly after the call ends. Joining me today are Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Co-Chair, Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; Dr. George Yancopoulos, Co-Chair, Co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer; Marion McCourt, Executive Vice President and Head of Commercial; Bob Landry, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Chris Fenimore, Senior Vice-President and Controller. As many of you already know. Bob will retire from Regeneron, after our Form 10-K as filed next week, and Chris has been appointed to become Regeneron's next CFO upon Bob's retirement. After our prepared remarks the remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate today's call will last approximately 60 minutes. I'd like to remind you that remarks made on today's call may include forward-looking statements about Regeneron. Such statements may include, but are not limited to, those related to Regeneron and its products and business, financial forecast and guidance, development programs and related anticipated milestones, collaborations, finances, regulatory matters, payer coverage and reimbursement issues, intellectual property, pending litigation and other proceedings and competition. Each forward-looking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected in that statement. A more complete description of these and other material risks can be found in Regeneron's filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which we expect to file with the SEC on Monday, February 5. Regeneron does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. In addition, please note that GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on today's call. Information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP is available in our quarterly earnings results press release and our corporate presentation, both of which can be accessed on the Regeneron Investor Relations website. Once our call ends, Bob, Chris and the IR team will be available to answer any further questions. With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer. Len?
Leonard Schleifer: Thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone joining today's call. Fourth quarter 2023 capped another strong year for Regeneron and Bob will walk you through our financial results. For my remarks today, I'd like to briefly look back at 2023 and then discuss what's to come in the year ahead. 2023 was another remarkable year for Regeneron highlighted by several significant achievements that better position the company to deliver sustainable growth and long-term shareholder value. At the start of the year, we identified five key strategic imperatives: First, obtaining FDA approval and successfully launching EYLEA HD. We did encounter a minor delay when we received a complete response letter in late June due to an issue at a third-party filler, but this was quickly remedied and EYLEA HD was granted approval in mid-August. With what we believe to be a best-in-class potential clinical profile, EYLEA HD is poised to become the new standard-of-care for patients with wet age-related macular degeneration and diabetic eye diseases. The launch is off to a great start, which Marion will discuss in a few minutes. Second, we had to defend our intellectual property related to EYLEA. We presented our best case and prevailed in the District Court, which found that one of EYLEA's formulation patents was both valid and infringed by a biosimilar aflibercept manufacturer. This favorable decision may have broad implications and could result in a delay to biosimilar aflibercept launches. Third, we and our collaborator, Sanofi, needed to continue driving Dupixent growth not only by further penetrating previously approved indications, but also reaching even more patients suffering from other diseases driven by type 2 inflammation. In 2023, we did both. Dupixent global net product sales grew by 34% on a constant currency basis to $11.6 billion. Dupixent lead in new to brand prescription share in the United States across all five of its approved indications. We also had a major breakthrough in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD. In March, we reported strong data from the BOREAS study, which enrolled COPD patients with uncontrolled moderate to severe disease and evidence of type 2 inflammation. The FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation during the summer, but required additional evidence of efficacy to support a regulatory filing. Based on this feedback, we and Sanofi decided to conduct an interim analysis on the replicate noticed study, which read out similarly compelling results enabling our December sBLA submission and a potential U.S. launch for this indication as early as mid-2024. Fourth, we continued making progress toward our long-term goal of becoming a global leader in oncology. 2023 was highlighted by our regulatory submissions for linvoseltamab, our BCMA by CD3 bispecific in myeloma and odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific in lymphoma, while continuing to advance other opportunities in solid tumors. And finally, we needed to advance our early-stage pipeline and over the course of 2023, we presented intriguing proof of mechanism or proof of concept data across hematology and genetic medicines as well, as well as other areas including obesity with data from non-human primates. Many of these early programs which George will run through in a few minutes represent first or best-in-class opportunities that we believe can drive long-term growth for Regeneron. Our accomplishments in 2023 have put us in a position of strength entering 2024. For this year, one of our strategic imperatives is to continue driving commercial execution, especially the ongoing launch of EYLEA HD with the goal of accelerating the pace of conversion from other anti-VEGF agents. Another important launch milestone was achieved last month when the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services assigned a permanent J-code for EYLEA HD that will go into effect on April 1, 2024, at which point a potential reimbursement concern for physicians will be removed. We also need to continue to drive Dupixent growth and its currently improved indications as well as from the potential FDA approval and launch in COPD with an eosinophilic phenotype. If approved, Dupixent would represent the first meaningful advance in over a decade for the 300,000 patients in the United States suffering from this form of COPD and would be the first-ever biologic approved for COPD. In oncology this year, aside from continuing to build on the success of Libtayo in non-melanoma skin cancers and then in small cell lung cancer, we're excited about the potential launches of odronextamab and linvoseltamab, the latter of which has the potential to be the best-in-class bispecific for myeloma. We also expect to make significant advances across our pipeline in 2024 with key readouts for fianlimab, our LAG-3 antibody in combination with Libtayo in metastatic melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. Libtayo in adjuvant cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and our Factor XI antibodies in thrombosis, which may inform pivotal studies. We also plan to initiate clinical trials in obesity, geographic atrophy, hemophilia B and severe food allergies in addition to expanding early studies of our CD28 costimulatory bispecific programs in solid and hematologic malignancies. In closing, we had a strong 2023 and are poised to deliver in 2024 and beyond. Our pipeline of over 30 clinical programs is delivering important and differentiated innovations. Our commercial team is executing well and we continue to look at ways to efficiently deploy capital to drive shareholder returns over time. Before I hand it over to George, I want to take a moment to thank Bob Landry for his many contributions to Regeneron over his 10-years as our Chief Financial Officer. In addition to helping fortify Regeneron's financial strength and discipline, Bob has been an incredible mentor to many of Regeneron's current and future leaders, helped drive our financial results over the past decade and worked tirelessly to ensure we have the resources needed to help improve the lives of patients around the world. Bob, on behalf of the entire Regeneron family, thank you and we wish you continued good health and happiness. As we first announced back in September upon Bob's retirement next week, Chris Fenimore will become the CFO of Regeneron. We all look forward to working closely with Chris in his new role knowing he brings a similar rigor and depth of financial knowledge that will ensure continuity and collaboration across the organization. With that, I'll now turn the call over to George.
George Yancopoulos: Thanks, Len. That was really impressive overview I have to say. 2023 was another year of first delivered by Regeneron as well as together with our collaborators, all of which have the potential to change the practice of medicine. Starting with inflammation and immunology. As you heard from Len, we are planning yet another launch for Dupixent, this time in eosinophilic COPD, which would represent the sixth disease if this remarkable medicine is approved to treat and the fifth for which it would be first-in-class. Dupixent’s transformative potential in COPD is based on the unprecedented results from our first Phase 3 trial BOREAS, which would then confirm our second Phase 3 trial notice demonstrating that Dupixent treated patients had a 34% reduction in the annualized rate of moderate to severe COPD exacerbations [Technical Issues] IL-33 blocking antibody. The pivotal AERIFY-1 and 2 studies passed an interim futility analysis last year. The studies are now on track to complete enrollment in 2024 with an anticipated readout in 2025. If the Phase 3 results from these studies even approach the Phase 2 data reported in former smokers where a 42% reduction in annualized exacerbation rate was observed, itepekimab has the potential to further transform the treatment paradigm for COPD. Later this year, we are planning on testing an innovative new treatment approach for severe food allergies using a combination of transient BCMAxCD3 bispecific intervention in patients receiving Dupixent therapy. As many of you know, allergic responses are driven by pathologically high levels of Immunoglobulin E or IgE. This is why many say the E in IgE stands for evil. About 40-years ago, it was discovered that interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 were the switch factors required for switching to IgE production. Based on exciting preclinical data including in non-human primates as well as human data, our innovative approach has the potential to reverse severe allergies by first eliminating the long lived plasma cells that serve as an IgE reservoir with the BCMAxCD3 followed by blocking of de novo immunoglobulin class switching to IgE with Dupixent. We are looking forward to starting a small proof-of-concept study, which will inform next steps for this program. We believe this approach has the potential to benefit the millions of people suffering from severe allergies, who are at constant risk. As tragically highlighted just last week by the widely reported death of yet another young person unknowingly exposed to food a allergen. Moving to Oncology. Libtayo is the leading PD-1 antibody for non-melanoma skin cancers, including metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma or CSCC and basal cell carcinoma. We are looking forward to potentially expanding the currently approved CSCC indication to include adjuvant CSCC and we expect results from potentially pivotal interim analysis in this setting in the second-half of the year. Regarding Libtayo combinations, our most advanced is the combination with a LAG-3 antibody fianlimab. As a reminder, our early clinical data in three separate first line metastatic melanoma cohorts demonstrated potential for best-in-class efficacy when compared cross trial with the approved anti-LAG-3 PD-1 combination product, highlighted by objective response rates greater than 60% and estimated median progression-free survival of longer than 15 months. These early clinical data suggested that the Libtayo fianlimab combination maybe one of the most exciting examples of a checkpoint inhibitor combination with clinically meaningful benefit and with the safety profile that is similar to that seen with anti PD-1 monotherapy. We are expecting a potentially pivotal initial readout from our first line metastatic melanoma trial by the end of this year. We also anticipate Phase 2 data in non-small cell lung cancer in late 2024. Onto by specifics, starting with solid tumors. In the dose escalation trial of our EGFR by CD28 costimulatory bispecific combined with Libtayo, we have observed promising activity in microsatellite stable colorectal cancer with higher doses of the costim. In terms of safety, so far, we have not seen an increase in immune related adverse events with this costim. Based on these encouraging early data, which will be presented at a scientific forum later this year, we will be initiating expansion cohorts across several solid tumors in the first-half of the year. In 2024, we are also planning to provide updates for our MUC16xCD3 and MUC16xCD28 programs in advanced ovarian cancer. Next, a bispecific for hematology oncology. For linvoseltamab, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific for multiple myeloma, FDA acceptance of our BLA submission is expected later this month and the EMA recently accepted our MAA submission. These submissions were supported by potentially best-in-class profile in late line myeloma in terms of efficacy, safety, dosing, as well as convenience. The confirmatory Phase 3 study, as well as studies in earlier stages of myeloma and pre-malignant disease are enrolling or will soon begin enrolling patients. For odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, the FDA decision for our BLA is expected by its March 31 PDUFA date and the new decision is expected in the second half of the year. In terms of additional recent news for our oncology and immunology pipeline, this week, we announced the formation of Regeneron Cell Medicines unit and that we are acquiring full development and commercialization rights for 2Seventy Bio's pipeline of investigational immune cell therapies. We have worked with 2Seventy since 2018 on many of these programs and are excited about the opportunity to continue advancing our collective efforts. After deal closing, certain 2Seventy employees will join Regeneron Cell Medicines and continue to work on addressing cancer and other serious diseases in novel ways including by combining Regeneron's antibody capabilities with CAR-T therapies. Moving from immunology and oncology to obesity and metabolic diseases. Despite all the enthusiasm surrounding GLP-1 agonist for obesity, it has been increasingly recognized that the profound weight loss is accompanied by substantial muscle loss accounting for up to as much as 40% of the weight loss. This potentially irretrievable muscle loss can be catastrophic for patients and may even lead to major public health concerns in the future. We have previously shown that our antibodies targeting myostatin in Activin A have the potential to preserve and grow muscle in human trials. Based on these data as well as additional data in obese non-human primates, we believe that inhibiting these pathways on top of GLP-1 receptor agonism has the potential to achieve comparable overall reductions in body weight, but with improved quality of weight loss resulting in more fat loss, while preserving or actually increasing muscle mass. In mid-2024, we plan to start our first clinical trial to evaluate the combination of our muscle preservation antibodies in combination with semaglutide. Also in 2024, we are anticipating proof-of-concept data for our Factor XI antibodies in the setting of prevention of venous thromboembolism after knee replacement surgery. Based on preclinical and healthy volunteer data, our antibody approach demonstrated more complete Factor XI blockade, compared to competing approaches in development for coagulation disorders and the program is on rapid path to a registrational trial starting late this year or early next year. We will now conclude with our efforts in genetic medicines. Our siRNA collaboration with Alnylam has demonstrated successful silencing of genes in the liver and for the first time for siRNA in the brain. Proof of principle was achieved for and ALN-APP last year and we are anticipating additional data from that program this year, including from patients who have received multiple doses. Based on this success, we are looking forward to new siRNA programs targeting CNS diseases entering the clinic this year such as ALN-SOD for ALS patients with SOD1 mutations. Our collaboration with Intellia on CRISPR gene editing continues to advance, where we together produced the first example of CRISPR-based gene editing of a pathological gene in human beings. This initial program for our lead indication of TTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy is now in the first in-vivo CRISPR program clear to enter Phase 3 studies in the United States. Together with Intellia, we also hope to be the first to use CRISPR technology to insert a corrective gene for deficiency disease. We recently achieved IND clearance for our CRISPR-based gene insertion programs for Factor IX and initiated the leading portion of the clinical trial to evaluate it as a potential cure for hemophilia B. Moving to genetic hearing loss, we were the first U.S.-based company to announce hearing restoration in a young child suffering from genetic hearing loss after treatment with our novel gene therapy approach. We're excited by these early results for this ultra-rare disease and look forward to advancing to the clinic additional programs to potentially address more common forms of monogenic hearing loss. These data represent validation of our viral-based gene therapy program, in this case, locally delivered to the cells of the inner ear. Beyond these efforts, we have made significant investments in leveraging our monoclonal and bispecific antibody expertise to use these agents to systematically deliver virally based genetic based payloads directly to specific tissues in the body non-amenable to local delivery, such as to muscle and the central nervous system. Based on encouraging preclinical data, we will be progressing these approaches to the clinic in the coming years. Finally, concluding with another notable first-in-class program involving a combination of an siRNA with an antibody, in this case to block the C5 complement target. Normally, one needs very high levels of infused antibody to achieve sufficient efficacy because of high target levels regarding C5, but our siRNA co-treatment dramatically lowers C5 target burden allowing lower and more convenient antibody dosing. We recently shared encouraging initial data from a Phase 3 study in patients with PNH, which supported our hypothesis that this combination approach could provide better efficacy and control of breakthrough hemolysis with more convenient dosing, and building on these data we continue to enroll our Phase 3 studies in PNH and myasthenia gravis. We are also planning to extend this combination approach to geographic atrophy and dry AMD. While this combination is expected to have manageable systemic toxicities, including elevated risk of infections, we believe that our approach has several potential advantages over recently approved complement inhibiting agents for GA, which are delivered directly into the eye and have resulted in rare but serious cases of retinal vasculitis, sometimes resulting in permanently impaired vision. In conclusion, Regeneron's R&D engine continues to grow and deliver many firsts, including differentiated early, mid, and late-stage opportunities and we're looking forward to additional progress in 2024. Before I turn the call over Marion, I would like to add my thanks and appreciation to Bob for his many years of devoted efforts and leadership, and welcoming and look forward to adding Chris Fenimore to our leadership team. With that, I will turn it over to Marion.
Marion McCourt: Thanks, George. Our business delivered strong results in the fourth quarter and for the year. Over the course of 2023, we successfully launched EYLEA HD, grew Dupixent across approved Type 2 inflammatory diseases, and expanded Libtayo's presence in lung and non-melanoma skin cancers. We look forward to several potential approvals this year in new therapeutic categories, including in COPD with Dupixent and in hematologic oncology using new treatment modalities. I'll start with our Retinal franchise. In January, we announced fourth quarter combined U.S. EYLEA HD and EYLEA net product sales of $1.46 billion. In its first full quarter, EYLEA HD net product sales were $123 million based on growing demand and positive early physician experience. EYLEA HD is already being used across a broad range of patient types, including those switching from EYLEA, other branded agents or Avastin as well as modest but increasing use in treatment-naive patients. In the fourth quarter, EYLEA HD and EYLEA together secured 49% of the anti-VEGF category share despite increasing competition and changing market dynamics. This share gain was driven by the differentiated efficacy and safety profile of our medicine, as well as a short-term disruption in compounded Avastin due to a quality issue in a large supplier that has since been resolved. Since launch, we've made significant progress in securing access and reimbursement for EYLEA HD. More than two-thirds of eligible lives are now covered with the vast majority having first-line or single-step edit access. Medicare fee-for-service, which represents approximately 45% of total category use claims are being paid across 100% of jurisdictions, using a miscellaneous J-code. Looking ahead in 2024, we remind you that the first quarter is typically impacted by payer re-authorizations and that EYLEA HD will remain subject to a miscellaneous J-code. However, in late January, we achieved another important launch milestone with CMS' assignment of a permanent J-code for EYLEA HD, that will go into effect on April 1. This will provide additional reimbursement confidence for those physicians hesitant to prescribe before a permanent J-code based on their negative experiences with other new eye disease medicines. Overall, we are very excited about the future of our Retinal franchise. We continued to see physicians prescribe EYLEA HD in both treatment-experienced and treatment-naive settings as EYLEA HD is increasingly recognized as the new standard of care. Now to Dupixent, fourth quarter 2023 global net sales grew 31% on a constant-currency basis to $3.2 billion and US net sales grew 28% to $2.5 billion with more than 800,000 patients on therapy worldwide, Dupixent is one of the most important biologic medicines for patients across a spectrum of diseases. Additionally, it continues to have significant growth potential based on new and upcoming indications. In U.S., Dupixent leads new-to-brand prescription share across all five approved indications, an important leading indicator for future growth. In addition, Dupixent already leads total prescription share in four or five approved indications and we are approaching share leadership in biologic asthma. In atopic dermatitis, Dupixent's largest Indication, physicians continue to prescribe Dupixent as the therapy of choice. Despite increased competition over the course of 2023, fourth quarter Dupixent new-to-brand prescription share in AD modestly increased sequentially compared to the third quarter 2023, driven by its differentiated mechanism of action, clinical results and trusted safety profile, including approval in patients as young as six months of age Dupixent's U.S. label was recently updated with efficacy and safety data for patients with moderate-to-severe hand or foot atopic dermatitis. Dupixent is the only biologic medicine data in the label supporting use for the subset of patients with this hard-to-treat disease. Beyond atopic dermatitis, growth also continues in asthma and nasal polyps, both of which are already blockbuster indications. The recent launches for eosinophilic esophagitis noticed EoE and prurigo nodularis further contributed to Dupixent's performance and represent indications of significant growth potential. In EoE, which prior to Dupixent's approval had no FDA-approved treatments. Nearly 25,000 patients in the US alone have already initiated therapy on Dupixent. The FDA's recent approval of Dupixent in pediatric EoE extends this indication to patients as young as one year of age where approximately 20,000 children in the U.S. being treated for EoE with unapproved therapies. Patient initiations also continue to accelerate in prurigo nodularis solidifying Dupixent as the standard-of-care for multiple dermatologic conditions. In summary, Dupixent is delivering on its potential as one of the most important biologic medicines of our generation was significant remaining opportunity for growth. We anticipate bringing Dupixent to many more patients this year across approved indications. The pediatric EoE launch is already underway and we are actively preparing to launch Dupixent in eosinophilic COPD pending potential FDA approval later this year. And finally to Libtayo, fourth quarter global net sales grew 43% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis to $244 million with U.S. net sales of $155 million, Libtayo continues to lead the category in non-melanoma skin cancers and we've made progress in penetrating the non-small cell lung cancer market In 2024, we expect continued growth across all indications, advancing our goal to exceed $1 billion in annual Libtayo net sales. In conclusion, 2024 provides the opportunity to further build Regeneron's market-leading positions with our medicines across even more therapeutic areas. Now, I will turn the call over to Bob.
Bob Landry: Thank you, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Regeneron ended 2023 with strong performance in the fourth quarter. Excluding contributions from Ronapreve, total revenues increased 14% year-over-year to $3.4 billion, primarily driven by sales growth and margin expansion from Dupixent, the launch of EYLEA HD and strong sales growth from Libtayo. Fourth-quarter diluted net income per share was $11.86 on net income of $1.4 billion. Moving to collaboration revenue and starting with Bayer. Fourth quarter 2023 ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales were $890 million, up 4% on a constant currency basis versus the prior year. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $377 million, of which $345 million related to our share of EYLEA net profits outside the U.S. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue grew 19% in the fourth quarter of 2023 to $993 million. Excluding a $50 million sales milestone recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022, Sanofi collaboration revenue grew 26%. Our share of collaboration profits was $886 million, an increase of 43% versus the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by Dupixent's continued volume growth and improving margins. Reimbursements from manufacturing of commercial supply, a component of Sanofi collaboration revenues declined 36% versus the prior year due to the implementation of a new higher-yielding manufacturing process. At the end of 2023, the Sanofi development balance was $2.33 billion reflecting a net decrease of $534 million, compared to the balance as of December 31, 2022. Recall, this decrease is primarily recorded as a reduction to our share of collaboration profits. We continue to expect this balance to be fully reimbursed in the next few years, which would result in a significant step-up in our Sanofi collaboration profits. Other revenue was $213 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, up 66% versus the prior year, primarily driven by higher royalties from Novartis on sales of Ilaris and an increase in our share of ARCALYST profit from Kiniksa. The increase in other revenue also reflects higher reimbursements for increased shipment volumes of ex-U.S. commercial supplies of Praluent to Sanofi. Moving now to our operating expenses. Fourth quarter 2023 R&D expense grew 13% year-over-year to $1.03 billion, which reflects continued investment in our growing pipeline. R&D growth was primarily driven by higher headcount and related costs, funding of our advancing late-stage programs and increased clinical manufacturing activity. SG&A grew 7% from the prior year to $622 million in the fourth quarter reflecting higher headcount and related costs and higher commercialization expenses, including costs to support the launch of EYLEA HD in pre-launch activities for anticipated 2024 hem-onc product launches. Fourth quarter COCM declined 12% from the prior year quarter to $210 million. Recall that we are reimbursed for these costs. Now to cash flow in the balance sheet. In 2023, Regeneron generated $3.9 billion in free cash flow ending the year with cash and marketable securities, less debt of approximately $13.5 billion. In 2023, we repurchased over $2.2 billion of our shares with approximately $1.5 billion remaining authorized for repurchase as of December 31, 2023. Since we began repurchasing our shares in 2019, we have bought back approximately $12 billion worth and plan to continue to make opportunistic repurchases. Now moving to our financial guidance for 2024. Note that these guidance ranges do not assume the completion of any business development transactions that were not completed as of today, including our recently announced agreement to acquire preclinical and clinical programs from 2seventy Bio. Starting with R&D expense in 2024, which is anticipated to be in the range of $4.3 billion to $4.5 billion, as George just discussed and as we highlighted at the J.P. Morgan Conference, our pipeline continues to expand with a growing number of registration-enabling studies ongoing or expected to initiate this year. These include potentially pivotal studies for Fianlimab, Phase 3 studies in earlier lines of odronextamab and linvoseltamab in our C5 programs. In addition, we expect to bring 8 to 10 new molecules into the clinic in 2024. We expect 2024 SG&A spending to be in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.65 billion. This reflects increased promotional activities for the ongoing launch of EYLEA HD, investments to support two anticipated hem-onc product launches and higher headcount to support our growing organization inclusive of our ongoing international expansion. COCM is expected to be in the range of $850 million to $910 million. This range reflects lower drug substance manufacturing cost for Dupixent, offset by higher Dupixent volumes and higher production costs for other collaboration products including EYLEA HD for Bayer. Recall, we are reimbursed for COCM expenses, and as a result, we expect reimbursement from Sanofi, which are recorded as a component of Sanofi collaboration revenue to be slightly lower in 2024, as compared to 2023. We expect the 2024 gross margin on-net product sales to be in the range of 89% to 91%. We also expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 10% to 12%. Finally, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $825 million to $950 million, which reflects the expansion of our R&D facilities at our Tarrytown, New York headquarters as well as the continued expansion of our manufacturing capabilities, including ongoing construction of our fill-finish facility in Rensselaer, New York. In addition to our full-year guidance, we expect U.S. net product sales of Praluent to be lower in 2024, as compared to 2023 due to changes in payer coverage. We also expect 2024 net product sales for Inmazeb to be in line with 2023 revenues with nearly all 2024 revenues expected to be recorded in the fourth quarter. Finally, we anticipate other revenue in 2024 to be in line with 2023, with the second half expected to be higher than our first half. Overall, Regeneron performed well in 2023 and our continued investments position the company to drive long-term shareholder value. Before I conclude, I'd like to sincerely thank Len and George for their kind words. It has been an honor to serve as Regeneron's CFO for these past 10-years and I have appreciated all of my interactions with each of you in the investment community. I wish Chris Fenimore much success in this role and have the utmost confidence that he and the rest of the management team will continue to deliver breakthrough medicines for patients and value to shareholders. Thank you and I wish you all continued success. With that, I will pass the call back to Ryan.
Ryan Crowe: Thank you, Bob, and congratulations again. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call for Q&A. To ensure we are able to address as many questions as possible, we will answer one question from each caller before moving to the next. Shannon, can we go to the first question, please?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instruction] Our first question comes from the line of Tyler Van Buren with TD Cowen. Your line is now open.
Tyler Van Buren: Great, thanks guys, good morning. And I'd like to say congratulations to you as well, Bob, wish you well during your retirement. It's been a privilege to work with you. And Chris, I look forward to working with you as well. So in the opening, Len mentioned accelerating the rate of conversion of patients from other agents to EYLEA HD. So, can you discuss the different factors at play that will accelerate the rate over the year, which I assume, includes the permanent J-code and also the robust sampling effort that is impacting to make sales.
Marion McCourt: Sure, Tyler. I'm happy to answer. So, as I mentioned, we're very encouraged by the early performance of EYLEA HD in the market and a number of factors early are driving that success. First, it's the clinical data, which is now showing in the actual market real-world setting the efficacy, safety, and durability of EYLEA HD, all very important factors. As we look to the future, physicians will build upon their early experience, and as I mentioned that experience is coming from conversion patients from branded agents broadly, Avastin and also in some cases naive patients but going forward, I would share that in addition to ongoing experience and confidence, the reimbursement consideration is very, very important for physicians, and some are hesitant to prescribe a product that doesn't have a permanent J-code. So we do look forward to that occurring April 1 and beyond based on CMS's recent update. And then in addition to reimbursement confidence, we've made progress certainly in payer coverage. We anticipate making more. And certainly, the experience in market to date with EYLEA HD has been very favorable for physicians. And that is the, probably, the most important, those differentiating characteristics of the product.
Ryan Crowe: Thanks, Marion. Shannon, next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Brian Abrahams: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats to both Bob and Chris. I was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about the differentiation of the emerging obesity portfolio as you move into the next wave of studies. I know a patent filing revealed that the antibody tethered GLP-1 shows very competitive weight loss in animal models. So I'm wondering where you see that differentiating most. Is it tolerability in distribution or dose frequency or somewhere else? And then I know others are pursuing myostatin as well on top of GLP-1s. Just curious where you see your biggest competitive advantage there.
George Yancopoulos: Okay. Well, let me start with the latter first, in terms of muscle preservation. Other people have related approaches, but we're the only ones, we're the ones who discovered that there are two key ligands or growth factors that control muscle size: myostatin, myostatin 1, we call it, and myostatin 2 or ActiveNA. And we're the only ones that have specific blocking antibodies for those two. And we are testing them together and individually. And the reason why that's important is it's going to be a combination of both efficacy and safety that matters here. So we're going to see which approach does the best in terms of the muscle preservation in the face of the profound muscle loss that you can see with GLP-1 agonist treatment. But we're also going to see the safety profiles. And I think that that's going to be so critical because safety is so important here. Other people are just testing one of these agents alone. I believe, the myostatin, and others are testing very broad approaches such as trying to block the receptors for these factors. The problem with the receptor blockade approach is that the receptors that are used by these factors are also used by over a dozen other ligands that have very diverse biologic functions. And you can easily imagine that by blocking so many diverse functions, you might end up having all sorts of safety issues, which you're not going to want to be able to be dealing with in the setting of a treatment that's intended to optimize obesity and body weight loss and give benefit to the patients. So our programs are very different in that we discovered the 2 key regulators, the 2 key growth factors. We have separate antibodies blocking them both. And we're evaluating them separately and together in the setting of GLP-1 receptor agonist, to see what gives us the best benefit vis-a-vis muscle preservation as well as safety profile. While we're doing that, as we said, we're initiating those trials this year, we are also developing unimolecular solutions. So whichever approach works best, we hope to have the possibility of having a tethered GLP-1, as you put it, associated with the right set of antibody molecules. So they will have the advantage of having a unimolecular solution that can provide all-in-one benefit in terms of providing, hopefully, the best convenience profile and potentially once-a-month dosing, together with providing not only the weight loss, the profound weight loss that one is seen with GLP-1 receptor agonist, but now complemented by providing muscle preservation, but with the safest possible approach. So we think that we have the most unique program in terms of addressing all these possibilities. And we're very, very excited about these programs.
Ryan Crowe: Thanks, George. Shannon, next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Mohit Bansal: Great. Thank you very much for taking my question and thank you, Bob, for all your help over the years. Maybe one question for Marion. Can you just comment on the trends in the anti-VEGF market, underlying trends? I mean, is the market growing or you are growing fast, as fast as it's been in the past, or is it slowing down a little bit? And in that context, how do you see the outlook for Hydro EYLEA plus EYLEA going forward, with the underlying demand out there? Thank you.
Marion McCourt: Sure, Mohit. So there is variation between quarters and years as it relates to anti-VEGF category growth. Overall, though, the category is healthy from a growth standpoint, unfortunately, based on the number of individuals with diabetes or diagnosed with diabetes. On a brighter note, aging population is good. So overall, we see it as healthy category growth. But there is variability. And as an example, there has been some decline by a couple of points between last year and this year overall.
Ryan Crowe: Okay, next question, please, Shannon.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Raymond with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.
Christopher Raymond: Thanks. Maybe just another EYLEA question. I know you guys don't want to get sort of too granular on your pricing strategy, but we've been struck that, even with the 2-milligram format revenue contracting in the last couple of quarters, our checks show that it's really not a market share issue. In fact, share of that format remains up around an all-time high. So one would think that that's been price erosion that's been driving that. Just understand this may be a strategy to maximize the HD launch, in broad stroke, can you talk about what we should be expecting in 2024? Do you expect further price erosion for that 2-milligram format? Or have things sort of leveled off?
Leonard Schleifer: Yes. I'm not sure we want Marion to get into the details of our strategies, pricing, rebates, things like that. But we can say, Marion, you could add thoughts, that we view it as a very competitive marketplace. There has been some price erosion on some of the products in the marketplace. We're starting at a new point with EYLEA HD. We think we priced it well. It was received well. It was intended to match on a yearly basis. And so we think the actual price point was fine. I don't know if Marion wants to add anything at all, but we don't like to comment specifically on those competitive dynamics.
Marion McCourt: Yes. Chris, really nothing in everyone to add to that.
Ryan Crowe: Okay, all right next question please Shannon.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Colin Bristow with UBS. Your line is now open.
Colin Bristow: Hey, good morning and thanks for taking the question. And all the best in the future, Bob. Maybe a couple more on the muscle sparing myostatin program. I'm curious, George, what are your thoughts around the potential concerns of myostatin targeting, increases or preserves muscle volume, but the muscle is less functional. And then any thoughts on the regulatory pathway that you would utilize for these muscle sparing assets? Thank you.
George Yancopoulos: Regulatory. Okay, so o first of all, we've done extensive work in preclinical models. And these antibodies have already been in humans. We believe that our studies are actually showing that this muscle is functional and certainly very important from both the metabolic and energy expenditure point of view. So, so far, those studies are very supportive of this whole approach. I should also say there's a variety of regulatory pathways that we're pursuing here. Obviously, the easiest, which would come from the possible results that we're seeing in the animal studies, is if there's incrementally more weight loss, that might suffice as a regulatory strategy. Alternatively, if it's just the quality of the white loss, then we would have to show functional outcomes in terms of strength and so forth and so on. So those are still early in the thinking. We have to see from these initial studies. But as I said, if we simply see increased weight loss, that would be the simplest way forward. And then you have more weight loss but better body composition data, and may also -- may be better metabolic benefits, which we also see in muscle, which could also provide additional pass-through approval. So it depends on those results that we're going to get from the initial studies. I should also mention, in terms of additional programs that we have, obesity. I mean, these are things that are here and now that we're doing these clinical trials and we hope to be getting results over the course of the next year, 1.5 years that could really inform in terms of all these questions that you have and really validate that there's real promise here. But remember, we're doing a lot of other things as well in obesity that are in earlier stages. So for example, as you probably know, we discovered a brand-new promising target in obesity using our Regeneron Genetics Center, the largest big data set on the planet in terms of human sequence linked to electronic health records, and identified, in some ways, one of the most exciting new targets in obesity that's been ever discovered. And we have a variety, it's called GPR75, it was published in a prominent paper in Science about a year or so ago. And we have a variety of promising and not-that-far-away approaches from the clinic in terms of blocking this target for weight loss. And I think that we presented at JPMorgan early preclinical data using siRNA approaches that look very exciting. I should also mention that, in terms of smaller programs and so forth, we have things like a very exciting leptin receptor-activating antibody that have had very promising human data as well. So there's a lot of things going on, but I think the muscle preservation program and how it goes forward is going to be very interesting to look at over the next year, 1.5 years.
Ryan Crowe: Thanks, George. Shannon, next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Evan Seigerman: Hi guys, I have one final question for Bob. So Bob, you've done an outstanding job managing the financials of the business and helping drive shareholder returns over the past decade. Looking ahead, how do you believe Regeneron can best use its rapidly growing cash balance to further drive investor returns in the next decade of Regeneron? And thanks for everything, Bob.
Bob Landry: Evan, thanks for the question, and thanks for the video that we were able to show at my retirement party. It was great. On that question, George just laid out earlier today, we have so many opportunities with regards to our kind of research and development. And again, I mean I'm going to hand the mantle over to Chris, but his number one priority within capital allocation is to make sure that that is kind of fully funded. Len and George do a great job with regards to making sure what we're bringing into the clinic as opportunities, and they're going to continue to do that, and there's just a lot coming, particularly when I said kind of 8 to 10 INDs. Proud on buybacks. Maybe I've kind of circled the victory too much on that with regards to how much we bought back and at what price. But we have a good methodology here that Chris is ingrained with, and he'll continue to do that. And with regards to business development, I mean, just because we can doesn't mean we're going to force something. It has to be right, it has to be a franchise, has to be modalities. You've heard George mention that has to be kind of incremental to what we currently have in the clinic here with regards to RGC and the targets we develop, and all of that. So we will remain prudent on that. Continue to be proud of the free cash flow that we're generating. And I trust that Chris, George, Len and the Board will optimize it and put it to great use.
Ryan Crowe: Thank you, Bob. Next question, please, Shannon.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Salveen Richter: Thank you. Good morning. And Bob, you truly will be missed, and enjoy the next stage of life here. With regard to your GA program, can you outline what's contributing to your confidence in the systemic approach here, and what data you've seen to support it given the move from animal models to Phase III?
George Yancopoulos: Okay, geographic atrophy. So basically, the excitement is that, as we show data from our combination approach, we believe that we have the most effective way of blocking the body's C5 activity. The C5, which is active in the eye, is essentially all coming from the liver. And we've shown now in our PNH studies, when we revealed the data from the first portion of our Phase III program, that it looked like we had the best-in-class activity in terms of decreasing the C5 activity. So if you block it at the source, then you don't have to block it in the eye. And if you block it at the source, then you don't suffer from all the concerns and side effects and so forth that you have from having to block it in the eye. So you block it where it's coming from, then you don't have to treat local in the eye. You can avoid the local side effects. The concern with systemic blockade is it comes with increased risks of infections and so forth. So we will have to come up with a strategy, which we're working on, to try to mitigate that in the elderly population that suffers from GA. We believe that we may need for that an approach to identify the patients who might be at risk in those settings. Because we certainly know that, for example, patients with PNH and myasthenia gravis who are immunosuppressed and so forth, not only with our agent, but certainly with this whole class of agents, can suffer from serious systemic infections when you block C5. So we are coming up with a way to mitigate that, in part by probably selecting out the patients who are at the highest risk. But in terms of efficacy, the fact that you block it at the source should make it much more effective than trying to block it indirectly in the eye, while avoiding all of the serious local side effect, you can get in the eye, including this horrific retinal vasculitis, which is associated with sudden and permanent blindness.
Ryan Crowe: Thanks, George. I think we have time for two more questions.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Risinger with Leerink Partners. Your line is now open.
David Risinger: Yes, thanks very much. And first, I wanted to offer my congrats as well and best wishes to you, both Bob and Chris. So I have a commercial question on linvoseltamab, please. It's clearly generated best-in-class results and a more attractive profile for patients. But Regeneron has to displace the incumbents. So could you discuss your plans to convert prescribers to linvoseltamab?
Marion McCourt: I'm anxious to answer, but Len will, of course, go first.
Leonard Schleifer: No, I just wanted to give a little history, David. You actually were around. You may even have asked the exact question, I'm not sure. when we were launching EYLEA and we had to displace Lucentis by the behemoth Roche. There are some lessons in there that it can be done with starting with a really good molecule, as you described, one that is potentially be best-in-class and then strong execution at the commercial front. We've done it. We're not afraid of the 800-pound gorilla. We hope to put that gorilla on perhaps a weight loss program and get in there and show them what we can do, Marion, any comments. I just want to put that historical perspective out there.
Marion McCourt: Thank you, David, for the question. And I'm going to be a bit redundant, so I'll be short. But my comment was to say it always starts with the best-in-class molecule. It's about the science. And certainly, you've seen us across therapeutic areas launch into competitive categories, both in the anti-VEGF category and then, more recently, bringing great products into the marketplace. So we do look forward to this opportunity. And it fits quite beautifully with our oncology team, our onc -- will be onc/hem team. And certainly, we will be very ready for that launch and look forward to helping patients with linvo.
Ryan Crowe: Okay. Thanks, Len and Marion. Shannon, last question, please.
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Carter Gould with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Carter Gould: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I'll echo all the prior comments about Bob, and best of luck. Maybe just on the 2seventy deal, Len and George. How should we think about this? Was this more about sort of protecting the rights of the assets that you already kind of partnered on, or really around sort of getting access to that manufacturing facility? And does that have implications then as we think about your business development going forward and maybe change kind of your willingness to move further down that path of cellular therapies?
Leonard Schleifer: I'll let George comment on the scientific rationale, which drives pretty much everything we do. Just to mention from a business development point of view, we have been a long-standing partner with 2seventy when they were still part of bluebird. We've invested in them, both in equity and, frankly, in development. So this was something that was well known. George can comment how we see this fitting in.
George Yancopoulos: Yes. We're excited about the existing programs. But what we're even more excited about is as we know that the history of many diseases, but cancer in particular, is about combination approaches. And thus far, even in the setting of this collaboration, the CAR T space has been separate from the biologics space. And even though we were working together as separate companies, it was a little harder to really move forward in an expedited fashion the incredible opportunities that I believe that we have to combine what we think is the largest and most exciting portfolio of biologics in immunotherapy, together with cell therapy approaches. Nobody else has really tried that. Nobody else has really led that. Now that we're really together all in with our new selected colleagues from 2seventy and their capabilities, we believe that we will now have the first opportunity to really try this new set of combination approaches against cancer. That is, combining our large portfolio of biologics in the immunotherapy space with their cell therapy capabilities and expertise, that brings a whole new level of combinations to the immunotherapy field. We believe we will be alone in that capability until somebody else tries to copy us and do what we're doing here. And that's what we're really excited about, in addition to just moving forward the existing cell therapy programs that we've been working on them for five years or more.

Leonard Schleifer: Thanks, Ryan, and thanks to everyone joining today's call. Regeneron delivered another strong quarter marked by continued execution across the company, which drove double-digit top line growth and notable progress across our innovative R&D pipeline. Total revenues increased by 15% on a reported basis compared to the prior year quarter, primarily driven by Sanofi collaboration revenues and Libtayo global net product sales, which grew by 50% and 62%, respectively. Dupixent global net product sales were $3.1 billion, up 33%, reflecting strong growth across all approved indications. Non-GAAP net income per share -- diluted share increased by 4%, including an unfavorable $0.77 impact from acquired IP R&D. Today, I will briefly discuss the launch of EYLEA HD, the progress we continue to make across our pipeline, and our latest thinking on capital allocation. I will then hand the call over to George, Marion and Bob, who will provide additional commentary on our pipeline, developments, commercial execution and our financial results for the quarter. Starting with EYLEA HD, which is off to a great start. We launched in late August shortly following FDA approval, and recorded $43 million of net product sales in the final six weeks of the quarter, which compares favorably to recent launches in the retinal disease category. Importantly, revenues were driven by strong initial demand with multiple reorders by distributors before the end of the quarter. In addition, samples for EYLEA HD were made available shortly after the launch, enabling prescribers and patients to trial the product. Early EYLEA HD utilization has come from across the spectrum of wet age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema patients, and momentum continues to build as positive real-world clinical experiences accumulate. We have also made significant progress establishing access and reimbursement, and we will continue to work on positioning EYLEA HD, the highest dose anti-VEGF therapy approved by the FDA, as a new standard of care in these retinal diseases. Moving on to the recent progress we have made advancing our pipeline. Within hematology oncology, in our CD3 bispecific platform, the BLA for odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific in certain lymphomas, was accepted by the FDA and granted priority review, which are -- with a March 31 PDUFA data assigned. We also remain on track to submit a BLA next month for linvoseltamab, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific for multiple myeloma, with pivotal trials now underway for both programs to support potential accelerated approvals, we are preparing for two commercial launches next year. Last week, we reported a potential breakthrough for patients with profound congenital hearing loss. The first patient enrolled in the Phase 1/2 cohort clinical trial of DB-OTO, an investigational cell selective adenovirus-associated viral gene therapy designed to provide durable physiological hearing to individuals with profound congenital hearing loss caused by mutations in the otoferlin gene, experienced hearing improvement six weeks after treatment compared to baseline. We are looking forward to continued follow-up with this patient as well as enrollment of additional patients to further validate this gene therapy approach. While otoferlin gene deficiency is an ultra-rare condition, we are hopeful that we can expand our approach to gene therapy in the year to more common genetic causes of profound hearing loss. Finally, regarding capital allocation. While we continue to prioritize internal R&D investment, given the strength of our balance sheet and anticipated future cash flows, we believe we have the flexibility to take additional actions to drive shareholder value. Beyond our ongoing share repurchase program, we continue to actively pursue emerging science and innovative platforms that complement our core R&D strengths. In addition to the Decibel acquisition, we announced last month an expanded research collaboration with Intellia combining our proprietary antibody targeted viral vector delivery technologies with Intellia's CRISPR platform to jointly explore in vivo programs outside of the liver for neurological and muscular diseases. We have always managed Regeneron with a focus on generating long-term returns, and we will continue to think carefully about how to strategically deploy our capital, with the goal of delivering breakthroughs to patients and value to shareholders. In closing, we had a strong third quarter, the EYLEA HD launch is progressing well, our pipeline is delivering important innovations, and we continue to look at ways to efficiently allocate capital. With that, let me turn the call over to George.
George Yancopoulos: Thanks, Len. I'd like to start with our recent data update for EYLEA HD. At the EU Retina Meeting last month, we presented the two-year results from the PULSAR study in wet AMD, which demonstrated that the vast majority of EYLEA HD patients randomized to 12 and 16 week dosing intervals continue to sustain vision and anatomic improvements through 96 weeks. 78% of all EYLEA HD patients were able to maintain at least every 12-week dosing intervals for the entire two-year period, with 88% assigned to at least every 12-week dosing by the end of the two-year period. Similarly, 70% of patients randomized to every 16-week dosing at baseline were able to maintain at least that interval through two years with 78% assigned to at least every 16-week dosing at week 96. Moreover, during the second year, many patients met the criteria for extension to even longer dosing intervals, with 47% meeting the criteria for at least 20-week dosing intervals, including 28% who were eligible for 24-week dosing intervals. The safety profile of EYLEA HD remain consistent with EYLEA, sustaining vision and anatomic improvements while maintaining such extended dosing intervals over two years in both wet AMD and DME is a remarkable advancement for the patients and their physicians. We believe that these results give EYLEA HD the potential to become the new standard of care for these retinal diseases. Moving to our immunology and inflammation pipeline. On Dupixent in COPD, our first pivotal study BOREAS met the primary and all two secondary endpoints in a previously unprecedented success for a biologic in a Phase 3 study in patients with uncontrolled COPD and evidence of Type 2 inflammation. Based on recent feedback from the FDA, in addition to the positive results from the BOREAS study, a positive interim analysis of the replicate Phase 3 NOTUS study would enable an sBLA submission. The independent data monitoring committee will conduct an interim analysis of the NOTUS study later this year. Itepekimab, our anti-IL-33 antibody, the Phase 3 AERIFY-1 and 2 studies remain on track for readout and potential regulatory submissions in 2025, both itepekimab and Dupixent could transform the treatment paradigm for COPD by leveraging their distinct mechanisms of actions in reducing different types of inflammation that contribute to COPD disease progression, and we look forward to the results of these studies. Moving to oncology and combination with Libtayo. We remain on target and are currently enrolling our pivotal study of Libtayo combined with our LAG-3 antibody, fianlimab, in first-line metastatic melanoma. We believe this combination may provide a significant advance for patients in this setting based on our encouraging earlier-stage studies. At the annual ESMO meeting, we presented data from the Phase 2 trial of neoadjuvant Libtayo treatment for resectable cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma or CSCC, which demonstrated event-free survival for the vast majority, 89% of the patients at one year. It is also noteworthy that of the 51% of patients who had a pathological complete response, none have since experienced disease recurrence. These results add to the growing body of evidence of Libtayo and other checkpoint inhibitors may have utility in earlier stages of CSCC and other malignancies. To further explore this, we are conducting a Libtayo trial in adjuvant CSCC for patients at heightened risk. We're also evaluating the combination of the Libtayo and fianlimab in adjuvant melanoma, and plan to initiate a study of this combination in the perioperative melanoma setting as well. On to bispecifics. First in hematology oncology. We are pleased that odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific, was recently accepted for review by both the FDA and European regulatory authorities in relapsed/refractory follicular bone and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Based on the pivotal Phase 2 data from the ELM-2 study, we have initiated a robust OLYMPIA Phase 3 development program, investigating odronextamab as monotherapy as well as in combination with current standards of care in earlier lines of follicular lymphoma and DLBCL. We are looking forward to the pivotal data presentations from ELM-2 later this year. We're also on track to submit our regulatory application for linvoseltamab, our BCMAxCD3 antibody for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma by the end of the year. This bispecific may potentially offer best-in-class efficacy and convenience. The LINKER-MM3 confirmatory Phase 3 study evaluated linvoseltamab monotherapy compared to a standard of care regimen is enrolling and studies in earlier lines of multiple myeloma and other plasma cell diseases will be enrolling soon. Finally, in addition to the ongoing Phase 1 combination study of odronextamab in our CD22xCD20 co-stimulatory bispecific, we're also on track to initiate a study of linvoseltamab with a corresponding co-stimulatory bispecific next year. Next, on to bispecifics for solid tumors, which are being investigated in combination with Libtayo and other modalities. At ESMO, we shared initial clinical data for the combination of ubamatamab, our MUC16xCD3 bispecific with Libtayo in advanced ovarian cancer. In these early data, promising durable responses were observed with ubamatamab monotherapy as well as encouraging combination activity with Libtayo with evidence of turnaround responses after initial progression on monotherapy leading in multiple patients upon addition of the Libtayo. A randomized Phase 2 expansion study is ongoing to evaluate two active monotherapy doses of ubamatamab, with the lower dose also tested in combination with Libtayo in order to optimize dosing and evaluate the potential added activity of Libtayo. In addition, we're exploring ubamatamab in multiple rare cancers that are known to express high levels of MUC16. In terms of our co-stimulatory bispecifics for solid tumors, we are currently exploring multiple different CD28 co-stimulatory bispecific antibodies in early clinical trials in a variety of tumor settings in combination with Libtayo with corresponding CD3 bispecifics. We are continuing development of our PSMAxCD28 co-stimulatory bispecific in advanced prostate cancer, focusing and identifying the window of opportunity for maintaining the remarkable antitumor activity observed with this treatment so far while minimizing serious toxicity. In order to explore this, we have expanded enrollment in the PSMAxCD28 monotherapy cohort, and we'll soon initiate cohorts in which investigators will have an option of adding a low dose of cemiplimab to the PSMAxCD28 treatment in certain patients. Moreover, we plan to initiate a trial combining PSMA/CD28 with PSMA/CD3 since, based on preclinical data CD28 costims with appropriate CD3 bispecifics may yield antitumor activity without severe immune-mediated adverse events. We also hope to progress an additional prostate specific CD3 bispecific toward the clinic in the next year, which we may also combine with our PSMA costimulatory biospecific. In terms of our MUC16xCD28 costim in combination with LIBTAYO in ovarian cancer, we are planning on presenting initial data by the end of the year. Regarding our EGFRxCD28 costim in combination LIBTAYO, we are planning on presenting updated dose escalation data in 2024. We will soon commence enrollment across eight tumor specific expansion cohorts in the study, including colorectal cancer with or without liver metastases, as well as EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer. Now, to genetic medicines. We and Intellia recently announced expansion of our research collaboration to include Regeneron’s proprietary antibody target delivery technology with the goal of expanding the reach of in vivo gene editing to neurological and muscle diseases. The aim of this expanded collaboration is to address a current bottleneck in genetic medicines, the inability to deliver a genetic payload beyond the liver. Our proprietary pre-clinically validated antibody directed AAV approach will initially test two in vivo non-liver targets. Additionally, we and Intellia announced FDA clearance to start a pivotal Phase 3 trial of NTLA-2001 for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy, the first time an investigational in vivo CRISPR-based gene therapy editing is clear to enter late stage clinical development in the United States. The trial is expected to initiate by year end 2023. Moving to our Alnylam collaboration. Alnylam recently presented updated interim ALN-APPI data in early onset Alzheimer’s disease. Updated data show that single doses of ALN-APPI achieved sustained robust reduction in APP-alpha and APP-beta measured in the CSF up to 10 months after administration, as well as reduction of amyloidogenic peptides implicated in Alzheimer’s disease and in cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Alnylam has also announced that a first patient has been redosed with ALN-APPI in the multi-dose portion of the study currently proceeding outside of the United States. We and Alnylam plan to initiate additional clinical programs for neurodegenerative diseases, including for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, next year. Finally, I would like to highlight DB-OTO, our otoferlin gene therapy Regeneron’s first clinical program for genetic hearing loss, which we developed over the last few years in collaboration with Decibel Therapeutics, a company we recently acquired. Last week, we announced the first preliminary results from this trial. A child who received an intraocular injection of DB-OTO in one ear experienced improvements in hearing tests in that ear through week six compared to baseline, including both auditory brainstem responses as well as behavioral audiometry. We are looking forward to continuing evaluation of this innovative approach in the ongoing trial for the ultra-rare otoferlin and gene related hearing loss, as well as in other planned clinical programs which include more common forms of genetic hearing loss. In conclusion, Regeneron’s R&D engine continues to grow and deliver differentiated late and early stage opportunities, and we are looking forward to progress in the remainder of this year and looking ahead to 2024. With that, I will turn it over to Marion.
Marion McCourt: Thank you, George. I’m delighted to share details of our commercial performance in the third quarter, including very encouraging early signals for EYLEA HD as well as ongoing results from our inline brands. Starting with our anti-VEGF retinal franchise. Regeneron achieved $1.49 billion in total net sales for the quarter in the U.S. We were excited to rapidly launch EYLEA HD in late August following its U.S. approval, and total net sales for the quarter were $43 million. Early launch indicators have been very positive. Physician enthusiasm was extremely high prior to EYLEA HD launch, and that interest has translated into early use in a broad range of patient types across wet AMD and diabetic eye disease. It is noteworthy that physicians are prescribing EYLEA HD in recalcitrant, switch and naive patients. We are already hearing anecdotal case reports from physicians whose recalcitrant patients are returning. Many of these patients have now been able to achieve drying that they were unable to obtain with other products. To accelerate this early launch momentum, our highly experienced team is rapidly advancing reimbursement and market access. We have confirmed paid claims from 100% of Medicare jurisdictions, and many large payers have recently published coverage policies for EYLEA HD. This includes both Medicare Advantage and commercial plans. While early, the speed of EYLEA HD coverage is significantly outpacing recent competitive launches. In addition, we continue to be on track to have a permanent J-Code by April 1, 2024, which we anticipate will drive additional uptake. These early reimbursement successes and positive physician experiences are being shared by prescribers with our team and more broadly with the retina community. These initial results bode well for the future of EYLEA HD and substantiate our belief that EYLEA HD will rapidly become the new standard of care across its approved indications. EYLEA HD’s unsurpassed safety and durability demonstrated in clinical trials, coupled with prescriber confidence in EYLEA’s efficacy and safety record is expected to drive continued category leadership. In summary, while the launch is still in early days, we are pleased with our progress and look forward to providing future updates. EYLEA remains the category leader with 45% anti-VEGF share for the quarter in an increasingly competitive market. With over 70 million injections worldwide since launch, EYLEA continues to demonstrate a strong and consistent safety profile, a key differentiator given retinal vasculitis and intraocular inflammation events with certain new products introduced in the retinal category. With both EYLEA HD and EYLEA, our formidable retina franchise is poured for sustained leadership. Next to Dupixent. Global net sales grew 33% year-over-year to $3.1 billion, and U.S. net sales grew 30% to $2.4 billion. This impressive third quarter performance demonstrates Dupixent’s clinical and safety differentiation across all approved indications, as well as its continued growth potential. In the third quarter more than 50,000 new patients are taking Dupixent in the U.S. alone, and there are now more than 750,000 patients on Dupixent worldwide. In atopic dermatitis, Dupixent’s largest indication, we continue to see more than 20% growth six years post-launch. Physicians have great confidence from the combination of efficacy, safety and ease of use across all age groups, including as young as six months. Not only is their remarkable adherence once patients begin therapy, we also see Dupixent as being the clear treatment of choice for new patients with moderate to severe disease with significant growth opportunity. In asthma, Dupixent is differentiated from all other medicines in the category based on its rapid and sustained effect on lung function, reduced exacerbations and reduced corticosteroid use. In the U.S., Dupixent continues to lead new patient prescriptions, and we are quickly approaching our goal of being the number one prescribed medicine for asthma. Together with our partner, Sanofi, Regeneron continues to advance recent launches in eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis, which are already meaningfully contributing to Dupixent’s growth. Since FDA approval, approximately 20,000 new patients with eosinophilic esophagitis have been initiated, and demand is also robust for prurigo nodularis, where Dupixent is rapidly becoming the standard of care within a year of approval. We also look forward to offering Dupixent to even more patients in the future with anticipated regulatory approvals of pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis, as well as multiple near-term Phase 3 data readouts on COPD, chronic spontaneous urticaria and bullous pemphigoid. In summary, Dupixent continues to be a key driver of our growth, and we look forward to seeing its transformational benefits extending to even more patients with type 2 inflammatory diseases across indications, demographics and geographies. And finally to LIBTAYO. Third quarter global net sales grew 59% year-over-year on a constant currency basis to $232 million, with U.S. net sales up 52% to $144 million. Global growth was driven by our non-melanoma skin indications coupled with increased utilization in both monotherapy and chemotherapy combination settings in lung cancer. We’re working to expand access and use in many additional countries following recent regulatory approvals. We continue to see a growing number of prescribers choosing LIBTAYO when treating their patients. In conclusion, Regeneron’s performance in the third quarter continues to deliver growth and value for patients and shareholders with opportunity for sustained growth. We’re encouraged by favorable early indicators from the EYLEA HD launch and continue to deliver compelling performance from our inline brands, including EYLEA, Dupixent and LIBTAYO. Now I’ll turn the call over to Bob.
Bob Landry: Thanks, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron’s financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Regeneron performed well in the third quarter, with execution across the business continuing to drive strong top and bottom line growth. Third quarter 2023 total revenues increased 15% year-over-year to $3.4 billion, primarily driven by sales growth for Dupixent, coupled with improving margins within the Sanofi collaboration as well as continued growth from LIBTAYO. Third quarter diluted net income per share grew 4% to $11.59 on net income of $1.3 billion. This included a $100 million acquired IP R&D charge incurred in the third quarter of 2023, which decreased growth by approximately 7 percentage points. Moving to collaboration revenue and starting with Bayer. Third quarter 2023 ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales were $872 million, up 6% on a constant currency basis versus the prior year. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $377 million, of which $350 million related to our share of EYLEA net profits outside the U.S. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $1.1 billion in the third quarter, up 50% versus the prior year, which included the final $50 million sales based milestone. Our share of profits from the commercialization of Dupixent and KEVZARA was $863 million, an increase of 57% versus the third quarter of 2022, driven by Dupixent’s continued volume growth and improving margins. As we guided last quarter third quarter reimbursements for the manufacturing of commercial supplies from Sanofi, a component of Sanofi collaboration revenues declined sequentially, primarily due to the ongoing phase in of a new higher yielding manufacturing process. In the fourth quarter, we expect a continuation of this trend with reimbursements for manufacturing of commercial supplies expected to be sequentially lower by approximately $40 million. Other revenues were $138 million in the third quarter of 2023, up 62% versus the prior year, and inclusive of $34 million of reimbursements from BARDA for ongoing development of our next-gen COVID antibody as per the agreement announced in August 2023. Moving now to our operating expenses. Third quarter 2023 R&D expense grew 17% year-over-year to $954 million, representing continued investment in our expanding pipeline. R&D growth was primarily driven by higher headcount and related costs in funding our advancing late stage pipeline as well as increased clinical manufacturing activity. SG&A grew 14% from the prior year to $534 million in the third quarter, reflecting higher headcount and related costs and higher contributions to an independent not-for-profit patient assistance organization. In the third quarter, we recorded acquired IP R&D of $100 million, reflecting the payment of a development milestone to our collaborator Alnylam, related to the Phase 1 ALN-APPI program in early onset Alzheimer’s disease. This impacted both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.77. Third quarter COCM was $212 million, up 20% versus the prior year, driven by manufacturing costs associated with higher sales volumes from collaboration products, partially offset by lower Dupixent manufacturing costs. Fourth quarter COCM is expected to be the lowest quarter of the year as we continue to transition to the higher yielding manufacturing process for Dupixent. Now to cash flow and the balance sheet. Through the third quarter of 2023, Regeneron generated approximately $3 billion in free cash flow and ended the third quarter with cash and marketable securities less debt of approximately $13 billion. We continue to deliver on our capital allocation priorities, buying back $507 million and $1.9 billion of our shares in the third quarter in the first nine months of 2023, respectively, with $1.8 billion remaining authorized under our existing share repurchase program. Additionally, in the third quarter, we also announced and completed the acquisition of Decibel Therapeutics for approximately $100 million to strengthen our genetics medicine portfolio. As Len mentioned, we continue to evaluate opportunities to utilize our strong financial position and build upon our core competencies with the goal of delivering long-term shareholder value. Finally, we’ve made some minor changes to our full year 2023 financial guidance based on our year-to-date results and our latest outlook, updating the guidance ranges for SG&A, R&D, gross margin, COCM and capital expenditures. A complete summary of our latest full year 2023 guidance is available in our press release issued earlier this morning. As we approach the end of 2023, I’d like to provide some commentary on the preliminary outlook for 2024. We expect continued improvements in profitability from the Sanofi collaboration, which will continue to accelerate the paydown of the antibody development balance, which as of September 30, 2023 was approximately $2.5 billion. Once this balance is fully repaid in the next few years, we expect a meaningful step up in our share of Sanofi collaboration profits. Separately for PRALUENT, we expect significant category and competitive pressures to negatively impact U.S. sales in 2024. Moving to our operating expenses. Consistent with our capital allocation priorities, we continue to invest in our growing internal R&D pipeline to drive long-term growth. As you just heard from George, our pipeline continues to broaden, while our infrastructure to support that growth continues to expand. R&D investment in 2024 will be driven by advancing strategically important late stage programs such as our fianlimab and Libtayo combination confirmatory hem/onc studies, including an earlier lines of therapy, our expanding collaboration in genetic medicines, as well as higher clinical manufacturing costs, and the continued expansion of our R&D organization. With this in mind, we expect year-on-year R&D growth in 2024 to be in the mid-teens compared to our anticipated 2023 spend. We also expect to make additional investments in our commercial business and G&A functions to support the launch of EYLEA HD, our planned hem/onc launches and our international expansion. In conclusion, Regeneron continues to deliver strong results, and our robust financial position allows us to make strategic investments to drive this growth over time. With that, I will now pass the call back to Ryan.
Ryan Crowe: Thank you, Bob. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call for Q&A. To ensure that we are able to address as many questions as possible. We will answer one question from each caller before moving to the next. Shannon, can we please go to the first question?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Evan Seigerman: Hi, guys. Thank you for giving me the question, and congrats on all the progress. So you have over $15 billion of cash and marketable securities on your balance sheet. Maybe, Bob, you could talk about how you think about capital allocation? I know interest rates are high, but how else can you spend that money to drive even higher returns for Regeneron shareholders?
Bob Landry: Yes. Thanks, Evan. I mean, I know having dealt with you and certainly many of our investors, this is certainly an issue that we’ve been tasked to solve. Now obviously interest rates are a lot higher. So obviously what we’re returning on that is certainly much better than the kind of days of 2020 and 2021. But we kind of stick to our knitting here with regards to our capital allocations. I mean George just went through a plethora of obviously pipeline progress that we’re making. Again, first and foremost, we’re going to make sure that is fully funded to the extent possible on that. And then with regards to acquisitions, you heard with Len’s intro, I mean, we continue to look at a lot of opportunities. Certainly, the market that is out there on the biotech space is not in the greatest shape, as you know. So again, we think there are opportunities out there, but just because we have the means doesn’t mean that we’re going to kind of push into something that may not give us an optimal result. It may not be kind of we like franchises, as you’ve heard me say that before. So we need to make sure that it’s the right fit with George and the team with regards to that. So we’ll continue to do that. And you’ve seen our share repurchases of which we’re $1.9 billion through nine months. We’ve done that at a very good price with regards to how we’re buying that back. We’re very kind of scientific in our approach on that. We do think that the stock continues to be undervalued given all the pipeline progress and the catalyst that we have. So we’re going to continue to push that button going forward. So we’re going to stick to our knitting. But again, as Len kind of alluded to, we are looking at a lot of opportunities that are out there. And if the right one makes the necessary fit, then we’ll move forward. And again, you kind of saw that with Checkmate and Decibel, albeit those were smaller, but again, those were nice kind of franchise fits into the business.
Ryan Crowe: Next question, please, Shannon.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open
Mohit Bansal: Great. Thank you for taking my question. And congrats on all the progress. My question is regarding the ulcerative colitis trial you are doing with Dupixent. Could you talk a little bit about the rationale behind that? And are you enriching this trial in any way on the basis of eosinophil counts or any other marker there? Thank you.
George Yancopoulos: Yes. So as you sort of hinted at, what we have realized is that all of the diseases that we are treating with Dupixent really are interrelated diseases that reflect a systemic disorder that is upregulation of so called Type 2 inflammation. And in some cases it manifests in the lungs, in some cases in the skin, in some cases in the gut, and so forth all over the body, and in many cases in most patients, actually in more than one location. And so in every disease that we’re going after, including now, as you mentioned, in ulcerative colitis, we believe that there are a subset of patients who may be marked with Type 2 inflammation in their gut. We are, as you say, indicating, utilizing biomarkers that might select out these patients. And so we’re going to see whether a subset of ulcerative colitis patients are driven by this Type 2 inflammation that’s driving all the other related manifestations of this systemic disorder.
Ryan Crowe: Thanks, George. Let’s move to the next question, please, Shannon.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.
Chris Raymond: Yes, thank you. Just maybe Dupixent in [ph] COPD, I think the last time we talked to you guys on this, you were talking about the risk reward on taking an interim look on notice, just given the alpha hit. Looks like you’ve decided to take that step here. But can you give us a sense of the alpha hit [ph] you are taking by doing this interim look? Just looking at BOREAS, with the 30% reduction in exacerbations, it would seem you’d have a decent amount of room here if notice is tracking similarly. But if you can give us any more color on how you’re thinking about this risk reward of this decision and assume you’re going to press release that result of that if it’s going to be the end of the year? Thanks.
Leonard Schleifer: Yes. We’re not going to get into the details of the statistical niceties on how you do this. An alpha sparing approach is what’s typical for an interim analysis. We’ll work closely with Sanofi on how to do this in the most efficient manner possible and get to the information as appropriate when it appears.
Ryan Crowe: Thanks, Len. Next question, please, Shannon.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Colin Bristow of UBS. Your line is now open.
Colin Bristow: Good morning and congrats on the quarter. Not surprisingly, we’ve been getting an increasing number of questions on your obesity assets. And I was wondering if you could just talk to your strategy and level of enthusiasm here and maybe frame out some of the timelines, GPR75 [ph], the leptin receptor antagonist. I think you shared some pretty provocative data at ADA on the myostatin blocker and the Activin A blocker. Maybe you could just tell us your level enthusiasm is this something that you’re going to go full force and plan to have a major presence in down the road? Just some color there would be helpful. Thank you.
George Yancopoulos: Yes. As you said, we’re very excited about, I guess, two of the approaches that we’ve been taking in obesity. One is our unique collection of targets that we’ve either been the first to discover, like the GPR75 genetically identified target that came from our Regeneron Genetics Center, which is a very exciting new target for obesity, as well as our new approaches such as our leptin receptor agonistic antibody. But one thing we’re doing is moving those programs forward and understanding exactly what their potential is in the field of obesity. But as you said, right now, the field which is dominated by these GLP-1 agonists also is recognizing increasing problems with this type of weight loss, meaning that about 40% of the weight loss is due to muscle loss. That means if you lose 20 pounds, eight pounds of that approximately on average, will be muscle. Most patients will never get that muscle back. This can, over time, especially if patients go off these drugs and regain the weight as fat can create potentially a very large public health problem and dilemma. So we also have been, as you pointed out, very active in the field of muscle preservation and muscle growth agents. We’ve developed some, I think, some of the most exciting candidates in the field that have the ability to do this. And we are certainly considering how to study these muscle preservation and muscle growth agents in combination with existing weight loss agents to see whether we can maintain or even grow muscle in the setting of weight loss. Hopefully, perhaps increasing the quality of the weight loss, maybe even resulting in greater weight loss. But most importantly, making sure that the patients, in terms of their muscle and so forth, do a lot better. And we will be talking about our clinical trials in this area, we hope, very shortly.
Ryan Crowe: Okay. Thanks, George. Next question, please, Shannon.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Van Buren of TD Cowen. Your line is now open.
Tyler Van Buren: Great. Thanks guys. And congrats on the tremendous quarterly results. It’s great to see the early EYLEA HD sales, of course, and you mentioned that naive and switch patients are being treated. But are you seeing switches from VABYSMO specifically, and to what extent are you guys sending samples out as we think about assessing additional demand beyond sales?
Marion McCourt: Thanks, Tyler. So let me address the first part and the positive anecdotal case reports we’re getting back really carry across the theme of better vision, better drying than they’ve seen with other anti-VEGF products. They also comment on very frequently the tremendous confidence that they have in the safety of EYLEA and the experience over many, many years. In terms of the switches, it’s early days. We are seeing switches from EYLEA, as you would expect, and of course, we’re the category leaders. So there are more potential patients to consider as well. But we are also hearing switches from faricimab. We’re hearing also switches from Avastin and other products in the category. And the early reports have been quite encouraging. To your other part of your question related to sampling. We do have a sampling program for EYLEA HD. It’s intended to give physicians experience with EYLEA HD in an appropriate way. The program is constructed on an on demand basis. We don’t disclose the number of samples or things of that sort. And certainly that’s not what you were asking. But I can share with you that we have seen a high conversion rate from practices ordering EYLEA HD samples and then subsequently placing orders of commercial product through commercial channels.
Ryan Crowe: Thank you, Marion. Next question, please?
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you. This is [indiscernible] on for Terence Flynn. Thank you for taking our question. Quick one from us. Could you provide an update on the timing or relative implications of the biosimilar EYLEA litigation with Mylan? Thank you.
Leonard Schleifer: Yes. So we had a trial in West Virginia, a bench trial, and we are waiting for a decision from the Judge. It’s out of our control, and as soon as it comes, it’ll come. It’s been several months. So it could come soon or not. It’s one of those things where it’s really beyond our ability to predict and control.
Ryan Crowe: Thanks, Len. Next question, Shannon.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Carter Gould with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Carter Gould: Great. Good morning and congrats on all the progress. Maybe a follow up for Marion. Thanks for all the color on the commercial dynamics for high dose EYLEA. One thing you didn’t touch on as much, though, is sort of how maybe some of the step edit language has evolved. Is that sort of tracking in line with what you were seeing with standard dose EYLEA or any broader commentary on how that’s tracking relative to your expectations? Thank you.
Marion McCourt: Sure. So, as a quick reminder, as we get into payer mix, I’ll remind everybody that these are approximates based on typical patterns in the category. It’s a little bit different when you look at a product that just launched, but about 45% of our overall business is in Medicare fee for service. And as I mentioned to you in the call today, we’ve made great progress there, not only in coverage, which is the first step to get coverage, but then taking the extra step to make sure that claims are being paid. So we’re seeing now that 100% of Medicare fee for service jurisdictions have coverage and demonstrated paid claims. When we go over to Medicare Advantage, which is roughly about 25% of anti-VEGF category business, and commercial, which is about 20, what we’re seeing so far. And we are making good progress with payers. We’re seeing that EYLEA HD is being positioned consistently with EYLEA and other brands in the category. And there are plans, as you know, that have a step edit or utilization management. The good news is that EYLEA HD is being positioned consistently with EYLEA and other brands. We don’t see a differentiation there. 
Ryan Crowe: Okay, Marion. Thank you. Next question, Shannon, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Truist Securities. Your line is now open.
Robyn Karnauskas: Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. Question on CSU. I know it’s a big opportunity. Many patients are not controlled well with antihistamines, and you have a CRL. Is Study C sufficient anything in particular you think the FDA is looking for? Is there a disconnect or they’re changing what they view for the bar for approval? What’s your thoughts there? Thanks.
George Yancopoulos: Yes. Well, as you know, we had one very positive study. We had a second study that actually had a P of 0.049, but for various statistical purposes, just missed meeting its predetermined statistical hurdle. But it’s certainly all the indicators were going in the right direction. And what the FDA indicated that they wanted to see the results of our ongoing Study C, as we call it, to make their decision. And so what we’re hoping is that that study, which is in the same population of the very positive initial study, remember the second study was in these recalcitrant patients who had failed [indiscernible], among other therapies. But Study C is in the same population as our very first Study A, the very positive study. And we're hoping that if we get consistent data in that study, that the FDA will consider and look favorably upon it.
Ryan Crowe: Okay. Thanks George. Next question Shannon.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Salveen Richter: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. With regard to your cancer portfolio, as we look to additional data coming out at ASH and the proof of concept we've seen so far, but combination data that we're looking to with Libtayo. Can you just talk to us about the optimization still required here and how you're thinking about positioning it in the context of emerging targets and competitive dynamics? Thank you.
George Yancopoulos: Yes. We have a very large collection of combination opportunities that we're very excited about. The first one that we hope has a chance of really crossing the finish line in a very significant way, in a very seen population, is our combination of Libtayo in combination with fianlimab, putting together these two checkpoints, the anti-PD-1 and the anti-LAG-3. And I think in this case, we believe we have evidence that we have the best-in-class type of activity with both agents separately. And as you've hopefully seen in our earlier stage clinical trials, the data suggests that when we put them together, we really can make a remarkable advance for patients in terms of the number of patients who respond and the extent of their progression-free survival. And we're now, as we announced in a pivotal trial where we hope that we will in the – within the next year, perhaps be able to provide the results from that trial, which might confirm this remarkable advance for patients. If it works in this first-line melanoma setting, it really opens up the door to a whole series of other opportunities both in related melanoma settings, such as an even earlier stage melanoma setting such as the adjuvant and perioperative settings, but we could be moving to other cancers as well with that proof of principle. So that's the nearest term Libtayo checkpoint combination approach. As you know, with our bispecifics, the combination opportunities there are also very exciting, either with Libtayo or with each other. And we have, in that space shown that our individual agents, the important thing is we have now validated so many of our individual agents as having once again the potential for best-in-class type of activity, whether it's our agent for myeloma or our CD20 bispecific in, for example, follicular lymphoma and so forth and so on. But we're also excited about our costim bispecifics. We've released the data about the incredible efficacy in, at early stages that we see in combination with Libtayo. But that one – that one is countered by concerns with immune-mediated adverse events that we're seeing in these patients. It is hard to dramatically increase the extent of immunotherapy benefit without having it associated with increased autoimmune type reactions. We're working very hard on that, and we think, based on preclinical data that the trick may be combining our costims with our CD3 bispecifics where we don't see these dramatic potential increases in the mechanisms that may lead to immune adverse events. So in summary, our checkpoint combinations are very near-term. Our bispecifics are single agents have been validated and hopefully will be being considered by the FDA for approval in the relatively near future. And the combinations are beginning to demonstrate exciting opportunity, and we're trying to tune that in order to try to present the best efficacy safety profile for patients.
Ryan Crowe: Alright. Thank you, George. Shannon, please the next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Brian Abrahams: Hey, guys. Congrats on the good launch so far. And thanks for taking my question. You mentioned in the press release some impact of price on EYLEA. I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on this, when you think this might stabilize; any extent that this might affect high-dose EYLEA as well? Thanks.
Marion McCourt: Sure, Brian. So I would comment that in an increasingly competitive category, there of course, there's been some pressure on EYLEA. I'd also reflect that in 12 years in the market, it's really modest rebating and discounting if you look at the history of the brand. And of course, that on a brand that has never taken a price increase. But we will continue to be very much watching uptake of EYLEA HD, taking very responsible and appropriate and thoughtful measures on pricing. And certainly, as I reported to early days, we're making some very strong progress in the marketplace in terms of making sure that physicians gain confidence in reimbursement of EYLEA HD as they initiate patients.
Ryan Crowe: Okay. Thanks Marion. Please the next question, Shannon.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Yatin Suneja with Guggenheim. Your line is now open.
Yatin Suneja: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Question on Dupixent. Could you maybe share your views on the newer mechanism? For example, OX40 or perhaps a longer-acting version of Dupixent on the franchise; maybe if you can talk about your efforts in terms of life cycle management of Dupixent? Thank you.
George Yancopoulos: Yes. Maybe getting back to some of the comments that I made before. The collection of so-called allergic or Type 2 conditions, which Dupixent addresses, are all characterized by a systemic inflammatory problem increase in the so-called Type 2 inflammation, which if you look at the science and literature is really of this digital pathway that largely evolved and was one of the most active parts of the immune system to fight things like fecal parasites, which are really not an issue now in the developed world. This part of the immune system should essentially in the modern world be entirely quiescent. It serves almost no role. The problem is it becomes unleashed abnormally to do things that it shouldn't be doing, like fighting allergens or attacking the skin or the gut in atopic dermatitis or eosinophilic esophagitis. What Dupixent does uniquely is that it controls, and the data now demonstrate this, the incredible effect that it puts this useless angry tiger back in the cage where it belongs. And that is why it has this incredible profile of not only efficacy but safety. Because what's shutting down is it's shutting down a pathway that should be vestigial in the modern world that becomes unleashed and attacks all different parts of the body. We believe that any of this current competition that's ongoing doesn't share these remarkable features that give Dupixent its incredible broad efficacy across the spectrum of diseases with its unique safety profile. Because all of these other approaches, including, for example, the OX40 approach and so forth, are addressing different fundamental immune pathways that are important in the immune system's function to do a lot of actual useful things in the modern world, like, for example, fighting viral infections in cancer and so forth. So Dupixent really has a very unique profile, which if we can help explain and if all physicians and patients can understand it, make it the perfect drug for this condition. It uniquely blocks this digital pathway that gets out of control and appropriately and causes disease all over the body. Dupixent shuts down this what should be a vestigial pathway, and it helps disease, whether in the same patients, it could be manifesting in the skin in the lungs, in the nodes, in the gut and so forth, it shuts it down without really untoward effects with regards to the ability of the body to actually fight infections and so forth. In fact, if you look at our clinical studies and some of the data that we published, in many, if not most cases, you actually see unbelievably reduced infections in the setting of the Dupixent treatment. Because what you're doing is you're putting the bad part of the immune system back under control and you're allowing the rest of immune system to do its function. All of these other approaches are trying to attack critical parts of the immune system that have important other functions, and they don't address the widespread problem that occurs systemically and causes all of these diseases. So as you've seen already with various agents, they may work in one of Dupixent indications, but they don't work, they failed in other indications. And if they work, they also often come with the concerns about safety because they're designed to be immunosuppressive, which Dupixent is not.
Leonard Schleifer: So just to add a small point to what George's eloquent explanation of why Dupixent is such a special drug and the prediction that it would be safe because it's attacking this vestigial part of the immune system, you're looking at somewhere in the neighborhood of three-quarters of million people on the drug, many more than that so that have demonstrated the safety that is predicted by the science.
George Yancopoulos: Including in children, as we know, as young as six months is approved there where it's been demonstrating not only incredible safety but incredible efficacy.
Ryan Crowe: Great points. Thank you. Shannon, I think we have time for two more questions, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dane Leone with Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Dane Leone: Thanks for taking the questions, and congratulations on a strong quarter. Just actually really two quick ones for me. First one being, can you just comment whether you saw any impact from increased utilization of biosimilar ranibizumab during the quarter on EYLEA sales. A number of high-volume clinics had highlighted favorable margin opportunities from using more biosimilar ranibizumab, which seems to be potentially a transient impact and use of some of the brands, but it would be interested in your commentary there. And then we've gotten just a lot of inbounds in terms of ongoing patent litigation of EYLEA. Could you just maybe state for us what your current expectation is for EYLEA patent life? And just any thoughts you have on how the ruling that we're awaiting could actually impact your base case? Thank you.
Leonard Schleifer: Yes. So I'll cover the patents and then Marion can cover any additional insight into the marketplace. On the patents, we're involved in litigation. There's a couple of key patents that have evolved in this case that both relate to formulation as well as dosing. On the base case is that, for us, assuming that the exclusivity will expire in May, but we will see what happens in the litigation, which could be an upside, obviously, for the franchise.
Marion McCourt: All right. And on the ranibizumab impact, it's relatively early in their launches, and – but there hasn't been a notable impact to the category. The Lucentis biosimilar shares in the low single-digit area in the third quarter, and certainly the impact has been seen more relative to Lucentis, which has declining share. But certainly, this is not extended to EYLEA HD.
Ryan Crowe: Thanks Marion. We'll just take our last question, please, Shannon.
Operator: Our last question is from the line of Brian Skorney with Baird. Your line is now open.
Brian Skorney: Hey, thanks for taking my question. It looks like J&J had a really good first quarter of their myeloma bispecific. So it definitely seems like there's a good demand there. But also an element of them having control of a lot of offerings for myeloma. So obviously, [indiscernible] would always dominate each in oncology, but with the initial launch of your bispecific next year. I'm just wondering what your strategy is for competing in the initial late line as a third to market? Do you think that there is differentiated enough data here to kind of take share? Or is the focus really on generating data in earlier line of combos to kind of move up market share? Thanks.
George Yancopoulos: Well, of course, it's both. We do believe that data rules, the best, both efficacy, safety profile, but also convenience profile. And we will be continuing to show our evolving and maturing data, which we believe could result in best-in-class in terms of efficacy, in terms of response rates and complete response rates in terms of safety, in terms of the frequency of Cytokine Release Syndrome and so forth, and in terms of differentiation in terms of mandated hospitalization. So we will be continuing to present our data. Of course, we'll see exactly ultimately what gets in the label and what the FDA supports but there's the potential here for best-in-class differentiation in terms of efficacy, safety and convenience and schedule. And of course, as you said we're also moving with, we think, an exciting program in earlier lines of therapy. And all of this is also going to be combined with the opportunities for our future combinations. We have a variety of costim bispecifics that we're excited about combining specifically with this agent in the Plasma Cell Dyscrasias setting. So we think it's a very exciting opportunity. As you said, unfortunately there's a large opportunity out there because there's a lot of patients that are still in need. I think that if you have the best agent for late-stage patients. A lot of people want to use it. And then if we figure out the best program to demonstrate how it can be utilized in earlier-stage patients that can certainly enhance that opportunity let alone if we come up with one of our magic combos that really takes it to the whole next level.
Ryan Crowe: Okay. Thanks George, and thanks to everyone who dialed in today and for your interest in Regeneron. We apologize to those remaining in the queue that we do not have a chance to hear from. But as always, the Investor Relations team here is available to answer any remaining questions you may have. Thank you once again, and have a great day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-08-03 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Ryan Crowe, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.
Ryan Crowe: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening to everyone listening around the world. Thank you for your interest in Regeneron and welcome to our second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. An archive of this webcast will be available on our Investor Relations website shortly after the call ends. Joining me on today's call are Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Board Co-Chair, Co-Founder, President, and Chief Executive Officer; Dr. George Yancopoulos, Board Co-Chair, Co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer; Marion McCourt, Executive Vice President and Head of Commercial; and Bob Landry, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A. I would like to remind you that remarks made on today's call may include forward-looking statements about Regeneron. Such statements may include, but are not limited to those related to Regeneron and its products and business, financial forecast and guidance, revenue diversification, development programs, and related anticipated milestones, including anticipated regulatory actions, collaborations, finances, regulatory matters, payer coverage and reimbursement issues, intellectual property, pending litigation and other proceedings, and competition. Each forward-looking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected in that statement. A more complete description of these and other material risks can be found in Regeneron's filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30th, 2023, which was filed with the SEC this morning. Regeneron does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. In addition, please note that GAAP and non-GAAP measures will be discussed in today's call. Information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP is available in our financial results press release and our corporate presentation, which can be accessed on our website. Once our call concludes, Bob Landry and the IR team will be available to answer further questions. With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer. Len?
Leonard Schleifer: Thanks, Ryan, and thanks to everyone joining today's call. Regeneron delivered strong results across the organization in the second quarter of 2023, while continuing to make progress toward our long-term objective of growing the business while simultaneously diversifying its revenue and earning streams. Total revenues increased by 11% compared to the prior year quarter, primarily driven by Sanofi collaboration revenues and Libtayo net product sales, which grew by 39% and 49% respectively. Non-EYLEA revenue contributions were 41% of total revenues, the highest proportion for any quarter in the last 10 years excluding those with COVID antibody revenue contributions. Overall, we were pleased with the trajectory of the business and believe the company continues to be well-positioned to deliver long-term growth. In a few minutes George, Marion, and Bob will provide commentary on pipeline developments, commercial execution, and financial results that we achieved during the second quarter. For the remainder of my remarks today, I will focus on aflibercept 8 milligrams. We are very excited about the emerging clinical profile including the compelling two-year data from the pivotal PHOTON study in patients with diabetic macular edema which George will discuss in more detail. Now I will summarize the progress that has been made toward getting this important product candidate approved by the FDA. As we announced in late June, the Complete Response Letter or CRL that we received from the FDA regarding our Biologics License Application for aflibercept 8 milligrams for the treatment of patients with wet age-related macular degeneration, DME, and diabetic retinopathy did not identify any issues related to aflibercept 8 milligrams clinical efficacy, safety profile, trial design, labelling or drug substance manufacturing nor has the FDA requested any additional clinical data. The CRL was entirely based on unresolved observations, resulting from the May 2023 FDA pre-approval inspection of a third-party contract manufacturing organization, Catalent, that Regeneron engaged to complete vial-filling for aflibercept 8 milligrams. The inspection observations were noted in a Form 483 and related to a manufacturing line in Catalent's facility that is used to fill vials with aflibercept 8 milligrams, as well as our C5 antibody pozelimab for the ultra-rare CHAPLE disease, which has a PDUFA date of August 20th. The inspection was conducted as part of the FDA review process for both the aflibercept 8 milligrams BLA and the pozelimab BLA. Broadly speaking, the observation cited production and process control procedures, equipment validation, and facility maintenance. We, Catalent, and the FDA have had multiple discussions since the aflibercept 8 milligrams CRL. There is a clear understanding of the remediation work that is required to allow the FDA to assume approving BLAs that involve manufacturing on this line. Catalent has already provided data and information to the FDA that could satisfy some of these requirements and expects to be able to provide the remaining required data and information by mid-August. The FDA said they will strive to complete their review expeditiously prior to the August 20th PDUFA date for pozelimab. However, if they are unable to complete their review before this date, the FDA said that they may need to extend their review by up to three months. If they do extend the review, FDA has stated that they will continue to prioritize the review and complete it as early as possible. Importantly, the FDA has also stated that their review of the Catalent manufacturing data in the context of the pozelimab BLA will support actions for both the pozelimab BLA and the aflibercept 8 milligrams BLA resubmission, which has already been submitted. In summary, we and Catalent expect to submit by mid-August all of the Catalent manufacturing data and information required to address the observations resulting from the pre-approval inspection. The FDA has stated that they will strive to complete their review expeditiously, prior to August 20th. If not, we anticipate the FDA will act on pozelimab and aflibercept 8 milligram BLAs before the end of the third quarter. In closing, we remain confident in our strategy of focusing investments on our internal R&D capabilities while exploring potential external collaborations as well as in our ability to deliver breakthroughs to patients and value to shareholders. With that, let me turn the call over to George.
George Yancopoulos: Thank you, Len. I would like to start with our recent update on aflibercept 8 milligram data in DME that Len referred to. At the Annual American Society of Retina Specialists meeting, we presented the two-year results from our PHOTON study. These data demonstrated that the vast majority of aflibercept 8 milligram patients were randomized to the 12-week and 16-week dosing intervals continued to sustain vision and anatomic improvements through 96 weeks. 89% of all aflibercept 8 milligram patients were able to maintain at least every 12-week dosing intervals for the entire two-year period, while 84% of patients assigned to every 16-week dosing at baseline, were able to maintain that interval or extend beyond it. On that point, many patients met the criteria for extension to longer intervals, with 44% meeting the criteria for greater than 20-week dosing intervals, including 27% who were eligible for 24-week dosing intervals. The safety profile of aflibercept 8 milligram remained consistent with EYLEA. Sustaining vision and anatomic improvements while maintaining such extended dosing intervals over two years is unprecedented in the field. Our results further strengthen the clinical profile of aflibercept 8 milligram and position this investigational medicine to become the future standard of care retinal diseases. Later in the third quarter, we and Bayer are planning to share initial results from the second year analysis of the PULSAR study in patients with wet AMD. Moving to our immunology and inflammation pipeline on Dupixent. We look forward to the FDA decision for our sBLA in chronic spontaneous urticaria by October 22nd, 2023, in terms of Dupixent in patients with COPD. We and Sanofi are pleased to announce that Dupixent was granted breakthrough designation for uncontrolled COPD with an eosiniphilic phenotype based on the positive results of the Phase 3 BOREAS study. Based on ongoing discussions with the FDA, we expect that in addition to the BOREAS study results, we will need to provide data from the replicate Phase 3 NOTUS study to support a BLA and such data requirements remain under discussion with the FDA. We continue to expect final results for the NOTUS study by mid-2024. Moving to Itepekimab, our anti-IL-33 antibody, which is being evaluated for COPD in former smokers. In May, Sanofi announced that the Phase 3 AERIFY-1 and 2 studies had passed an interim futility analysis. These studies remain on track for readout and regulatory submissions in 2025. Both the Itepekimab and Dupixent could transform the treatment paradigm for COPD by levering their distinct mechanism of action in reducing different types of inflammation that contribute to COPD. Moving to oncology and combinations with Libtayo. In June, in an oral presentation at the ASCO conference, we presented data for the combination of fianlimab, our LAG-3 antibody plus Libtayo, which showed consistent response rates ranging from 56% to 63% across three independent cohorts of advanced melanoma patients, including a new cohort of patients who had received prior anti-PD-1 therapy in the adjuvant melanoma setting. These response rates represent about double the rate historically seen with anti-PD-1 monotherapy in similar settings and clinically meaningful responses were observed in Post Hoc analysis of various populations of interest, including patients with poor prognosis factors and varying tumor PD-L1 expression levels. The safety profile of fianlimab and Libtayo combination in these cohorts appears to be generally consistent with the safety profile of Libtayo monotherapy and other anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 agents, except for the higher rates of adrenal insufficiency, which were Grade 2 or lower in the majority of cases, with all cases successfully managed with steroid replacement. Our fianlimab plus Libtayo Phase 3 studies in metastatic and adjuvant melanoma are enrolling patients as are the Phase 2 portions of the Phase 2/3 studies in advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Next on to bispecifics for solid tumors, which are being investigated in combination with Libtayo and other modalities. Later this year, we are planning to share initial clinical data for the combination of ubamatamab, our MUC16xCD28 bispecific plus Libtayo in advanced ovarian cancer. Last year we showed encouraging ubamatamab monotherapy data in advanced ovarian cancer and we believe that combining it with Libtayo may lead to enhanced anti-tumor activity. Moving to costimulatory bispecifics. We are currently exploring multiple different CD28 costimulatory bispecific antibodies in early clinical trials in a variety of tumor settings, in combination with Libtayo well with corresponding CD3 bispecifics in our Phase 1 study of REGN5678, our PSMAxCD28 costimulatory bispecifics in advanced prostate cancer in combination with Libtayo, which has demonstrated promising anti-tumor activity. The safety profile of this combination continues to pose a challenge, highlighted by the recently observed second Grade 5 adverse event or death. Although serious immune-mediated adverse events continued to be highly correlated to patients who experience profound responses, we have decided to discontinue enrollment of new patients with the full dose Libtayo combination and explore PSMAxCD28 combination with lower doses of Libtayo. We also will continue to explore PSMAxCD28 as a monotherapy, where we have seen anti-tumor activity in some patients and we will explore PSMAxCD28 in combination with other immunotherapy modalities. We believe our prostate cancer data support the exciting potential of costimulatory bispecifics both the challenge of focusing the response solely to the tumor. Our preclinical studies and mechanistic insights suggest the degree of immune-related adverse events seen when combining costims with PD1 blockade may depend on the particular costim target and tumor types. Moreover, combining costims with CD3 bispecifics may not result in these types of severe immune-mediated adverse events. Along these lines, our other costimulatory bispecific programs continue, including our MUC16xCD28 costim with Libtayo and MUC16xCD28 costim with ubamatamab both in ovarian cancer as well as our EGFRxCD28 costim with Libtayo in colorectal and other cancers. In these early dose-escalation studies, we have observed limited immune-mediated toxicities to-date. We are also excited about combining our costimulatory bispecifics with our CD3 bispecifics in our hem/onc programs, which continue to progress. We have initiated dosing of our CD22xCD28 costimulatory bispecifics with odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific in relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, which we hope can improve on the impressive efficacy demonstrated by odronextamab alone in that setting. In terms of odronextamab monotherapy, US and EU regulatory submissions for both relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma remain on track. Regarding linvoseltamab, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific, we recently presented updated data at the ASCO Annual Meeting demonstrating early deep and durable responses in patients with heavily pre-treated multiple myeloma, with 71% objective response rate and 59% of patients achieving a very good partial response or better at the recommended 200-milligram dose with a median follow-up of only six months, with the data potentially improving as they mature. We believe these data support linvoseltamab's best-in-class potential with differentiated efficacy, safety, hospital requirements, and favorable dosing schedule. In the fourth quarter this year, we are planning to present additional data with longer follow up and to submit regulatory applications for linvoseltamab. We also plan to start combination studies with myeloma-specific costim next year. Next to genetic medicines. In the second quarter, we and Alnylam jointly announced the first human data suggesting that a siRNA can be used to silence pathological genes in the brain, which may open up an entirely new approach to fighting back against neurodegenerative and other central nervous system diseases. We plan to initiate additional clinical programs for CNS diseases next year. As announced by our collaboration with Intellia, we plan to initiate the first in-vivo CRISPR-based Phase 3 clinical program by year-end, subject to regulatory feedback in patients with transthyretin amyloidosis cardiomyopathy. And in terms of our targeted gene delivery pipeline, we hope to initiate our first clinical program in 2024 for Hemophilia B. In conclusion, Regeneron's R&D engine continues to grow and deliver differentiated late and early-stage opportunities and we are looking forward to several important clinical milestones in the second half of this year. With that, I will turn the call over to Marion.
Marion McCourt: Thank you, George. In the second quarter, Regeneron delivered impressive results across our commercial portfolio, notably Regeneron medicines currently lead multiple disease categories and our future is promising with short and longer-term scientific innovations on the horizon. As Len mentioned, we eagerly await the anticipated approval of aflibercept 8 milligram for retinal diseases, beyond that our robust late-stage pipeline supports additional commercial opportunities that we anticipate will continue to drive growth. Starting with EYLEA, the anti-VEGF category leader in retinal diseases. US EYLEA net sales were $1.5 billion, down 7% year-over-year and up 5% quarter-over-quarter. EYLEA total category share remained stable at 46% over the last two quarters and at approximately 70% for branded share. At the end of the second quarter, there was minimal sequential change in wholesaler inventory levels compared to the levels at the end of the first quarter. Our strategic focus is to maintain and grow Regeneron's anti-VEGF leadership and we're well-positioned to deliver on the score in an increasingly competitive category. Last week at ASRS, we presented our two-year data in diabetic macular edema which further confirmed the unprecedented durability of aflibercept 8 milligrams, with 44% of patients assigned intervals of at least 20 weeks at the end of their second year. Market enthusiasm remains high for this important innovation and our commercial team is ready and excited to launch aflibercept 8 milligram upon approval. Moving now to Libtayo. Global net sales were $210 million, up 49% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. In the US, net sales were $130 million, up 43% driven by steady growth in non-melanoma skin cancer and strong growth in lung cancer. In lung cancer, Libtayo use in new patients share is accelerating, both monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy with an expanding base of prescribers in the community and academic settings. Outside the US Libtayo, net sales were at $80 million, a 58% increase on a constant-currency basis. Growth was driven by demand in the non-melanoma skin cancer indications and initial launches in lung cancer. We expect to drive accelerated performance as we build Regeneron's presence in key international markets and secure access and reimbursement for lung cancer indications. And lastly to Dupixent, which continues to revolutionize the lives of patients with type 2 diseases. Global net sales were approximately $2.8 billion, up 34% year-over-year on a constant currency basis and up 12% compared to the first quarter of 2023. In the US, net sales grew 33% year-over-year to $2.1 billion driven by growth across all indications and age groups. Once again, Dupixent is the number one prescribed biologic medicine for new-to-brand patients across all approved indications and is the category leader in total prescriptions in four out of five indications. We see impressive uptake across our recent US launches with significant opportunity for future growth. In eosinophilic esophagitis, well over 15,000 patients have been initiated since launch and we are actively investing in disease awareness initiatives to empower patients to seek diagnosis and treatment for this debilitating disease. Our prurigo nodularis launch is off to a fast start with physicians rapidly recognizing Dupixent as the go-to treatment for this often underdiagnosed dermatologic condition. Additionally, we look forward to our October 22nd PDUFA date in chronic spontaneous urticaria, where we estimate Dupixent could benefit up to 300,000 US patients. We also continue to generate impressive growth across atopic dermatitis, asthma, and nasal polyps, Dupixent's three largest indications. There is robust demand among all indicated age groups with a significant opportunity for future growth beyond the hundreds of thousands of patients around the world, whose lives have already been transformed by Dupixent. In summary, we delivered a strong commercial performance in the second quarter with Regeneron's medicines positioned for sustained growth. We continue to demonstrate industry-leading execution across our current portfolio and we are prepared to maximize opportunities from our robust pipeline, with the goal of extending Regeneron's scientific innovations to even more patients. Now I will turn the call over to Bob.
Robert Landry: Thank you, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Regeneron's second quarter results demonstrate continued growth and strong financial performance across the organization. Second quarter 2023 total revenues increased 11% year-over-year to $3.2 billion, driven by strong Dupixent sales growth coupled with improving profitability within our Sanofi collaboration and continued momentum from Libtayo. Second quarter diluted net income per share was $10.24 on net income of $1.2 billion. Moving to collaboration revenue and starting with Bayer. Second quarter 2023 ex-US EYLEA net product sales were $886 million, up 4% on a constant currency basis versus second quarter 2022. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $377 million, of which $350 million related to our share of EYLEA net profits outside the US. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $944 million in the second quarter and grew 39% versus the prior year. Our share of profits from the commercialization of Dupixent and Kevzara was $751 million, an increase of 51% from the second quarter of 2022, reflecting higher volumes and an improving margin profile for Dupixent. We expect further margin expansion from the collaboration driven by continued Dupixent global sales growth coupled with higher gross margins due to significant drug substance yield improvements resulting from dupilumab manufacturing process enhancements. These factors are also contributing to a gradual increase in the rate in which we are repaying the antibody development balance to Sanofi. Once this balance is fully repaid in the next few years, we expect a meaningful step up in our share of Sanofi collaboration profits. Recall that a portion of our Sanofi collaboration revenue was related to the manufacturing of commercial supplies, for which we are reimbursed by Sanofi. As we continue to face in the higher yield manufacturing process for Dupixent, we expect these second half reimbursements to be approximately 25% lower than the first half of 2023, with the fourth quarter expected to be the lowest of the year. Other revenues were $69 million in the second quarter, up 17% versus the prior year. We continue to expect other revenue to be higher in the second half of 2023 as compared to the first half. Recall that other revenue primarily includes reimbursements for the manufacturing of certain Regeneron discovered products commercialized by other companies, including ex-US Praluent, ARCALYST, and ZALTRAP, as well as royalties for Alaris and our share of global profits for ARCALYST. Moving now to our operating expenses. Second quarter 2023 R&D expense was $974 million, representing continued investment in our robust pipeline. Year-over-year R&D growth was primarily driven by higher headcount and related costs and funding of the company's pipeline which encompasses approximately 20 late-stage or potentially registrational studies including our ongoing aflibercept 8 mg studies. Phase 3 studies in earlier lines of therapy for our hem/onc product candidates and our advancing fianlimab development program. The increase in R&D expense was also driven in part by the impact of the 2022 amendments to the Sanofi collaboration agreements and increased manufacturing activity associated with the company's earlier-stage product candidates. SG&A was $562 million in the second quarter, reflecting the ongoing build-out of our ex-US operations following the acquisition of global rights to Libtayo last year, higher headcount and related costs, and higher contributions to an independent not-for-profit patient assistance organization. Second quarter 2023 COCM was $213 million up 44% versus the prior year driven by manufacturing costs associated with higher Dupixent volumes. As we progress the phasing of the improved manufacturing process for Dupixent, we expect COCM in the second half of this year to decline versus the first half as our unchanged 2023 COCM guidance reflects with the fourth quarter expected to be the lowest of the year. Now to cash flow and the balance sheet. In the first half of 2023, Regeneron generated approximately $2.1 billion in free cash flow. We ended the second quarter with cash and marketable securities less debt of approximately $12.6 billion. We continue to opportunistically deploy cash towards share repurchases throughout the second quarter, buying back $723 million of our shares. At current levels, we remain buyers of our shares, and as of June 30th, approximately $2.3 billion remained available for repurchases under our existing authorization. Finally, we've made some minor changes to our full year 2023 guidance ranges based on our first half results and our latest outlook for the remainder of the year. We have tightened guidance ranges for 2023 SG&A and R&D spend and provided updated guidance ranges for our effective tax rate. A complete summary of our latest full year guidance is available in our press release issued earlier this morning. In conclusion, Regeneron delivered positive financial results in the second quarter of 2023 and we remain excited for the potential upcoming launch of aflibercept 8 mg in the third quarter. With that I will now pass the call back to Ryan.
Ryan Crowe: Thank you, Bob. This concludes our prepared remarks, we will now open the call for Q&A. To ensure we are able to address as many questions as possible, we will only be able to answer one question from each caller before moving to the next. Shannon, can we go to the first question, please?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Evan Seigerman with BMO. Your line is now open.
Evan Seigerman: Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking my questions and on all the updates today. So on the 8 milligrams CRL, do you have any idea if it's a Class 1 or Class 2 resubmission? And you say that FDA is going to take action in the third quarter or could take action. What does that mean? Are they going to provide an approval decision or is that just going to be acceptance of a refiling? Thank you.
Leonard Schleifer: Hi, Evan. It's Len. Thanks for your question. So just to clarify, the FDA has not classified the resubmission as Class 1 or Class 2 because they have said that the timeline for pozelimab will be governing what happens with our 8 milligrams. So let me remind you what happened, it was a pre-approval inspection for both products. The pozelimab is for our ultra-rare disease -- CHAPLE disease and it has a PDUFA date of the 20th. What the FDA has said is that they will review the remediation efforts in the context of the pozelimab BLA and therefore, whatever happens there will govern the timeline and results. And when we say we expect them to take action, we mean, we expect them to make an approval or not decision. If they find the manufacturing remediation acceptable for the pozelimab, then we think they will be in a position to promptly make a decision on approval for the 8 milligrams. Does that answer your question?
Ryan Crowe: He is off the line. We will move to the next question Shannon.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Van Buren with TD Cowen. Your line is now open.
Tyler Van Buren: Hi, there. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So the timeline to the FDA potentially taking action by the end of this quarter and high-dose EYLEA is very encouraging and investors are clearly surprised by the short lines. So kudos to you all for executing. But as we think about the data submission in a couple of weeks, what additional detail can you provide regarding the manufacturing data and other information that are required from Catalent? And how feasible it is to review this in a few days prior to the pozelimab decision date on August 20th?
Leonard Schleifer: Right. Great question. So we've been in very close contact with Catalent and the FDA, multiple meetings, oral, written, and so forth, and we have a clear understanding of what's required from an information point of view and from a data point of view. The submissions have been on a rolling basis that as Catalent has completed work, they've submitted data and information already to the FDA. There is very little that will be left for the last submission at the middle of August, and that's why the FDA has told us and they know what's coming that they will strive to expeditiously review that. And if they can't get that done by the few days before the pozelimab PDUFA date, they have told us that they will prioritize our review and do that as soon as possible. That's why we have confidence about this getting done in this quarter. So to summarize the data has been coming in on a rolling basis. We have everything we need, the last piece of information that we'll be rolling in and submitted by the middle of the month, the FDA will strive expeditiously to review that in time for the August 20th PDUFA date. But if not, there will be a clock extension for up to three months, but they have told us that they will prioritize our review. And that's why we believe it will get done, if not in time for the pozelimab PDUFA date in the near future thereafter.
Ryan Crowe: Okay. Thanks, Len. Next question, please Shannon.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Mohit Bansal: Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. And really thank you very much for providing all the clarity on the filing situation right now. Maybe taking -- so just trying to understand this a little bit more. So is it fair to say you have already submitted everything for pozelimab and the remaining part is related to high-dose EYLEA only? Is that fair?
Leonard Schleifer: Actually, the way you should think about it, we've submitted everything we need for pozelimab except for the final remediation of the pre-approval inspection, which applies both to pozelimab and to the 8 milligram EYLEA. So it's a single pre-approval inspection same data and information required for both. Once that is in then we will have completed everything necessary for pozelimab and for the EYLEA 8 milligrams. They are linked together. The FDA has clearly stated to us that the review of this remediation in the context of the pozelimab BLA will govern what happens to the 8-milligram remediation.
George Yancopoulos: And I think there is nothing specific to either pozelimab or aflibercept about the data. This has to do as Len said with general manufacturing processes and operations at the Catalent manufacturing facility, particularly with this one manufacturing line.
Leonard Schleifer: Hey, that's a very good point, George. So that's why the single pre-approval inspection applies to both products. It wasn't the product specifically, it was the processes and validation on the line that fills the two products. So one remediation satisfies both, all the data and information that is being submitted on a rolling basis, the last piece comes in, in the middle of August, the FDA is aware of this. They've told us in writing that they will strive to do that as expeditiously. If they get it done before the end of the PDUFA, an original PDUFA clock, that's great. If they don't, they'll consider an amendment that will set the clock back three months. But notwithstanding that three months, they've told us that they will continue to prioritize our review. So we're very pleased and we're working very hard. Catalent is working very hard, the FDA is working very hard, everybody wants this done properly and finished and properly remediated.
Ryan Crowe: Okay. Next question please, Shannon.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.
Tim Anderson: Thank you very much. I have a question on the Vabysmo. So Roche at Q3 said they're capturing 30% of treatment-naive patients which seems like a quite high figure frankly. And then they said afterward, that it's not the extended dosing that's driving this as much as it is the better drawing that they say docs or seeing with their product. I'm wondering how those comments kind of line up with what you're seeing play out in the US market. Thank you.
Marion McCourt: Sure. So, Tom, I will comment on our EYLEA performance. And as I just shared with you the performance in the quarter was strong, certainly we see EYLEA steadily as the standard-of-care in the anti-VEGF category. We continue to capture not only naïve-patients, but also another big source of business is switch patients from Avastin. Obviously, the other branded competitors are smaller in market today. But I would say that beyond your comment, probably best to get more clarification from the individuals who are commercializing faricimab in the market. But certainly, I do want you to know that we are seeing continued strength in EYLEA performance and obviously very much look forward to having the potentially game-changing opportunity of bringing aflibercept 8 milligrams into the marketplace and where the profile of efficacy, safety and durability has so many KOLs and prescribers excited based on what they've seen recently in the clinical data presented at ASRS.
Ryan Crowe: Thanks, Marion. Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.
Chris Raymond: Thanks. Just maybe another market-related question. So I know these extended dose therapies have benefits in and of themselves on the face of them. But there's been some decent level of market chatter around docs, looking to free up injection capacity specifically to make room for geographic atrophy patients and specifically with the Apellis drug. Just maybe curious how widespread was that notion before the Syfovre safety issue. And now with the issue have you noticed a discernible shift among docs who we're talking about that? And then maybe a related question, you guys have talked I think about an early effort of your own in geographic atrophy. Clearly, the market is sizable, when could we expect to hear more about that effort?
Marion McCourt: So let me share first in terms of the market dynamic. I think the most exciting thing and most important thing about aflibercept 8 milligram is it gives prescribers for all of their patients whether a naïve-patient, a patient currently on EYLEA or a patient on another anti-VEGF category product, the opportunity to decide if that patient is a candidate when we launch and when we have an FDA approval, is the patient is a candidate for aflibercept 8 milligram, that does have benefit to the patient and prescriber and potentially to the office capacity and patient flow. I think it's premature to comment on the category that we're not directly involved in. We are though very focused on making sure that we are ready for launch and certainly at the proper time, educating all stakeholders on aflibercept 8 milligram once we have an approval.
George Yancopoulos: And in terms of our own efforts, as I'm sure many are aware we've been very active with what we feel are very innovative approaches in the complement blockade field. And we believe that we may have an approach that may allow potential treatment in these retinal diseases. While avoiding some of the very concerning adverse events having to do with issues like inclusive vasculitis and so forth, and you'll be hearing much more about those efforts in the short-term.
Ryan Crowe: Okay. Thanks, Marion and George. Shannon, please move to the next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Carter Gould with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Carter Gould: Great, good morning. And thanks for all the transparency. Maybe switching gears a bit, in terms of the update on your costim and report of the death and the change in the dosing paradigm with 5678 in combination with Libtayo. George maybe you can speak about the implications for other combination efforts of CD28 with Libtayo, it's going to require lower dosing with those efforts with Libtayo portion and just the broader implications there and just fill your level of confidence you can kind of thread that needle in terms of the dosing levels? Thank you.
George Yancopoulos: Great question. Obviously, as you know, in cancer, the biggest hurdle is actually coming up with approaches and new classes of agents that have the ability to really change the efficacy paradigm to really bring new ability to address cancers that have previously been untreatable or refractory to treatment. So I think that, that excitement continues with the costim platform in terms of all of the signs and the preclinical modeling and predictions have really delivered in terms of showing that this new class does seemingly has the ability to really change the efficacy paradigm. But now we have to balance that as you said with the safety, because with more efficacy, which is often seen in the cancer field comes more safety concerns to what you just said, what we've seen preclinically and we're now beginning to see it in the clinic that the amount of associated immune adverse events is related to the particular costim target. So what you see for one costim doesn't necessarily apply to the other costim. So we are, as you said for our PSMA costim moving out of lower doses of the Libtayo because the full dose combination, while it seems like it has the potential to be very efficacious, but also has in some cases these associated only, remember only in the patients who are having deep responses, these associated in some cases, it can be very serious even resulting in death associated immune adverse events. So we're moving away from full dose combinations there and we're going and hoping that we can maintain some level of the efficacy, but avoiding these very serious immune-related adverse events. We're not doing that yet, because we're not seeing these sort of immune-related adverse events with our other costims. And the other very, very important thing just to remind you from our preclinical modeling, these types of immune-related adverse events that we're seeing with the PSMA in combination costim in combination with Libtayo are not seeing preclinically when you combine with the CD3 bispecific. And so we are very aggressively trying to move forward those programs as well, where we hope we may have a better efficacy, safety profile. So it's both a -- very exciting time to have these very active molecules, remember or remind you, we have three classes now, three independent classes of very active molecules that have been individually validated in our portfolio. We have the checkpoint inhibitors, in particular, our PD1 and our LAG-3 checkpoint inhibitors, which are validated. We have our CD3 bispecifics which are validated and we now have our costims which are validated from the efficacy perspective, very exciting time to be mixing and matching them. The challenge is to mix-and-match them appropriately to maximize the signal-to-noise, the therapeutic benefits relative to the potential adverse events we see in the patients.
Ryan Crowe: Thanks, George. Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Salveen Richter: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question and nice updates this morning. Clearly the possibility of a permanent J-code now has moved to April and it shortens the runway for patients switching from EYLEA ahead of potentially loss of exclusivity in May. So kind of a two-part question here. What are the dynamics around this and how do you, on one hand kind of maintain and grow the switch population from EYLEA? But secondly, how should we think about the uptake of high-dose EYLEA without a permanent J-code? Thank you.
Marion McCourt: Hi Salveen. So I'll get started. Certainly, we're conscious of the dates and the requirement for submissions to CMS that occur at the start of a quarter. So we would estimate potentially the time frame that you're referencing, if we have an approval in the third quarter. What I would share is that we anticipate use of aflibercept 8 milligram after approval and launch before we have the permanent J-code. Retina specialists are sophisticated in their reimbursement capabilities at the office level. They are experienced with newer products coming into the marketplace on a fairly regular basis and how to make certain that they validate reimbursement for products prior to having the permanent J-code under a temporary J-code. So obviously, we want to have the permanent J-code that will be a positive. But certainly, we do see the opportunity for uptake across patient types prior to that situation with CMS.
Ryan Crowe: Okay. Thanks, Marion. Shannon, please move to the next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Terence Flynn: Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. Len, I know we've talked about this before, but the company has been somewhat non-traditional on pricing decisions historically. You guys priced EYLEA at a discount to Lucentis. You worked with ICER on Dupixent pricing. So just wondering why we shouldn't expect it similar approach here with high-dose EYLEA. Thank you.
Leonard Schleifer: Thanks, Terrence. If your comments referencing similar, I mean, thoughtful and appropriate, we would agree.
Ryan Crowe: Okay. Next question please Shannon.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Brian Abrahams: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on all the progress and appreciate all the details. Maybe just another clarification on 8 milligram aflibercept. Can you characterize your level of confidence that a re-inspection would not be required? Have you had any interactions or feedback with the agency around this? And is there a defined period of time where the FDA would need to wait re-inspection or not to ensure that the remediations are sustainable before proving to BLAs? Thanks.
Leonard Schleifer: Great. Thanks for your question. Look, we've tried to be 1,000% transparent as usual Regeneron. And this is really, let me just see if I can summarize it, again, what we know. We've been in close contact with the FDA as has Catalent. We know what the remediations required are and we've been submitting them on a rolling basis. We expect to submit the last requirement by the middle of August and that will be several days before the PDUFA date for the pozelimab BLA. The FDA has been very clear that they will strive to expeditiously review that. If they can, great. They can't, they said there would be a three-month clock extension. But even with a three-month clock extension, they've been very categorical in saying that they would prioritize our review and try and get it done as soon as possible. Those facts are what led us to believe it would be done during the third quarter. In all of this, is the fact that there has been no need, no discussion, no indication whatsoever that a re-inspection would be necessary. The FDA of course is free to make those decisions, but we have not seen any indication of that in our very detailed and close contact. So we've given you our best estimate at this point.
Ryan Crowe: Thanks, Len. Let's move to the next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Chris Schott: Great. Thanks so much. Can you just come back to the CD28 PSMA update? Maybe just elaborate a little bit more in terms of the approach of lowering the PD-1 exposure to address the safety issues here and taking that approach versus trying to work to further adjust the dosing of the bispecific piece of the equation? Thanks so much.
George Yancopoulos: Well, we should say that we are adjusting both doses. We have been already exploring a variety of doses from very low doses to the highest active doses on the costim side. But we've been doing all of them in the context of the full dose Libtayo. So now what we're doing is we're exploring some of the doses that are active, particularly ones are active as monotherapy, as I mentioned, there is monotherapy activity with the PSMA costim. And now we are -- to try to decrease these immune-related adverse events. Let me remind you, they are on the same sort of class of immune-related adverse events that you do see with checkpoint inhibitors in general. We're just seeing them in some patients, the one with the biggest responses in some cases to a greater extent. So we're hoping that lowering the checkpoint inhibition may allow us to adjust the therapeutic window there. But we are as you are saying dealing with a couple different doses of the costim, but now we're incorporating lower doses of the Libtayo into the program as well.
Leonard Schleifer: I think what George said earlier, just maybe it bears repeating, is that he said that we're starting with the good position of having very impressive efficacy, one. And two side effects that for the most part in the patients who are benefiting with the efficacy, that's a very good position to begin to explore and how to get the therapeutic index or signal to noise as George calls it right.
Ryan Crowe: Okay. Let's move to the next question, Shannon. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dane Leone with Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Dane Leone: Hi. Thank you for taking the questions. Congratulations on the updates and best of luck with the resolution of the reviews for pozelimab and 8 mg aflibercept. I actually want to ask you to expand a bit on your discussions with the FDA and potential filing or early filing on Dupixent for COPD. The point I'd like a little bit more clarity on specifically what you may be able to have from NOTUS before the final readout of that study that you could potentially include in a package with the BOREAS results to get the FDA comfortable with an accelerated review for that indication. Thank you.
George Yancopoulos: Yeah. What we know right now is that we're going to need data from NOTUS. And right now, as we said, we are still in discussions on what that data could be. And so right now, we don't have any details to give you.
Ryan Crowe: Okay. Thanks, George. Hopefully an update and next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Colin Bristow with UBS. Your line is now open.
Colin Bristow: Hey, good morning, and congrats on the quarter and the progress. Just maybe one on the itepekimab interim. Can you share anything on the utility threshold? And if not, specifically, could you say how the sort of Fed relative to BOREAS? Thanks.
Leonard Schleifer: I don't think we have anything specific. This was handled by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee sort of a standard approach. We're pleased that we passed it. And we will look forward to further data at the end of the study.
Ryan Crowe: And both we and Sanofi are blinded to that. We only got the go-decision from the Independent Data Monitoring Committee. So we will proceed to a final readout for both of those studies. Let's go to the next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Skorney with Baird. Your line is now open.
Luke Junk: Hey, this is Luke on for Brian. Thanks for taking the question. Can you just provide a little bit more color on what drove the Libtayo growth this quarter? Was there any stocking or was it largely demand-based? Thanks.
Marion McCourt: Thank you, Luke. And I'm pleased to share it is demand growth. Certainly, we see continued and steady performance across our skin indications both cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma. In addition to that, it is exciting that we are seeing not only an increase in the number of prescribers for our lung cancer indications, but the depth of prescribing is improving and increasing in both the community and also academic settings. But that is demand based, it is not stocking based.
Ryan Crowe: And I think Shannon we have time for two more questions, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Risinger with Leerink Partners. Your line is now open.
David Risinger: Yes, thanks very much. So my question is for George, on the costims, please. You mentioned that you haven't seen the immune age with respect to your other costim trials. Could you please comment on whether the dosing step-ups at this point are close to the higher dosing levels that you're stepping back from in the PSMA trial? I'm just trying to contextualize whether you really have advanced those other trials to the point to really know whether you're going to have similar problems in your other costim trials? Thanks very much.
George Yancopoulos: That's a very good and fair question. And those programs are at earlier stages, so we won't know until we are more advanced, whether when we get to the same sort of efficacy type levels, do we have the same sort of immune-related adverse events associations or not. What I was referring to is in the preclinical studies, the amount of this associated T-Cell activation that can lead to these sorts of immune-related adverse events varies depending on the tumor class and on the costim itself. So based on that we would expect to see different ratios of immune-related adverse events. Those other programs though right now are all-in stages where they are in with full dose Libtayo combinations at this point.
Ryan Crowe: Okay. Thanks, Shannon. We have time for one more question.
Operator: Our last question is from Akash Tewari with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Akash Tewari: Hey, thanks so much. I'll switch it up. I guess maybe for your obesity program, you had data at the ADA showing synergy with your myostatin inhibition program when combined with the GLP-1. I guess the natural observation here is Regeneron doesn't currently have a program in development. Is there any interest in acquiring one externally via BD or partnership at this time? Thanks.
George Yancopoulos: Well, what we would say is, we do think that obviously, there's a lot of focus on obesity and particularly these new agents that are causing a large amount of weight loss. But as you described is being increasingly recognized that the quality of this weight loss may prove challenging that many patients are actually losing muscle or lean body mass which is -- can be very detrimental particularly if they stay on these therapies or yoyo on and off them, that can really lead to substantial changes over-time and body composition can be very debilitating for patients. And as you said, we've had long investment in programs that can maintain muscle mass in various settings and we've shown that they can maintain or even grow muscle mass in the setting of these types of obesity treatments in our preclinical modeling. So obviously it is a very exciting opportunity to think about which is, can we combine some of our muscle preservation or growth strategies and biologics to prevent these concerning side effects that are being seen with the new class of profound weight loss agents. And so we are very actively pursuing everything that we can imagine. And hopefully, we'll be providing updates on our approaches as time goes along.
Ryan Crowe: Okay. Thanks, George, and thanks for everyone who dialed in today and for your interest in Regeneron. We apologize to those remaining in the queue that we did not have a chance to hear from. As always, the Investor Relations team is available to answer any remaining questions. Thank you once again and have a great day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-05-04 20:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Josh, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Ryan Crowe, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.
Ryan Crowe: Thank you, Josh. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening to everyone listening around the world. Thank you for your interest in Regeneron and welcome to our first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. An archive of this webcast will be available on our Investor Relations website shortly after the call ends. Joining me today are Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; Dr. George Yancopoulos, Co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer; Marion McCourt, Executive Vice President and Head of Commercial; and Bob Landry, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A. I would like to remind you that remarks made on today's call may include forward-looking statements about Regeneron. Such statements may include, but are not limited to, those related to Regeneron and its products and business, financial forecast and guidance, revenue diversification, development programs and related anticipated milestones, collaborations, finances, regulatory matters, payer coverage and reimbursement issues, intellectual property, pending litigation and other proceedings and competition. Each forward-looking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected in that statement. A more complete description of these and other material risks can be found in Regeneron's filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2023, which was filed with the SEC this morning. Regeneron does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. In addition, please note that GAAP and non-GAAP measures will be discussed in today's call. Information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP is available in our financial results press release and our corporate presentation, which can be accessed on our website. Once our call concludes, Bob Landry and the IR team will be available to answer further questions. With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer. Len?
Leonard Schleifer: Thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone joining today's call. Following our significant achievements in 2022, Regeneron is off to a good start in 2023, highlighted by important regulatory and pipeline advances, commercial execution and prudent capital allocation, all of which position better the company to deliver sustainable long-term growth and shareholder value over time. George, Mary and Bob will cover details of our first quarter performance in a few moments. In the meantime, I would provide an update on our goal of continuing to grow our business while simultaneously diversifying our revenue and earnings streams, which is part of our long-term vision for Regeneron. We have made substantial progress toward achieving that goal. Over the past four years, while total revenues have nearly doubled, EYLEA accounted for only 57% of total revenues in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 88% of total revenues for the year 2019. Driven primarily by the growth of DUPIXENT, our Sanofi collaboration accounted for 25% of our total revenues in the first quarter of 2023 compared to only 6% of our total revenues in 2019. We expect this trend of revenue growth, along with diversification to continue. For example, assuming the approval and successful launch of aflibercept 8 milligrams, which has a June 27 PDUFA date, EYLEA 2 milligrams is expected to become a smaller share of our revenues, while aflibercept 8 milligrams is expected to contribute to overall revenue growth. In addition, DUPIXENT remains in a high-growth mode, with global net product sales up 40% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year quarter, driven by growth across all 5 approved indications. We believe the positive Phase III results for DUPIXENT in the subpopulation of COPD patients with evidence of type 2 inflammation, as well as the promising results for our IL-33 antibody itepekimab in former smokers represent additional significant opportunities to accelerate revenue growth as well as diversification. Our oncology portfolio is also starting to make a meaningful contribution to our top line, with last year's acquisition of full global rights to Libtayo and the recent launch of Libtayo in combination with chemotherapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Moreover, we believe that fianlimab, our LAG-3 antibody, in combination with Libtayo, has the potential to become an important therapy in both melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer, where we have already advanced to pivotal studies. We are also quite excited about the emerging clinical profile for linvoseltamab, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific. Updated data for which will be presented at the upcoming ASCO Annual Meeting. We remain on track to submit a BLA seeking accelerated approval in late-stage myeloma later this year. We continue to invest in our research and development engine and expect it will deliver new differentiated medicines that will drive organic growth over time. Our broad development pipeline of nearly 3 dozen programs spans many different therapeutic areas and modalities, notably: Our co-stimulatory bispecifics in cancer; our early pipeline in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases; as well as our collaborations with Alnylam, Intellia, Decibel and others are expected to drive medium- and long-term revenue growth, profitability and diversification. Before handing over to George, I'd like to take a moment to recognize the contributions that Dr. Roy Vagelos has made to Regeneron over the nearly three decades that he has served as our Board Chair. Over the years, he has provided invaluable guidance and he continues to inspire us as we work to turn world-class science into medicines. Roy will retire from the Board after his current term ends next month. At that time, in addition to our current roles in the company, George and I will be appointed by the Board to serve as co-Chairs, and Christine Poon, a member of Regeneron board since 2010, will be appointed as the board's Lead Independent Director. With that, let me turn the call over to George.
George Yancopoulos: Thank you, Len. The first quarter of 2023 delivered multiple significant milestones for Regeneron and for our collaborations, from the positive DUPIXENT Phase III COPD data to progress in our oncology pipeline, as well as exciting new landmarks from our genetic medicines programs. Starting with DUPIXENT. In March, together with our Sanofi collaborators, we announced that DUPIXENT was the first immune mechanism of action treatment to produce statistically significant and clinically meaningful results in a Phase III trial for COPD in over a decade.  Our BOREAS trial enrolled COPD patients with moderate to severe disease and evidence of type 2 inflammation. DUPIXENT-treated patients demonstrated a clinically meaningful 30% reduction in exacerbations, a significant improvement in lung function as well as quality of life benefits: an impressive trifecta in a potential paradigm-changing treatment for this deadly disease. We are looking forward to presenting the detailed BOREAS results in a late-breaking presentation at the upcoming American Thoracic Society Meeting later this month. We also plan to discuss these exciting results with regulatory authorities and expect to report results mid next year for the replicate Phase III NOTUS study. I would remind you that we are also trying to address an overlapping COPD population with our IL-33 antibody, which is in Phase III studies based on positive Phase II proof-of-concept data. This approach is further supported by genetic analysis from our Regeneron Genetics Center, which demonstrated association of loss of function in IL-33 with reduced COPD risk. Similar genetic analysis supported the role for a DUPIXENT benefit in COPD. The BOREAS COPD data indicates that DUPIXENT can help even more patients beyond the 5 current FDA-approved indications and diseases caused or exacerbated by type 2 inflammation, including atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis. We are also expecting an FDA decision for DUPIXENT for chronic spontaneous urticaria on October 22, 2023, and we are continuing to tailor DUPIXENT development to patients with other type 2 inflammatory diseases, most likely to be responsive to this method. Moving to oncology. With the progress of our late and early stage pipeline, we are looking forward to several important milestones this year. Starting with Libtayo. In addition to expanded use in lung cancer, Libtayo was recently added to the NCCN guidelines for neoadjuvant treatment of CSCC. The Libtayo U.S. label was also recently updated with more mature CSCC and BCC data, supporting its differentiated clinical profile in these tumor settings and satisfying all post-marketing commitments that require full approval in these indications. Regarding our exciting new combinations with Libtayo. Starting with fianlimab, our LAG-3 antibodies, for which we are planning a broad pivotal program spanning several cancer indications. These efforts were triggered by our robust and confirmed data in first-line metastatic melanoma patients, which will be presented in further detail at ASCO, suggesting that the fianlimab-Libtayo combination could produce about double the response rates with longer progression-free survival, the anti-PD monotherapy standard. Based on this, we have already initiated pivotal trials in metastatic and adjuvant melanoma, and we will start a study in perioperative melanoma in the second half of the year. In addition, based on promising data in small patient cohorts, we started a seamless Phase II/III pivotal study for treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, and we will soon start a Phase II study in the perioperative setting. Next, the bispecifics for solid tumors, which are being investigated in combination with Libtayo. Earlier this year, ASCO's GU represented initial positive first-in-human data for our PSMAxCD28 costimulatory bispecific in combination with Libtayo in advanced prostate cancer, the tumor type considered immunologically cold and largely unresponsive to anti-PD-1 therapy alone. Over the next 12 months we plan to present updated PSMAxCD28 data in more patients, some of which will have been prophylactically treated with our anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, sarilumab, to potentially reduce the severity of immune-mediated side effects while maintaining or improving antitumor activity. Also during this time frame, we plan to present data in advanced ovarian cancer for both our MUC16xCD3 bispecific in our MUC16xCD3 co-stimulatory bispecific as well as data in several tumor types from our EGFRxCD28 costimulatory bispecific, or in combination with Libtayo. Our hematology oncology pipeline continues to advance. In an oral presentation at the upcoming ASCO Annual Meeting, we will present updated data for linvoseltamab, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific tested in late-line multiple myeloma. We believe these data will show that linvoseltamab has the best-in-class potential with differentiated efficacy, safety and a favorable dosing schedule in the competitive environment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma treatment candidates. We remain on track for a regulatory submission in the United States in the second half of this year for linvoseltamab. For odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific, we are on track to complete U.S. and EU regulatory submissions for both relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in the second half of this year. Odronextamab in late-line relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma has a potential best-in-class efficacy profile, and our optimized step-up dosing regimen has improved our generic safety profile without impacting efficacy. Also, we have initiated a first-in-human study of our CD20xCD28 costimulatory bispecific in combination with odronextamab in relapsed/refractory DLBCL, which we hope could further improve upon the anticancer benefit for these patients. Now to genetics medicines. Starting with our collaboration with Alnylam, and siRNA therapeutics. Just last week, we and Alnylam announced an important update for our Alnylam APP program in early onset Alzheimer's disease. For the first time, an siRNA therapeutic demonstrates sustained silencing of a pathological gene in the central nerve system in a clinical trial. In the earnings call this morning, our Alnylam collaborators provided additional details on these results. Our siRNA approach aims to prevent production of amyloid precursor protein as opposed to clearing existing amyloid plaques after they have already formed, providing a new way to potentially address Alzheimer's disease, which will still have a devastating impact on patients and their families even with the emergence of amyloid-clearing antibodies. Patients treated with single dose of ALN-APP experienced dose-dependent, rapid and sustained reduction of up to 90% in APP production as assessed by biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid. The safety and tolerability profile with single dosing is encouraging so far. While the multi-dose Part B portion of the study is on partial clinical hold in the United States due to finding reserved in prior nonclinical chronic toxicology studies, Part B has already received regulatory approval to proceed in Canada, where the majority of the part A clinical trial patients had been enrolled. Detailed results from the study will be presented in an upcoming medical meeting. We are looking forward to advancing additional development candidates for the many other neurodegenerative diseases that currently have few or no therapeutic options such as other targets for Alzheimer's as well as for ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease, Parkinson's and Huntington's. In addition to these exciting developments in central nervous system diseases, we are continuing our progress with liver targeted medicines, including our broad and multipronged approach to develop treatments for NASH, or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. We're enrolling a Phase II study of ALN-HSD in NASH patients with genetic risk factors, continuing in development of ALN-PNP, and we are planning to progress additional more recently genetically validated NASH targets as well. Finally, I would like to highlight our recently announced collaboration with Sonoma Biotherapeutics' discover, develop and commercialize regulatory T cell therapies for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. This collaboration will bring together our industry-leading technologies for the discovery and characterization of fully human antibodies and T cell receptors, as well as our additional biologics candidates with Sonoma's pioneering approach to developing and manufacturing gene modified T reg cell therapies. In conclusion, Regeneron's R&D engine truly continues its productivity in both late and early-stage pipeline. Before turning the call over to Marion, I would also like to thank Roy Vagelos for serving as a role model for all of us at Regeneron as well as for so many others across the industry. I hope that we can continue to live up to the high stage that Roy has set over his distinguished career. With that, I will turn the call over to Marion.
Marion McCourt: Thank you, George. Our first quarter performance demonstrates ongoing leadership across multiple therapeutic categories. Taken together, our in-market brands anticipated near-term launches and extensive development pipeline uniquely position Regeneron to expand our leadership across multiple disease areas. First quarter EYLEA U.S. net product sales declined 6% year-over-year to $1.43 billion. On a sequential quarter basis, EYLEA U.S. net product sales decreased 4%, reflecting the favorable impact of higher demand volume, offset by lower sequential wholesaler inventory levels, higher sales-related deductions and increasing competitive pressure. EYLEA captured approximately 70% branded share in the first quarter. Based on presentations at scientific meetings, the retina community has expressed increasing enthusiasm about Regeneron's portfolio with the aflibercept 8-milligram PDUFA date, now 7 weeks away. EYLEA is the well-established gold standard anti-VEGF treatment and aflibercept 8-milligram has the potential to be as paradigm changing as EYLEA when it was introduced more than a decade ago. In clinical trials of aflibercept 8-milligram demonstrated improvements in visual acuity with less frequent injections and a safety profile comparable to EYLEA, exactly what retina specialists have told us they need in a next-generation medicine. Launch preparations are well underway, and we look forward to bringing this important treatment option to patients following FDA approval. On Libtayo, which is foundational to Regeneron's oncology portfolio, first quarter global net product sales grew 49% on a constant currency basis, reaching $183 million, which includes $6 million from Sanofi transition sales in international markets. In the U.S., net sales grew 39% to $110 million. Libtayo continues to lead the market in both advanced CSCC and advanced BCC as demand volume increases. Following last November's FDA approval of Libtayo in combination with chemotherapy for first-line advanced non-small cell lung cancer, new patient starts have accelerated as physicians of Libtayo has an important new treatment option, initiatives to raise brand awareness and improve access have driven share gains in both the academic and community settings. Outside the U.S., Libtayo net sales grew 67% on a constant currency basis to $73 million, driven by steadily increasing demand and additional country launches. The European Commission recently approved Libtayo in combination with chemotherapy for PD-L1 positive lung cancer, and we are in the process of securing access and reimbursement for this new indication. Turning to DUPIXENT. First quarter global net sales grew 40% on a constant currency basis to $2.49 billion. In the U.S., net sales grew 43% to $1.9 billion, with notable volume growth across all approved indications. Driven by its outstanding efficacy and safety profile, DUPIXENT is the number one prescribed biologic for new patients in all 5 of its approved indications. In atopic dermatitis, DUPIXENT is the leading systemic treatment based on its unique mechanism of action, clinical profile and real world experience. Strong prescribing trends continue across moderate and severe disease and across approved age ranges. There's also significant opportunity to further increase market penetration as DUPIXENT is uniquely positioned to provide an effective, safe and convenient treatment for patients 6 months and older. In prurigo nodularis, DUPIXENT is the only FDA-approved systemic treatment. Launch update is progressing well, and we anticipate ongoing growth as we leverage our dermatology commercialization capabilities for patients in need. Across the competitive asthma space, DUPIXENT continues to gain market share as naive and biologic switch patients are initiated on treatment. DUPIXENT also continues to capture the majority of market demand in nasal polyps with increased prescribing from allergists and ENTs. Our cytosolic esophagitis launch is exceeding expectations. In the first year following U.S. approval, more than 11,000 patients have initiated therapy, demonstrating extensive unmet patient need and our strong launch execution and collaboration with Sanofi. Both gastroenterologist and analogists have embraced DUPIXENTas the new standard of care setting meaningful improvements in disease symptoms and quality of life for those now on therapy. A new patient campaign is underway to raise awareness of the scientific advancements in treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis. Outside the U.S., DUPIXENTnet sales were $587 million, growing 30% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across approved indications and launches in new geographies. Recent European approvals of eosinophilic esophagitis, prurigo nodularis and atopic dermatitis in young children are expected to contribute to DUPIXENT’s ongoing growth. In summary, our commercial portfolio continues to diversify across many serious medical conditions and delivered solid results in the quarter. Moving forward, we are well positioned to serve even more patients driven by the strength of our existing portfolio, coupled with anticipated launches that have the potential to advance standards of care. With that, I'll turn the call to Bob.
Bob Landry: Thank you, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Regeneron performed well in the first quarter of 2023 with solid financial results. First quarter total revenues increased 7% year-over-year to $3.2 billion as DUPIXENT and Libtayo contribute to increasingly diversified revenue and earning streams. First quarter diluted net income per share was $10.09 on net income of $1.2 billion, which included a previously announced $0.42 impact of acquired IPR&D. Beginning with collaboration revenue and starting with Bayer. First quarter 2023 ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales were $847 million, up 4% on a constant currency basis versus first quarter 2022. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $357 million, of which $332 million related to our share of EYLEA net profits outside the U.S. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $798 million in the first quarter and grew 26% versus last year's first quarter, which included a $50 million sales milestone that did not recur this year. Our share of profits from the commercialization of DUPIXENT and KEVZARA was $637 million, an increase of 53% versus the prior year. We continue to see increasing profitability from our antibody collaboration and expect further margin expansion as we begin to realize drug substance yield improvements from a new Regeneron developed manufacturing process for DUPIXENT. Finally, we recorded Roche collaboration revenue of $222 million in the first quarter for our share of gross profits from ex U.S. sales of Ronapreve related to a previously signed contract. We do not expect to record any additional revenue from Ronapreve in 2023, absent a new contract. Moving now to operating expenses. First quarter 2023 R&D expense increased 28% year-over-year to $960 million as we continue to invest in our pipeline to drive organic growth. The increase in R&D was primarily driven by higher headcount and related costs and funding of the company's growing pipeline, which now encompasses approximately 35 programs in clinical development in more than 15 ongoing late-stage studies with additional study starts expected this year. These late-stage programs include our expanding fianlimab development program, upcoming Phase III studies and early reliance for our hem/onc assets, as well as ongoing development programs for DUPIXENT and itepekimab for which we now record our full 50% share of development costs as a result of the Libtayo transaction. SG&A expense increased 32% year-over-year to $515 million due to higher contributions to an independent, not-for-profit patient assistance organization, higher headcount and related costs, and the impact of the Libtayo transaction. First quarter 2023 COCM was $249 million, up 26% versus last year, due to increases in shipments of ex-U.S. commercial supplies of Praluent to Sanofi and manufacturing costs for Dupixent. Reimbursements for these production costs are recorded as part of other revenue in Sanofi collaboration revenue respectively. Shifting now to cash flow and the balance sheet. In the first quarter of 2023, Regeneron generated $1.2 billion in free cash flow. We ended the first quarter with cash and marketable securities, less debt, of $12.3 billion. We have continued to strategically deploy our cash to deliver on our capital allocation priorities, which are focused on investing in innovation, both internal and external, as well as returning capital to shareholders. We purchased nearly $700 million of our shares in the first quarter with $3.1 billion remaining under our existing authorization as of March 31. Additionally, as George discussed, we announced the collaboration with Sonoma Biotherapeutics, investing $75 million through an upfront payment and equity investment to add a new approach to our scientific capabilities. I'd like to conclude with some select updates to our financial guidance and outlook for 2023. We are updating 2023 COCM guidance to be in the range of $820 million to $880 million, an increase of $90 million at the midpoint, reflecting increased shipments of ex-U.S. commercial supplies for Praluent and DUPIXENT to Sanofi. Importantly, these anticipated incremental expenses will be reimbursed by Sanofi, generally resulting in a neutral impact to Regeneron's 2023 operating profit. Approximately half of the incremental $90 million of reimbursements from Sanofi are expected to be recorded as Sanofi collaboration revenue, with the balance recorded as other revenue. As a result, we now expect 2023 other revenue to be higher than 2022 other revenue. For modeling purposes, second quarter 2023 other revenue is expected to be the lowest of the 2023 quarters, with the vast majority of the remaining other revenue to be recorded in the second half of this year. We are also updating our 2023 gross margin to be between 89% to 91%. The change in expected gross margin is primarily driven by an unfavorable change in product mix, as well as an increase in the start-up costs associated with our new fill/finish facility located in upstate New York. Finally, we are lowering our guidance for our effective tax rate to 10% to 12%, reflecting the benefit of higher than previously anticipated stock-based compensation deductions. In conclusion, Regeneron continued to deliver robust financial results in the first quarter of 2023, and the company remains well positioned to drive further growth in the remainder of the year and beyond. With that, I will now pass the call back to Ryan.
Ryan Crowe: Thank you, Bob. Josh, that concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call for Q&A. To ensure we are able to address as many questions as possible, we will answer one question from each caller before moving to the next. Please go ahead, Josh.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. You may proceed.
Mohit Bansal: Maybe, Marion, if you could elaborate a little bit on the EYLEA, over this more dynamic at this point a little bit. Given the weakness in the quarter, you did mention that Decibel is taking some share. So if you could elaborate on where the share is coming from? Is it more of a switch? Or do you think it is also some new patient starts? And your confidence level in terms of flipping this situation once high-dose EYLEA comes along.
Marion McCourt: Sure, very happy to comment. And as I noted, as we're reporting on the quarter performance on a sequential basis, we did see with EYLEA, if I look at a sequential quarterly basis, we did see with EYLEA a net product sales decrease of 4%. As I mentioned, it was driven by a number of factors. Certainly, competitive pressure is one, but we also reflected on while we had slightly higher demand volume. It was offset by lower sequential wholesaler inventory levels and overall tire sales-related deductions. Specifically as it relates to competitive pressure, I would say that this is overall competitive dynamic in the anti-VEGF category, not something that we would necessarily identify with a particular product, more the totality of competition. I will comment that in the quarter, we certainly maintained a 70% branded share and over at approximately, I believe it was a 46% share in the overall anti-VEGF category. So certainly standard of care with EYLEA. And very importantly, we look forward to launching aflibercept 8 milligram, as I mentioned now, is about 7 weeks away.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist. You may proceed.
Robyn Karnauskas: Just some questions on LAG-3, and thinking about the first-line melanoma market and you're going to be having data relatively soon. So what -- I guess it's a multipart question. What is the bar for success, do you think, for the combination to be competitive? And when you think about penetrating into the nivo and checkpoint monotherapy buckets for first-line melanoma, can you help us understand how big these buckets are to actually model this opportunity better?
George Yancopoulos: Well, as we've already reported, based on our two country cohorts, we are seeing remarkable overall response rate increases over the PD-1 standard alone, almost doubling with much longer PFS. If we get anywhere near these numbers along with a satisfactory safety profile, which we had seen a favorable safety profile in the small studies, but if we reproduce or come anywhere close to reproducing these results, we believe that this will establish an entirely new standard of care for this disease. And as we all know, the first-line melanoma opportunity is very large, but we're also moving laterally and earlier and so forth into many additional applications within the melanoma opportunity itself. We're going -- we're already now in adjuvant and entering neoadjuvant studies. We'll also be going to other cancer settings, including lung cancer and so forth. So we consider this a major opportunity, and we can only help to -- if we approach the data that we've already seen in our earlier studies, it really has a chance to make a huge difference for these patients.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tyler Van Buren with Cowen. You may proceed. 
Tyler Van Buren: For high-dose EYLEA, is there anything left to do on the regulatory front? And have you guys started labeling discussions yet? And forgive me for the follow-up, but just briefly for housekeeping and related to your response to the first question in prepared remarks, Marion, can you quantify the impact of the lower EYLEA inventory for the quarter?
Leonard Schleifer: So on the regulatory update, we don't comment on ongoing stuff. I'd like to say we're looking forward, hopefully, to the action of the FDA on June 27 and the launch promptly thereafter. Marion, you can comment on the inventories.
Marion McCourt: Sure, Tyler. I can give you the detail there. So while still within the normal range of inventory related to your question on EYLEA in the quarter in the normal range is 5 to 10 days, our inventory levels were approximately three days lower at the end of the first quarter of 2023 compared to the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. And when you do the calculation on that, as I'm sure you all will do, that's a negative impact in the first quarter net sales of approximately $70 million.
Operator: Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley.
Terence Flynn: I was just wondering on the commercial footprint for DUPIXEN, there, given the potential for another indication with COPD. If you could talk about any additional footprint or spend that's required there. And again, maybe just how to think about leverage on the forward.
Marion McCourt: Sure, very happy to comment. And as we think of DUPIXENT and all the different therapeutic disease areas and specialists that we cover with some indications, there certainly is an amazing and wonderful synergy. And you give an example with COPD launch potentially. And obviously, today, we're in market with our asthma indication and with nasal polyps. As we look forward with COPD, it's a really important launch, an indication to help patients in a way potentially that, as George described, hasn't been achieved ever for this population. So we have the opportunity to use our existing footprint, specifically in covering respiratory specialists, pulmonologists. But we'll also evaluate very closely with Sanofi, as you've seen us done in dermatology indications, where we might need some additional coverage and where the synergy is adequate, and we'll be very disciplined and very thoughtful about that. But you can be assured that we'll make certain that we appropriately give commercialization effort to such an important indication of COPD.
Leonard Schleifer: And it's interesting, just to add a little bit to that, Marion, that the allergists seem to have really understood the concept of type 2 inflammation. And the fact that type 2 inflammation is not a collection of individual unrelated diseases, it's a collection of related diseases. And I was speaking to an allergist the other day and said when you take an asthma patient, if you look carefully, many of them will have nasal polyps. And if you talk to dermatologists, they're beginning to understand that when they're treating atopic dermatitis, people who have concomitant asthma, for example, they get a benefit there. So I think DUPIXENT really is kind of unique. And we are talking to the main doctors, including the allergists, the dermatologists and the pulmonologists, with some of the ENT, as Marion said. We're covering them all, and many of them are covering multiple diseases.
Marion McCourt: I'll add to the enthusiasm here too in COPD, the potential to have a second product following DUPIXENT as well. So this will be a very important future area for helping patients.
Bob Landry: So with regards to your question on leverage, first off, welcome back. Nice to have you back on the team. You'll see with the issuance of our 10-Q this morning with regards to our share of the antibody alliance, we're going to pick up quarter year-over-year for the quarter, roughly 300 basis points. And again, that's half the economics on the transaction. So we're beginning to see really great leverage in to Marion's comment that should continue on with the COPD indication.
Leonard Schleifer: Obviously, we work very closely with Sanofi and all of these. And I believe it's fair to say we're equally excited about the potential for the future of DUPIXENT in all the current and, hopefully, future indications.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christopher Raymond with Piper Sandler.
Christopher Raymond: Maybe another DUPIXENT question, if you don't mind. Leonard, I know you don't talk about regulatory interactions. But when you had the COPD data, I think the signal that I got from you guys that seemed to be pretty strong was that you were hoping to have some discussions with the agency on BOREAS alone. Just kind of -- maybe can you map out how you anticipate communicating the results of that discussion with FDA once it happens? And then maybe a second part of that question is, our KOL checks have been pretty consistent when we asked them about this data. They're very impressed. But one of the things we've heard consistently is that this cutoff or clinical is greater than 300 as sort of arbitrary and that this drug would see -- maybe add value to patients with clinical accounts as low as 200 to 250. Just maybe your thoughts on this, and how you anticipate to sort of take advantage of that.
Leonard Schleifer: Yes. Well, let me start with the regulatory aspect. The -- obviously, what we're all staring at is an incredibly positive state -- I mean a Phase III setting, where, as we've mentioned, that we not only improve people's exacerbations, but we also improved their lung functions and the lung function and their quality of life, and all these other measures that were part of the statistical hierarchy. So when you have a very robust study like that, and you have -- I don't know how many patients we currently have, but it's a huge number, a very large patient commercial database and so many indications, I think Sanofi and Regeneron concur, that this is something that we should be discussing with the FDA to see how they feel about whether or not there is a potential filing. We don't have any update for you, if it's something once we have that meeting, if it's something definitive, I'm sure Sanofi and Regeneron will figure out a way to properly communicate that. In terms of cutoffs and what have you, I think it's a little bit premature to talk about that, other than to say you stick with what you brought to the trial, which is a cutoff of 300. And that's where you commercialize. But the future work one can look at in other studies, that's something obviously we'll think about. But I remind you as George and both Marion mentioned, our IL-33 antibody gives a larger, although somewhat overlapping population potentially. So we really could have cover many, many, many patients, a great opportunity to help people with what has been really a very unfortunate progressive loss of lung function.
Marion McCourt: Len to your comment, you were talking about numbers of patients. I can fill in there that as of March worldwide, we had over 600,000 patients on DUPIXENT in 57 countries.
Leonard Schleifer: Right. So that speaks a lot to the post-marketing experience of the product.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.
Brian Abrahams: Shifting gears, you recently reported with your partner, APP data in Alzheimer's. I'm curious what this proof of principle potentially opens up beyond this indication? How quickly you can expand into some of the other neurodegenerative diseases that you mentioned, and your level of confidence overall in the safety of the program.
George Yancopoulos: Well, we think that the data were really game changing. I mean this is the first time in human history that one has been able to use this very exciting siRNA technology within the brain and silence, to a very high degree, higher-than-expected levels an important pathological gene. Obviously, this could have important implications for Alzheimer's itself. But as you point out, the application goes way beyond that. To every neurodegenerative disease, there are also other types of CNS diseases as well. We have a number of programs that we're working with Alnylam. We have exclusive relationship with them on all of these CNS targets. And we're trying to expedite a lot of them based on the exciting results from this initial clinical work into the clinic. And we're also trying to expedite many of our programs that are behind as well. So we really think this opens up an entirely new way of addressing a whole assortment of brain diseases and neuropsychiatric diseases, not just neurodegenerative diseases. We're in exciting times. We have to go cautiously. We have to hope that the initial results, in terms of the safety profile and so forth, hold up. We're all in the early days, and we don't know for sure. But the low doses with which we saw this very marked reduction in the target give us a lot of hope that we can have a sufficient therapeutic window that will be applicable to these large variety of disease that could potentially be addressable by this modality.
Leonard Schleifer: So I just wanted to add to that, two things: streaming on a different channel, I think you might find some further data being discussed by our friends at Alnylam, which will speak to not only impressive result, but the durability of the effect. And one of the other things I want to comment is really to echo something George said. The recent amyloid plaque clearing antibody results by Lilly previously, by Biogen, are really quite important. But as George said, even with the adjuvant, there's still going to be a tremendous burden of Alzheimer's disease. But what the data seem to be speaking towards is that the process is ongoing, is that the pathologic role of amyloid is not over. And as George said, having another way, perhaps upstream, stopping the production of amyloid, maybe even a more advantageous way to deal with the ongoing process that amyloid seems to be generating, which is what the antibody data, I think, seems to be speaking to us.
Operator: Our next question comes from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.
Salveen Richter: So with regard to EYLEA high-dose becoming the larger share of revenue on the forward here, can you give us any color here on discussions with payers and how to think about formulary fit?
Marion McCourt: So Salveen, we are actively involved in all aspects of launch preparation. And certainly, that includes all elements and levers associated with premarket activities and then getting ready for the launch activities. We do have in place a very sophisticated market access, payer and pricing team. And at the appropriate times, they most definitely will be involved with payers and other organized customers that will be important in our launch efforts. Additionally, this is a customer base that we know very well from our over a decade experience with EYLEA, so we look forward to potential FDA approval and launch activities and working with all of our customer stakeholders. I'll also mention again the importance in the retinal space of the key opinion leaders and prescribers and the enthusiasm they have for a product that really can be a game changer for their patients in terms of visual acuity, duration and the safety profile they've come to know with EYLEA. So we're very enthusiastic and look forward to the launch opportunity, and we'll be ready.
Operator: Our next question comes from Akash Tewari with Jefferies. You may proceed.
Akash Tewari: So just to clarify the moving parts on U.S. EYLEA, there was a 5% market share loss, a $70 million inventory impact and then lower price. Any color on what the net price impact was on the quarter, and how it should evolve in the back half of '23? And additionally, should we expect EYLEA market share to hold at 70% going forward, or potentially start to grow again as high-dose EYLEA launches?
Marion McCourt: So let me take some of the items, and others may want to jump in here, too. But first, I would say that some of the calculation related to market share shift is not exactly correct. There was some decline in the quarter, but not to the height that you mentioned. When I look at market shares through the entirety of the first quarter period, then as described, it is a more competitive market, a variety of, obviously, competitors, very low cost and others. And overall, EYLEA performance is in a very strong situation as we look today to planning for our future portfolio and the aflibercept 8-milligram launch. As to the specifics of pricing and calculation to the net, I can't give you specifics on that number. But I do think that we gave you some transparency on the overall item related to inventory, overall competitive pressures and then our preparation for our next launch in the category coming up shortly, we hope, following FDA approval.
Leonard Schleifer: Obviously, as Marion mentioned, on a sequential basis, demand was modestly up. So obviously, we were offset by the factors that Marion referred to.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. You may proceed.
Chris Schott: I just had a question on the IL-33 in COPD. I guess just the success you've had with your kind of study design and results with DUPIXENT increase at all your confidence in that program. And just, I guess, maybe just elaborate little bit on, how you see kind of those 2 agents kind of interacting as we think about the space overall?
George Yancopoulos: Yes. We are more optimistic, obviously, that all of our decisions, all of the data that led us to do the particular study and the particular population of patients in COPD with DUPIXENT was made based on a lot of factors. And we also had, from our Regeneron Genetics Center, very strong human genetic evidence suggesting that it would have activity particularly where we actually saw activity. And so all of that gives us confidence -- since we use the same criteria, the same approaches and so forth to plan and design our IL-33 study, certainly, the fact that everything that went into one and it all worked so remarkably well gives us confidence that the same approaches will lead to success with the IL-33. The results with DUPIXENT were really outstanding, as we've already mentioned. Not only a clinically meaningful reduction in exacerbations, but we hit all these other important endpoints, most importantly, improvement in lung function, as well as you rarely hit these quality of life improvements unless you have a really active agent that the patients can really feel the difference for their function and for their quality of life. With IL-33, the genetics is very strong. We have a Phase II study in the subgroup that we're doing the Phase III study in. It was in that group. We have demonstrated a 42% reduction in exacerbations in the Phase II study. This will be an overlapping population with our DUPIXENT population. We think we already have a chance to really make a huge difference for this high unmet need population that really has had no new mechanism of action of drugs brought to help these patients for a very, very long time. We have one with Dupixent, and we're hoping to hit another one with IL-33. And this could make such a huge difference for these patients who have been suffering for so long without much hope. It could really make a big difference for this population.
Leonard Schleifer: I just wanted to repeat, maybe George said it probably 2 or 3 times, but maybe it's worth saying a fourth time. And yesteryear, the way you did drug development is you identified a target based on some biology or what have you, you did your Phase I and Phase II, and you hope that Phase II was an indicator for how your Phase III was going to turn out. And obviously, that's how it is still done today. But what George mentioned is that we can layer on top of it in sort of a unique way our genetic insights and look and validate and say, is it reasonable to expect that if you block a certain target that you're going to have a beneficial effect? Is that target associated with the disease you're treating? And I know George said it 3 times, but I think it's worth saying a fourth time. That really gives you added confidence that's uniquely Regeneron in many respects, how we can get this genetic information. People ask us a lot, if you think about the number of people that have been sequenced in the world, George can comment when I'm done, I know we've sequenced a large part of them and coupled that with all this medical, anonymized medical information. We use that in so many ways, not only to identify targets, but to validate the work we're doing in specific targets, specific diseases. George, how much have we done?
George Yancopoulos: We've seen about half of all the humans who have been sequenced.
Leonard Schleifer: So I mean, that's a large database of millions. And I think that, that is what you're hearing is that that's why we had more confidence perhaps than others did with DUPIXENT and now with anti-IL-33.
George Yancopoulos: Since [Indiscernible] expand it a little bit, just let you know how it works. What we do is we identify genetic variations that mimic the blocking of a drug or exacerbation of this type 2 pathway. And what we showed for DUPIXENT, for the genetic variations that mimic DUPIXENT, those people were protected from COPD, particularly the type 2 COPD patients. Whereas increased activity of the IL-4/13 path was associated with more disease. And obviously, that turned out to be the case. I mean it's human genetics. It's a very, very powerful predictor. And we've done the same thing, as Len said, with IL-33, where we have genetic variation at mimics blocking the pathway or exacerbating the pathway. And as I've said, this is one of the secrets to our ability to have high success rates in our studies is we use that as a criteria to make our decisions going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Yatin Suneja with Guggenheim Securities. You may proceed.
Eddie Hickman: This is Eddie Hickman on for Yatin. I was wondering if you could talk about the draft guidance from the FDA on the anti-VEGF trial designs? And if that impacts your outlook on the high-dose program at all?
Leonard Schleifer: I don't think that has any impact on us, on our program.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Risinger with SVB Securities.
David Risinger: I guess I'll just go straight to the question. Len, you had mentioned in your opening remarks the ongoing diversification of the company's revenues away from EYLEA. Could you please discuss your expectations for EYLEA U.S. sales growth in the near term, including the total EYLEA franchise prospects after Regeneron launches the HD? Thank you.
Leonard Schleifer: Let me go right to the answer since you ran right to the question. We don't give future guidance on specific quantitative measures of our sales. On a qualitative basis, Marion has said, that we're anticipating that the combination of EYLEA and 8 milligrams aflibercept will be a growth franchise over time for the company.
Operator: Our next question comes from Hartaj Singh with Oppenheimer. You may proceed.
Hartaj Singh: Just a quick question on linvoseltamab. At ASH, you presented a Phase I data, and these were your dose ranging, I guess, data. Really interesting data you present at ASH. At ASCO, what should we expect to see? Will it be dose expansion data? And then any duration also on the patients from ASH? And then what would FDA like to see before you can go ahead and submit the application?
George Yancopoulos: Well, I think you're going to actually see an update on our pivotal Phase II data, the actual data that was a little bit more maturing, with a further update we will be hoping to submit to the to the FDA for our BLA. So the data will be very close. We think the data will even get better as it matures. Because as we all know, response rates and so forth get better with time as you follow these patients. But these data are going to show what we believe are the potential to have best-in-class efficacy, as well as safety in the favorable dosing schedule based on the results that we'll show from our pivotal study at the upcoming ASCO.
Ryan Crowe: I think we have time for two more questions.
Operator: Our next question comes from Carter Gould with Barclays. You may proceed.
Carter Gould: Sorry to belabor EYLEA. I guess just simply, what's the pricing pressure that you guys highlighted in Q1. Was that a seasonal dynamic? Or would you characterize it as that? Or something more permanent around that market landscape going forward?
Leonard Schleifer: Before Marion answers that, I just want to come back to the BCMA story a little bit, because it's one that I'm particularly excited about. The bispecific field, which was initiated by Regeneron in terms of using bispecifics, I think we were the first to put the biospecific into patients, has obviously become a very clouded space. and it's sometimes hard to differentiate what you've got compared to what the competition has and you look at somebody claiming one thing and you're claiming another and so on and so forth. But if you take a dispassionate view, I think for the BCMAxCD3 program, you could really see a differentiated molecules and the potential to be best-in-class. Antibodies are not all created equal. Bispecifics are not all created equally. You do see differences. Clinical trial programs and not all created equally. This is one I'd really encourage you to think a very careful look at and compare. Now there was some question on EYLEA. Marion, you're going to answer that.
Marion McCourt: Sure. And Carter, getting back to your question on the competitive dynamic and pricing pressure. I think if you look at the anti-VEGF category and look at it over time, go back multiple quarters, there has been increasing competitive pressure. And that does then have a corollary to some extent on pricing dynamic, and that would go forward. But I just want to share and remind all that in the category in the VEGF category, what really is rewarded is product profile. And as we look at a product like EYLEA that launched and was a game changer in the category, that was profile not being the least costly, right? There's been a low-cost alternative, very low-cost alternative for a very, very long time, but it was the product profile that made the difference for prescribers and patients. So that will always be a very important dynamic to look at going forward, and certainly has strong interest for prescribers as we bring a new product into the marketplace following FDA approval with aflibercept 8 milligram. But to your point, pricing pressure will continue in this category. But what's most important is product profile and the clinical attributes that the patient experiences.
Operator: Our last question comes from Evan Seigerman with BMO. You may proceed.
Evan Seigerman: I'd love to have you expand on some of the feedback you've been hearing from physicians regarding the 8-milligram dose. Maybe some color as to how they plan on using it and assuming approval comes June.
Marion McCourt: So of course, the updates on actual prescribing will be even more important as the product comes into the marketplace and physicians have an opportunity to use it and select patients. We obviously have done a lot of work with our medical team, looked at the clinical data with specialists. And to give you an early answer to your question, I think there's opportunity for a variety of patients that are deemed to be appropriate candidates. And there's a range. Certainly, when physicians are considering new patient starts, it's very attractive. We obviously have a strong portion of patients that are naive to EYLEA today, but in the future, the question becomes, why wouldn't you start a new patient with a product that gives you all the visual acuity benefits and safety of EYLEA, but it also gives you that durability and duration? Because obviously, physicians know their patients are anxious and don't like to have more injections in the eye than they need to. Similarly, you might have a patient that's very well controlled on another product, maybe EYLEA, maybe another product in the anti-VEGF category. But you'd like to give them that opportunity for duration and, maybe in some cases, if the product is in another area of the anti-VEGF category, improved visual acuity and duration. So I would say it's the combination of interest for patients who might be broadly anti-VEGF category switch patients, or the potential for new patients as well. I hope that helps, and I look forward to the day when we can give you specifics for market experience.
Ryan Crowe: Thank you, Marion, and thanks to everybody who dialed in, and for your interest in Regeneron. We apologize to those remaining in the queue that we did not have a chance to get to. As always, the IR team is available to answer any remaining questions that anyone may have. Thank you once again, and have a great day, everyone.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-03 08:30:00) =====

Once our call concludes, Bob Landry and the IR team will be available to answer any further questions you may have. With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Len Schleifer. Len?
Leonard Schleifer: Good morning to everybody and for those of you experiencing the optic freeze, I hope you are staying warm. Our strong fourth quarter performance kept remarkable year of Regeneron, highlighted by significant achievements that better position the company to deliver sustainable growth and shareholder value. Fourth quarter 2022 revenue increased 14% compared to the prior year when excluding the impact of contributions from REGEN-COV and Ronapreve underscoring the commercial strength and increasing diversity of our business. We also made several important advances across our pipeline during the quarter, notably the submission of a Biologic License Application for aflibercept 8 milligrams in neovascular age-related macular degeneration or wet AMD as well as diabetic macular edema, or DME, positioning us for a potential U.S. launch in late August of this year. Additionally, we received FDA approval for Libtayo in combination with chemotherapy as a first line treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer, making Libtayo only the second PD-1 or PD-L1 antibody approved in this setting, regardless of the patient’s histology or PD-L1 expressions level. We also presented data from our rapidly advancing oncology pipeline, including fianlimab, our LAG-3 antibody in combination with Libtayo in advanced non-small cell lung cancer, odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific in B-cell lymphomas and linvoseltamab, our BCMA x CD3 bispecific in multiple myeloma. Finally, Dupixent was approved for prurigo nodularis in Europe. Briefly reflecting on 2022, we ended the year with three strategic imperatives that we felt we had to accomplish in order to position the company for long-term growth. First, we had to fortify the medium and long-term outlook for our retinal franchise. Based on the positive results that we reported in September 2022, we believe aflibercept 8 milligrams has the potential to change the treatment paradigm for patients with wet AMD and DME by becoming the new standard of care for these patients, positioning Regeneron for prolonged leadership in this category. Second, we needed to maintain and grow DUPIXENT leadership across a variety of Type 2 allergic diseases. 2022 turned out to be a phenomenal year with Dupixent global net product sales approaching $8.7 billion and growing 44% at constant currency. Despite new competition, Dupixent maintained a leading market position in atopic dermatitis, asthma and nasal polyps and was also approved in new indications, geographies and younger populations, which George will detail shortly. Collectively, these 2022 approvals meaningfully expanded the Dupixent commercial opportunity, allowing the addressable population to increase by approximately 225,000 patients, bringing the total addressable population to over 7 million patients globally. And third, we wanted to make significant progress towards becoming a leader in immunooncology and 2022 turned out to be a crucial year. Key to this long-term goal was requiring Sanofi’s share of global rights to Libtayo, an antibody discovered by Regeneron, which was a necessary step towards realizing the full clinical and commercial potential of this foundational therapy. It also enables us to unlock combination opportunities from promising candidates in our oncology pipeline, including with our LAG-3 antibody, our costimulatory bispecifics and our CD3 bispecifics. Looking ahead, we expect 2023 to be another notable year with significant incremental progress across these imperatives as well as in other areas of our business. We are preparing for a potential U.S. launch for aflibercept 8 milligrams in late August given prescribers decade plus experience with EYLEA. And now with the 48-week data for aflibercept 8 milligrams, which demonstrated comparable efficacy and safety to EYLEA, but with longer treatment intervals, we believe that over time there is an opportunity for aflibercept 8 milligrams to become the new standard of care for wet AMD and DME. We expect Dupixent to continue to strengthen its leadership position across approved Type 2 allergic diseases based on its differentiated mechanism of blocking both interleukin-4 and interleukin-13. In 2023, we have an opportunity to reach even more patients with potential regulatory approvals in new diseases, geographies and younger populations that could add another approximately 500,000 patients globally to the biologic eligible population. Additionally, we look forward to the upcoming readout of our first Phase 3 study of Dupixent in COPD in the first half of this year. In oncology, we expect to continue rapidly advancing our pipeline. For our LAG-3 combination with Libtayo, we are moving forward with expansion beyond melanoma to include lung cancer and potentially other solid tumors. For our costimulatory bispecifics, in combination with Libtayo, we are continuing dose expansion in our Phase 1/2 PSMAxCD28 program in advanced prostate cancer. We also expect to report additional Phase 1 data from our EGFRxCD28 program in solid tumors and to present initial clinical data for our MUC16xCD28 program in recurrent ovarian cancer. And within Heme-Onc, we anticipate second half regulatory submissions for odronextamab in follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma as well as limvolseltumab in refractory multiple myeloma. In 2023, we also plan to rapidly move forward with clinical development of our next-generation COVID-19 antibody, which we believe could help protect the millions of vulnerable patients who were unable to map a sufficient immune response from vaccination and treat those who require other alternatives. Activities enabling clinical manufacturing have commenced and we expect to enter clinical development later this year. In closing, 2022 was a pivotal year at Regeneron and we expect to continue making significant progress in 2023. Our strategy remains focused on investing in our internal R&D capabilities which has historically generated a high rate of return. We remain confident in our near and long-term growth prospects with approximately 35 pipeline candidates currently progressing through clinical trials. We will also continue looking for opportunities to complement these internal efforts by exploring potential collaborations. With our commercial capabilities continue to drive revenue growth and our strong financial position, Regeneron is extremely well positioned to continue delivering breakthroughs for patients and value to shareholders. Now, I will turn the call over to George.
George Yancopoulos: Thanks, Len. I would like to briefly walk you through our pipeline’s progress in 2022 and touch upon what lies ahead in 2023. In ophthalmology, we presented pivotal – positive pivotal results for aflibercept 8 milligram in wet AMD and DME. These trials showed that aflibercept 8 milligram extended dosing intervals to every 12 or even 16 weeks for the vast majority of patients through 48 weeks without compromising the visual improvement or safety seen with EYLEA. These are truly unprecedented and potentially game-changing results who have not – which have not been achieved using any other anti-VEGF agents. Moving to Dupixent, in 2022, Dupixent became the only biologic approved in atopic dermatitis, for infants as young as 6 months of age, the first treatment for prurigo nodularis and the first treatment in the United States for eosinophilic esophagitis. And just this week, we obtained the European Commission approval for eosinophilic esophagitis as well. In addition, we submitted a supplemental BLA for chronic spontaneous urticaria and shared positive Phase 3 data in children with the eosinophilic esophagitis. Dupixent is now approved in 5 related Type 2 allergic conditions. And our data shows that these diseases are mediated by IL-4 and IL-13 driven Type 2 inflammation. Because many patients suffer from systemic Type 2 inflammation, they often suffer from several of these diseases concurrently. And thus, Dupixent has the potential to holistically address these patients multiple Type 2 conditions for which Dupixent is approved. While many other immunomodulators are associated with worrisome immunosuppression and carry boxed warnings, Dupixent’s safety profile supports its approval in infants. In 2023, we are looking forward to the initial results of BOREAS, the first Dupixent Phase 3 study in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD. Our Dupixent COPD Phase 3 studies have enrolled patients with elevated blood eosinophils aiming to select for patients with COPD driven by Type 2 inflammation. The BOREAS study passed an interim futility analysis in 2020, an encouraging event, which triggered the start of the replicate Phase 3 NOTUS study. We are looking forward to the readout of BOREAS with the primary endpoint of annualized rate of acute, moderate and severe COPD exacerbations expected in the first half of ‘23. Moving on to oncology, 2022 was an important year for our oncology programs. Libtayo was approved by the FDA in combination with chemotherapy in first-line non-small cell lung cancer, irrespective of histology or PD-L1 expression levels, an achievement met by only one other PD-1 or PD-L1 targeting agent. Libtayo is also emerging as an essential backbone of our oncology pipeline as several programs in combination with Libtayo are starting to yield encouraging data. First, I will discuss our LAG-3 antibody, fianlimab in combination with Libtayo, where we have recently shown positive data from a second confirmatory cohort of PD-1 naive metastatic melanoma patients and reported encouraging results from a smaller dataset in non-small-cell lung cancer patients. These initial results suggest that the fianlimab Libtayo combination has a potentially best-in-class profile in melanoma. And we are advancing broad pivotal programs in both melanoma and lung cancer. Phase 3 studies in metastatic melanoma and adjuvant melanoma are already enrolling and we have plans to soon initiate another Phase 3 study in perioperative melanoma as well as Phase 2/3 studies in first-line advanced as well as perioperative non-small cell lung cancer. Other notable Libtayo combination used from this year was the early but very encouraging data with our PSMA by CD28 costimulatory bispecific in advanced metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, a tumor type considered immunologically cold with multiple recent Phase 3 failures demonstrating that prostate cancer is largely unresponsive to anti-PD-1 therapy in other end as well as in other types of chemo combination. In our proof-of-concept study of our PSMA by CD28 costimulatory bispecific, we observed first evidence that combining this new class of bispecifics with anti-PD-1 can confer profound responsiveness to tumors previously thought to be cold and unresponsive to anti-PD-1 therapy with 3 out of the 4 patients treated at the highest dose levels showing greater than 90% reductions within 6 weeks of initiating combination therapy in the prostate cancer biomarker PSA. Following up on these early but exciting results, we are continuing to enroll patients in this study and we are planning to present additional data at medical meetings in 2023. We also presented our first clinical data for a CD3 bispecific in a solid tumor for ubamatamab, our MUC16xCD3 bispecific in development for advanced ovarian cancer. As a single agent in a Phase 1 dose escalation study in heavily pretreated recurrent ovarian cancer patients, we observed a 4% overall response rate with a 31% response rates in a small subset of patients with high MUC16 expressing tumors. We expect initial dose escalation data later this year for ubamatamab with Libtayo as well as for our MUC16xCD28 costimulatory bispecific with Libtayo in advanced ovarian cancer. We also expect updated clinical data for our EGFRxCD28 costimulatory bispecific in combination with Libtayo in various solid tumors later this year. Moving on to our hematology oncology pipeline, at the American Society of Hematology, or ASH Annual Meeting, we presented new data from odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific as well as linvoseltamab our BCMAxCD3 bispecific. For odronextamab, we presented pivotal Phase 2 ELM-2 data. Odronextamab in third or later line relapsed or recurrent follicular lymphoma has a potential best-in-class efficacy profile with 82% of patients responding and 92% of these responders achieving a complete response with encouraging durability. Our optimized step-up dosing regimen has improved odronextamab’s safety profile while retaining efficacy similar to the prior dosing regimen. In third or later – in relapse or recurrent diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, odronextamab demonstrated efficacy regardless of prior CAR-T experience and a safety profile generally similar to that seen in follicular lymphoma. We are planning regulatory submissions in the second half of 2023 for both indications, which we hope will support potential accelerated approvals. In 2023, we anticipate initiating several Phase 3 studies in follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, including in earlier lines of therapy. These trials will serve as confirmatory studies which could potentially support conversion to full approval. We also expect to initiate a proof-of-concept study of our CD22xCD28 costimulatory bispecific in combination with odronextamab in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, which we hope could further add to the anticancer benefit for these patients. For linvoseltamab, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific antibody we presented efficacy and safety data from our pivotal Phase 2 study in third or later line multiple myeloma at ASH. Early, deep and durable responses were observed in patients with high disease burden and these responses may improve with longer follow-up. In 2023, we plan to initiate a confirmatory Phase 3 study of linvoseltamab in second line multiple myeloma and are on track for a BLA submission in the second half of the year. As with odronextamab, we plan to initiate combination studies for linvoseltamab with costimulatory bispecifics in the near future. I’d also like to update some additional clinical programs. Our antibody blocking Factor XI for anticoagulation and our antibody that activates the NPR1 receptor for heart failure are both completing proof of mechanism trials. Moving on to Regeneron Genetics Medicine, regarding our collaboration with Alnylam and siRNA Therapeutics, we are planning a broad and multi-pronged approach to develop treatments for NASH, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. We are initiating a Phase 2 study of ALN-HSD and NASH patients with genetic risk factors. We also dosed first subjects in the first-in-human study of another siRNA medicine in development for NASH, ALN-PNP, which targets a different gene and can be potentially combined with ALN-HSD in appropriate patients. We have discovered additional NASH targets, which we have validated using our Regeneron Genetics Center, including side B, which will potentially be the next NASH therapeutic candidate to enter the clinic. With regard to our collaboration with Alnylam for central nervous system targets, our initial dose escalation study is ongoing. Our collaboration with Intellia and CRISPR-based therapeutics, this is expected to progress further in 2023, building on continuing data readouts from the Phase 1 study of NTLA-2001 in transthyretin amyloidosis in both cardiomyopathy and neuropathy patients, which provided the first demonstration in humans that CRISPR-based technologies can deliver up to 90% reduction of the pathological gene product for over a year. Regarding our gene therapy efforts, our collaborators at Decibel Therapeutics recently announced that a clinical trial has been authorized by both the U.S. FDA and the UK MHRA for DB-OTO, a virally delivered gene therapy designed to restore hearing to individuals with otoferlin-related hearing loss. A Phase 1/2 study in patients 2 years of age and younger is expected to initiate in the first half of 2023 with initial data from the first cohort of patients anticipated in the first quarter of 2024. I’d like to conclude with our next-generation COVID-19 efforts. As we recently announced, we have identified a potent broadly neutralizing COVID-19 antibody, which, unlike other neutralizing antibodies find outside of the so-called receptor binding domain, or RBD, of the spike protein. This antibody retains activity against all the viral variants seen throughout the pandemic because it binds to an atop that has remained highly conserved, greater than 99.9% across all known variants. The vast majority of antiviral antibodies generated as a result of vaccination or due to natural infection target the RBD domain, which results in overwhelming selective pressure driving the emergence of these resistant variants. We hope that by targeting this unique and conservative to outside of the RBD this antibody will also retain its activity in the face of future variance. We plan to initiate clinical trials to test this antibody this year, and we are looking to develop it in both treatment and prophylactic setting. In conclusion, Regeneron’s R&D engine continues its productivity, including the early-stage pipeline. Just in the first weeks of this year, we have initiated clinical studies for two new drug candidates and we anticipate clinical trials starting or IND submission for up to 10 new therapeutic candidates this year as well as for additional indications for candidates that are already in the clinic. So with that, I will turn it over to Marion.
Marion McCourt: Thanks, George. The fourth quarter capped off a strong year of execution and growth, delivering results across our commercial portfolio. We expanded into new indications, which, coupled with our existing business, is expected to drive meaningful growth in 2023 and beyond. We look forward to several important potential approvals and subsequent launches this year, providing additional opportunities for growth. Starting with EYLEA, where we announced in January, fourth quarter U.S. net sales of $1.5 billion, full year 2022 net sales were $6.3 billion, representing 8% year-over-year growth and outpacing total growth of the anti-VEGF category for the year. At the end of the fourth quarter, EYLEA category share was approaching previous levels of approximately 50% of injections. This followed the short-term shift earlier in the quarter where EYLEA was negatively impacted by a temporary increase in use of off-label compounded Avastin. During this time, there was a short-term closure of a not-for-profit patient co-pay assistance fund, which reopened later in the quarter. We believe we have substantially recovered from the issue encountered in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect competitive pressures but remain confident in Regeneron’s overall retinal franchise as we look forward to our potential upcoming aflibercept 8-milligram launch. In summary, our retinal franchise leads the anti-VEGF category with EYLEA as the current standard of care and aflibercept 8-milligram, if approved, offering a differentiated clinical profile that can potentially shift the treatment paradigm. Turning to Libtayo. Total fourth quarter global net sales were $169 million, growing 44% on a constant currency basis. In the U.S., net sales grew 36% to $110 million with contributions across all indications. In advanced non-melanoma skin cancers, we continue to build our leadership position in the PD-1 class. In lung cancer, Libtayo continues to see steady growth in utilization in prescribers. Customer ordering has accelerated following the chemotherapy combination approval last November. We are working to maximize launch uptake by increasing depth and breath of prescribers. Early launch indicators are positive community and academic centers have welcomed Libtayo’s expanded role as an important treatment option in advanced non-small cell lung cancer. There are more than 200,000 new cases of lung cancer per year in the U.S. alone for which Libtayo is an important treatment option. Outside the U.S., Libtayo net sales grew 60% on a constant currency basis to $59 million driven by steady demand growth and additional launches as we secure access and reimbursement globally. We continue a targeted approach to extend our global commercial footprint in priority international markets. designed to maximize opportunities for Libtayo and potential future medicines. Finally, turning to DUPIXENT, where in the fourth quarter, global net sales grew 42% on a constant currency basis to $2.45 billion. In the U.S., net sales grew 44% to $1.94 billion, with strong growth continuing across atopic dermatitis, asthma, nasal polyps with additional contributions from recent launches in the eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis. DUPIXENT is well positioned to expand market penetration and drive revenue growth across established new and potential future indications in 2023 and beyond. Atopic dermatitis DUPIXENT’s largest indication continues to rapidly grow across all age groups, firmly establishing DUPIXENT as the preferred systemic therapy for patients with moderate to severe disease. There continues to be rapid uptake in younger populations, further confirming DUPIXENT’s differentiated efficacy and safety profile. We’ve also seen meaningful early adoption in prurigo nodularis where DUPIXENT is the only FDA-approved medicine for this debilitating disease. We expect ongoing uptake of DUPIXENT as the launch progresses and physicians identify patients need. DUPIXENT continues to perform well in the highly competitive biologic asthma space with steady market share gains and strong growth in total prescriptions and new patient starts. In nasal polyps, DUPIXENT’s differentiated clinical profile continues to drive uptake as the leading first-line treatment option in patients requiring systemic therapy. In the eosinophilic esophagitis, the launch is going exceptionally well finally offering physicians and their patients a treatment to effectively manage the underlying mechanism of the disease. Patients treated with DUPIXEN have experienced dramatic improvements in their symptoms and quality of life we’ve seen rapid uptake across both gastroenterologists and allergists. We also continue to advance our clinical efforts in younger patients where there is also substantial unmet need. Outside the U.S., DUPIXENT net sales worth $513 million, growing 37% on a constant currency basis, driven by rapid uptake across approved indications and launches in new geographies. In Europe, DUPIXENT was approved for prurigo nodularis in December. And earlier this week, DUPIXENT was also approved for eosinophilic esophagitis. We expect these new indications to contribute to DUPIXENT’s ongoing international growth. In summary, during 2022, we executed on our core focus to deliver life-changing medicines to patients. Our commercial initiatives and strategies are driving increases in market penetration for our in-line brands and optimizing the potential of new and upcoming launches. Taken together, we are confident in Regeneron’s future and are well positioned to deliver long-term and sustainable growth. Now I’ll turn the call to Bob.
Bob Landry: Thank you, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron’s financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis, unless otherwise noted. Regeneron ended 2022 with a strong fourth quarter with continued execution driving positive results across the business. Excluding contributions from REGEN-COV and Ronapreve, fourth quarter total revenues increased 14% year-over-year to $3 billion, driven by growth across our core brands. Fourth quarter diluted net income per share was $12.56 on net income of $1.4 billion. Beginning with collaboration revenue and starting with Bayer. Fourth quarter 2022 ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales were $839 million, up 7% on a constant currency basis versus fourth quarter 2021. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $355 million, of which $324 million related to our share of EYLEA net profits outside the U.S. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $836 million in the fourth quarter and grew 61%, driven by DUPIXENT. Our share of profits from the commercialization of DUPIXENT and KEVZARA was $619 million, an increase of 60% versus the prior year. We also recognized a $50 million sales-based milestone in the fourth quarter of 2022 due to achievement of $2.5 billion of ex-U.S. sales of antibody collaboration products on a rolling 12-month basis. Finally, we recorded Roche collaboration revenue of $396 million in the fourth quarter for our share of gross profits from ex-U.S. sales of Ronapreve related to a previously signed contract. Moving now to our operating expenses. Fourth quarter 2022 R&D expense increased 43% year-over-year to $911 million, driven by the impact of the Libtayo transaction with Regeneron now recording all R&D expense for Libtayo and our full 50% share of antibody collaboration R&D spend for DUPIXENT and odronextamab, as well as additional costs incurred in connection with the company’s late-stage pipeline and increasing clinical manufacturing activities and higher headcount-related costs. SG&A expense increased 17% year-over-year to $579 million due to higher headcount and related costs, incremental costs to fully support the global commercialization of Libtayo and higher contributions to an independent not-for-profit patient systems organization. Product gross margin in the quarter increased to 93% as compared to 86% in the prior year. The improved gross margin was driven by a favorable change in product mix and no longer having to pay Sanofi for their share of U.S. Libtayo gross profits. Finally, fourth quarter 2022 effective tax rate was 11.3% compared to 12.6% in the prior year. Shifting now to cash flow and the balance sheet. For full year 2022, Regeneron generated $4.4 billion in free cash flow, favorably impacted by our first quarter 2022 payment from the U.S. government for sales REGEN-COV that were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021. We ended 2022 with cash and marketable securities less debt of $11.6 billion. We continue to deliver on our capital allocation priorities in 2022 by deploying approximately $3.4 billion towards business development and share repurchases while continuing to fund our internal R&D efforts. In 2022, we executed approximately $1.3 billion in business development initiatives, including the acquisitions of Checkmate Pharmaceuticals in the exclusive worldwide rights to Libtayo. We also purchased approximately $2.1 billion of our shares in 2022, including $431 million in the fourth quarter. This morning, we announced a new $3 billion share repurchase authorization reflecting our continued confidence in our business and our pipeline. We remain buyers of our shares at current levels, and this new authorization enables us to continue returning capital directly to shareholders. I’d like to conclude with our initial financial guidance and outlook for 2023. We expect 2023 SG&A spend to be in the range of $2.13 billion to $2.2 billion. This primarily reflects the full year impact of global Life tile commercialization expenses, the build-out of our international commercial infrastructure in select markets and higher headcount to support our growing organization. We expect our 2023 R&D expense to be in the range of $3.725 billion to $3.925 billion. As George mentioned, we have numerous strategically important development programs advancing in 2023, including late-stage studies for our fianlimab, Libtayo combination in melanoma and lung cancer in confirmatory Phase 3 studies for odronextamab, both in FL and DLBCL and linvoseltamab in myeloma. In addition, we continue to advance programs in our early pipeline across multiple therapeutic areas including with collaborators such as Alnylam and Intellia positioning us for long-term growth. This range also includes the full year impact of the Libtayo transaction, we are now recording all development expenses for Libtayo recognizing our full 50% share of development expenses for DUPIXENT in itepekimab. COCM is expected to be in the range of $720 million to $800 million, similar to 2022 reflecting the gradual phase-in of a new Regeneron developed manufacturing process for DUPIXENT that is designed to improve drug substance yields. We expect our capital expenditures in 2023 to be in the range of $825 million to $950 million. These expenditures will support the continued expansion of our manufacturing facilities, including ongoing construction of a fill/finish facility as well as the previously announced expansion of R&D facilities at our Tarrytown, New York headquarters. Finally, we anticipate 2023 gross margin to be between 90% to 92% and our effective tax rate to be in the range of 11% to 13%. In addition to our full year financial guidance, we expect higher interest income in 2023, given our greater cash balance plus higher interest rates as compared to last year, which will favorably impact other income and expense. We also expect 2023 other revenue to be slightly lower than 2022. Finally, as I said in November, we no longer expect to record any material other operating income or expense in 2023 are beyond absent a new transaction. In conclusion, Regeneron continued to deliver robust financial results in 2022, and we are well positioned to drive continued growth in 2023 and beyond. With that, I will now pass the call back to Ryan.
Ryan Crowe: Thank you, Bob. Shannon, that concludes our prepared remarks. We’d now like to open the call for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Shannon, please go ahead and poll for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tyler Van Buren with Cowen. Your line is now open.
Tyler Van Buren: Hey, guys. Good morning and congratulations on the results and thanks for the question. Regarding EYLEA, it would be great to hear the latest on what you are seeing in the marketplace with respect to [indiscernible]. Apparently, Roche is not seeing switches from [indiscernible] back to EYLEA despite what we are hearing from the KOLs. So any additional color there would be helpful?
Marion McCourt: Hi, Tyler. Yes, and let me comment that certainly, EYLEA performance in the market, as I reported, continues to be very strong, a quick reminder on the year growing at 8% to $6.3 billion and certainly a very strong competitive performance. We are conscious of competition in the marketplace. But to give a bit of an update, we continue to hear that first nAb use has been modest and results, in some cases, have resulted in patients switching back to other agents, including EYLEA probably most frequently EYLEA. Certainly, we look forward to continued efforts on EYLEA this year is the standard of care. And as you know, from many of us talking to KOLs, they’re incredibly enthusiastic about the launch – potential launch of aflibercept 8-milligram coming later this year.
Ryan Crowe: Next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Leonard Schleifer: Matt, we don’t’ hear you.
Matthew Harrison: Sorry, could you not hear me, Len?
Leonard Schleifer: We hear you now.
Ryan Crowe: Yes, we can.
Matthew Harrison: Okay. Alright. Sorry. So I was just wondering if you could comment on COPD and what you view as clinically meaningful in terms of result there. Other companies have reported sort of 15%. But I think in the past, you’ve talked about that as not being a particularly high bar. So maybe you could just talk about how you view clinical meaning from this. Thanks.
George Yancopoulos: Well, we powered our futility analysis as well as our clinical trial to deliver what we believe would be clinically meaningful benefit if the study proves positive, which we hope it will. And remember, we’re going to be looking at both exist patios, but also improvement in lung function. So it will be a sort of integration of the benefit that patients can receive from both those measures. I remind you that in other settings in asthma, in particular, DUPIXENT has distinguished itself from other immunomodulators and delivering pretty substantial improvements in pulmonary lung function. So it’s not only all about exacerbations, but we hope to have significant improvements in exacerbations as well as in lung functions which will hopefully provide important benefits to patients.
Ryan Crowe: Thank you. Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Carter Gould with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Carter Gould: Hi, guys. Thank you very much for taking the question. You do have some APP data on the horizon here with Alnylam. I would love to kind of hear your thoughts on how you’re thinking about that. And if we should be thinking about that as more just a proof of concept or as a potential product opportunity even with intrathecal delivery? And if, I guess, more of the former, how much of this is sort of a gating factor to really kind of expanding the effort here potentially dramatically across a number of CNS diseases. Thank you.
George Yancopoulos: Well, as you say, the important thing about that aspect of the Alnylam collaboration is together, we were hoping for the first time to see if we could develop technology that would actually allow us to do what’s been done now by Alnylam and others in the liver to bring it to other tissues, particularly to the central nervous system in this case. So this – the first study, which is focused on APP is really a proof of concept that can we get this technology to work, we view it as a potential sort of platform enabler, meaning that if we see anything here and obviously these are challenging things to be first and to do something that nobody has ever done before. And it’s obviously very early in the program. But the goal is to establish proof of principle that this type of technology, which looks like it can be pretty effective in the liver, chat and work outside of the liver, particularly in the CNS. So this would be a platform enabler.
Ryan Crowe: Thanks, George. Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrams with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Brian Abrams: Hey, guys. Congrats on all the progress and thanks for taking my question. So with the potential approval coming this December, I am curious how we should be thinking about the launch cadence for high-dose aflibercept just considering some elements like the introduction of pre-filled syringe, the J-code and maybe your overall strategy and how you are thinking about converting market segments and where you are initially focused? Thanks.
Leonard Schleifer: Give us a second. We will disconnect all the Roche people on the call, so we can get you our strategy. In all seriousness, obviously, there is a lot of thought that’s going to go in between now and what we hope will be our late August approval on pricing, on rollout, on targeting, on strategy, etcetera, etcetera. But we are working on that. We have to get our label. We have to get it approved, and we will have everything else ready to go. The initial launch will be with a vial and then we hope down the road, not too far with the pre-filled syringe. Marion, I don’t know if you want to give away any of the secrets at this point.
Marion McCourt: I would just say that we have a highly experienced team in commercialization, and we certainly will be ready for the launch. And in the meantime, we are very focused on our participation in the market today with EYLEA. But certainly more to come, and we absolutely look forward to the potential launch of 8 milligrams.
Brian Abrams: Very good.
Leonard Schleifer: Obviously, the Vabysmo launch has not turned the market sideways on us. It’s real competition. But that, I think there is a window that’s sort of closing for them to compete against 2 milligrams, we hope and then 8 milligrams, we hope could become the standard of care. So, lots to look forward to later in the year.
Ryan Crowe: Certainly. Thank you. Next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Evan Seigerman: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a follow-up to Matt’s question, can you just speak to what you saw in the pre-specified interim efficacy analysis of the BOREAS trial and just any additional color on the level of benefit versus placebo that triggered the initiation of the NOTUS trial? Thank you.
George Yancopoulos: All I can say is that we powered it to deliver would be a clinically significant improvement. There was a combination of measures of exacerbations and lung function improvement, and we haven’t disclosed what those numbers were.
Leonard Schleifer: And we remain blinded to that interim analysis Evan. So, next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Salveen Richter: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. With regard to the oncology portfolio, what do you consider the most meaningful milestones for the next 12 months and particularly here the PSMAxCD28 asset? Thank you.
Leonard Schleifer: Well, we obviously have some important submissions we need to get in later in the year, as we mentioned, for our CD3 bispecifics. And we need to continue to get data later in the year with more patients with PSMAxCD28 bispecifics as well as from some of the other costim bispecifics. And we have to move aggressively enrolling the additional studies we planned for LAG-3. So – and we have to make Libtayo even more successful, we hope in the marketplace around the world. So, lots to do. I don’t know if George or Marion have anything else to add there?
George Yancopoulos: Yes. I think it’s – it was really critically important for us to validate individual agents in each class. That was our strategy. We wanted to develop the best-in-class checkpoint inhibitors, such as our PD-1 antibody, Libtayo, such as our LAG-3 antibody, fianlimab. We wanted to establish three bispecifics that we are best-in-class and that we are working in hem/onc settings, but also in solid tumor settings. And then, of course, we want to validate that this incredible principle of co-stimulatory bispecifics that we introduced into the world, which were truly magical in animal studies with essentially working like turnkey agents to synergize with the other two classes in animal studies that that we could reproduce that sort of activity in humans. And to us obviously, it takes years to get to that point, but we feel we are in a very exciting position right now because, as I have said, the individual classes are validated. We are starting to see impressive combination opportunities. We talked about combining two checkpoints, combining our LAG-3 with PD-1, where it looks like we have maybe taken first-line melanoma to a different point where patients can get a lot more benefit from this combination. And now having validated those, we are expanding much more broadly. Same thing with the CD3 bispecifics, we are growing that franchise now that we have shown that our platform works, and we are working both in hem/onc and outside in solid tumor settings. And the fact that our first costim bispecific delivered the sort of exciting early data that it delivered really gets us – very excited about the possibility now that we have this whole rollout. We have several of these costim bispecifics in the clinic, clearing their dose escalation safety settings, and we are now going to be rolling out data from these combinations, more data from the PSMA, costim bispecific in prostate cancer in more patients, but we are also going to be reporting on a series of other costims, including not only in combinations that we already talked about in solid tumors. But in the hem/onc space, where we are very excited, obviously, about our CD20xCD3 bispecific by itself and our BCMAxCD3 bispecific by themselves, that Len said. We are both filing for those hopefully by the end of the year, but also initiating earlier line studies. But just as importantly, we are going to be initiating combination with these costim bispecifics, which we think yet again, if these continue to work like they work not only in the animal models, but now how they are looking in the early human study, these could really leapfrog the individual agents to a whole place where they are really changing the practice of medicine and delivering much more benefit to patients, which is what we are all about.
Leonard Schleifer: Yes. I don’t think George’s point, can be overstated. Cancer cures in serious advanced tumors are still far and few between. And there is still tremendous need which makes this a very dynamic treatment marketplace because people want that extra benefit because it’s not like they are getting cures. We haven’t cured lung cancer or we haven’t cured most serious cancers. So, the ability to have foundational individual treatments and then get more by combining them really does position us to leapfrog to use George’s word in the treatment paradigm out in the world because patients and their doctors are very sensitive to improve outcomes because there is still tremendous, tremendous need.
Ryan Crowe: Next question, Shannon.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Mohit Bansal: Good. Thank you for taking my question. Maybe staying with COPD, so talking to some KOLs and reading some papers. It seems like IL-13 has some implication into fibrosis as well. Now, so the question is, do you think there could be a beneficial effect of IL-13 blockade and its impact on fibrosis on COPD-4 and above blocking inflammation? And if yes, do you think a 1-year trial would be enough to see that?
George Yancopoulos: I think you bring up really interesting points. We were actually involved in some of the experiments years ago that showed that IL-13 could actually cause fibrosis in animal models. And certainly, we do believe that long-term, like in many of the diseases that we have studied so far, that the benefit of Dupixent and blocking both IL-4 and IL-13 can continue to accrue for the patient in terms of preventing the chronic inflammation that results in so much of this remodeling that you talked about. We believe this may be true in asthma. And we are actually involved in programs and studies to show that some of the same things that you are talking about will also benefit in that and you will prevent long-term remodeling that decreases lung function over time in structural changes in the asthmatic patients and we believe that, that may also be true, of course, in COPD. But first, we need, as you say, the shorter term studies to be positive, but we do believe that if they produce the type of data that we hope if Dupixent type data, we are hoping it could in COPD, that longer term studies, like you say, could end up showing even longer term benefits in terms of exactly the type of remodeling and fibrotic changes that result in permanent loss of function, lung function in these patients. So, we think that you are totally right, but it will probably, as you say, take longer term studies to actually pick that up.
Ryan Crowe: Thanks George. Next question Shannon.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Colin Bristow with UBS. Your line is now open.
Colin Bristow: Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to sort of push a little more on the COPD readout. And just trying to understand what’s underpinning your confidence here. It certainly feels like you are more enthusiastic than what we are hearing out of Europe. Is this primarily based on the threshold set for BOREAS interim and these were sufficiently robust that you just – you feel good about the ultimate result, or is there something else you can point us to? Thanks.
Leonard Schleifer: Yes. I wouldn’t over under-read our situation right here. And it almost doesn’t matter because Regeneron is a data-driven enterprise, and we are all going to see the data coming up, we hope later this quarter. We are totally blinded to the evaluation that was done on the interim analysis. We have said we set it at a reasonable bar, but it was only a fraction of the patients. So, you never know how this is going to turn out, we would not be as confident about something like this compared to another classic Type 2 inflammatory disease. So, you have that on the negative side. But on the positive side, you do have the fact that we have selected patients who have eosinophils and we had this interim analysis. Bottom line is we look forward to the data as well as you do.
Ryan Crowe: Thanks Len. Next question Shannon.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.
Chris Raymond: Thanks. Maybe a broader question on the VEGF retinal market. Last year, at AAO, there was a lot of discussion and debate around the potential impact on the retinal specialist practices if intravitreal therapies for geographic atrophy are approved. And some folks were talking about, just back of the envelope, this could drive a pretty sizable like 30%-some increase in injection volume, the practices just from treating geographic atrophy patients. As you guys think about this dynamic, we have heard some KOLs sort of offer up potential fix to that, that they would move in a more accelerated fashion to longer duration, longer-acting therapies for wet AMD. Are you guys seeing that? Is that something that we should be thinking about in terms of a driver from short-acting to longer acting?
Leonard Schleifer: Yes. I mean I think despite all of these practice aspects, the primary driver will be that patients would prefer to get a needle in the eye less frequently. With every time you put a needle in the eye, there is a risk of inflammation or more serious complications hemorrhages, detachments, things like that. So, the less you have to do that and get the same benefit is better for the patients from the needle in the eye perspective. And it’s better for the patient from the number of times they have to come to the doctor’s office. These are elderly patients. Frequently, they have to have a caregiver. From a practice perspective, certainly, as many doctors’ offices are overwhelmed by – in the number of injections that they are giving and that they could free up time with if you could get the same result. From a practice point of view with less frequent injections, certainly that would free up more time and would drive them. But I believe at the end of the docs do make the decision with their patient on this primarily because less injections in the eye are just stapled and more convenient for the patient.
George Yancopoulos: Well we also shouldn’t lose sight of the fact that if treatments for geographic accuracy become much more take off and become much more prevalent that they do have a side effect. They are actually increasing levels of macular edema in these patients, which will of course, necessarily treatment there as well.
Ryan Crowe: Thanks. We have time for two more questions, Shannon.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Chris Schott: Great. Thanks so much for the question. Just on the costim platform, I guess once you land on the right dose for these products, do you expect that there could be accelerating filing pathways given the few options available for most of these patients – or do we still need to think about needing to go slowly even with the registrational studies as you are kind of balancing, I guess safety versus efficacy. Thank you.
Leonard Schleifer: Well, we certainly believe that when you are in something where there is tremendous medical need and no alternative, that there will be opportunities to move for accelerated approval. We are all aware of the new FDA guidelines that they want you to be underway with your pivotal studies are well underway, I think is a phrase they use. So, we are taking that into account. But there is no question that if we can reproduce the efficacy that we saw in these late-stage prostate cancer patients. There is not only the need, but there will be a mechanism to get that to patients as quickly as possible. Remember, the main issue as you referred to, is being mindful of the safety. And of course, we are doing everything we can to mitigate that. But remember, thus far for the most part, there has been an extremely tight linkage of safety and efficacy. That is the adverse events occurred in those patients who were having the substantial benefit. So, that makes the risk/reward even more attractive from a regulator’s and doctor’s and frankly, a patient’s perspective. But the short answer is we think we are not going to go too fast where one would be reckless. We have to be careful. But we do think there is an opportunity for an accelerated approval if we follow the new approach the FDA has laid out.
Ryan Crowe: Thanks Len. Last question, please, Shannon.
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Truist. Your line is now open.
Robyn Karnauskas: Great. Thank you for squeezing me in. So, just a follow-up on the prior question. So, for your MUC16, CD28 and MUC16 is a great combination, what are you expecting regarding the safety profile and how do you think about that type of combination efficacy and safety vice versa as CD28-CPI combo? And just a follow-up to that, I know the FDA was concerned back in the day about dosing up with CD28 is superagonist, like do you think that your initial data might alleviate some of the needs of the low doses for CD28 bispecifics? Thanks.
George Yancopoulos: Well, a lot of good questions in there. I will start from the end first. For sure, when we started the program, there was very serious concerns about previous experience with general CD28 activators that activated all over the body that resulted in really horrific situations for patients, which almost killed the field. We invented this new approach to tightly limit where we were limiting CD28 activation right at the tumor surface and so forth. And of course, there was a concern from the FDA, which is why, as you said, they made us employ a very, very conservative dose escalation program. We had to go through five or six dose levels just to get to where we thought were the active dose levels where we then start to see the rather dramatic antitumor activity that we began to report. We are hoping that as we get more experience and show that what we had demonstrated pre-clinically is really holding true in humans. In fact, the side effects that Len was talking about immune-related adverse events are totally unrelated to the sort of toxicities that were seen with non-specific CD28 superagonist in the past. They were really much more on target and on mechanism that is we were generating a presumably a polyclonal T-cell response against the tumor and some of that cross-reacted to tissues in the patients, and that’s what we were seeing. So, we are hoping that increasingly we might be able to move a little bit more quickly through some of these dose escalation stages to get to the active doses with these other agents. What we are seeing so far, as we have presented in our posters on MUC16xCD3 that right now it’s having an acceptable safety margin. And we also hope to see that when combined, either the CD3 combined with the MUC16xCD28 or when the MUC16 is combined with Libtayo that we will see the same sort of things that we saw with the PSMAxD28 that we will be getting, hopefully, market synergy and increase in the antitumor activity with hopefully a satisfactory safety window. And but that remains to be seen, and that’s why we are carefully going through the combination studies and the dose escalation studies. But once again, I mean just to say how I mean exciting it is for those of us who have been working on these programs for over 10 years to be at this point where the individual agents and the individual classes are now validated and we now get to mix and match these things. And as Len said, the history of the field is when you have active agents and you start combining this, you can then leapfrog and get to the next level that would change the practice of medicine for these cancers. That’s what we are aiming to do to try to save more lives, extend more lives, and it’s an exciting place to be in.
Ryan Crowe: Thanks George. That’s all the time we have for today. Thanks to everybody who dialed in and for your interest in Regeneron. We apologize to those remaining in the queue that we did not have a chance to get to. And as always, the IR team is available to answer any questions you may have. Thank you once again and have a great day and a nice weekend.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Leonard Schleifer: Thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone joining today's call. Regeneron's strong operational momentum continued in the third quarter, highlighted by important developments across our pipeline and outstanding commercial execution. Total revenues for the quarter increased by 11% compared to last year when excluding contributions from our COVID antibody cocktail. With global net sales of Dupixent and Libtayo, as well as U.S. net sales of EYLEA once again reaching new all-time quarterly highs and growing by double digits. Before diving deeper into our commercial results, I'd like to review some of the recent progress we have made across our pipeline, starting with the striking pivotal data that we reported, in September, for our investigational Aflibercept8 mg, which we believe could ultimately transform the treatment landscape for patients. With nearly 90% of DME patients and 80% of wet AMD patients able to sustain 16-weeks maintenance dosing through 48 weeks of treatment, we believe Aflibercept8 mg may shift the current treatment paradigm, with more patients receiving less frequent injections, while achieving visual acuity gains anatomical improvements, and a safety profile comparable to EYLEA. It has proven to be very difficult to decrease the treatment burden beyond what we were able to achieve with EYLEA over a decade ago with many potential treatments failing either due to suboptimal visual outcomes or safety issues. A recently issued anti-VEGF agent did not demonstrate in pivotal studies that the majority of patients in either disease were able to sustain 16-week maintenance dosing throughout the first year of treatment, supporting our view that Aflibercept8 mg has the potential to become the next generation's standard of care anti-VEGF treatment, assuming regulatory approval. We plan to submit the Aflibercept8 mg pivotal data to the FDA under a single BLA at the end of this year, and have decided to use a previously granted priority review voucher to expedite the FDA review process. Pre-launch planning is already underway, with a potential FDA approval by late August 2023. In addition to the pivotal Aflibercept8 mg data, Regeneron continued to make notable progress in our immunology and oncology pipelines. Starting with immunology, in September, we received FDA approval for Dupixent in prurigo nodularis, the first systemic therapy for this indication, and the fifth disease for which Dupixent is now approved. So far this year, Dupixent has received four U.S. or E.U. regulatory approvals, expanding the treatment-eligible population by approximately 225,000 patients, including in two diseases that previously had no FDA-approved systemic therapies. In the first-half of next year, we are looking forward the E.U. regulatory decisions for eosinophilic esophagitis, prurigo nodularis, and atopic dermatitis in patients as young as six months. With these potential additional indications, approximately 200,000 more patients with these type 2 inflammatory diseases could benefit from Dupixent's unmatched clinical profile. Additionally, we expect pivotal data readouts for Dupixent in chronic inducible cold-urticaria, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the first-half of next year. Moving to oncology, where the depth and breadth of our pipeline has positioned Regeneron to ultimately become a global leader. We presented several datasets at this year's European Society for Medical Oncology Annual Meeting, further underscoring the importance of Libtayo as the foundation for our overall oncology strategy. George will review the data in more detail during his remarks, but we were particularly encouraged by the results for Libtayo monotherapy in neoadjuvant CSCC as well as Libtayo in combination with Fianlimab, our LAG-3 antibody, in first-line metastatic melanoma. We also presented monotherapy data for our MUC16 by CD3 bispecific in recurrent ovarian cancer, which has the potential to be combined with Libtayo as well as data for our METxMET biparatopic bispecific in MET-altered non-small cell lung cancer. I'd also note the early but very exciting results for our PSMAxCD28 costimulatory bispecific in combination with Libtayo, which showed promising anti-tumor activity in patients with advanced metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. The patients enrolled in our study have a poor prognosis, with an expected survival of one to two years depending up on their treatment history. Given prostate cancer has been largely unresponsive to PD-1 inhibition and immunotherapy in general, there is a clear need for new treatments. In 2020 alone, there were over 375,000 deaths globally from prostate cancer, and it was the second leading cause of cancer death in American men. We continue to expand our costimulatory bispecific efforts in prostate cancer with an acceleration in enrollment in our first immune study since we reported our top line results, in August. And we look forward to updating you on this program in the first-half of next year. Now turning to our commercial performance, in the third quarter, EYLEA global net sales grew 8% at constant currency to $2.4 billion. In the U.S. EYLEA net sales were $1.63 billion, up 11% year-over-year, and outperforming the anti-VEGF category growth of only 4%. Despite recent branded and biosimilar entrants, EYLEA set a new all-time high for anti-VEGF category share in the United States. Dupixent continued to grow at a remarkable pace bolstered by approvals in new diseases and younger patient populations in previously approved indications. In the third quarter, global net product sales were $2.3 billion, up 45% at constant currency compared to last year, reflecting growth across all indications and all geographies. Dupixent's differentiated clinical profile and ability to effectively treat more and more patients in both currently approved indications and potentially for additional type-2 inflammatory diseases is expected to drive strong growth in the future. Libtayo total net sales grew 25% globally at constant currency, to $143 million in the third quarter, including 21% growth in United States driven by non-melanoma skin cancer indications and monotherapy non-small cell lung cancer. At the start of the third quarter, we acquired global rights to Libtayo from Sanofi, with potential future combinations including with chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer as well as other pipeline agents in development, we believe Libtayo is poised to become a more meaningful revenue contributor over time. We are excited about the strong commercial performance for our core products with compelling efficacy, safety, and durability data that we reported for Aflibercept8 mg, as well as the notable progress we have made advancing our pipeline, particularly in oncology. Our pipeline now includes approximately 35 product candidates in clinical development including a number of marketed products that we are investigating for additional indications. Some of which, George will discuss in a moment. In closing, our strategy continues to focus on investing in our internal R&D capabilities while exploring potential collaborations that will enable us to fully realize the power of our science. We remain confident in this strategy and in our growth prospects as well as in our ability to deliver breakthroughs to patients and value to shareholders. Now, I will turn the call over to George.
George Yancopoulos: Thank you, Len. I will start with ophthalmology. Positive pivotal results for Aflibercept8 mg in the PULSAR and PHOTON study recently presented at the American Academy of Ophthalmology Annual Meeting. Results of these trials in wet AMD and DME respectively demonstrated that a remarkably high percentage of patients were able to be rapidly initiated into and then successfully maintained through week 48 on 12- and 16-week dosing intervals while achieving vision gains that were non-inferior to the current standard of care, EYLEA 2 mg dosed every 8 weeks. These results suggest that Aflibercept8 mg has the potential to become the new standard of care in these retinal diseases. I think it would be helpful if we step back for a minute and try to put these results in context. What our trials did was push the limits far beyond what has been accomplished with any currently available anti-VEGF therapies. Rather than using response criteria to try to identify or slowly extend patients to longer dosing intervals, our trials tested whether all patients could be randomly assigned and rapidly initiated on extended dosing intervals of Aflibercept8 mg without compromising visual improvement or safety. These Aflibercept8 mg trials accomplished just that for the vast majority while delivering a safety profile consistent with that of EYLEA. Eighty nine percent of DME patients and 77% of wet AMD patients were able to be rapidly initiated and maintained on a 16-week of Aflibercept8 mg dosing regimen while 93% of DME and 83% of wet AMD patients were able to be rapidly initially maintained on at least a 12-week dosing interval. All while delivering efficacy similar to that of EYLEA administered every 8 weeks. We believe these are truly unprecedented and potentially game changing results which have not been achieved using any other anti-VEGF agent. Others have speculated that PULSAR and PHOTON results were due to our dose modification criteria and even tried to theoretically extrapolate that their agent could have somehow approached these results using our criteria. We put these speculative extrapolations into the category of wishful thinking. And based on our expert analysis of the data, we conclude it is all about the drug and not the trial design. Briefly moving on to Dupixent, building on our recent approval in eosinophilic esophagitis in adults and adolescents, we are planning on submitting a supplementary BLA for eosinophilic esophagitis in 1- to 1-year old children in mid 2023. Dupixent ability to treat eosinophilic esophagitis highlights how important it is that our IL-4 and IL-13 blocker more completely target the entire type 2 inflammatory cascade and not only eosinophils. As you heard Len mention, the FDA label was expanded yet again in the third quarter ad Dupixent became the first and only treatment indicated for prurigo nodularis, a debilitating chronic skin disease. This marks the fifth disease for which Dupixent is now approved. Our collective clinical data with Dupixent support a unifying molecular mechanism underlying these related diseases from asthma to atopic dermatitis to nasal polyps to prurigo nodularis to eosinophilic esophagitis. In this unifying hypothesis, IL-4 and IL-13 induced inflammation is driving all these related diseases in different tissue compartments. Moving to Libtayo and oncology, in the third quarter, our robust oncology pipeline has started to deliver data readout from our latest and most innovative programs. We are expecting these readouts to accelerate in the remainder of 2022 and continue into 2023. The European Society of Medical Oncology or ESMO Annual Meeting in September was a truly a banner event for Regeneron with several notable oral presentations for assets in our oncology pipeline, which I would like to briefly summarize. Starting with Fianlimab, our LAG-3 antibody in combination with Libtayo, at ESMO, we shared data from two independent advanced melanoma expansion cohorts from our first in human study which importantly showed consistent efficacy and safety between the two replicate cohorts. Fianlimab in combination with Libtayo demonstrated greater than 60% response rates in each cohort. A median PFS estimated will be 24 months across both cohorts, and a median duration of response that has not yet been reached. The preliminary safety profile of the combination appears to be in line with anti-PD-1 monotherapy and potentially with less toxicity compared to anti-CTLA-4 combination. While dual LAG-3 and PD-1 inhibition has previously shown promise in advanced melanoma, response rates greater than 45% with median PFS of more than a year has not been previously reported. These initial results in melanoma suggest that Fianlimab–Libtayo combination has the potentially best-in-class profile in the setting. We are enrolling our Phase 3 metastatic melanoma study. Intend to initiate a Phase 3 adjuvant melanoma study later this year and have additional plans in other solid tumors where Fianlimab has a potential to be first-in-class. The neoadjuvant cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma or CSCC, a Phase 2 study of Libtayo monotherapy has shown promising results. Given prior to potentially curative surgery in patients with large tumors, Libtayo was able to deliver major pathological responses to 63% of patients prior to surgery. This raises the possibility that Libtayo could decrease the burden of these major and potentially disfiguring surgeries for the many patients who require them each year. We are pleased that concurrent with the ESMO presentation, these data were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Regarding next steps, we are talking to regulators about possible pathways to labeling and potential inclusion in the NCCN guidelines. Also at ESMO, we presented initial clinical data for Ubamatamab, our MUC16xCD3 bispecific developed for advanced ovarian cancer, our first clinical data for a CD3 bispecific in a solid tumor. In heavily pre-treated ovarian cancer population, we observed durable responses to this MUC16xCD3 monotherapy. In a patient subset whose tumors over expressed MUC16, response rates were as high as 31%. Most of the treatment emergent adverse events occurred with the initial step up dosing. Ubamatamab is being developed as a monotherapy as well as in combination with Libtayo as well as in combination with our MUC16 co-stim bispecific. We are looking forward to more data across these programs in 2023. In our ESMO investor presentation, we shared more detailed data for our PSMAxCD28 co-stim bispecific in combination with Libtayo, representing the first efficacy and safety data with this new class of bispecifics which we had initially top lined and discussed at our second quarter earnings. We have since continued to enroll patients in the study. We are planning to present updated data at a medical meeting in the first-half of 2023. Regarding our hem/onc pipeline, we are looking forward to data from Odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific as well as Linvoseltamab, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific at the American Society of Hematology or ASH Annual Meeting in December. For Odronextamab, we will present pivotal Phase 2 data for both follicular lymphoma and diffused large B-cell lymphoma in two separate oral presentations. Upon discussions with the FDA, we are now targeting a second-half 2023 regulatory filing of this program. We hope to initiate combination studies with an appropriate CD28 co-stim bispecific in the near future. For Linvoseltamab, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific antibody, we remain on-track with development. And we are planning to file pending discussions with the FDA in 2023. We have now completed enrollment in our potentially pivotal Phase 2 study. As I mentioned earlier, data from this study will be updated at ASH. As with our Odronextamab, we are planning on initiating combination studies for Linvoseltamab with co-stimulatory bispecifics in the near future. We believe existing standard of care therapies leave significant room for improvement in these difficult-to-treat settings. And we have been encouraged by the interim efficacy and safety data we have generated today for both Odronextamab and Linvoseltamab. Finally at ESMO, we also shared initial data for our Maftivimab bispecific antibody in MET-altered non-small cell lung cancer. Responses were rich in patients with high levels of MET expression. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Even the modest over expression of MET may render lung cancer susceptible to this mechanism of action. And we are looking forward to the METxMET antibody-drug conjugate data next year. In summary, for oncology, a rich commentarial pipeline is delivering competitive data. And with our full ownership of Libtayo, we are excited about the potential to advance standard of care in oncology with our portfolio approach. Concluding with the Regeneron genetic medicines efforts where we continue to progress our pipeline and discovery engine. In September we and Alnylam reported promising data from our ongoing Phase 1 study of Alnylam HSD nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or NASH. We are planning on initiating a Phase 2 studies shortly, which is just one part of our multi-pronged approach exploring multiple genetically validated targets for NASH. Also in September, we and Intellia announced initial data from the cardiomyopathy arm of our ongoing Phase 1 study of NTLA-2001. An investigational CRISPR-based therapy for the treatment of transthyretin amyloidosis, which show deep and sustained mean serum TTR reductions of over 90% and was generally well tolerated. Finally, in October our collaborators at Decibel Therapeutics announced FDA clearance where an NDA application for DB-OTO, a first virally delivered gene therapeutic product candidate designed to provide hearing to individuals with otoferlin-related hearing loss. This IND provides clearance to initiate a pediatric Phase 1/2 clinical trial in the United States. With that, I will turn it over to Marion.
Marion McCourt: Thank you, George. Our third quarter performance reflects strength and across our commercial portfolio. We continue to extend our leadership position in additional therapeutic categories as part of our commitment to deliver life-changing medicines to patients in need. With Dupixent’s approval in prurigo nodularis, Libtayo’s anticipated approval in combination with chemotherapy in first line event non-small cell lung cancer and recent data demonstrating the compelling profile of Aflibercept8 mg, Regeneron’s commercial business is poised to deliver long-term growth. Starting with EYLEA, which reached $2.4 billion in global net sales for the third quarter, this represents an 8% increase on a constant currency basis, a remarkable achievement for brand that launched 11 years ago. In the U.S., EYLEA net sales grew 11% year-over-year to $1.63 billion to again achieve over a million injections in the quarter. Despite the overall 2% sequential category decline in volume from the second to third quarter of 2022, EYLEA continued to grow across all indications gaining share from both branded and unbranded agents. In fact, EYLEA reached all-time highs in category share of approximately 50% with a commanding 75% share in the branded category. We continue to strengthen and extend EYLEA’s leadership position in the anti-VEGF category as we recently announced the FDA has granted pediatric exclusivity for EYLEA, thereby, extending the period of EYLEA U.S. market exclusivity by an additional six months through May 17, 2024. Since announcing positive Phase 3 results earlier this year, there has been widespread excitement in the retina community about the Aflibercept8 mg dataset and Aflibercept8 mg’s potential to become the future standard of care, if approved. Next to Libtayo, total global product sales were $143 million, growing 25% on a constant currency basis. In the U.S., net sales grew 21% to $95 million based on growth in our lung and non-melanoma skin indications. We see particular opportunity for growth in lung cancer over time. In monotherapy, there are already steady increases in prescribers and total utilization. We are launch-ready for the potential chemotherapy combination approval which significantly expands the patient opportunity. And finally to Dupixent, third quarter global net sales were $2.3 billion, up 45% on a constant currency basis. In the U.S., net sales grew 45% to $1.82 billion driven by a robust demand across atopic dermatitis, asthma, and nasal polyps. Growth was also driven by a rapid launch trajectory across recent indications including eosinophilic esophagitis and pediatric atopic dermatitis where Dupixent is the only biologic to be approved from infancy through adulthood. Starting with dermatology, in atopic dermatitis, Dupixent is the leading first line systemic therapy with strong uptake across the spectrum of moderate to severe disease, and across age groups. The ongoing launching short in as young as six months is professing very well, providing release shot in MS families as well as enforcing the safety of Dupixent for all age groups. We've also expanded Dupixent's leadership in dermatology. Following its approval in prurigo nodularis, Dupixent is the only FDA approved medicine for this chronic stabilitating skin disease that affects approximately 75,000 adults in the U.S. Early launch indicators are positive with patients already being initiated on therapy. Dupixent also continue to perform well in the highly competitive asthma market, with steady growth in prescriptions and new patient starts, as well as nasal polyps. Early launch performance in eosinophilic esophagitis has been very strong, with broad adoption from both gastroenterologists and allergists. The medical community has embraced Dupixent as patients previously had very limited options. Dupixent is the only medicine indicated to treat eosinophilic esophagitis, and is the only treatment shown to address the underlying disease causes resulting in unprecedented symptom release. There are presently 50,000 adults and adolescent patients in the U.S., and we continue to advance our clinical efforts in younger patients where substantial unmet need remains. Outside the U.S., Dupixent net sales were 506 million, going 44% on a constant currency basis. There is rapid uptake across approved indications, and we continue to execute on recent launches, and expand into new geographies. As part of this, Regeneron's increased presence in key international market supports efforts to bring Dupixent to even more patients. In conclusion, our third quarter performance demonstrates strength in growth across our commercial portfolio. We are successfully executing on initiative to deliver life-changing medicines to patients, and advancing strategies to maximize new and upcoming launches. Our commercial portfolio is positioned well to drive long-term and sustainable growth. Now, I will turn the call to Bob.
Robert Landry: Thank you, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on non-GAAP basis, unless otherwise noted. Regeneron performed well in the third quarter, with growth from key brands and execution across the business continuing to drive strong financial results on both the top and bottom line. Excluding global revenues related to the COVID-19 antibody cocktail, third quarter total revenues increased 11% year-over-year to $2.9 billion, demonstrating continued growth momentum from our core business and reflecting the favorable impact of the Libtayo transaction. Third quarter total diluted net income per share was $11.14 on net income of $1.3 billion. Beginning with collaboration revenue, and starting with Bayer; third quarter 2022 ex-U.S. product sales were 817 million, up 4% on a constant currency basis, versus third quarter of 2021. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $333 million, of which, $315 million related to our share of EYLEA in those profits outside the U.S. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $711 million in the third quarter of 2022, and grew 22% from the prior year, driven by Dupixent. Recall that in connection with the Libtayo transaction, we increased the repayment of our antibody collaboration development balance from 10% to 20% of antibody collaboration profits. A portion of this step-up is recorded as a reduction to antibody collaboration revenues, while another portion is recorded as R&D expense. Given Regeneron is now recording its full 50% share of antibody collaboration R&D expense has incurred, previously Regeneron had only recognized a partial share of its antibody collaboration R&D expense has incurred, with the remaining share of expenses added to the antibody development balance. Also, as we highlighted last quarter, in accordance with the agreement, we recorded a one time development balance repayment of $57 million as an incremental reduction to Sanofi collaboration revenue in the third quarter of 2022. We have posted to our Web site supporting materials to further explain the accounting associated with this and other elements of the Libtayo transaction. Moving now to our operating expenses, R&D increased 38% year-over-year to $817 million, partially driven by the impact of the Libtayo transaction, which affects R&D in two ways. First, Regeneron now records all R&D expense for Libtayo, which was previously shared equally with Sanofi. Second, as I mentioned earlier, Regeneron now records our full 50% share of antibody collaborations spend for Dupixent and Itepekimab. SG&A expense increased 20% year-over-year, to $467 million primarily driven due to incremental costs related to assuming global rights to Libtayo. Cost of goods sold in the third quarter was $109 million, and product gross margin in the quarter increased to 94% as compared to 90.2% in the prior year. The more favorable gross margin was driven by the non-recurrence of REGEN-COV sales in the current period and the removal of the payment to Sanofi for their share of U.S. Libtayo gross margin. Finally, the third quarter 2022 effective tax rate was 12.1% compared to 10.8% in the prior year. Shifting now to cash flow in the balance sheet, year-to-date in 2022, Regeneron has generated $2.9 billion in free cash flow, and ended the third quarter of 2022 with cash and marketable securities less debt of approximately $10.3 billion. We remain focused on leveraging our strong financial position to deliver long-term value for shareholders. Over the first nine months of 2022, we have deployed in excess of $2.8 billion in capital; we have executed approximately $1.2 billion in business development initiatives including the $900 million acquisition of Libtayo rights. Additionally, we have repurchased over $1.6 billion of our shares, including over $900 million in the third quarter alone. As of September 30, we had approximately $1.2 billion remaining on our current share repurchase authorization, and we remain opportunistic buyers. As we approach the end of the year, we've made some minor changes to our 2022 guidance ranges. A complete summary of our latest full-year financial guidance is available on our press release issued earlier this morning. In addition to these changes, I would also like to provide some initial thoughts on our 2023 expense outlook. We continue to make investments to advance our pipeline and position the company for long-term growth. We expect R&D investment to grow in 2023 comparable to our slightly above the nine-month year-to-date growth rate reported earlier today. The incremental R&D investment in 2023 will be driven by advancing our immuno-oncology, hematology, immunology, and genetics medicine pipeline, as well as the continued expansion of our R&D organization. In addition, 2023 will be the first full-year reflecting the impact of the Libtayo transaction where we record 100% of the global R&D spend for Libtayo and our full 50% share of the Sanofi antibody collaboration R&D spend as incurred. For SG&A in 2023, we currently project growth in the mid teens versus 2022 given we'll be recording a full-year of global Libtayo expenses along with targeted investments in the build-out of our international infrastructure. Finally, for other operating income and expense in the third quarter of 2022, we recognized the remaining $44 million of deferred income related to previously-received upfront payments in development milestone for Fasinumab as a result of the program discontinuation. We do not currently expect any material other operating income or expense in the fourth quarter of 2022, in 2023, and beyond absent any new transactions. In conclusion, Regeneron has performed exceptionally well in the first nine-months of 2022, and our strong financial position enables continued investment to drive long-term growth. With that, I will pass the call back to Ryan.
Ryan Crowe: Thank you, Bob. So, Towanda, this concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call for Q&A. With the number of callers in the queue, I'd like to ensure we are able to address as many questions as possible. As a result, we'll only be able to answer one question from each caller before moving to the next. So, Towanda, please open the call for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from line of Evan Seigerman with BMO. Your line is open.
Evan Seigerman: Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking my questions, and congrats on the progress. So, with nearly $13 billion on the balance sheet and minimal debt, can you provide more color on your capital allocation priorities? Would you consider business development on a larger scale and/or issuing a dividend?
Robert Landry: Evan, hi, good morning, it's Bob. With regards to capital allocation, and demonstrated today by our growth in R&D in the 2023 forward guidance, we are going to continue to invest, first and foremost, in the R&D pipeline that we have. We issued our 10-Q this morning, within the MD&A; you'll see a plethora of trials that are currently ongoing. And as George mentioned in his script, we're very bullish with regards to what is in the pipeline. Now, again with regards to business development, it's not a [and or and or] [Ph], right, as you saw in what we've done in the first nine months of 2022, where we do think there are opportunities and where we do think we can do collaborations where one plus one is three, then we're absolutely going to take that opportunity, and I think Checkmate was a good example of that. And I would expect that you'd see more of that. With regards to your question on dividends, it's never a never. Obviously, that tool is in our tool chest if we do decide to play that card. As of right now, we don't have dividends in the foreseeable future in our plan. We have been very opportunistic with regards to buybacks. Again, the MD&A issued earlier today, the 10-Q will show you what we've been buying back our shares. Again, we'll remain opportunistic buyers. And we do have a remaining $1.2 billion remaining under our current $3 billion authorization.
Ryan Crowe: Thanks, Bob. So, Towanda, please have the next question on, please.
Operator: Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Van Buren with Cowen. Your line is open.
Tyler Van Buren: Hi, guys. Good morning. Congratulations on the great quarter. So, I just pulled up the Odronextamab and 5458 NASH abstracts, and it'd be great to get a brief preview from you guys on what you need -- what you believe you ultimately need to show at the conference to be competitive relative to what others have shown?
Leonard Schleifer: Yes, I don't think we want to scoop ourselves given that the conference is coming up pretty soon, Tyler. But Odronextamab has the potential of being a very important molecule. We recognize that there are some people ahead of us, and we recognize that some of the most recent timelines are pushed back a little bit based on recent regulatory feedback. The regulators have recently been focused on having Phase 3 trials substantially enrolled at the time of submission before they'll grant accelerated approval. But we are confident in the profile of Odronextamab. And as George says, there is also the future possibility of combinations with other things in our pipeline that could really even leapfrog.
Ryan Crowe: Thanks, Len. Next question, please, Towanda?
Operator: Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Salveen Richter: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. On EYLEA, what are you observing in the market between yourselves and Roche for the Vabysmo launch?
Marion McCourt: So, happy to give more characterization, as I mentioned, we see EYLEA continuing to perform extremely well, reaching all-times high category share of 50%, and now as well growth in the overall branded market where we participate with other branded agents, including Roche. One thing I will mention just to give a bit more insight is that EYLEA captured growth coming primarily from Lucentis and also from Avastin. And, in fact, if you put the Roche portfolio together, the growth of EYLEA obviously was positive, while there was a decline in a real market share for the Roche products combined.
Ryan Crowe: Thank you, Marion. Next question, Towanda?
Operator: Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Matthew Harrison: Great, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. George, I was wondering if you could just comment on your outlook for the COPD study for Dupixent and how you think about that market opportunity? Thanks.
George Yancopoulos: Actually COPD has been a very difficult disease for new therapies in biologics in particular. We think that there is a category of patients with COPD who have or are marked by more of what we call Th2-type inflammation. We think that, as I said in my remarks, that there's this unifying hypothesis there are a lot of Th2-type diseases that manifest in different ways. We believe that this subset of patients with COPD may maybe or fit into that category. And being able to benefit these patients in [technical difficulty] terms of either reducing their exacerbations and/or improving their lung function would really make a difference to these patients. And so, we're anxiously awaiting the data, and we're hopeful that we will have another set of patients where we might be able to demonstrate that Dupixent could really make a difference.
Ryan Crowe: Thanks, George. Towanda, next question?
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Tim Anderson: Thank you so much. Lilly will be launching Lebrikizumab in '23 in atopic derm, and they have data that looks comparable to Dupixent, at least in this one indication. Pretty much a direct competitor, although not identical on mechanism, they know the derma space because it halts, and the positioning is going to be that they can dose every month versus Dupixent, which is every two weeks. So, I'm wondering if you have any strong views on that product or if you think that it's going to be total nonstarter which is pretty much the consensus view I get?
Leonard Schleifer: Maybe Marion can comment on it. But look, there's room for competitors in this market. We're really modestly penetrated in the opportunity. I don't think that the profile that you say is actually going to be suppressed. We've seen it so far, all that's similar. We have the earliest, from infancy already to adulthood. That's a big deal, okay. In addition, the fact that many of these people have other comorbidities, whether it be asthma or nasal polyps, for example, and they can get, if they do have comorbidities, this single drug can treat both. It's a very big differentiator. So, I think when you're the market leader, when you're so far ahead, when you have really a differentiated profile you have an advantage. Obviously, Lilly is a fine company; they know what they're doing. But as I said, there's room, frequently, when new, good drugs come to market there is a growth of the market. And we're not going after a fixed number of patients; we're actually growing those patients. Marion, I don't know if you want to add anything?
Marion McCourt: So, I would just add that most of the key opinion leaders that we speak to recognize that the dual mechanism of action, the NTIL-4 coupled with NTIL-13 is very, very important, so certainly efficacy shouldn't be assumed. There's also reinforcement on the incredible efficacy that's seen for patients with moderate-through-severe disease. And, obviously, real world experience is compelling. The administration with Dupixent is really quite straightforward, it's self-administration, and we actually see there the active patient or parent involvement has been very helpful in establishing Dupixent. But certainly as Len mentioned, expanding the education in category to bring more atopic dermatitis patients into the treatment continuum is very positive for patients, and certainly for Dupixent.
George Yancopoulos: Not to pile on, but since -- just to add on to what Len was saying. I mean the fact that the IL-13 have failed in these other important Th2 inflammation-driven diseases, like asthma and like COPD and others right now really does suggest that they are not fully addressing the Th2 inflammation, both in any one particular disease, but also as Len said, so many of these individuals, if you just look at our label or any label that describes these diseases, they suffer from other allergic comorbidities. And so, obviously, it can make such a difference for a patient where one drug can treat a systemic disease as opposed to treating the disease only in one of the many compartments where it manifests itself. I think this is the way I think medicine in the field should be moving. This is a systemic disease where Th2 inflammation is probably rampant in many compartments in the body, you don't only want to treat it in one compartment, you want to treat the entire body. And that's what we've been showing systematically, by going one disease after another with Dupixent. It works in every compartment, and it broadly attacks the underlying inflammation that's related and causative in all of these diseases.
Ryan Crowe: Okay, thank you for that response. Towanda, can we go to the next question?
Operator: Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Mohit Bansal: Great, thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the progress. If I could probe little bit further on the comments you made about the growth of anti-VEGF market, you said it's about 4% year-over-year. Seems like bit of slowdown from what the high growth we have seen. Could you elaborate it further, do you see -- just one quarter, do you see any underlying trend there and it because of the high growth we saw post-COVID, which is tapering down, if you could help us understand that? Thank you.
Marion McCourt: I think it's very difficult to extrapolate one quarter. Certainly I did mentioned that there'd been a sequential decline of about 2% going from the second quarter into the third quarter in the overall anti-VEGF category. But I think it's really difficult to extrapolate from that. The numbers you shared on overall year-over-year growth of category, at about 4%, we recognize as well. I think we'll have to see as a bit more time goes by. But it's really difficult to draw conclusions on what may or may not have occurred in a one-quarter period.
Mohit Bansal: Got it.
Leonard Schleifer: There's still quite a bit of room of growth in the diabetic eye diseases area. We still see a decent growth there in that category.
Mohit Bansal: Helpful, thank you.
Leonard Schleifer: Next question.
Ryan Crowe: Thank you. Thank you, Len, and Marion, and Mohit. Next question, please, Towanda?
Operator: Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Raymond with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Christopher Raymond: Hey, thanks. Just another question maybe on the VEGF market and EYLEA specifically, so in our checks we get a sense that there's some docs who believe that Vabysmo confers differentiated efficacy. But on the other hand, there's still a sizable amount of docs who've yet to see a patient for follow-up after the first dose. So, sort of just curious if, in the field, you're seeing a difference in perception of Vabysmo by time of experience, that is any discernable change in perception with the more patient follow-up they've had? Thanks.
Marion McCourt: I think it's probably best that Roche answer questions on what they're hearing about use. I'll just share at this point, I haven't heard characterization or that use is still at a low level, in fact quite modest. I can characterize the EYLEA performance, as I did, in terms of market leadership and the growth we see in our business in terms of market share and other parameters, and that is across indications, and certainly substantially creating EYLEA as leader in the anti-VEGF category. And, obviously, we're very enthusiastic as is the retina community, probably even more important about the possibilities and potential of Aflibercept8 mg if approved in the future.
Ryan Crowe: Thank you, Marion. Next question, please.
Operator: Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Bristow with UBS. Your line is open.
Colin Bristow: Hey, good morning, and congrats on the quarter. So, on EYLEA, in '23, we're starting to see [confirmary] [Ph] updates. So, I was wondering, could you just speak to how you see the market share evolving over the course of '23 in light of Vabysmo, and then, obviously, biosimilars? And then just as we think about high-dose EYLEA in the back-half of the year, anything you can say in terms of anticipated OpEx changes? Thank you.
Marion McCourt: So, as a start, we don't predict future market share performance, so I'm going to stay away from specifics in that area. Certainly, not only this quarter but over several quarters, we've been able to demonstrate continuing strong performance with EYLEA as anti-VEGF category leader. And certainly we'll continue to work on that. And as agents have entered the market, our competitive readiness abilities have been very strong. But most important, frankly, it's the profile of EYLEA; the clinical attributes, the safety of the product, the breadth of indications, ease of access for physicians and patients, but going forward, certainly we will be very much prepared to launch Aflibercept8 mg and you know, as we get into that launch potentially with an FDA approval we will be able to give more characterization, but as George and Len described today, the profile of Aflibercept8 mg and opinion leaders in the retina community confirm that this profile potentially has all the ingredients to become standard of care, and certainly that's what we work on all the benefits of vision coupled with safety, and now this potential of substantial durability that hasn’t been seen before in the category.
Robert Landry: Collin, it's Bob. With regards to OpEx, I mean Marion and I will do what we always do on the brands. We'll look at what totally makes sense. I mean as you know, it's kind of to find number of retinal docs. It's not as if we are going into tremendously new area that creates a lot of new touch points on it. And on top of that, Marion's team right now is a very tight functioning sales rep team on the top of their game. So, again, we don’t expect some gigantic pivots in this area, but again, we will make sure that we fund this appropriately and that it is -- the commercial side of it is going to match how well the clinical data is going to stand up on it. Thanks.
Colin Bristow: Thank you.
Ryan Crowe: Okay. Next question, please?
Operator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with RBC. Your line is open.
Brian Abrahams: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the continued execution and innovation. On Costimulatory Bispecifics, by specific, now that you have more time with the evolving data, any views on predictors of response of durability there, and I'm curious how your learnings might shape your latest thoughts on threading the therapeutic window, both for the PSMA as you accelerate the trail enrollment, as well as your other Costimulatory Bispecifics? Thanks.
George Yancopoulos: Yes. I think that our data actually shows that with the remarkable response rates, which we saw especially going to the higher doses, yet it's not as if you have to look hard to find biomarkers for response, the number just to remind you that is at the highest dose; three out of the four patients had very profound responses. So, response predictors are not an issue, but you also pointed the question about therapeutic window, certainly we are seeing autoimmune-related side effects associated with these responses. And so, we are working hard now, we are actually -- we have accelerated enrollment in this program, we are trying to understand more of the relationship between the responders, and having these sorts of new side effects, I mean one very positive perspective is we don’t see these series autoimmune side effects in people who don’t see responses. So, it's the people who benefit, who do get the autoimmune side effects these have obviously coupled, it's because I think the drug is doing what we intent it to do. I think this is some of the most exciting data in the history of immunotherapy that you can take what people have historically called a "Cold tumor," that has almost no responses to immunotherapy or repeating one therapy, and get these incredibly high rate of very deep and so-called durable responses, and we will continue to work on improving the therapeutic window. In terms of the bispecific program more broadly, and I want to hearken back, Len sort of answered the previous question about CD20 and BCMA, but I do want to amplify on some of these comments, which is we think that there are indeed a very small number of bispecs in the CD20 space, and the BCMA space, which are actually looking quite competitive with each other, including ours, the emerging data suggests the efficacy and safety profiles of these agents will be competitive with each other, you will see our updated data, we will present it at ASH, but I think what's emerging is that these small numbers of competitors will exist in this field. I think that there is going to be room to these, there is actually a lot of patients in this late-stage settings who need treatment. So, I think that there is going to room for these small numbers of competitors there. But the future is going to be about moving into earlier lines of therapy, and there is going to therapies there about how one executes designs to those studies, the co-therapies, more standard co-therapies that are used there, and so there is going to be a lot of actually art to have one move these agents into the earlier lines of therapies, but the other very important thing is in addition to moving into earlier lines of therapy with these more standard combinations, where as I said, there is going to a lot of art to doing those studies, it's going to be of novel combos. And as we just talk about, with the CD20 and costim bispecifics that we're now showing that we are leading the field with, in prostate cancer we have very similar type agents now, that we are going to be combining with our CD20 bispecific in lymphoma and with our BCMA bispecific in myeloma, and we think that these are going to really have the opportunity to continue to change the game, and change the practice in medicine for these patients. So, it's about taking agents that R&D is going to be competitive and quite competitive with each other in these late stage settings, where I think they're all going to be making important contributions to the treatment in patients, but then moving in very artful ways to these earlier lines of therapy and using them there, where I think there is also going to be room, there is also going to be room for differentiation as well as the future, we are making these combos look all of these exciting opportunities we have in our portfolio can really take the utilization of these agents and the treatments of these patients, and these cancers to a whole another level, as we believe we are already showing that we are doing in prostate cancer.
Ryan Crowe: George, there was one question about biomarkers in prostate cancer, maybe you might just comment on how quickly you can use PSA you know, as studies after paper works is exposed to both agents?
George Yancopoulos: Right. And in some of the data we have already shown, and we will continue to show, many of our patients have remarkably high PSA levels, because they have very high burden of disease, as all know depending on the assay and the lab and so forth, normal PSA levels are in the low single-digits, you know, maybe one to four, consider the highest levels. We have patients who entered into our study with PSAs in the 100s, 500s, 600 and so forth. And we saw with this combination treatment, as soon as you put the combination on board essentially at the next time point that we measured within three weeks or so, we saw dramatic drops in the order of 99% reductions in the PSA. And these are really astounding results, and now where we continue to follow our patients over time we have seen that, for example, bone lesions have entirely normalized, and so forth. So, the effects are incredibly rapid as reflected in the PSA. And to the point about predicting which patients respond, it doesn’t matter whether you had patients who had relatively low burden as measured by PSA, where their PSA was measured in let's say, 40 to 50 range or whether you had incredibly high PSAs in 500 to 600 range, those patients seem to similarly respond in terms of very dramatic, very profound drops in the PSA within weeks of starting therapy. And as we continue to follow these patient's incredibly durable responses, first patient has now been out for more than a year. Their immune side effects have resolved, whereas their complete remission has remained completely intact, and as I said, not only completely normalized the PSA levels, but the bone lesions and so forth have all normalized at least as measured by bone scans and so forth. So, this really has the potential to be so game-changing for these late stage patients who really have at this point no other real recourse.
Ryan Crowe: Thank you, Len and George. I think we have time for one more question. Towanda?
Operator: Thank you. Please standby for our final question. Our final question comes from the line of Carter Gould that Barclays. Your line is open.
Carter Gould: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me, and taking the time. Maybe just come back to -- for Marion, how we should think about your expectations for timeline to receive a J Code for high dose EYLEA next year, you know, we have seen in the past pretty varied timelines here in terms of like AVEVO got their's trending around, Eli Lilly and Roche clearly had a more pace process, and I guess more to the point, should our expectation be that's more of like a January 1, 2024 type of event that's potential for J Code, maybe in the later part of '23? Thank you.
Marion McCourt: Carter, thank you for the question, and certainly we will stay very close on this. And obviously the importance of new BLA and new J Code is important. In terms of timing, I would need a crystal ball you know, certainly would share with you, we will be working very closely with the proper organizations and officials, but at this time it's too early to give anything definitive on expectation for J Code timing.
Leonard Schleifer: Yes. My own perspective on this and slightly different is that I'm not convinced in this particular setting that the J Code is the end of the all of -- like, you are going to see these dramatic changes in uptakes post J Code, so -- 
Carter Gould: Okay, thank you.
Ryan Crowe: I think that's all we have time for today. Thank you everyone for joining the call. As always, the Investor Relation team is standing by for any follow-up questions you may have. Have a great day, everyone.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-08-03 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Bella and I will be your operator for todayâs call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that todayâs conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Ryan Crowe, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.
Ryan Crowe: Thank you, Bella. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening to everyone listening around the globe. Thank you for your interest in Regeneron and welcome to our second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. An archive of this webcast will be available on our Investor Relations website shortly after the call ends. Joining me today are Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; Dr. George Yancopoulos, co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer; Marion McCourt, Executive Vice President and Head of Commercial; and Bob Landry, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A. I would also like to remind you that remarks made on this call today include forward-looking statements about Regeneron. Such statements may include but are not limited to those related to Regeneron and its products and businesses, financial forecasts and guidance, development programs and related anticipated milestones, collaborations, finances, regulatory matters, payor coverage and reimbursement issues, intellectual property, pending litigation, and other proceedings and competition. Each forward-looking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected in that statement. A more complete description of these and other materials risks can be found in Regeneronâs filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2022 which was filed with the SEC this morning. Regeneron does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. In addition, please note that GAAP and non-GAAP measures will be discussed in todayâs call. Information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP is available on our financial results press release, which can be accessed on our website. Once our call concludes, Bob Landry and the IR team will be available to answer any further questions. With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer. Len?
Leonard Schleifer: Thank you, Ryan and thank you to everyone joining todayâs call. Regeneron had a strong second quarter with notable execution across R&D, Commercial, and Business Development functions. Total revenues increased by 20% when excluding contributions from our COVID antibody cocktail. With net sales for EYLEA, Dupixent and Libtayo, each reaching new all-time quarterly highs and growing by double digits year-over-year on a constant currency basis. In addition to exceptional commercial execution, we made significant pipeline progress with three regulatory approvals, two accepted regulatory filings, and one positive Phase 3 readout. We also completed the acquisition of Checkmate Pharmaceuticals and the third quarter purchase of worldwide rights to Libtayo from Sanofi, both of which we believe will strengthen our oncology franchise in the near, medium and long-term. We also reported today preliminary, but promising anti-tumor activity and safety data for REGN5678 our PSMAxCD28 costimulatory bispecific in combination with Libtayo in patients with advanced metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. George will have more to say on this shortly. But we believe this represents an important step towards validating our costimulatory approach to fighting cancer and potentially advancing the science of immuno-oncology. Turning to our commercial performance. In the second quarter, EYLEA global net sales grew 13% at constant exchange rates to $2.5 billion. In the U.S. EYLEA net sales were $1.6 billion, up 14% year-over-year and outperforming anti-VEGF category growth of approximately 8%. Despite new competition EYLEAâs share was approximately half of the anti-VEGF category and 75% among branded agents, confirming its status as the gold standard anti-VEGF category. We believe aflibercept represents a significant potential growth opportunity going forward given favorable demographic trends as well as the potential for aflibercept 8 mg to augment the category and complement our retinal franchise. Regarding our investigational aflibercept 8 mg, the goal of our clinical program is to evaluate whether visual acuity among wet AMD and DME patients can be maintained or improved compared to EYLEA while extending the interval between doses. Equally important is maintaining the high bar for safety that has been set by EYLEA over the past 10 years, 55 million injections, worldwide and 8 million patient years of experience. We anticipate pivotal results in late quarter three or early quarter four and with supportive data, a BLA submission completed by early 2023. Dupixent continued to grow at a remarkable pace after five years and more than 450,000 patients treated since launch. In quarter two, global net product sales were $2.1 billion, an increase of 43% at constant exchange rates compared to last year, reflecting Dupixentâs differentiated clinical profile and ability to effectively treat more and more patients with the type two inflammatory diseases where Dupixent is approved. In the U.S. we saw growth across all indications, including initial contributions from atopic dermatitis in patients as young as six months to five years of age and from eosinophilic esophagitis, both of which are indications approved by the FDA during the second quarter and represent the first approved systemic treatment options for these patients. We hope to add a third first-in-class indication for Dupixent later this year in patients with prurigo nodularis, which is currently under Priority Review with the FDA. In Oncology, Libtayo net product sales grew 25% globally at a constant currency to $141 million in the second quarter of 2022, including 17% growth in the U.S., driven by non-melanoma skin cancer indications and monotherapy non-small cell lung cancer. We have long believed that the key to fully unlocking the opportunity in oncology is through differentiated combinations with Libtayo possibly serving as our foundation for many of them. That belief was the basis for our acquisition of the global rights to Libtayo. We plan to invest further in Libtayo based combinations, pairing it with promising candidates in our oncology pipeline, such as LAG-3 antibody fianlimab and our many investigational bispecifics, as well as with candidates from external collaborations. We continue to make progress with these Libtayo combinations and intend to share initial data in the second half of this year from our emerging oncology pipeline, which George will discuss in more detail. Regarding the FDA's review of our Libtayo chemo combo supplemental BLA for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, we are pleased with the progress that we have made as the FDA continues its review. However, we recently were informed that an FDA travel complication relating to scheduling a routine clinical trial site inspection in Eastern Europe will likely delay their decision until after our September 19 PDUFA date. While any delay is disappointing, a new site inspection date has been scheduled. Therefore, we do not expect a lengthy extension of the review period, and we do not expect it to meaningfully impact our launch plans assuming FDA approval. We continue to actively work with the FDA believing the ongoing review is otherwise progressing well and all other elements of the review remain on track. Regarding our COVID-19 response, Regeneron remains committed to combating the virus by developing additional novel antibodies. We continue to work with the FDA to establish a regulatory pathway for these antibodies, which could potentially serve an important role in protecting immunocompromised individuals who do not respond adequately to COVID-19 vaccines, as well as treating infected patients whom all antiviral therapy is not appropriate. In closing, as I reflect on our performance during the first half of the year, I am very proud of our numerous achievements, which were only made possible by the dedicated Regeneron employees around the world. Together we have continued to serve patients in need while strengthening the foundation of the company and leveraging our financial strength to better position Regeneron to achieve sustainable growth over time. We are excited about the increasing commercial momentum of our core products and the important progress we have made in advancing our pipeline. Our strategy continues to focus on investing in our internal R&D capabilities while exploring potential collaborations that will enable us to fully realize the power of our science. We remain confident in the strategy and in our growth prospects, as well as in our ability to deliver breakthroughs to patients and value to shareholders. Now, I'll turn the call over to George.
George Yancopoulos: Thanks Len. I will start with ophthalmology. We are looking forward to the upcoming Phase 3 readouts of aflibercept 8 mg in patients with diabetic macular edema and in wet age-related macular degeneration. PHOTON in patients with DME and PULSAR in patients with wet AMD will test whether patients treated with 8 mg dose every 12 weeks or every 16 weeks can achieve non-inferior best corrected visual acuity at week 48, compared to the currently approved EYLEA 2 mg dose every eight weeks. Unlike studies from other sponsors, in which patients were assigned to a dosing interval based on disease activity assessments following the loading phase, patients enrolled in the PHOTON and PULSAR studies were randomized at baseline into one of the three treatment groups, which we believe will allow us to determine whether extend dosing can truly be achieved. If the studies are positive and the high safety standard established with EYLEA is maintained, we believe aflibercept 8 mg would represent a significant clinical advance for patients. And we would target a U.S. regulatory filing by early 2023. Moving to Dupixent, which continued to deliver notable milestones in the second quarter of the year, Dupixent was recently improved in children with atopic dermatitis as young as six months old, making Dupixent the first and only biologic medicine approved to treat atopic dermatitis from infancy through adulthood. Marion will talk more about this as well as about our recent earlier than expected FDA approval for a brand new gastroenterology indication, eosinophilic esophagitis, or EOE. Since receiving approval in adults and in adolescent aged 12 and over, we have reported positive data in pediatric patients with EOE as young as 1 year of age. Our Phase 3 study in children 1 to 11 years of age met the primary endpoint with 68% of patients on the higher Dupixent dose and 58% on the lower Dupixent dose achieving histological disease remission compared to 3% of children on placebo at 16 weeks. EOE symptoms can be difficult to assess in these young patients. However, we also observed medical improvement in EOE symptom score. In an exploratory analysis we recorded 3.1% increase from baseline and body weight for age percentile for the higher dose group, compared to 0.3% of the placebo. These data will be discussed with regulatory authorities starting with the FDA later this year. Regarding approvals for new indications expected in the near future, for prurigo nodularis we received a PDUFA action date from the FDA of September 30. And the European Commission's decision expected in the first half of 2023. Also in the first half of next year, we are also looking forward to the readout of the first Dupixent study in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD. Moving on to Libtayo and oncology. As Len mentioned, we are excited to have acquired Sanofiâs stake in Libtayo, thereby gaining exclusive worldwide rights to a PD1 inhibitor review as foundational for our oncology franchise, which has the potential to be utilized in numerous combinations with other candidates in our pipeline, such as our costimulatory bispecifics, our C3 bispecifics and novel checkpoint inhibitors, such as fianlimab. Regarding such combinations, I'd like to provide a brief update on our first clinical data from our costimulatory pipeline involving REGN5678, a PSMAxCD28 costimulatory bispecific in combination with Libtayo. This combination is being studied in patients with advanced metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, who have previously progressed on multiple anti-antigen therapies. These patients unfortunately have a poor prognosis with approximately one to two years of life expectancy and with limited treatment options. Metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer is considered an immunologically cold tumor and is largely resistant to immune checkpoint inhibitor, with large trials of PD1 antibodies showing monotherapy response rates in the single digits. As just announced today by Merck, the challenge of metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer in terms of lack of efficacy for checkpoint inhibitors used in standard ways is emphasized by the failure of their large Phase 3 trial in earlier stage of this disease. Our costim program was designed to innovatively enhance responsiveness in these types of cold tumor classes, such as prostate cancer, and essentially turn these cold tumors into hot tumors. I will remind you of the extensive preclinical data we have published supporting this hypothesis. Since 2019 we have been in careful dose escalation for this prostate cancer program in close collaboration with the FDA. In our study, patients are dosed weekly with REGN5678 and every three weeks with Libtayo. However, first dose of Libtayo is not  until week-four, permitting a period of PSMAxCD28 leading to evaluate monotherapy safety and efficacy. Earlier today, we announced the first clinical data from 33 patients across eight dose levels, which showed dose dependent anti-tumor activity. The key efficacy endpoint in the study is objective response rate defined as a greater than 50% decline of prostate-specific antigen or PSA from baseline and/or tumor shrinkage. PSA is a protein produced by the prostate gland and by prostate tumors and this is commonly used as a biomarker to diagnose and follow up prostate cancer as many metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients have diseased limited to bone lesions and cannot be assessed by conventional resist criteria. Preliminary data from the ongoing dose escalation portion of the trial across eight dose level cohorts in a total of 33 patients showed dose dependent antitumor activity is assessed by PSA values at the five lowest dose levels, which are preclinical models predicted might be subtherapeutic. There was almost no evidence of any anti-tumor activity with only 1 in 17 patients showing a decrease in PSA. There were no greater than grade 3 -- greater or equal to grade 3 immune related adverse events or irAEs at these doses. The lack of anti-tumor activity among these patients was consistent with the approximate 6% response rate reported in other trials with anti-PD1 monotherapy. At the next three dose levels we began to see clear evidence of dose dependent anti-tumor activity, which was generally seen within six weeks of starting the combination. At dose level six, one of four patients experienced a 100% decrease in PSA and a complete response in target lesions based on resist criteria. The patient discontinued therapy due to a grade 3 immune-related adverse event of the skin that was considered to be a recurrence of a preexisting condition and has since resolved with treatment per investigator report. Despite termination of the treatment, he has maintained his 100% decrease in PSA and complete response in target lesions for approximately 10 months to date per investigator report. We continue to see anti-tumor activity at the next dose level or dose level seven. And in our eighth and most recent dose level, three out of four patients had dramatic and rapid PSA reductions, two with greater than 99% reductions and one with an 82% reduction. Of the two patients with greater than 99% PSA reductions, one experienced a grade 3 case of mucositis, which has resolved and the other experienced a grade 3 case of acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculopathy, which is ongoing. In terms of safety, very importantly, no grade 3 or higher irAEs were observed in patients without anti-tumor activity. And the occurrence of irAEs was correlated with anti-tumor activity. This is consistent with previous trials with anti PD1 immunotherapy, wherein irAEs have been reported to occur at a higher rate in responding patients. No grade 4 irAEs were greater than or equal to grade 2 cytokine release syndrome have been observed in the trial to date. There was one death that was considered unrelated to treatment. In this trial, irAEs are being treated according to standard management practices used for checkpoint inhibitors. We are planning on sharing more detailed data from this study at an upcoming medical meeting. Let remind you that through extensive preclinical research, we hypothesized that augmenting T-cell costimulation alongside PD inhibition could be a key to turning immunologically cold tumors hot. These preliminary data for a PSMAxCD28 costimulatory bispecific provides the first clinical evidence supporting the promise of our broader pipeline of coast inventory bispecifics in diverse solid tumors, as well as hemalogic malignancies. By combining these costimulatory bispecific  well with our CD3 bispecifics we have the opportunity to create novel therapeutic synergies to address some of the most difficult to treat cancers. We look forward to partnering with the oncology community on this ambitious and potentially groundbreaking efforts. In addition to these exciting early data, we anticipate several important oncology milestones in the second half of the year. At the upcoming ESMO Conference, we will provide updates on fianlimab, our LAG-3 antibody in combination with Libtayo in a Phase 2 cohort of metastatic melanoma that will hopefully confirm the encouraging combined efficacy that we previously reported in this setting. In addition, we will present initial data for  our MUC16xCD3 bispecific in metastatic ovarian cancer, where I'd like to remind you that we have also combination studies ongoing with both costimulatory bispecifics and Libtayo. We will also report initial data for a METxMET bispecific in advanced met-altered non-small cell lung cancer as well as for Libtayo monotherapy with neoadjuvant cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Moving on to our hematology pipeline. Odronextamab has the potential to be the first CD20xCD3 bispecific to be approved for both major types of advanced B-cell lymphoma, that is both follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Based on interim data from a cohort of patients dosed with our recently modified step-up regimen, we believe odronextamab may have the lowest rates of grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome for this class of bispecific in follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma while still maintaining the efficacy profile previously reported. We look forward to presenting these updated data and potentially submitting a BLA for both indications in the second half of this year, pending feedback from the FDA. We also plan to share updated data for a BCMAxCD3 bispecific study in relapse or refractory multiple myeloma by the end of the year. Pending regulatory feedback, we are planning to submit for regulatory approval in 2023. An umbrella study in multiple myeloma investigating BCMAxCD3 in combination with various standard of care products and investigational candidates is now open to enrollment while we plan to initiate an additional study in earlier lines of multiple myeloma later this year. As you can see, the pace of innovation in our oncology pipeline has been accelerating, building upon piles of foundation with data readouts for novel mechanisms for cancer indications that historically have not responded to immunotherapy. Concluding with our Regeneron genetics medicines, where we in collaboration continue to progress our pipeline and discovery engine. Our siRNA collaboration with Alnylam, a non-alcoholic steatohepatitis or NASH contains product candidates addressing various targets, including those discovered by the Regeneron Genetic Center. First data in NASH for ALN-HSD are anticipated this fall. We are progressing a second target, PNPLA3 into the clinic later this year and we have recently identified an additional novel promising target for NASH site B. as we just published in the New England Journal of Medicine, we found unprecedented association of very rare site B loss of function variants with lower risk of liver disease. In the largest association study examined protection from liver disease ever described, individuals with loss of function of side B variant has about 53% lower risk of developing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and about 54% lower risk of developing non-alcoholic cirrhosis. Regeneron and Alnylam are developing siRNA therapeutic candidate leads to advance to the clinic. And with that, I will turn the call over to Marion.
Marion McCourt: Thank you, George. Regeneronâs commercial business achieved another strong quarter demonstrating durable growth across our brands. We're building on the momentum of inline brands, including EYLEA, Dupixent, and Libtayo and also accelerating the potential across our portfolio from new and anticipated future launches. Let me start with EYLEA. Second quarter global net sales grew 13% year-over-year at constant currency to $2.5 billion. In the U.S. EYLEA net sales exceeded $1.6 billion, a 14% year-over-year increase driven by prescribing demand with strong demand continuing into the third quarter. EYLEA year-over-year growth significantly outpaced the category, gaining competitive share and further enhancing EYLEAâs position as the anti-VEGF agent of choice for retinal disease. We continue to see durable growth based on patient flow and new patient starts, ongoing demographic trends such as the aging population and prevalence of diabetes support anticipated mid-to-high single digit category growth for the foreseeable future. In diabetic eye disease, increasing diagnosis rates are also driving strong growth for EYLEA with more than $55 million injections worldwide since launch and well over 1 million injections in the U.S. alone in the second quarter of 2022. Physicians continue to recognize and prefer EYLEAâs differentiated efficacy and safety profile. We are confident in our ability to continue to build on our leadership over the long-term. Pending FDA approvals, there are potential incremental opportunities for EYLEA, including extending the dosing interval up to 16 weeks for diabetic retinopathy and treating preterm infants suffering from retinopathy of prematurity. In addition, aflibercept 8 investigational program has garnered significant enthusiasm from the retinal community and has the potential to significantly enhance the anti-VEGF treatment paradigm. Turning now to Libtayo, global net sales in the second quarter grew 25%, at constant currency to $141 million with U.S. net sales of $91 million. Libtayo continues to grow across all approved indications, including non-melanoma skin cancers, where Libtayo is the leading immunotherapy treatment. In monotherapy non-small cell lung cancer we are generating increased utilization across a broader number of prescribers. We are launch-ready for the potential chemotherapy combination approval, which will significantly expand the patient opportunity and physician choice for Libtayo in treating lung cancer. Regeneronâs full ownership of Libtayo presents many exciting opportunities across our current and future oncology portfolio. Key thought leaders recognize our growing commitment to oncology and have high interest in the potential for Libtayo combinations to meaningfully advance the standard of care in many cancer indications. We are taking a measured approach to expanding our global commercial footprint in key international markets to maximize the impact of our innovations to patients and Regeneron. These capabilities and infrastructure will support Libtayo in overtime future medicines. And now turning to Dupixent, in the second quarter global Dupixent net sales grew 43% year-over-year at constant currency to $2.1 billion. Dupixentâs performance was fueled by strong uptake across all indications with recent launches performing well across new diseases, age groups, and geographies. In the U.S. Dupixent net sales grew 38% to $1.58 billion. We continue to expand Dupixentâs leadership position as the first line systemic treatment in atopic dermatitis. There's robust demand for Dupixent across the spectrum of moderate and severe disease, as well as across age groups. With the recent approval in children as young as six months, Dupixent is the first and only biologic medicine approved to treat moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis from infancy through adulthood and the launch in our youngest patients is off to a very strong start based on initiations. We are also preparing for the potential approval next month in prurigo nodularis, a dermatologic condition where approximately 75,000 U.S. patients have no FDA approved medicines and are most in need. In asthma Dupixent is the number one biologic prescribed by both allergists and pulmonologists. We continue to see strong growth in new patient starts and total prescriptions, driven by Dupixentâs differentiated profile, unique mechanism of action, ease of prescribing broad label and demonstrated efficacy and safety. In nasal polyps, robust demand continues with Dupixent capturing the majority of market share and increased prescribing from ENTs. In eosinophilic esophagitis, our first gastroenterology indication, Dupixent is the only approved medicine for adults and children aged 12 and above. Early launch indicators have been favorable with encouraging adoption from both allergists and gastroenterologists. In addition, we are expanding our outreach to educate patients and caregivers about Dupixent as a new therapeutic option that provides meaningful symptom relief. Turning now to Dupixent and markets outside the U.S., in the second quarter, net sales grew 61% on a constant currency basis to $510 million, driven by robust growth across all indications. Regeneron continues to expand our presence in key international markets to bring Dupixent to patients. In summary, Dupixent is transforming the type 2 inflammatory disease landscape and has significant growth potential ahead driven by further penetration and existing indications, as well as from potential future indications. In conclusion, our commercial execution delivered solid results for the second quarter, bringing our life-changing medicines to even more patients. Our inline brands continue to perform well and new launches provide additional opportunities for sustainable long-term growth. Now I'll turn the call to Bob.
Robert Landry: Thank you, Marion. My comments today on Regeneronâs financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Regeneronâs outstanding performance continued in the second quarter as our core business maintained a strong growth trajectory, and we have leveraged our strong financial position to complete two business development oncology transactions. Excluding global revenues related to the COVID-19 antibody cocktail, second quarter total revenues increased 20% year-over-year to $2.9 billion demonstrating continued momentum across our business. Second quarter total diluted net income per share was $9.77 on net income of $1.1 billion. Beginning with collaboration revenue and starting with Bayer. Second quarter 2022 ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales were $870 million, up to 13% on a constant currency basis versus second quarter 2021. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $358 million of which $340 million related to our share of EYLEA net profits outside the U.S. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $678 million in the second quarter of 2022, improved 55% from the prior year driven by Dupixent. Finally, we recorded Roche collaboration revenue of $8 million related to Rocheâs sales of Ronapreve outside the U.S. We expect to record additional revenue from this collaboration in the fourth quarter of 2022. Moving now to our operating expenses. R&D increased 7% year-over-year to $690 million driven by higher head count in cost to support our expanding pipeline, partially offset by lower development costs for REGEN-COV. In the second quarter of 2022 acquired IPR&D was $197 million, which includes a previously disclosed $195 million charge related to our acquisition of Checkmate Pharmaceuticals. SG&A expense increased 14% year-over-year to $418 million, primarily due to costs related to growth initiatives for EYLEA and higher headcount to support our growing organization. Cost of goods sold decreased 73% year-over-year to $137 million primarily due to sales of REGEN-COV in the prior year that did not reoccur. Finally, the second quarter 2022 effective tax rate was 13.6% compared to 17% in the prior year. The lower rate is partially related to the non-recurrence of REGEN-COV sales. Shifting now to cash flow in the balance sheet. Year-to-date in 2022, Regeneron has generated $2.4 billion in free cash flow and ended the second quarter of 2022 with cash and marketable securities, less debt of $11.3 billion. We continue to deliver on our capital allocation priorities, completing our acquisition of Checkmate Pharmaceuticals, the first acquisition in Regeneronâs history and the purchase of Sanofiâs stake in Libtayo. In addition, we repurchased approximately $400 million of our shares in the second quarter of 2022, bringing our year-to-date total through July to over $1.1 billion. We continue to be opportunistic buyers where we see dislocation between our stock price and our intrinsic valuation. I will now discuss updates to our full year 2022 guidance driven by the closing of the Libtayo transaction. We are updating full year R&D expense guidance to be in the range of $3.1 billion to $3.24 billion, an increase of $170 million at the midpoint from our previous guidance. Approximately one third of the increase is driven by Regeneron now recording all R&D expense for Libtayo, which was previously shared with Sanofi. The remaining two thirds reflects the recording of our full 50% share of antibody collaboration spend as incurred beginning in the third quarter of 2022. Previously our share of antibody collaboration expenses was only partially expensed in the period incurred with the remaining share added to the antibody collaboration development balance. We were updating full year SG&A expense guidance to be in the range of $1.74 billion to $1.84 billion. The updated range reflects the inclusion of a 100% of Libtayo commercial expenses, which were previously shared with Sanofi net of anticipated synergies. We are also updating full year gross margin guidance to be in the range of 92% to 93%. The more favorable gross margin is due to the removal of the payment of Sanofiâs share of U.S. Libtayo gross margin that was previously recorded in this slide. A complete summary of our latest full year guidance is available in our press release issued earlier this morning. Let me conclude by highlighting four important financial modeling considerations related to the Libtayo transaction. First, effective July 1, Regeneron will record a 100% of the global Libtayo net product sales. We previously recorded only U.S. Libtayo net product sales. Second, the Libtayo off fund payment milestones and royalties will be recorded as an intangible asset on the balance sheet and amortized through cost of goods sold over the useful life of Libtayo. This amortization expense will be excluded from non-GAAP results. Third, as you may recall, we will now pay 20% of our share of antibody profits to reduce the antibody development balance instead of the previous 10% arrangement. The quarterly development balance repayment going forward will be reflected in our P&L as incremental antibody R&D expense I mentioned earlier when discussing revised R&D guidance with the remainder coming in the form of a reduction to antibody collaboration revenue. Therefore, the reduction in antibody collaboration revenue will be less than 20% of our share of antibody profits. As a result of the development balance repayment step-up, we expect to shorten the period to fully repay the development balance resulting in an earlier and very significant inflection in collaboration profits in the other years. Finally, in the third quarter of 2022, we will record a one-time development balance repayment per the Libtayo transaction agreement of approximately $55 million in addition to our regular quarterly repayments, which will be recorded as a deduction within the antibody collaboration revenue line. In conclusion, Regeneron is performing well and we continue to make investments in our business supported by our strong financial position to drive sustainable long-term growth. With that, I will pass the call back to Ryan.
Ryan Crowe: Thank you, Bob. Bella that concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call for Q&A. With several callers in the queue and to ensure we are able to address as many questions as possible, weâll answer one question from each caller before moving to the next. Bella please go ahead and poll for questions.
Operator:  And our first question comes from the line of Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Mohit Bansal: Yes, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter and data. Maybe a question on high dose EYLEA DME trial, especially with the loading dose sticking to that, so if we go back in the memory lane, it seems like the use of five loading doses only came along after the DRCR protocol, because I couldn't find anything which were -- in the history, which suggests that you should use five loading doses. Could you talk a little bit about that? And also, what is the realistic utility of fourth and fifth loading dose even for standard dose EYLEA, especially in the context of one year long trial? Thank you.
George Yancopoulos: Yes, those are really interesting questions and they get into the detail of very specific points of the regimen. Many of these, as you point out have not been directly studied in sort of head to head studies. So where we would have to maybe offline discuss some of these issues, but as I said, details that would require a lot of experimentation, maybe the answer.
Mohit Bansal: Thanks, George.
Ryan Crowe: Bella, can we go to the next question, please?
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital. Your line is now open.
Evan Seigerman: Hey guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. I'd love for you to expand on kind of some of the next steps for REGN5678. What do you want to see in additional cohort 8 patients and even at potentially higher dose cohorts to move into a registration directed trial? Thank you.
George Yancopoulos: Yes, no, thanks. We are obviously very excited about these data that have been, long been coming. As you all know we had to go through a very careful dose escalation starting with very low doses, but what we've now seen at the dose level 6, 7 and 8 has really been very exciting. I think that what we're going to be doing is we're going to be continuing to expand the number of patients at these dose levels. We're going to continue to evaluate the tumor activity as well as the safety and we hope that we're going to see that the responses remain profound and durable while the safety hopefully most of them will resolve and be managed well. And if we continue down that path, we will, as you say, also continue to explore other dose levels and so forth. But the level of tumor activity and balanced by the safety event that we're seeing on doses, are occurring now at levels where we think that they could be providing a new standard for benefit risk for this population. I think that it's important now to point out and remind everybody, I mean, I said it, but just to say it again, the IRAs  were only seen in the patients who had profound anti-tumor activity. That is the patients who didn't benefit did not really indicate in terms of higher level IRAs  to have significant safety concern. And that is of course, what you want to see, that the patients who have the benefit that the safety is limited to those, youâre not doing harm to the patients that do not benefit. Okay, I guess we're ready for next question.
Ryan Crowe: Thanks, George. Bella, next question please?
Operator:
Tyler:
Ryan Crowe: You must be on mute. We don't hear a question, but maybe we could take the opportunity to amplify even a little further and repeat what George said about this, the safety and one thing, hello?
Tyler Van Buren: Can, can you hear me? Sorry. It cut out.
Ryan Crowe: Yes, yes, Tyler.
Tyler Van Buren: Good morning. Thanks very much for taking the question. I wanted to ask about PULSAR and PHOTON, just a follow up. Can you elaborate on the decision to randomize patients to the 12-week and 16-week arms prior to assessing their response for loading doses? Since patients can only be rescued during that first year or moved down in dosing interval and not moved up to a less frequent regimen, even though they might be doing well. Doesn't this make the comparison to the  term studies difficult, and given this, how do you expect to communicate the data to the physicians when we see it?
George Yancopoulos: Well, we have to, we were somewhat confused by the whole of the business data and it's meaning it's intense because of the confusing study design. We are basically only after you see how well patients are doing you then shift them. So if you take your best patients and you shift them, for example, to a Q 12 or Q 16 regimen, and you say, oh, X percent of patients can send this regimen, you are not really understanding how good your drug is and what percent of the patients can actually achieve that dosing regimen. We know, and we've already published on this, that patients who do well can be dramatically extended. We're trying to answer a very different question, which we think is going to be very, very important to the community, which is whether you can truly achieve extended dosing. And whether you can prospectively put people into these dosing regimens and get substantial numbers of them to stay at these dosing regimens, because we're giving the higher dose of EYLEA, which we believe has this ability to maintain more patients at these longer intervals. So we really believe that this would represent a significant clinical advance and would also clarify how to use these drugs as opposed to the prior somewhat confusing approaches.
Ryan Crowe: Thanks, George.
Tyler Van Buren: Okay, that's helpful. And just a brief follow up, in year two is it going to be able to beâ¦
Ryan Crowe: We have to move to the next one. I'm sorry, Tyler. Bella, can we go to the next question?
Leonard Schleifer: We'll deal with that privately Tyler, sorry.
Operator: Sure. And your next question comes from the line of Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Salveen Richter: Good morning. Thank you for taking our question. This is Andrea on for Salveen. Can you walk us through how to think about implications from the potential Medicare negotiation provision to high dose EYLEA, given that there is no distinct IP there, but there will be a biosimilar for the regular dose by mid-24? Thanks so much.
Leonard Schleifer: Yes, it's a complicated -- it's a complicated question that until we see the final language in the statute, how it's interpreted and how it's actually implemented as to whether and how we file for the high dose, whether or not there'll be separate considerations for high dose versus the standard dose EYLEA. If there are -- if it turns out that there are, if it turns out that there are separate, we get a separate BLA, obviously you get, I can't remember what the statute says now, 11 or 12 years before this comes into play. And based on our current understanding of the bill, we believe that a new BLA would constitute a new biologic product. And therefore the 8 mg would not be subject to price negotiations in years. But we have to see what the final bill looks like and how it's interpreted. So we we're as anxious to see some of that as you are so being, so we will keep you informed about thinking as the bill is finalized and starting to be interpreted.
Ryan Crowe: Thanks, Len. Bella, next question please?
Operator: Yes. Your next question comes through the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Matthew Harrison: Great, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could comment maybe a bit more broadly on costims and how the impact of today's data makes you think about investment in additional tumor types or broader investment across costims and other combinations? Thanks very much.
George Yancopoulos: That's a great question. I think you bring up a great point. And I think those of us who have been in this field now, weâre of course so excited by the early promise of immunotherapy checkpoint inhibitors and particularly PD1 antibodies. But of course over the years it's been recognized that only a small percentage of tumors, even in responding, even in the most responsive cancers, not all the patients respond and for many tumor classes, as we just saw with Merck's announcement of their failure today, in many classes, there's almost no detectable activity. So the Holy Grail in the field that people have been looking for is an answer to the question of, how do you activate immunotherapy in all these cold tumors, which is unfortunately the vast majority of cancers, both solid tumors and hemalogic malignancies. And so we went down this path based on the science that we could add the second signal, signal 2 to the first signal that could activate T cells. And these preliminary data suggest that that hypothesis might be right, and that we are on the way to this Holy Grail, that this is we believe very early data. We have a long way to go, but it's a spectacular indication that we have done where we are in the midst of doing and on the path of doing exactly what we set out to do, which is to turn immunotherapy cold tumors into hot tumors with dramatic anti-tumor activity. And the implications here based on all the pre-clinical data suggest that this is going to be broadly applicable. And as you all know, we have been developing a very broad costimulatory pipeline across many, many tumor classes, and several of them are already in the clinic, I mentioned. We have the prostate data. We have ongoing studies with the costim for ovarian cancer. We have other costims that are in the clinic for -- and we have other costims that are going to be entering into the clinic over the next short period of time. These are going to cover all sorts of cancers from the lung cancers that don't respond to hemalogic malignancies and so forth and so on. So we really think that this could be groundbreaking and taking immunotherapy now to the next level where all of us in the field were hoping it was going to go with the early advances with checkpoint inhibitors and have been frustrated over obviously the last decade or so that we haven't been able to get there. This may be the way to get there for the field. We have a very broad pipeline of costimulatory bispecific. By the way, we believe this validates the concept of the combinations, not only with Libtayo, and the PD1 class, but also with our CD3 class of bispecifics, because it suggests that the preclinical data which is so strongly supported now with this clinical data might also be very predictive for that class. So, a lot of exciting possibilities across very broad areas, diverse  hemalogic malignancies. This is, I think, could represent the next breakthrough for immunotherapy.
Leonard Schleifer: Yes. And Matthew itâs Len. Maybe just add to, or what George said in terms of the investment side, we're prepared and we're able to make the investment across many different areas that George is talking about. And having under one roof, all the reagents owning all of Libtayo, having the variety of costims, having a variety of the CD3 three bispecifics and having all that knowledge, we think and the ability to invest puts us in a really terrific position. It is early going. We have to work through the safety. But to me, it's sort of reminiscent of once you started to see the excitement around the CAR T-cells, and the CAR T-cells actually provide a pretty good lesson in that they give very high levels of activity, response rates, 75% in some tumors or higher. And when you get those very high response rates, you also got very high levels of these immune reactions. You had -- and you look at the labels, you'll see 25% grade 3 neurologic adverse events and a whole bunch of other, not to mention all the cytokine release syndromes. So I think that these -- this is sort of an equivalent stage. We have got this tiger by the tail I really believe and George has described it well. And the amazing thing that should be echoed is that the preclinical data was extremely valuable. So Regeneron is not a company that just has all these molecules that we've acquired from others. These are all homegrown molecules, home tested, home validated, et cetera. There's a whole collection. We couldn't be more excited. I could keep going on, but maybe I'm getting waved off. We should take the next question.
George Yancopoulos: No, I just want to add and build on what Len has said. So I think just like he said, in some ways, the CAR Ts in terms of high efficacy, particularly in hematologic malignancies, because that's where it's seen high efficacy seeing along with the AEs and in some of the responding patients, that's a good analogy. But I do have to point out the many differences. These are off the shelf reagents. Okay? Which God forbid, if there is a safety issue can be stopped. And it's much easier as we're already demonstrating to create a whole pipeline across a whole variety of broad cancers and unlike the Car T world right now, anyway, these are dramatic effects in solid tumors which were never really seen before by any other modality. So this is actually pretty exciting. There are analogies, there are in terms of dramatic efficacy, but also very important differences here that establish this as a potential breakthrough new class.
Ryan Crowe: Okay. Thank you, George and Len. Next question, please, Bella.
Operator: Sure. Your next question comes from the line of Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Tim Anderson: Thank you. A question on the REGN5678 data, you report out one CR but no other response rate data using recess criteria. So I'm wondering if there's anything else you can say about tumor shrinkage beyond that one CR in those upper three cohorts? And then to clarify, you mentioned a host of grade 3 AEs in the press release and some of those to me don't seem like the classic immune related AEs. So are you, Iâm hoping you can clarify which of those you consider to be IRAEs, maybe you consider all of them to be? Thank you.
George Yancopoulos: I think we've given a lot of the details and we're going be giving a lot more details obviously in upcoming meetings. Suffice it to say that as I mentioned for most of these patients, actually many of these patients, they don't have lesions outside of the bone, which is why we use PSA as as the indicator of total disease activity, because you don't have that many lesions. Okay? So that's one point where we're focusing on the PSA. We do believe that many of the IRAEs are the sort of IRAEs that you do see with both PD1 therapy and as Len mentioned also with CAR T therapy. And I think we indicate every single great 3 that we had and indicated that actually even though these are very early data in the treatment most of these patients many of these are actually already resolving or resolved. And we're going to continue to follow these patients and look for hopefully as seen, remember a total of six that one patient, the reason we highlighted then is they were the first responding patients, so we've now had almost a year follow up and we have this very impressive durability of response there. The other cohorts are much more recently treated and that's why weâre not giving that much follow up because these are patients who are in the very early months of being treated. But obviously you hear it, you hear it in our voices probably, those of us who have commented, we think this rule has the potential to be game changing, game changing for the field of immunotherapy and taking immunotherapy to the next level, also game changing for our oncology program and for our company.
Ryan Crowe: Thank you. Bella, next question, please? I think we have time for two more.
Operator: All right. Your next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.
Chris Raymond: Hey thanks. Maybe back to EYLEA and the high dose format for a second. So our checks have indicated a pretty good chunk of the bio patients are actually EYLEA patients, and specifically EYLEA patients who are on a higher frequency dose regimen. I guess maybe a two part question here. First maybe talk about the plan to sort of mitigate this, you know, either before the high dose format or even after? And I guess is the plan with the high dose one would expect that switching paradigm for the high dose EYLEA would be easier than  is that sort of part of the plan? And then the second part is our checks also indicate surprisingly low awareness of this high dose format among docs. Are these signals at odds with what you're seeing or is that correct? And outside of, you know, actually just having the data presentedâ¦
George Yancopoulos: Marion is going to answer the question. By the way we don't market products before they are approved. So it's not surprising that there is not awareness of a product that's an investigational product. Marion can comment on the other stuff.
Marion McCourt: Sure. Let me take a start on some of the situations in market and perhaps George will add to that. But first let me comment that obviously we presented today very strong results on the growth of EYLEAâs standard of care in the marketplace, both in the U.S. and the worldwide information. You know, today in the branded category, U.S. anti-VEGF category, we have 75% of the branded market. We are approaching 50% of the overall market. So truly EYLEA is the standard of care. You know, it, it's probably best that fianlimab organization comment on where their product is being used, I'll comment anecdotally that early days, the response has been fairly muted, fairly low grade use in concentrated accounts rather than market wide. As for the future, weâre very excited and optimistic that the aflibercept 8 mg will represent a new standard of care with true durability of dosing and the same type of efficacy and safety that we see with EYLEA. So we're really excited. And certainly our clinical organization has put together trial designs that truly test the durability of the product, and then we'll allow the commercial organization to determine what the best strategy is for launch if and when we get FDA approval.
George Yancopoulos: All right, let me just add to that, that it's important to point out that the reason why EYLEA has become the leading anti-VEGF agent, branded VEGF agent is because it allows most of the EYLEA patients to go on longer interval dosing and have, and be very satisfied with the response. Now, of course, as with any disease and situation, not every patient is going do perfectly well. And we know that there is a small percentage of patients who do need more frequent EYLEA. And, and of course, if one has a new untested agent that doctors haven't seen, their hope in the place that they would first try in a small percentage of patients who don't -- who are not doing well. And of course, that's why it's being used in that setting. Now our goal, of course, with the high dose of EYLEA is to take now the best-in-class agent and hopefully produce even better results in terms of allowing these small percentage of patients who are being dosed more frequently, or even the patients who are now on eight-week regimens or 12-week regimens to go to more extended regimen. And that's the whole point of the design in the study. So I don't think there's any surprises that it's the small percentage of very hard to treat patients where somebody would try an untested agent that they're hoping might work better, but we have a real logical rational way that we are now taking EYLEA, bringing forth this high dose formulation and hope to extend the benefits that we're already seeing with this tried and true in terms of both safety and efficacy reagent, and even expand it and get even for these small percentage of patients longer dosing and even extend maybe everybody else.
Ryan Crowe: Okay. Thanks, George. Oh, last question please?
Operator: Sure. And your last question comes from the line of Carter Gould with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Carter Gould: Hi sorry. Thanks, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Thanks for squeezing us in. I guess, now that you fully own sort of Libtayo, can you update us on kind of where you stand on a subcutaneous formulation given what we've seen data from some of your competitors there and the importance of that the kind of key pace? And I guess, looking down the road then can you talk about the feasibility of potentially co-formulating Libtayo with one of these bispecifics, excuse me, costimulatories and if that's even feasibly possible recognizing it's or either way? Thank you.
George Yancopoulos: You can imagine we're working on the subq. We'll give you some details I think down the road later this year. In terms of co-formulation and we have a strong view that if you're doing it for gamesmanship or patent work and all that kind of stuff, you know that's one thing, but we, what we're more focused on is getting the optimal dose and the optimal regimen and they are not likely to be the same in many of these settings. Itâs only useful if you're going try to have a single regimen that covers both. So, but we're a long way from worrying about that. We're far more focused on the fact that we've turned cold to hot which is a big deal at least in our eyes. And obviously it hasn't escaped yours, or I'm sure anybody's attention that now with this just appreciated new data where it looks like we're on the way of turning cold tumors to hot in combination with Libtayo we are in retrospect, very happy that we now have taken on sole ownership of Libtayo.
Ryan Crowe: Thanks Len and George. I think that thatâs all we have time for today. Bella, could you please conclude the call?
Operator: Thank you. This concludes todayâs conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-05-04 08:30:00) =====

With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer. Len?
Leonard Schleifer: Thank you Ryan. Welcome to your first earnings call. I hope all of us stakeholders will join me in giving you a warm welcome to the Regeneron team. Thanks for everyone joining the call as well. Following an exceptional 2021, Regeneron is off to a strong start in 2022. Our first quarter results were driven by execution across the entire company as we continued to realize the benefits of our sustained investment in differentiated research and development along with our focus on commercial performance. We also continued to drive shareholder value through proven capital allocation, including approximately $350 million of share repurchases in the first three months of this year. Regarding our financial performance, we delivered strong double-digit revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share growth. Excluding revenue contributions from our investigation of COVID antibody cocktails, revenues grew 25%, reflecting our increasingly diversified core business which continues to thrive. For EYLEA, global net sales grew 11% to nearly $2.4 billion in the first quarter, including $1.5 billion of revenues in the United States, up 13% versus last year which outpaced the U.S. anti-VEGF category. In yet another milestone for EYLEA after more than 10 years, we recently surpassed 50 million EYLEA injections globally, a testament to its well-established efficacy and safety profile. We believe EYLEA continues to represent a significant long term growth opportunity primarily driven by an aging population, increasing utilization among the rapidly growing diabetic population, as well as the potential for our investigational aflibercept 8 milligrams to complement and enhance our retinal franchise.  For Dupixent in quarter one, global revenues for the quarter exceeded $1.8 billion, an increase of 43% to last year as we continued to redefine the treatment of Type 2 inflammatory diseases. A significant opportunity remains to reach even more patients in already approved indications and we look forward to potentially launching Dupixent in seven new indications in the U.S. later this year and in early 2023, including pediatric atopic dermatitis, eosinophilic esophagitis, and prurigo nodularis. Collectively, approximately 200,000 U.S. patients are suffering from these three indications today but currently have no FDA-approved systemic treatment options. In oncology, Libtayo continues to capture significant share in FDA-approved non-melanoma skin cancer indications, where it is considered the standard of care. Beyond dermato-oncology, we’re beginning to generate momentum in monotherapy non-small cell lung cancer in the United States, helping to build a foundation for potential launch of Libtayo post-chemotherapy later this year, which would allow Libtayo to address a much larger population of non-small cell lung cancer patients.  As we have said before, we continue to consider Libtayo to be foundation to our immune-oncology development strategy and expect it to serve as the backbone for our investigation of clinical programs in combination with various antibodies, bispecifics and co-stimulatory bispecifics in our pipeline, as well as other pipeline candidates including those from our collaborations.  In April, we announced our agreement to acquire Checkmate Pharmaceuticals, Regeneron’s first-ever acquisition of a company. Upon closing we expect Checkmate’s differentiated toll receptor 9 agonist, vidutolimod will add a promising new modality to Regeneron’s pipeline of potential approaches for difficult to treat cancers.  Looking ahead, we remain on track for the second half of this year to share data in difficult to treat solid tumors, such as ovarian and prostate cancers, to submit a BLA for Odronextamab, our potentially best-in-class CD20xCD3 bispecific for refractory B-cell lymphomas, and to advance Regeneron 5458, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific.  Finally regarding our ongoing COVID-19 response, Regeneron remains committed to combating the virus as we head toward the likely endemic stage. We firmly believe that monoclonal antibodies will continue to play an important role, particularly to protect immunocompromised individuals who do not respond adequately to COVID-19 vaccines as well as to treat infected patients for whom an oral antiviral therapy is not well tolerated or might trigger serious drug-drug interactions. We are progressing next-generation antibodies that are designed to be active against multiple variants, including those of omicron lineage, and initiated a first in human study last month concurrently as the FDA continues their review of our REGEN-COV BLA for COVID-19 treatment and prophylaxis. We’re working closely and collaboratively with them and other global regulatory authorities to establish clinical and regulatory pathways to bring additional safe and effective monoclonal treatment options to patients as quickly as possible. In closing, we are excited about the strong commercial momentum for our inline portfolio and the progress we have made advancing our pipeline so far this year. For the remainder of 2022, we anticipate up to eight additional U.S. and EU regulatory approvals, up to four additional U.S. or EU regulatory filings, pivotal data for aflibercept 8 milligrams, as well as various other data read-outs from other pipeline programs, which George will discuss.  We remain confident in the long term outlook for our business and our pipeline continues to be highly productive, and we are in a strong financial position, all of which positions Regeneron to deliver sustainable growth and long term value creation.  Now I will turn the call over to George.
George Yancopoulos: Thank you Len. I will start with ophthalmology today.  At the recent Angiogenesis meeting, we presented encouraging results for the Phase II CANDELA study of aflibercept 8 milligrams in patients with wet AMD  primary safety end points with no new safety signals observed through week 44 and efficacy end points numerically favored aflibercept 8 milligrams in visual acuity, drying, and other anatomical measures through week 44. Phase III studies, PHOTON in DME and PULSAR in wet AMD are ongoing. The primary objective of the Phase III studies is to determine whether aflibercept 8 milligram dosing can allow for more extended dosing intervals while maintaining efficacy and safety.  Regarding Phase III design in both PHOTON and the PULSAR study, patients are randomized at baseline to three groups: an every 8 week EYLEA 2 milligram arm, an every 12 week 8 milligram aflibercept arm, and an every 16 week aflibercept 8 milligram arm following loading doses. The primary end point of both these studies is mean change in best corrected visual acuity, or BCVA at week 48. The primary end point will be met if 8 milligram aflibercept is not inferior to 2 milligram EYLEA while being dosed less frequently. We anticipate results of both PHOTON and PULSAR in the second half of this year and if positive, to file for regulatory approvals in the U.S. and EU by early 2023. Moving to Dupixent, which had a remarkable quarter in terms of clinical updates and regulatory progress, in January we announced our second positive Phase III study in prurigo nodularis, a disease with high unmet need. At the AAAAI and AAD meetings this year, we presented detailed data from the first positive Phase III study in prurigo nodularis and we also presented detailed data from our positive Phase III studies in eosinophilic esophagitis and in chronic spontaneous urticaria, or CSU, in biologic naïve patients. The second Phase III CSU study in patients refractory to omalizumab did not reach statistical significance in an interim analysis, and as announced in March, we have completed enrollment in the first of the two Phase III Dupixent studies in COPD and anticipate data from this first study to read out in the first half of next year. In terms of regulatory progress, we expect an FDA decision for Dupixent in children aged six months to five years with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis by the new June 9 PDUFA date. We are also excited about an upcoming trial in collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or the NIAID, to assess efficacy and safety of Dupixent for asthma in underserved populations, including Black and Hispanic children in the United States. Additionally, we are expecting an FDA decision for our supplementary BLA in eosinophilic esophagitis in patients 12 years and older by August 3, and we completed our regulatory submission for prurigo nodularis indication with FDA acceptance of this application anticipated shortly. Moving to Libtayo and oncology, we are excited about the upcoming milestones in our oncology pipeline, including the FDA decision on our Libtayo chemo combination application for non-small cell lung cancer, data readouts and potential regulatory filings for our hematology bispecifics, as well as initial data readouts from our bispecific antibodies for solid tumors. In hematology, Odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific has the potential for best-in-class efficacy in both follicular and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and was recently granted fast track designation from the FDA for these indications. Detailed results of our first in human study were recently published in Lancet Hematology and our registration in 10 programs in late stage follicular lymphoma and DLBCL are expected to complete enrollment soon. Based on the safety profile we are observing from our updated step-up dosing regimen, we believe Odronextamab has the potential to be administered entirely within the outpatient setting. We look forward to filing with this updated data set later this year, pending regulatory feedback from the FDA. Development of REGN5458, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific investigated for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, remains on track and pending regulatory feedback, we are planning to submit regulatory approval in the first half of 2023. Studies in earlier lines of the disease as well as an umbrella study in multiple myeloma investigating 5458 in combination with various standard of care products and investigational candidates will begin enrollment shortly.  The second half of the year, we anticipate initial clinical data disclosures for three first-in-class bispecifics: our MUC16xCD3 monotherapy for late stage ovarian cancer, our METxMET bispecific antibody for met-altered non-small cell lung cancer, as well as our PSMAxCD28 costim bispecific in combination with Libtayo in late stage prostate cancer. For these late stage cancers, patients have limited options, and showing any durable response would be a promising early sign to be confirmed with additional clinical studies also involving combinations.  We continue to progress our strategic approach to oncology which starts with Libtayo as our foundational anti-PD1 therapy and is augmented by logical combinations utilizing our broad oncology pipeline, whether it involves combining Libtayo with a second checkpoint inhibitor, as we are doing with our LAG-3 antibody in melanoma and other settings, with different combinations of bispecifics or with other agents in our portfolio. Briefly turning to our antibodies against COVID-19, as we recently announced, the FDA extended its review of our REGEN-COV BLA for COVID-19 treatment and prophylaxis with a new action date of July 13. This extension was due to ongoing discussions with additional data provided to the FDA on pre-exposure prophylaxis use of REGEN-COV. As this regulatory process continues, we are advancing next-generation COVID-19 antibodies and initiated a first in human trial with a new candidate in April. We continue to believe that a major unmet need for COVID antibodies is in chronic disease prevention for immunocompromised patients and future development efforts will be addressing this population. Concluding with our Regeneron genetics medicine, where we in collaboration are continuing to advance our pipeline. For our siRNA collaboration with Alnylam, we are very excited about our first-in-class approach to combining siRNA with antibody therapeutics designed to maximize effect as well as duration of target blockade. The first of these is our C5 siRNA antibody combination, cemdisiran plus pozelimab. Phase III studies of the combination treatment for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, or PNH, and myasthenia gravis are underway and we’ll be dosing patients shortly. In PNH, we are planning to test our combo in both naïve and switch patients tested against standard of care therapies, including ravulizumab and eculizumab. Beyond C5, several additional combination programs are in our pre-clinical pipeline. We continue to work with Alnylam as leaders in the use of siRNA therapeutics to address non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, with several programs addressing novel targets discovered by the Regeneron Genetic Center. First data in NASH patients for ALN-HSD are anticipated mid-2022. We are progressing a second target, PNPLA3 into the clinic later this year and have recently identified an additional novel promising target that has been validated by RGC and is awaiting peer review publication.  We are also pleased to report a novel milestone, that we and Alnylam initiated our first CNS target siRNA clinical program targeting amyloid precursor protein, or APP, in development for both cerebral amyloid angiopathy and Alzheimer’s disease. Showing that this siRNA approach can reduce levels of the target protein in the CNS has the potential to open the door for using this approach in multiple genetically defined neurodegenerative diseases.  In the first quarter, we and Intellia provided an update on our joint CRISPR-based knockout program for transthyretin amyloidosis. Just to remind you, this is the first example of achieving CRISPR-based genomic editing in human beings. Our recent update demonstrated greater than 90% reduction of transthyretin durably achieved for the follow-up observation period in patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, as well as acceptable safety observed so far. Our genetics medicine portfolio now includes a diverse pipeline of siRNA candidates that we are working on with Alnylam targeting diseases of the liver, the brain and the eye, as well as our CRISPR-based approaches in collaboration with Intellia and our bio-targeted gene delivery programs, such as with Decibel addressing congenital forms of hearing loss and other internal programs. While still early, we think these groundbreaking approaches have the potential to change the practice of medicine. With that, I will turn the call over to Marion.
Marion McCourt: Thank you George. Our commercial performance in the first quarter reflects strong execution and the competitive strength of our diversified and growing portfolio. Starting with EYLEA, first quarter global net sales grew 11% year-over-year to nearly $2.4 billion. Over the same period, U.S. net product sales grew 13% to $1.52 billion as EYLEA continues to strengthen its leadership position. Across approved indications, EYLEA is the preferred anti-VEGF treatment based on its differentiated efficacy and safety profile, as well as extensive real world patient and physician experience. As Len mentioned we are incredibly proud that EYLEA helped improve or save the vision of patients around the world with more than 50 million treatments since launch. Category growth and EYLEA market share continued to increase across all approved indications. In diabetic eye disease, we have seen notable increases across the patient continuum from initial patient diagnosis through to receiving ongoing EYLEA treatment. We believe diabetic eye disease will remain an important source of future growth for EYLEA as, unfortunately, most patients remain under-diagnosed and under-treated. Beyond EYLEA, our investigational aflibercept 8 milligram clinical program continues to generate excitement and a high level of interest within the retinal community. If supported by Phase III results, aflibercept 8 milligram has the potential to be a major enhancement to the anti-VEGF treatment paradigm. In summary, we are confident in Regeneron’s ability to maintain leadership over the long term based on our current EYLEA performance and future potential of aflibercept 8 milligram.  Turning now to Libtayo, with first quarter global net sales of $125 million, in the U.S. net sales were $79 million based on steadily improving demand across FDA-approved non-melanoma skin cancer indications. The number of prescribers has increased in our non-small cell lung cancer monotherapy indication based on growing brand awareness, positive prescriber feedback, and an increasing number of institutions and networks that have included Libtayo in protocols and pathways. We are working to build on this momentum ahead of the potential chemotherapy combination approval expected later this year that would dramatically expand the patient opportunity for Libtayo in lung cancer. Finally onto Dupixent, which again achieved remarkable growth for the quarter, demonstrated by a 43% increase in global net sales to over $1.8 billion. Our performance was fueled by robust uptake across all approved indications as well as an expanding geographic footprint and potential future indications, including use in younger patients. Dupixent is a transformational medicine for patients and prescribers with significant growth potential ahead. In the U.S., net product sales grew 38% to $1.3 billion. In atopic dermatitis, Dupixent is the first line systemic treatment in patients with moderate to severe disease. Healthcare specialists recognize Dupixent’s differentiated profile, which includes dual anti-IL4 and IL13 mechanism of action compelling efficacy, rapid symptom relief, and well established safety profile. More than 430,000 patients worldwide are currently on treatment across all indications and launch preparations are underway for the June potential label expansion for children as young as six months of age with atopic dermatitis. We estimate approximately 75,000 biologic eligible children in the U.S. could benefit from Dupixent in this younger age group. We also look forward to potentially extending Dupixent’s label to include additional dermatology conditions, including prurigo nodularis where patients have no currently FDA-approved medicines. Approximately 75,000 U.S. patients with PN are in need of new treatment options and may benefit from Dupixent. In the highly competitive biologic asthma indication, Dupixent continues to grow based on its compelling differentiation for healthcare professionals based on its unique dual mechanism action, ease of administration, demonstrated safety, broad label, and use in both steroid-dependent patients and pediatric patients. There are positive prescribing trends from the recently pediatric asthma launch. In nasal polyps, Dupixent remains the preferred choice for both ENTs and allergists with rapid growth even three years after initial launch. Many patients with Type 2 or allergic disease suffer from another concomitant Type 2 disease. For example, in our atopic dermatitis clinical program, 40% of patients also had asthma. Dupixent is differentiated not only by its efficacy and safety profile in individual FDA-approved Type 2 indications but also its potential to simultaneously address multiple Type 2 diseases in the same patient. We look forward to expanding Dupixent into even more Type 2 diseases. Launch preparations are underway for eosinophilic esophagitis, where there are no FDA-approved medicines and significant unmet need. Importantly in our EOE clinical program, approximately 45% of patients also had atopic dermatitis or asthma. If approved in EOE, we estimate at least 50,000 patients in the U.S. could benefit from Dupixent in this indication. Key opinion leaders continue to provide positive feedback on our clinical data, especially given the lack of effective approved treatment alternatives for their patients who suffer from multiple EOE symptoms. Turning briefly now to Dupixent in markets outside the U.S., in the first quarter net product sales grew 61% to $485 million. Over the past year, Regeneron has expanded our commercial presence in several key markets outside the United States, and we are encouraged with progress so far integrating our sales efforts with Sanofi. In summary, we see significant potential for Dupixent to continue to change the lives of patients and their families, and we will continue to advance initiatives that bring Dupixent to those in need.  In conclusion, we are pleased with performance across our portfolio. We continue to advance our inline brands and are on track to deliver on future launches, positioning Regeneron for sustained and long term growth. Now I’ll turn the call over to Bob.
Robert Landry: Thank you Marion. My comments today on Regeneron’s financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Regeneron is off to a strong start in 2022 with double-digit top and bottom line growth in the first quarter, driven by execution across the business. First quarter total revenues grew 17% year-over-year to $2.97 billion. Excluding global revenues related to the COVID-19 antibody cocktail, total revenues grew 25%, demonstrating continued strength of our core business. First quarter total diluted net income per share grew 16% to $11.49 on net income of $1.3 billion.  Beginning with collaboration revenue and starting with Bayer, first quarter 2022 ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales were $869 million, growing 7% on a reported basis and 13% on a constant currency basis versus first quarter 2021. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $385 million, of which we recorded $338 million for our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S.  Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $631 million in the first quarter of 2022 and grew 73% from the prior year, driven by Dupixent. In this quarter, we recognized the $50 million sales milestone upon achieving $2 billion of aggregate ex-U.S. sales for antibody collaboration products on a rolling 12-month basis.  Finally, we recorded Roche collaboration revenue of $216 million related to Roche’s sales of Ronapreve outside the U.S. We do expect additional revenue from this collaboration primarily in the second half of 2022. Regarding REGEN-COV in the U.S., consistent with our commentary from earlier this year, we did not record any U.S. sales for REGEN-COV in the first quarter of 2022. Absent the execution and fulfillment of an additional government contract, we do not expect to record any U.S. sales for REGEN-COV this year. Other revenue in the first quarter of 2022 was $94 million. This includes a $30 million upfront payment from our collaborator, Ultragenyx to market Evkeeza outside of the U.S.  Moving now to our operating expenses, R&D increased 12% to $751 million driven by higher headcount and clinical manufacturing costs, including for next-gen COVID antibodies, partially offset by lower clinical trial costs for REGEN-COV. Starting in the first quarter of 2022, we are changing the presentation of our non-GAAP results to include in-process R&D acquired in connection with asset acquisitions, as well as upfront and opt-in payments related to license and collaboration agreements. Going forward, we will now include these charges in both GAAP and non-GAAP results as a new line item called Acquired In Process Research and Development. In the first quarter of 2022, acquired IPR&D was $28 million, which includes a $20 million opt-in payment to our collaborator, Adicet. In full year 2021, there were $44 million of aggregate upfront payments excluded from non-GAAP R&D expense, all of which were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021.  SG&A expense increased 10% year-over-year to $389 million, primarily due to costs related to growth initiatives for EYLEA and higher headcount to support our expanding organization. COCM increased 58% year-over-year to $198 million due to higher sales in Dupixent and an increase in shipments of commercial supplies of Praluent for Sanofi outside the United States. Finally, the first quarter 2022 effective tax rate was 11.6% compared to 10.5% in the prior year. Shifting now to cash flow and the balance sheet, in the first quarter of 2022, Regeneron generated $2 billion in free cash flow, inclusive of collections from the U.S. Government for sales of REGEN-COV recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021 and ended the first quarter of 2022 with cash and marketable securities less debt of $11.4 billion.  We continue to deliver on our capital allocation priorities. Last month, we announced the agreement to acquire Checkmate Pharmaceuticals for total equity value of approximately $250 million. Earlier this week, we launched the tender offer for Checkmate shares and expect this deal to close in mid-2022 subject to receipt of regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. In addition, we repurchased $352 million of our shares in the first quarter of 2022. We continue to be opportunistic buyers where we see dislocation between our stock price and our intrinsic valuation.  I will conclude with select updates to our full year 2022 guidance and outlook. We are updating full year R&D guidance to be in the range of $2.9 billion to $3.1 billion. The increase in guidance is driven by clinical manufacturing costs for next-gen COVID antibodies, most of which were recorded in the first quarter, and advancing programs across our pipeline. We also now expect our full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 12% to 14%. A complete summary of our latest full year guidance is available in our press release issued earlier this morning. In conclusion, our core business is performing well and we continue to make investments in our R&D engine supported by our strong financial position, leaving Regeneron well positioned for sustainable long term growth. With that, I will pass the call back to Ryan.
Ryan Crowe: Thank you Bob.  Gigi, that concludes our prepared remarks. We’d now like to open the call for Q&A.  With more than 20 callers in the queue and to ensure we are able to address as many questions as possible, we will answer only one question from each caller before moving to the next. Gigi, please go ahead.
Operator:  Our first question comes from the line of Chris Raymond from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.
Chris Raymond: Hey, thanks for taking the question. Just a question maybe for Marion, if I can, on EYLEA and the competitive set. I know you guys have said feedback from the market on Vabysmo has been somewhat muted, but it’s actually kind of striking how different Roche is viewing the reception of the drug. They highlight a lot of enthusiasm from docs and I know there’s a lot of talk about what will happen after a permanent J-code. I know you guy have a lot of levers to pull here, not least of which is launching the high dose format of EYLEA, but can you talk a little bit about the rebates, how they are playing into your counterstrategy in the maybe near to intermediate term, and how we should be thinking about net pricing going forward? Thanks
Marion McCourt: Chris, happy to give you some characterization of the market. First let me comment on EYLEA. As we reported today, our performance certainly with EYLEA in a very competitive marketplace is quite strong across indications, and certainly we see very strong performance not only in capturing more than our fair share of the market growth but also competitive share gains across indications. As a reminder, in the overall market we have about 50% of the VEGF category market share with EYLEA and in the branded marketplace over 75% of the branded market share.  I really do think it’s probably best to let Roche comment on uptake of their new product in the marketplace. I’ll share that prescribers and key opinion leaders comment to us on the importance of the demonstrated safety they see with EYLEA, the efficacious profile that we have, and certainly the extensive consideration across indications and in-market use that has been incredibly robust.  As it relates to other items around pricing and things of that sort, generally we don’t comment; but I certainly will say that looking ahead, we see strong leadership with EYLEA and a profile that is certainly leading the category in terms of experience, uptake and use.
Ryan Crowe: Thank you. Next question, Gigi.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JP Morgan. Your line is now open.
Cory Kasimov: Great, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. To follow up on EYLEA, I wanted to ask about the high dose formulation. Assuming the results read out as you anticipate, how do you think about this product potentially slotting into the treatment landscape? Is it possible this could broadly take over from your current dose, or would you expect it to be primarily used in certain segments of the market? Thank you.
Marion McCourt: I think at this point, we’ll want to wait and look at product profile as the clinical data matures and then certainly as we move into launch preparation planning, we’ll be considerable of how the profile matches up against patient need and opportunity, so I think more to come on specifics on uptake. We remain optimistic, but of course we need to wait and see how the clinical data matures and the profile of product is clarified.
Ryan Crowe: Thank you. Gigi, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Siegerman from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Evan Siegerman: Hi guys, thank you so much for taking the question. I’d love if you could expand on some of the rationale behind acquiring or proposing to acquire Checkmate Pharmaceuticals. Anything in the data that was particularly notable when you were doing your diligence that piqued your interest, and do you expect to go forward combining their asset with Libtayo versus, say, nivolumab or pembro as they had on their prior trials? Thank you.
Leonard Schleifer: I’m sure--it’s Len here. I’m sure George would love to expand upon the thinking, but unfortunately because we just launched a tender offer, we’re really not committed to have that discussion. We’ll look forward to that discussion assuming that the deal closes around the middle of the year, as we anticipate.
Evan Siegerman: Fair enough, Len. Fair enough. 
Leonard Schleifer: Sorry.
Evan Siegerman: No, it’s all right.
Leonard Schleifer: But because we couldn’t answer that question, if you get back in the queue, we’ll come back to you for another question.
Evan Siegerman: Fair enough.
Ryan Crowe: Thanks Evan. Gigi, next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Salveen Richter: Good morning, thanks for taking my question. On these initial bispecific data sets in solid tumors in the second half, could you just speak to what exactly we’re going to see initially and then what you would want to see from the data set in terms of being clinically meaningful?
George Yancopoulos: Well, as I indicated in my remarks, basically we’re going into late stage patients heavily pretreated. We’re hoping to actually be able to report on seeing objective responses, and the number and the duration of the responses is what we’re looking for. We would love to be able to see significant numbers of durable responses showing that each one of these novel agents is really making a difference in the latest stage patients. That of course would open up for each one of them, we think, very important opportunities in terms of both those late stage settings but also particularly with logical combinations going back to earlier and earlier stage patients. Each one of them could become then a significant program, not only in monotherapy but in combination with logical other agents.  So as I said, responses with duration is what we’re looking for in all three of those programs. 
Leonard Schleifer: Just to amplify a little bit, to make sure nobody missed what George just said, is that it seems to be the case that with these types of reagents, much as it is the case with other anti-cancer agents, that while you start in the latest, most difficult patients, there is better activity in earlier lines with these kinds of immune reagents, so finding activity in the late heavily treated would be very encouraging. 
Ryan Crowe: Thanks Len and George. Gigi, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Brian Abrahams: Good morning, congrats on all the progress, and thanks so much for taking my question. Could you elaborate a little bit more on the safety benefit that you’re seeing for Odronextamab stepped up dosing, and I guess what it means in terms of differentiating versus other bispecifics in development and ultimately CAR T, and then your confidence that you’ll retain similarly strong efficacy with this dose? Thanks.
George Yancopoulos: Yes, we actually had initiated the concept for bispecifics in general as we were very early players in the field of this concept of step-up dosing, and what seems to be confirmed by our own data and other people’s data is that when you give them initially at low doses and gradually step up to your optimal dose, you are reducing the incidence of severe side effects, and particularly cytokine release syndrome.  We had actually pretty low rates with our original, so our original dosing regimen was also a step-up dosing regimen, but in collaboration with the FDA, we redefined the stepped up dosing and came up with an even more gradual program. It only extends the timing to get to maximum dose by one week and we’re still obviously getting to that same dose, and what we’re saying is that from the early read from the new step-up dosing, which presumably we’ll give you the detailed data at some point in the future, the results are looking very promising. The already low rate of significant cytokine release syndrome that we were seeing looks like it’s depressed even further down to rates where we think, as I stated, we will be able to use this regimen and this approach in the outpatient setting.  It’s just very promising that we’ve come up with a safe, what looks like to be a safe protocol that could be used in outpatient settings, and it’s getting to the same maximum dose in a pretty short period of time as well.
Ryan Crowe: Thanks George. Gigi, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carter Gould from Barclays Capital. Your line is now open.
Carter Gould: Great, good morning. One from me - I want to understand, I guess, how you’re thinking about your broader CV effort. We’ve heard from a number of larger pharma and biotech companies rededicating themselves to CV recently, and when you map out the indications and products, I’d argue you have one of the broader pipelines across CV but you don’t really get much credit for it and Praluent and Evkeeza remain relatively small contributors to your sales. Do you see this being a major commercially relevant area for Regeneron going forward? I’d just like to understand your ambitions here a little bit better. Thank you.
Leonard Schleifer: We have not obviously realized what we think is the full potential of our CV expertise and capabilities, and we are exploring ways on how to do that, some of which may require us to rethink combinations of both types of reagents and targets, and hopefully you’ll hear more that. But we would agree - right now, it’s not a major contributor to our near term performance.
Ryan Crowe: Okay, thank you. Gigi, next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Skorney from Baird. Your line is now open.
Luke Hermann : Hi, this is Luke Hermann on for Brian Skorney. Could you talk a little bit more about 5458, maybe your confidence that the currently enrolling Phase II study will support a filing, any timeline granularity, and the combinations you’re particularly excited about there? Thanks.
George Yancopoulos: Yes, well in small numbers, we have very competitive response rates with deep responses and duration that we think for these late stage patients should be able to support registration if we can replicate it in the larger Phase II registrational possible study that we are undertaking. We continue to see a very acceptable safety and tolerability profile, and as you said, this is just the first step in the whole program. We are very excited about combinations and we’re also very excited about moving to earlier lines of therapy. In terms of combinations, as we’ve talked about before, it’s very logical and the preclinical data are very compelling. The combinations with so-called costimulatory bispecifics that also bind to a target on the same myeloma cells but now activate what we and others refer to as single two, will be very exciting and has really the potential to enhance responsiveness and deepen responsiveness and deepen duration.  We have a series of additional next-generation candidates as well that we could layer on top of that next series of logical combinations which involve these costimulatory molecules, and we’re also thinking that obviously, as Len already mentioned, going to earlier lines of therapy is only going to increase the responsiveness and the opportunities to get longer and longer responses and, dare I say, even potentially cures, so that’s the basic summary of our programs - get registration in the late setting by replicating the data that we’ve seen with our ongoing registration possible Phase II study, adding combinations to enhance responses, deepen responsiveness and duration, and three, going into earlier lines of therapy as well.
Ryan Crowe: Thanks George. Gigi, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brittany A. Woods from Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.
Brittany Woods: Good morning everyone, this is Brittany on for Tyler. Congrats on another strong quarter and thanks for taking our question. A multi-part question a bit related on the REGEN-COV cocktail. For the ongoing studies of the next-gen candidates, when do you expect that you’ll be able to file for approval and what will the regulatory path forward look like; and also, if we continue to be in a relatively low case period as we enter the endemic phase, what could a pivotal trial ultimately look like there?
George Yancopoulos: These are all really great questions, and we are continuing to discuss our regulatory path both for getting our hopefully full approval for our existing cocktail, but also the regulatory path going forward for next-generation cocktails with the FDA. That’s an ongoing discussion that has potential to change, and obviously associated studies to support that program have the potential to change, so we are not at this point talking about the details of either, but great questions.
Leonard Schleifer: Suffice it to say the complexities are increased when you have to start thinking about supply as well, so as George said, we’re in discussions with the agency about what it would take to get an authorization, but you’re always chasing the next variant and we have probably, what we think is the greatest end-to-end capabilities in this space as is out there. But still, knowing which variant to manufacture for which antibody and how to keep chasing that, it’s a fairly complex situation, but we’re committed to try and make monoclonals an important part of the solution, and I think they can be, but it is going to require some artful science, so to speak.
Ryan Crowe: Thank you. Gigi, next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dane Leone from Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Dane Leone: Hi, thank you for taking the questions, and congratulations on all the progress across all of your programs. One question from me on the PHOTON and PULSAR outcomes. It’s been interesting to hear your narrative over many years now through EYLEA, and your team’s generally been right in terms of next-generation efforts that have failed to displace EYLEA as the standard of care. To that point, I’m a little interested from your commentary on the CANDELA readout and how that impacts your interpretation of PHOTON and PULSAR, meaning what does your team really think ends up being a differentiated outcome for those patients that are able to treat and extend on the high dose out to Q 16-week, and does that have to be a comparison to what read out with  studies to make it a compelling drug option or a higher dose option in the market to complement EYLEA? The context for this, I guess, I’d put in is you guys have generally contended that a lot of these studies comparing against per label EYLEA are not actually fair studies to be running -  obviously used an extra loading dose, but in the real world the treatment extended EYLEA versus any of these other agents is actually quite equivalent, so I’d be just interested to hear how you think that the contextualization of these high dose aflibercept studies really inform who should get the higher dose, if and when it becomes available. Thank you very much.
Leonard Schleifer: You know, that’s going to be obviously a choice for clinicians to decide once they’ve seen all the data, but I think an important consideration is still going to be not only the duration, because duration does matter; efficacy - efficacy matters, but safety, and I think the distinct advantage we have with high dose EYLEA is that from a molecular point of view, whether you’re having immunologic reactions and those sorts of things, EYLEA is a very well known entity. If we can transition to a higher dose with the same kind of safety and allow for longer duration, I think that is a more attractive paradigm than switching to a new molecular mechanism of action with unproven safety with 50 million injections behind it. Frankly, I do think even the FDA views the--when you’re changing dosing paradigms of the same molecule is different than when you’re bringing in a new molecule.  We can’t say, and we wouldn’t dare speak for what clinicians will do once they see the data, but we do feel strongly that having the same EYLEA backbone, if we get the safety that we anticipate thus far from the small CANDELA study and we get the kind of extension of duration, perhaps with more drying, we’ll look at the actual numbers, I think that sort of transition is more efficient than transitions that may occur with new reagents.
Ryan Crowe: Thank you Len. Gigi, I think we have time for two more questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charlie Yang from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Charlie Yang: Thanks for taking the question. This is Charlie Yang on for Matthew. I just want to follow up on the REGEN5458 BCMA bispecific. I guess my question here is given the competitor is ahead in potentially getting approval later this year, and they are already testing in combination with darsivax , for example, I’m just curious about your confidence on the 5458 in terms of its outlook, and maybe you could just provide some thoughts on the competitive landscape and the commercial opportunity across different line settings. Thank you.
George Yancopoulos: Yes, we think being marginally ahead or behind here isn’t really going to mean all that much. It’s how good your actual agent is, and also of course what opportunities you have for combinations. As we said, if we can reproduce the efficacy we’ve seen in our initial studies, in our potentially pivotal Phase II program, that will make it a very, very competitive agent in terms of efficacy, and that’s what obviously really matters.  But also in terms of combinations, we do believe that we have some of the most interesting and potentially game changing combinations with novel agents, such as these costimulatory bispecifics that are a whole different opportunity than combinations with traditional, more traditional agents. We can take the efficacy that hopefully we will see with the monotherapy, both in the late stage settings but just as, if not more importantly, in the earlier stage settings and really extend and take it to another level, so being a little bit ahead or behind here is not going to be as important as producing really good data.  Combinations, we think it’s really whether you can really come up and you have in your portfolio very interesting, logical combinations that can really be game changing, and we think that we have those opportunities, which is why we’re so excited about this program.
Ryan Crowe: Great, thanks George. Gigi, last question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Mohit Bansal: Great, thank you for squeezing me in. Maybe a question on EYLEA, high dose EYLEA. George, would love to get your take on the design of the DME trial. It seems like there are five monthly doses in the 2 milligram arm, just like label, but only three for the 8 milligram arm. Could you please walk us through the rationale behind this difference, and wouldn’t this put high dose EYLEA at a disadvantage? Thank you.
George Yancopoulos: Yes, well certainly the whole goal of the high dose EYLEA is to deliver the same efficacy and safety, as Len said, and safety being very important, but with a reduced injection schedule. Obviously it is, as you said, more challenging to be accomplishing the results in PHOTON with less loading injections than for the 2 milligram EYLEA, but that is the goal with the high dose aflibercept. It is challenging, but it is the higher dose, that’s what the goal is, and I guess the data will speak.
Leonard Schleifer: Yes, and I think we can eliminate if we get too high of a loading dose, obviously, it might complicate some of the efficacy readouts; but as George said, I think based on what we know when we designed it, this looks like it could--we’re optimistic.
Ryan Crowe: All right, thank you. I think we’re done. Thanks Mohit. Gigi, can we conclude the call?
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-02-04 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Michelle, and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mark Hudson, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.
Mark Hudson: Thank you, Michelle. Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening to everyone listening around the globe. Thank you for your interest in Regeneron, and welcome to the fourth quarter 2021 conference call. An archive of this webcast will be available on our website. Joining me on the call today are Dr. Len Schleifer, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; Dr. George Yancopoulos, Co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer; Marion McCourt, Executive Vice President and Head of Commercial; and Bob Landry, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks, we will open up the call for Q&A. I'd also like to remind you that remarks today may on today's call include forward-looking statements about Regeneron. Such statements may include, but are not limited to those related to Regeneron and its products and business, financial forecasts and guidance, development programs and related anticipated milestone, collaborations, finances, regulatory matters, payer coverage and reimbursement issues, intellectual property, pending litigation and other proceedings and competition. Each forward-looking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected in that statement. A more complete description of these and other material risks can be found in Regeneron's filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2021, which we are planning to file with the SEC early next week. Regeneron does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. In addition, please note that GAAP and non-GAAP measures will be discussed in today's call. Information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP is available in our financial results press release, which can be accessed on our website. Once our call concludes, Bob Landry and the IR team will be available to answer further questions. With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.
Dr. Len Schleifer: Thanks, Mark, and thanks to everyone joining today's call. The fourth quarter of 2021 capped off a terrific year for Regeneron. Our performance was driven by strong execution across the organization, despite the ongoing challenges posed by COVID-19. We're all proud of the incredible work and dedication of our employees who continuously deliver on our mission to bring important medicines and novel medical breakthroughs to patients in need. Throughout 2021, we delivered strong top and bottom line growth. Revenues, excluding our COVID antibody cocktail, grew 19%, a testament of our diversified and strengthening core business. Our innovative and world-class pipeline advanced across a wide variety of diseases. We also unveiled initial clinical data and pipeline advancements from our Regeneron Genetics medicines portfolio, which has the potential to unlock significant long-term value. Additionally, we returned substantial cash to shareholders in the form of share buybacks. In '21, we spent approximately $1.7 billion repurchasing over 3 million shares. For EYLEA, 2021 global sales grew 19% to $9.4 billion. Even after 10 years on the market and millions of injections later, we continue to view EYLEA as an enduring product, with significant future opportunity, despite new market entries. In the second half of the year, we look forward to the results from our Phase III aflibercept 8-milligram high-dose program. If those data continue to support that aflibercept 8 milligrams provides extended dosing duration without compromising on safety and efficacy, aflibercept 8 milligrams has the potential to complement and enhance our retinal franchise. With Dupixent, we are delivering on a goal of transforming the treatment of type 2 inflammatory diseases. 2021 global sales of Dupixent were $6.2 billion, representing 53% growth for the year. Looking ahead, Dupixent's outlook is bright. There are significant opportunities to increase market penetration rates in approved indications, and we are in the midst of a wave of new data submissions and launches in potential new indications, further fueling Dupixent's growth. In oncology, Libtayo continues to thrive in the approved non-melanoma skin cancers. We look forward to potential Libtayo plus chemotherapy approval later this year in the broader population of non-small cell lung cancer patients. Our oncology footprint continues to expand. We have advanced many candidates and combinations into the clinic with a range of antibodies, bispecifics and co-stimulatory bispecifics across many cancer settings. This year, we look forward to sharing what we hope will be groundbreaking data in difficult-to-treat solid tumors, such as prostate cancers and ovarian cancers, both of which are conditions with historically low response rates to immunotherapy. We also remain encouraged in the progress of our maturing CD3 bispecifics. We are confident in the overall safety and efficacy profile for odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific. We are forging ahead with REGN5458, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific, which we believe will play an active role in the treatment of multiple myeloma given its competitive profile. Last but not least, we are immensely proud of our rapid response efforts against COVID-19. In 2021, REGEN-COV, our antibody cocktail, was administered to millions of people globally, making a major impact during the darkest days of the pandemic. Based on preclinical data, we recently announced that REGEN-COV is highly unlikely to be active against the Omicron variant. Appropriately, the FDA amended the emergency use authorization for REGEN-COV, limiting its use in the U.S. in light of the Omicron variant being dominant. Regeneron remains committed to helping fight the COVID-19 pandemic. We are progressing next-generation antibodies that are active against Omicron, Delta and other variants of concern. We are scaling up manufacturing efforts and completing the necessary requirements to begin clinical trials for next-generation candidate in the coming months. Concurrently, we are working closely and collaboratively with the FDA and other global regulatory authorities to establish and define clinical pathways to bring additional safe and effective monoclonal antibody treatment options to patients as quickly as possible. As one of the leaders in the fight against COVID-19, our VelociSuite platform of technologies makes us uniquely positioned to promptly develop and deliver potentially life-saving medicines. As the COVID-19 story transforms from pandemic to endemic, we believe there will remain a significant opportunity to use our next-generation monoclonals as a prevention for those immunocompromised individuals who do not respond adequately to COVID-19 vaccines. In addition, monoclonal antibody therapy is likely to play an ongoing role in treatment for infected individuals. In conclusion, 2021 was another high-performance year for Regeneron. With strong commercial results from our in-line marketed products, 30-plus pipeline candidates progressing through clinical trials, our discovery efforts firing on all cylinders, a growing portfolio of highly productive external collaborations and our strong financial position with over $12 billion in cash and marketable securities, Regeneron is extremely well positioned for the future. Now I will turn the call over to George.
Dr. George Yancopoulos: Thanks, Len. I'll start by briefly addressing our novel monoclonal antibodies for COVID-19. As Len mentioned, we are rapidly developing next-generation antibodies that retain potency against Omicron and other variants of concern. Early in 2019, we anticipated that the virus would mutate and, thus, began generating large pools of virus-neutralizing antibody candidates from both human survivors and our VelocImmune mice. We have continually evaluated and refreshed this pool and now have next-generation candidates that, based on preclinical studies, effectively neutralize Omicron and other variants of concern. We're on track to initiate clinical trials with the first of these in the coming months. In addition, we are in discussions with the FDA regarding how to streamline the development program for monoclonal antibodies, considering the unwavering unmet need and demand for these medicines, especially with potential future virus variants in mind. As Len already highlighted, since we believe that monoclonal antibodies will continue to play an especially important role in the treatment of future protection of the several million immunocompromised people in the United States alone, we are committed to undertaking a development pathway that will make this possible in the near future. Moving on to ophthalmology. At the upcoming Angiogenesis meeting, we will present the final Phase II data from the aflibercept 8-milligram CANDELA study in patients with wet AMD. In this study, aflibercept 8 milligram, given at the same protocol-specified dosing schedule, as currently approved EYLEA 2-milligram met its primary safety endpoint, with measures of drawing numerically favoring the 8-milligram dose over the 2-milligram dose. These two -- these Phase II results give us more confidence that the upcoming Phase III readouts has a potential to show that the higher 8-milligram aflibercept dose can at least match the efficacy and safety of EYLEA, but with more convenient dosing. Moving on to Dupixent. Building on the outstanding clinical success Dupixent has shown so far across a wide spectrum of allergic or type 2 inflammatory diseases, the second Phase III study in prurigo nodularis recently met primary and key secondary endpoints, making Dupixent the first and only systemic medicine to demonstrate such success in this indication. These data confirm the results from the first Phase III trial, where 60% of Dupixent patients met the primary endpoint of its reduction compared to 18% of placebo patients at 24 weeks. Nearly 3x many Dupixent patients experienced reduced skin lesions compared to placebo as well. Prurigo nodularis marks the sixth disease for which Dupixent has demonstrated profound benefit for patients, providing convincing evidence that the IL-4 and IL-13 pathways inhibited by Dupixent are the key drivers of the type 2 inflammation underlying all of these diseases. We have to appreciate how remarkable the Dupixent story is in terms of the important benefit it provides for the many patients across this diverse set of clinical conditions, together with its well-established safety profile, and highlights how Dupixent is delivering on its promise of providing a pipeline in a product. At the upcoming AAAAI meeting, in addition to the other important Dupixent updates, we will present pivotal results for the recent top line studies in eosinophilic esophagitis, or EOE, and for the first chronic spontaneous urticaria, or CSU study. EOE is a complex disease, and we are excited to share these data with the scientific community and patients. Our first regulatory submission for EOE in adolescents and adults is underway, with regulatory submissions for prurigo nodularis also starting in the first half of this year. Anticipated flow of Dupixent-related clinical data update continues. We are planning on reporting results in an additional Phase III study in CSU this time in omalizumab experienced patients and also for the chronic cold-induced urticaria indication in the second half of this year. These represents more difficult-to-treat patients or condition and present a higher bar for Dupixent. We're looking forward to results of these pivotal studies. Moving on to oncology and first Libtayo. Progress in our oncology portfolio includes pivotal readouts and regulatory filings for Libtayo presented an anticipated data readouts for our bispecifics as well as multiple upcoming milestones with novel diversified pipeline entrants. As Len mentioned, the Libtayo chemotherapy combination for patients with non-small cell lung cancer is under review at the FDA with a PDUFA date of September 19, 2022, which could address a larger portion of the patients with lung cancer. In hematology, at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting, we presented encouraging data for REGN5458, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific, investigated for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, with safety data that has shown no grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome to date and strong efficacy data. We believe our investigational agent is promising and has the potential to be competitive in this indication. We are planning on investigating this product for earlier lines of myeloma therapy, in combination with standard of care, and are excited about the combination with an appropriate co-stimulatory bispecific, which could further enhance responses. Odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific, has the potential for a best-in-class efficacy profile in both follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and our updated step-up dosing protocol may mitigate safety concerns and decrease the need for hospitalizations to manage cytokine release syndrome. In terms of progress of our bispecifics for solid tumors, as previously disclosed, we are observing early signs of activity for our MUC16xCD3 bispecific monotherapy developed for late-stage ovarian cancer, and we are excited to be sharing these early data later this year. In addition to monotherapy, the MUC16xCD3 bispecific is being investigated in combination with Libtayo and in a first of its kind in a combination trial with a MUC16xCD28 bispecific. These combinations are in early stages that are advancing through dose escalations. Later this year, we are hoping to share initial results for a unique biparatopic METXMET antibody studied in advanced non-small cell cancer patients with MET protein alterations. Early signs of clinical activity we have observed so far with the naked METXMET bispecific antibody, especially in patients with MET overexpression, bode well for our follow-on agents, the METXMET bispecific antibody drug conjugate, which is now enrolling patients in a Phase I study. We are also excited about our early-stage EGFRxCD28 co-stimulatory bispecific program for lung and other cancers. For prostate cancer, we are expecting initial readouts from our first co-stimulatory bispecific PSMAxCD28 later this year as well. PSMAxCD28 is progressing through dose escalation in combination with Libtayo. We are excited about the potential of our broad oncology portfolio, which includes multiple Phase I, II and III assets, as many are beginning to believe the future is going to involve the right combination of targeted immunotherapy agents. Concluding with our Regeneron Genetic medicines efforts, we and our collaborators have made significant strides in expanding the capabilities and scale of our groundbreaking work in genetics medicines. In terms of our siRNA collaboration with Alnylam, ALN-HSD is progressing through healthy volunteers, and initial data in NASH patients are anticipated by the middle of this year. With the C5 siRNA and the antibody combination, another first of its kind, healthy volunteer data were presented at ASH, demonstrating PK and PD results supportive of the monthly subcutaneous dosing regimen selected for pivotal studies. Phase III studies of the combination for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, or PNH, were also initiated. Recall, in PNH, we are planning to test our combination in both naive and switch patients tested against standard of care therapies, including ravulizumab and eculizumab. Also Alnylam has recently announced submission of the CTA application for ALN-APP, the industry's first-ever investigational RNAi therapeutic for CNS diseases. This agent will be evaluated in both the relatively rare disease driven by amyloid precursor protein, known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy, or CAA, as well as in early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Finally, later this quarter, we and Intellia will provide our -- an update on our joint TTR CRISPR-based knockout program for transthyretin amyloidosis. This will include additional ascending dose interim clinical data from the polyneuropathy arm of the ongoing Intellia 2001 Phase I study. We have also expanded the study to include patients with transthyretin amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy, which we believe will address an even broader patient population. We are very excited by our large and diverse pipeline of siRNA candidates that we are advancing with Alnylam, ranging from targeting the liver, the brain and the eye, as well as our CRISPR-based approaches in collaboration with Intellia and our viral-targeted gene delivery programs, such as with Decibel. While still early, we think these groundbreaking approaches have the potential to change the practice of medicine. And with that, I will turn the call over to Marion.
Marion McCourt: Thank you, George. Our fourth quarter business performance demonstrated the strength and resilience of our in-line brands and creates a foundation for commercial success as we prepare for future launches. Starting with EYLEA. We recently announced fourth quarter U.S. net sales of $1.55 billion and $5.79 billion in 2021. This represented 17% year-over-year U.S. growth for the full year, which is noteworthy for a brand 10 years post launch. EYLEA reached record share across all approved indications and is the recognized leader in a category that continues to grow due to favorable demographic trends. EYLEA remains physicians' top choice for patients with indicated retinal diseases due to its demonstrated efficacy, safety, dosing flexibility and unsurpassed real-world experience, with more than 40 million administered injections worldwide. We are also excited about ongoing strategic initiatives that position our retinal franchise for future growth, such as our educational efforts in place across existing indications where many patients don't receive the treatment they need. Beyond EYLEA, we are encouraged by promising early results for high-dose aflibercept 8 milligram, which, if supported by Phase III clinical results, potentially represents next-generation treatment for a range of eye diseases. Turning to Libtayo, where global net sales in the fourth quarter were $121 million, in the U.S., net sales reached $81 million. In advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, which currently drives majority of performance, Libtayo is the #1 systemic treatment, and we saw steady growth as the market continued its post-COVID recovery. In advanced basal cell carcinoma, Libtayo is also rapidly being established as standard of care in patients who have progressed or are inappropriate for hedgehog inhibitors, building on our strength in non-melanoma skin cancers. In advanced non-small cell lung cancer, we are making progress in the launch of our monotherapy indication with a steadily growing prescriber base. There is also significant opportunity in the chemotherapy combination setting. And if proved, Libtayo would be available for a much broader range of first-line lung cancer patients than for monotherapy alone. Our experience is that medical oncologists consider combination treatment first and reserve monotherapy for a much smaller group of patients, which, in part, has limited Libtayo uptake in lung cancer to date. Briefly turning to our cardiovascular franchise. Evkeeza, our treatment for patients with HoFH, was successfully launched in 2021 and is already the standard of care. We continue to see initiations in both switch and category naive patients. In 2021, we are focused on employing innovative efforts to identify patients not currently diagnosed with HoFH. On to Dupixent, which grew 51% in global net sales in the fourth quarter year-over-year to $1.77 billion, in the U.S., net sales grew 46% to $1.35 billion. Dupixent is well positioned for ongoing rapid growth based on significant unmet need in existing and potential new disease areas, with anticipated expansion into even younger age groups and new geographies worldwide. In atopic dermatitis, prescribing trends are strong across the spectrum of moderate to severe disease. Dupixent is health care specialists' first-line systemic treatment of choice due to several highly differentiating product characteristics, including its dual anti-IL-4 and IL-13 mechanism of action, compelling efficacy and rapid symptom relief, well-established safety profile, with no risk of serious infections due to immunosuppression and clinical data in children as young as six months. If approved, we look forward to expanding Dupixent's skin indications to include babies and young children with atopic dermatitis as well as two new dermatologic indications. There are no currently approved biologic medicines for prurigo nodularis, where we estimate approximately 75,000 patients may benefit from Dupixent in the U.S. alone. We're also progressing an important opportunity to help chronic spontaneous urticaria patients. Dupixent is also steadily growing in the highly competitive asthma space. We see ongoing potential to differentiate Dupixent in moderate to severe disease through its competitive profile, including a broad label that allows use in uncontrolled steroid-dependent patients, regardless of their eosinophil levels, as well as use in patients as young as six years of age. Dupixent is also the preferred treatment of ENTs and allergists in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, regardless of prior surgery and contributes meaningfully to our business. We are also progressing our launch plans for eosinophilic esophagitis, a gastrointestinal disease with substantial unmet need. We estimate at least 50,000 patients in the U.S. could benefit from Dupixent if approved. We've received positive feedback from key opinion leaders on the strength of our data and lack of suitable treatment alternatives for this serious disease. In summary, in 2021, our commercial team delivered strong growth across the portfolio. Our momentum and new launch opportunities position us well for the future growth. Now I'll turn the call over to Bob.
Bob Landry: Thanks, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis where applicable. Regeneron's fourth quarter capped off a strong year. In the quarter, we delivered top and bottom line growth driven by strong execution within our core business. Fourth quarter total revenue grew 104% year-over-year to $5 billion. Excluding revenues related to the COVID-19 antibody cocktail, total fourth quarter revenue grew 17% year-over-year to $2.7 billion, demonstrating continuing strength of our core business. Fourth quarter total diluted net income per share was $23.72 on net income of $2.7 billion. Starting with REGEN-COV. In the fourth quarter, we delivered the remaining 1.1 million doses from our September 2021 U.S. government supply agreement and recognized $2.3 billion of U.S. net sales. In accordance with our global collaboration with Roche, the amount of manufactured products supplied by each party to the global market resulted in the recognition of a true-up payment related to Roche's share of profits. As a result, in the fourth quarter, we recognized a $260 million charge in cost of goods sold and recorded no Roche collaboration revenue. As mentioned, we completed all deliveries under the September 2021 U.S. government supply contract in the fourth quarter. With the FDA's recent amendment to REGEN-COV's emergency use authorization, we do not expect to record any U.S. REGEN-COV sales in the first half of 2022. I will now move to our collaborations, starting with Bayer. Fourth quarter 2021 ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales as reported to us by Bayer were $934 million, growing 9% on a reported basis and 12% on a constant currency basis. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $372 million, of which we recorded $354 million for our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $518 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Despite seasonally higher fourth quarter operating expenses, our share of the profits from the commercialization of Dupixent and Kevzara was $388 million, which compares favorably to our share of profits of $230 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Moving now to fourth quarter 2021 operating expenses. R&D decreased slightly to $639 million primarily due to lower spending on REGEN-COV development as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. SG&A expense increased 30% year-over-year to $495 million primarily due to cost related to growth initiatives for EYLEA and higher head count-related costs. Cost of goods sold were $559 million primarily related to REGEN-COV manufacturing costs and, as I mentioned earlier, the recognition of the $260 million true-up payment to Roche for their share of profits related to the COVID antibody cocktail. Finally, the fourth quarter 2021 effective tax rate was 12.7%. Shifting now to cash flow and the balance sheet. For the year, Regeneron generated $6.5 billion in free cash flow and ended the year with cash and marketable securities less debt of $9.8 billion. In the fourth quarter 2021, we exhausted the remaining balance on our $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization. And in November, we announced a new $3 billion share repurchase authorization. Across both, we've repurchased approximately 850 million of shares in the fourth quarter of 2021. We continue to be opportunistic buyers where we see dislocation between our stock price and our intrinsic valuation. Now let me conclude with our initial 2022 outlook and guidance. As I mentioned earlier, we do not expect to record any U.S. REGEN-COV sales in the first half of 2022. For U.S. Praluent throughout 2021, we observed significant category and competitive pressures. We expect these pressures to accelerate throughout 2022. And now for our 2022 expense guidance. For R&D, we forecast our 2022 R&D expense to be in the range of $2.8 billion to $3 billion. As we highlighted throughout 2021, critically important development programs are advancing in 2022, including the late-stage randomized studies versus branded comparators for the LAG3 Libtayo combination, BCMAxCD3 and C5 programs in development expenses to advance next-generation antibodies against COVID-19. For SG&A, we forecast our 2022 SG&A expense to be in the range of $1.65 billion to $1.77 billion. Based on our initial plan, we expect SG&A expenses to be spread evenly across the quarters in 2022. For COGS, we forecast 2022 product gross margin on our percentage of net product sales to be between 90% and 92%. We expect cost of collaboration manufacturing to be in the range of $750 million to $830 million driven by continued growth in our Dupixent franchise. And finally, we anticipate our 2022 effective tax rate to be in the range of 13% to 15%. A complete summary of our full year guidance is available in our press release issued earlier this morning. In conclusion, our core business continues to advance and strengthen. With growth continuing across our existing portfolio and investments in our R&D engine supported by our strong balance sheet, we remain well positioned for sustainable long-term growth.
Mark Hudson: Thanks, Bob. Michelle, that concludes our prepared remarks. We now like to open up the call for Q&A.  Please go ahead, Michelle.
Operator:  Our first question comes from Evan Seigerman with BMO. Your line is open.
Evan Seigerman: You touched on your solid tumor oncology franchise, specifically the METXMET in MUC16xCD3 bispecifics that we're supposed to get this year. Can you elaborate a little as to kind of what we should be expecting with these data readouts and how that could inform potentially pivotal trials or a registration path?
Dr. George Yancopoulos: Yes. These are both being evaluated in late-stage patients who have essentially failed all existing therapies. And obviously, the excitement would be if one saw evidence of convincing objective responses that were durable in these settings, then those would certainly inform how would we move forward on these. And we've already announced that we've been observing encouraging early signs of efficacy, and we will be elaborating on these and giving the details in these future presentations.
Operator: Our next question comes from Carter Gould with Barclays. Your line is open.
Carter Gould: Maybe I'll just take on the elephant in the room. For Len and Marion, would love to get your thoughts on -- as you think about the EYLEA franchise in the context of what looks like a very accommodating label on faricimab and their pricing, as we think about the implications for your high-dose label and commercial positioning.
Dr. Len Schleifer: Yes. I'll let Marion get into the details. But we don't see faricimab as a transformative therapy of any kind, notwithstanding any label. It's very hard to see when you look at it dispassionately any scientific evidence for the contribution of Ang2 blockade. People forget, nobody has a greater interest and would love to see Ang2 blockade being a value given that George and his colleagues were the ones who discovered and cloned Ang2, the first in the world on that. But there's really no evidence that we can see where you've separated that out. So what we're seeing here is a higher dose of faricimab relative to Lucentis and possibly on a moral basis relative to EYLEA. We remind everybody that there are a lot of lessons learned here. One of the biggest lessons is efficacy is super important, but well beyond that is safety. And nothing right now contract the, I don't know, almost 50 million injections that have been given worldwide with EYLEA. So we feel pretty good. The competition is always good. Obviously, competition is going to eat into a product. We suspect that faricimab may take a lot of the -- of its share initially from Lucentis, but we'll see. Marion might want to elaborate.
Marion McCourt: Yes. Thank you, Len. Certainly, to give some very early market feedback, the comment that we're getting from key opinion leaders is that they don't see first met via product that potentially is a game changer and that the dosing is complex. And there are remaining questions on the clinical trial design and, of course, as Len mentioned, safety. More importantly, I'll go back over to EYLEA, where we certainly are establishing the product as standard of care and more across indications with great flexibility of dosing, indications, experience, real-world evidence, prefilled syringe and busy times. So we look forward to strong performance going forward on EYLEA, and we're very optimistic about what could be a next-generation product with our own aflibercept 8-milligram high-dose product if the Phase III data works out.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tyler Van Buren with Cowen. Your line is open.
Tyler Martin Van: So for your next-generation COVID antibody cocktail, looks like it's -- you said it's entering the clinic in the coming months. So was there a slight delay versus the prior Q1 guidance? And you referred to FDA streamlining development of monoclonal antibodies. So can you give us your latest thoughts on how long it might take to get to market? I noticed Bob mentioned that there won't be sales in the first half, so just curious if we could see something in the second half.
Dr. Len Schleifer: Yes. George can comment on what he thinks is necessary, but I just want to be clear. I don't think there's any delay, whether we come in just at the end of this quarter or early in the next quarter or thereabouts. It's tough to exactly estimate when we'll start. But we're scaling up, and we're rolling forward. George can comment on some of the global and U.S. regulatory considerations and guidances that we know about thus far.
Dr. George Yancopoulos: Yes. There's not much to add. I mean, we're continuing to discuss with regulators what the program is and what are the abilities as was done with vaccines to expedite the development programs compared to what was necessary for the first-generation agents developed using the same platform. So we will update that as we learn more.
Dr. Len Schleifer: George, there's some confusion, just so you could clarify it. Our next-generation antibody work on just -- Omicron on is a work on all of them. Yes, George, go ahead.
Dr. George Yancopoulos: As I mentioned in my script, so obviously, we have one of the largest collections of antibodies to choose from. And what we do as a variant emerges is we select new candidate antibodies that will work against the new variant, but will also retain their activity against the previous variants of concern. And that's exactly the candidates that we're advancing right now. They work against Omicron, but they work against Delta. They work against all the other variants before. .
Dr. Len Schleifer: And anything -- any comment on stealth Omicron, do you think it will work there, too?
Dr. George Yancopoulos: Well, yes. Obviously, we take all these things into consideration. And so when a new variant that looks like it could be coming along that might be important, we certainly have made sure that the candidates that we're advancing now are going to be active against all of those as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Salveen Richter: Could you just speak to the RNAi programs? I think we're going to get first data this year from ALN-APP from that program. And how do you think about the optimization of delivery to the brain here and what we might see and how the C5 program could be differentiated?
Dr. George Yancopoulos: Okay. So you're asking about the brain and CNS and the APP program, but you're always asking about C5. Okay. So yes, with the brain, obviously, as we all know, there have been disappointing results with antibodies that have been delivered to try to decrease APP levels. They work in a fundamentally different way. One of the problems that they cause, they cause the famous inflammatory syndrome that may complicate activity. So obviously, the hope of siRNA programs is they work by a completely different mechanism. They will actually decrease the production of APP and allowed to be cleared by normal mechanisms as opposed to letting it be made continuously at the normal rate and then trying to remove it by artificial mechanisms that they themselves may be toxic, i.e., the antibody efforts. So that's why they may be fundamentally different. Importantly, we're exploring this not only in Alzheimer's disease, as we all know. It's not as if the early results in Alzheimer's disease are going to really address the important endpoints, that is cognition and efficacy in slowing down cognitive decline and so forth. They're going to be looking at levels of biomarkers and so forth. That's why we're also excited that we are developing the same exact agent, in some ways, a much more rapidly progressing, though albeit much rare disease known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy, or CAA, because there, the ability to both look at the biomarkers, but also, more importantly, look at important efficacy parameters is going to allow us to proceed much faster and much smaller numbers of patients. And therein, we may be, over the next couple of years, able to establish both definitive efficacy, but maybe even get authorization approved in those indications, and that will certainly be quite in advance for the entire field of these types of diseases, and particularly for the first siRNA that's going into these diseases. So we are very excited about these programs, and we have a very large pipeline of other CNS diseases and targets that we are going forward in addressing with Alnylam. So it's a very important part of our collaborative efforts with them, which also include a large number of targets in terms of genetic targets, genetically validated targets,and diseases in the eye, let alone outside of the eye such as, for example, in the liver, and that brings us to the C5 that you asked about. So as we all know, people are taking single types of approaches to target C5. Some people might have an antibody. There's now some other types of approaches and so forth. What we realized is that if we could combine an siRNA with an antibody, we might have really not only combine the unique advantages of both, but incredible synergies. And what do we mean? Antibodies have the highest effectiveness because, essentially, they can bring down activity levels almost to zero. But because of the high target load, you have to give these antibodies, and these are all the existing approved antibodies and those that are under investigation by other sponsors, you have to give them a relatively large amount of them and relatively frequently. So antibodies are great. But by themselves, you need to give a lot of antibodies to deal with a high target load. siRNAs are great at reducing the target load, but they don't get you to really almost zero activity, and that creates problems. We already know that. By putting the two together, you now get the best of both. You reduce the target load, and you allow now a much smaller amount of antibody to control activity hopefully completely. So there really is tremendous synergy with this. This is the first of its kind that is combining siRNA with antibodies. We think there's very exciting potential for this to deliver best-in-class, both efficacy but also convenience and dosing regimen. We're going for convenient subcutaneous self-administration once a month, which would really, I think, be game changing for the field and for these patients. But we're also moving these programs also to other related indications as well. So we're very excited about this combination approach for C5 and for these types of indications. But once again, just like what we're doing in CNS, just like what we're doing with eye, these are really franchise and portfolio opportunities. I mean, you can just imagine, if combining -- and there are so many other settings where this could be very useful, combining the benefits of siRNA and antibodies and bringing them together could really begin changing not only in this area, but in many, many other areas. And who better to do this than bringing together the leading siRNA company and the leading antibody and biologics company, Alnylam and Regeneron. So we are very excited about the individual programs with some of these siRNA, but also these incredible combination opportunities, bringing these two incredible technologies together, taking the advantages of both.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ronny Gal with AllianceBernstein. Your line is open.
Ronny Sanford: One is for Marion. Can you talk a little bit about the VEGF market? It seems that we've been coming close to a year for a better than 10% growth. And I was wondering how much of this is catch-up versus how much of this is just higher natural market growth rate versus what we're expecting. And then can you talk a little bit about the dynamics of what it takes to compete in this market, kind of like how long to get a J code, how long to have contract with different practices? Essentially, when will -- how long will take a competitor coming online, whether innovative or biosimilar, to really be able to effectively compete in that market?
Marion McCourt: Sure. Ronny, happy to take it, and I'm going to take the end of your question first. And I first would say that a competitor or a new entrant to the market's ability to compete is really going to be based on the differentiation of their product profile, the quality of their studies and the confidence and enthusiasm that the key opinion leaders have on the product as it comes in. So I do think differentiation matters quite a lot. In the case of EYLEA, certainly, our growth in the past year has been quite pronounced. We've captured not only the market growth, but we've also captured competitive share gain more than any other products, so that our market share today for EYLEA is approaching 50% of the overall category and 75% of the branded category. And we picked up several share points in the last year in this very large category. Let me go back now to new entrants. You're asking about timing of J codes, and that is important. Quality of product, as I mentioned, reflects confidence in how well it performs, but it is a six-month period before a new product receives a permanent J code. So in that window of time, especially in a product which is buy and bill, there's always the concern on reimbursement. There's not experience, not with the product, but there's also not experience with applying for reimbursement under the J-code. That period of time is six months. And to my earlier comment, product confidence will vary based on profile. I hope I've covered, Ronny, most of what you had in that. The only thing I think I probably missed is anti-VEGF category growth going forward. That is a little bit complicated because we're comparing to recovery in the market opposite the COVID period to some extent. However, there is growth of the category because of patient demographics and because of education. I'll give you an example of patients who are diagnosed with DME, only about 47%, 48% of those patients are treated. And those are -- and of those that are diagnosed, there's only -- if you took all DME patients that exist, only about 25% of those patients are treated. So there still is tremendous unmet need in the marketplace, and we certainly will work hard through educational initiatives to make sure that we perform very well as we have been on an ongoing basis on all of our indications. I hope that helps, Ronny.
Dr. Len Schleifer: Can I just add one thing, Ronny, on that? It's just that it seems like it's been every single year for the last decade there has been a threat to EYLEA that a variety of number of people have predicted would be the next thing to displace EYLEA. And along the way, the barriers have changed. And the most important barrier that I think now exists is safety, and that safety, even for a biosimilar, the same product safety for a new product with purported differences, people have learned that the eye is a very sensitive place. And having given scores of millions of injections of EYLEA, there's a great deal of confidence out there. I think it's going to take a matter of time beyond J codes and meeting with practices before that level of confidence is significantly displaced.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist. Your line is open.
Nicole Germino: This is Nicole on for Robyn. Just a really quick question on yesterday's report, the Adicet Bio disclosing their general exercising option to license an allo CAR-T. Can you just comment on the move towards allo CAR-T and why this particular happened?
Dr. Len Schleifer: Could you repeat the end of the question? It was a little hard to hear the question.
Dr. George Yancopoulos: The Adicet?
Dr. Len Schleifer: Yes. But what was the question? Can you repeat it?
Dr. George Yancopoulos: Why does that matter? What's the importance of it?
Dr. Len Schleifer: So well, as you already referred to it, I mean, this is an advance in the CAR-T space because, obviously, so far, the approved approach and upcoming approaches are all dependent on giving customized individualized autologous CAR-T cells. And the results coming from this relatively novel gamma delta approach is the first gamma delta data in the world show that you could give allogeneic cells and get very remarkable -- in very small numbers, a very remarkable response rate. And so this would take the customization autologous approach and take it to the autologous to the non-autologous allogeneic way, which will really could potentially revolutionize the treatment paradigm here. And so we've been long-term collaborators with Adicet, and we're pretty excited about this allogeneic approach. And so we're investing in it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Matthew Harrison: I was hoping for one on co-stim. I know we're supposed to get some data this year. Can you just maybe help us think about dosing levels, how you're thinking about safety currently? And just in terms of initial data, what should we expect to see, whether it's just about safety or we should really start to have some idea on efficacy as well?
Dr. George Yancopoulos: Yes. That's a great question. And as we all know, this pathway was explored many years ago now and led to, unfortunately, very dramatic safety concerns to patients, and that sort of killed the field. And so because of those concerns and that we were reexploring utilization of this very, very powerful co-stimulatory pathway to add to -- in combination with other immunotherapies, the FDA appropriately asked us to move very, very slowly. So the first endpoint of most concern was the safety endpoint, of course, first do no harm. And I think that what we've announced is that in our ongoing dose escalation study, it's only been recently that we have achieved what we think are therapeutic dose potential levels. And now -- and we have -- I think the thing that we have said publicly is we successfully crossed in terms of getting to these dose levels, this very concerning and potentially game stopping safety hurdles. And so now that we're at the potentially therapeutic dose levels, we are now hoping to focus on efficacy. And remember, in several of these programs, for example, our prostate program, we're going in a setting where, at least if properly identified, there are essentially no or very rare responses to PD-1 in these types of very carefully characterized prostate patients. I mean, there has been very little hope, except for rare subsets of characterized patients that have mutations and so forth, for the PD-1 immunotherapy class. So if we can show essentially almost any responses in these types of very recalcitrant and hard-to-treat patients with PD-1 alone in our combinations with our co-stim for prostate cancer, I think there's real reason to believe that our scientists have successfully figured out a completely novel way of taking advantage of this long known, very exciting and powerful, but dangerous pathway that we may have figured out a way to take advantage of it and done it in a safe manner. So this is what we're hoping to see this year that now that we are at these levels, we've gotten there without activating these huge safety concerns that were previously seeing. Essentially seeing any objective responses in this setting would really be potentially game changing. And so we're looking forward to being able to tell you about this possibility later this year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Cory Kasimov: Wondering if you could frame expectations for the pending update on your program with Intellia that we're getting here near term. What new might we see relative to last summer's preliminary data disclosure?
Dr. Len Schleifer: Yes. We don't want to get too far in front of our partner. George's remarks already indicated the kind of things we'll see, but we should leave it up to Intellia to comment beyond what George said about looking at the dose escalation and including the safety and knockdown of the TTR. But Intellia should have the benefit of making some comments.
Dr. George Yancopoulos: But maybe just a couple of obvious points that's not stealing anybody's thunder. But obviously, the initial results were incredibly exciting and revolutionary. Obviously, the first systemic case CRISPR therapy, I mean, all this excitement for almost 20 years, Nobel prizes and all this, I mean, it is incredible that, together with our Intellia colleagues, I mean, this represents the first-ever systemic use of CRISPR to actually modify human genetic gene. But obviously, one of the most important things that one will see is the whole promise of this approach is duration, that is you are modifying the gene. And hopefully, you will never have to treat that patient again, okay? And that's part of the dream and the hope with these genetic cures. And so this is, of course, one important thing that we hope that we'll be seeing from the follow-up data, the duration, which is what is really game changing. You can permanently cure these patients. That's the theory here by permanently changing their genes. And so the longer you follow them up, the more you can validate the duration with, of course, the appropriate safety and continue to keep the dream alive that this whole new approach could really be game-changing for important and appropriate clinical indications.
Operator: Our last question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Mohit Bansal: And congrats on the progress. Maybe another one on faricimab. And given that your competitor also has Lucentis, which is facing biosimilar this year, are you seeing any rumblings of potential bundling or attractive pricing for those both products combined, that could be played as a strategy to take on EYLEA? And how much does payer versus provider matter in this market?
Marion McCourt: Sure. So at a high level, I'll share just and talk about our own business is, certainly, we have strong market understanding and work closely with all of our customers across the market segments. When it comes to how another company might be looking at their pricing or strategy, it's probably best I let them comment. But I appreciate the interest in the category and the question.
Mark Hudson: Thanks, everyone. That concludes today's conference call, and thanks for your interest in Regeneron. The IR team and Bob Landry is here to take any questions that you may have. Everyone, have a nice day.
Operator: This concludes the program. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-11-04 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. . I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Justin Holko, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Justin Holko: Thank you, Didi. Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening to everyone listening around the globe. Thank you for your interest in Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2021 Conference Call. An archive of this webcast will be available on our website. Joining me today on the call are Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; Dr. George Yancopoulos, Co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer; Marion McCourt, Executive Vice President and Head of Commercial; and Bob Landry, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A.  I would also like to remind you that remarks made on today's call include forward-looking statements about Regeneron. Such statements may include, but are not limited to, those related to Regeneron and its products and business, financial forecast and guidance, development programs and related anticipated milestones, collaborations, finances, regulatory matters, payer coverage and reimbursement issues, intellectual property, pending litigation and other proceedings and competition. Each forward-looking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected in that statement. A more complete description of these and other material risks can be found in Regeneron's filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission including its Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2021, which we filed with the SEC earlier today. Regeneron does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  In addition, please note that GAAP and non-GAAP measures will be discussed in today's call. Information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP is available in our financial results press release, which can be accessed on our website. Once our call concludes, Bob Landry and the IR team will be available to answer further questions.  With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.
Leonard Schleifer: Thank you, Justin. And before I begin my remarks, let me just note that this may be Justin's last call, it may not be, at least in the position of IR. He is making a transition. He has decided he wants to make the news, not just report and explain the news and he is moving over to our commercial organization. So we're very excited, but we're not letting him go until his replacement is fully in place. So you may hear more from Justin in this role what you may not. He -- Justin has done a remarkable job. He is quick to point out to me that when he joined the company, the stock was only around $300. And now he says it's significantly higher. Justin, we thank you for your great service.  Turning to our business, we turned in another strong performance in the third quarter, which was marked by significant double-digit top and bottom line growth and continued operating leverage. This was more possible as a result of the truly exceptional execution by our colleagues across the entire company from R&D to production, commercial and support teams despite the challenges that we all faced imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Our core business of EYLEA, Dupixent and Libtayo, all contributed solid underlying growth. Additionally, we secured a third supply agreement with the United States government for REGEN-COV, our investigational antibody cocktail for treating and preventing COVID-19 in certain populations with initial deliveries fueling additional growth momentum in the quarter.  In R&D, our broad and growing pipeline, which now includes more than 30 clinical stage candidates with many more expected to enter the clinic in short order continues to advance new innovations to secure our long-term growth potential. Importantly, our pipeline continues to be largely composed and comprised of internal innovation. But increasingly, it is supplemented by external relationships that bring in novel modalities, including CRISPR and siRNA, creating unique treatment options and combination approaches as George will outline momentarily.  In the third quarter, beginning with EYLEA, global net sales of EYLEA were $2.4 billion, growing 15% compared to the prior year. U.S. EYLEA sales grew 12%, reflecting recovery of the anti-VEGF category and share gains as the leading anti-VEGF treatment for retinal diseases. We see the strength of EYLEA an opportunity for steady growth continuing despite potential upcoming competition from which we currently do not see any disruptive or game-changing new engines to the anti-VEGF space for treating retinal diseases.  Dupixent continues to be remarkable in delivering commercially and clinically across a wide spectrum of type 2 inflammatory diseases. In the third quarter, global net sales grew 55% to $1.7 billion. Growth contributions from inside and outside of the United States continued to improve operating leverage in our alliance with Sanofi.  Moreover, we announced positive results from 4 Phase III registrational studies in recent months, 1 in very young children with atopic dermatitis, and 3 in the potential new indications of eosinophilic esophagitis, prurigo nodularis and chronic spontaneous urticaria.  In October, the FDA expanded our asthma label to include children aged 6 to 11, a testament to not only the efficacy, but also the safety of Dupixent in the chronic treatment of type 2 inflammatory diseases. With several other disease opportunities in clinical development, such as COPD, the expansion possibilities are significant for this remarkable medicine that is already changing the lives of hundreds of thousands of patients.  In Oncology, Libtayo global net sales were $120 million and grew 24%. Despite the challenges imposed on the Oncology market by COVID-19, we're working hard as the leader in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and progressing in our basal cell carcinoma and lung cancer launches. We are also preparing for a potential launch in 2022 in the much larger opportunity of Libtayo combined with chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer.  REGEN-COV continues to grow in importance with increased utilization in the treatment of COVID-19. The FDA has accepted under priority review our biologic license application for the treatment and prophylaxis of COVID-19 in certain patients. We are also on review to expand the emergency use authorization for REGEN-COV in certain hospitalized patients and for pre-exposure prophylaxis.  Outside of the United States, our antibody cocktail has received a full approval in Japan, is conditionally approved in Australia and the U.K., and has emergency or temporary pandemic authorizations currently in place in more than 40 other countries.  REGEN-COV has the potential for a broad range of prevention and treatment applications from preexposure prophylaxis to treatment of infected hospitalized patients. Given the anticipation of new COVID infections over time, increased utilization of REGEN-COV in appropriate cases and the need for prophylaxis in immunocompromised individuals, we anticipate an ongoing role for REGEN-COV. If global demand warrants, we have the capacity to produce between 4 million to 5 million 1.2 gram doses in 2022, excluding any further supply contributions from Roche.  To conclude, as we close out 2021, our growth momentum is strong and our outlook for continued growth fueled by the breadth and depth of our pipeline is bright. Now I will turn the call over to George.
George Yancopoulos: Thank you, Len. I'll pick up where you left me with the REGEN-COV story. As Len mentioned, our robust COVID-19 development program involving more than 25,000 people to date has provided compelling evidence that REGEN-COV has the potential to be used for various prevention and treatment applications from pre-exposure prophylaxis to treating hospitalized patients. In the United States, REGEN-COV is currently authorized under an EUA and also being reviewed for full FDA approval for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 in certain patients with an action date of April 13, 2022. At Regeneron, we all appreciate that widespread vaccination is the best way to broadly protect as many people as possible from COVID-19. But recent research also reveals some important gaps in coverage provided by the vaccines, leaving some individuals uniquely vulnerable, particularly the several million immunocompromised people in the United States alone who remain prisoners of the pandemic.  First, many of the immunocompromised population respond sub-optimally or not at all to vaccination, even after booster shots. Second, breakthrough infections in the general population still occur after vaccination, meaning that immunocompromised people will continue to be at risk of encountering infected individuals even within a highly vaccinated population. Therefore, we believe that REGEN-COV could be of particular importance for these immunocompromised individuals who remain unprotected and also are at highest risk for developing the most severe COVID-19 disease. This includes people with certain hematologic cancers, for example, lymphomas, leukemias and myeloma and people who take certain immunosuppressive medicines for diseases such as multiple sclerosis, in rheumatoid arthritis, for organ transplant recipients and for those with primary immunodeficiencies.  In the United States, Regeneron submitted data and a request to the FDA to expand the existing emergency use authorization of REGEN-COV to include chronic prevention back in April. Further reflecting Regeneron's commitment to the immunocompromised, we recently began a big trial to optimize REGEN-COV prophylaxis in this population, including evaluation of extended dose.  Our current REGEN-COV cocktail retains potent activity against all known variants of interest, including the Delta variant. However, the virus continues to mutate and evolve. And thus, as we have previously discussed, we are advancing a novel anti-spike protein antibody cocktail into clinical development. We have done so proactively in the case of a novel innovative antibody cocktail that retains potency against new potential variants as required in the future.  Moving to Ophthalmology. We reported encouraging top line data of high-dose aflibercept in the Phase II CANDELA study in wet AMD. The small proof-of-concept study met its primary efficacy endpoint, a higher proportion of patients in the 8-milligram aflibercept group had no retinal fluid compared to patients treated with the currently approved 2-milligram EYLEA dose at week 16.  There were no safety signals observed in the comparison to the currently approved EYLEA 2-milligram dose, 2 large Phase III trials in wet AMD and DME, evaluating the high dose of aflibercept in dosing intervals of every 12 weeks and every 16 weeks are fully enrolled and are expected to report results in the second half of 2022. These Phase III data will be crucial to understanding overall efficacy, safety and convenience of high dose aflibercept.  Moving on to Dupixent. The remarkable clinical success of Dupixent across so many different allergic or type 2 inflammatory diseases, validates our early and long-standing hypothesis that these conditions are all driven by overactivation of the same fundamental immunologic pathway that is the interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 pathway, which is effectively blocked by Dupixent whether the disease manifests as asthma or chronic rhinositis with nasal polyps in the airways as atopic dermatitis or prurigo nodularis in the skin, as the eosinophilic esophagitis in the GI tract. Our clinical data have demonstrated an important impact of Dupixent on these many conditions that initially did not seem related. In only the past few months, Dupixent demonstrated positive results in 4 separate pivotal studies. This is a tremendous accomplishment stemming from the vision and dedication of our team and it's great news for patients suffering from these type 2 inflammatory diseases.  In a recent Phase III trial in atopic dermatitis in infants and children as young as 6 months of age, Dupixent met all primary and secondary endpoints as well as a lower observed rate of skin infections in the Dupixent group compared to placebo.  Detailed results from this trial will be presented at a future medical meeting, and data will be submitted to the FDA by the end of this year. These data reinforce the well-established efficacy and safety profile of Dupixent with over 0.5 million patients treated to date. We also reported recent Phase III data with Dupixent in eosinophilic esophagitis or EoE, a progressive disease that damages the esophagus and impairs the ability to swallow. More than 1/3 of the patients in our trial had manifestations of this disease so severe that they previously had to undergo endoscopic dilation of the esophagus for symptomatic relief. In our study, patients taking weekly Dupixent had an approximate 24-point improvement on the 0 to 84 dysphagia symptom questionnaire, representing a 64% improvement compared to a 14-point improvement for placebo.  This update reinforced previously reported Phase III results for which the 52-week follow-up results were recently presented at the United European Gastroenterology Week Virtual 2021 Congress. Completion of our regulatory filing for EoE in adolescents and adults is planned for early 2022. We also recently reported positive results for Dupixent from our Phase III trial in yet another inflammatory skin condition known as prurigo nodularis, an underdiagnosed disease characterized by extreme itch and skin nodules. The trial met its primary and all key secondary endpoints in comparison to placebo, including reduction in itch from baseline at 12 and 24 weeks, achieving clear skin and improvement in quality of life. A second trial in prurigo nodularis is fully enrolled and is expected to read out in the first half of '22 with regulatory submissions planned for the same year.  If all these exciting Phase III data lead to regulatory approvals, Dupixent would be approved for 6 different allergic or type 2 inflammatory disease indications, including patients as young as 6 months.  Moving to Libtayo in Oncology. Positive Phase III data of Libtayo in combination with chemotherapy in first-line advanced non-small cell lung cancer were presented at the ESMO 2021 meeting. These data mark Libtayo as 1 of only 2 PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors to demonstrate positive Phase III results in first line non-small cell lung cancer, irrespective of histology, both as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy. These Libtayo studies were conducted in a patient population that included difficult-to-treat disease characteristics that reflects everyday clinical practice. We are rapidly progressing towards regulatory submission for the Libtayo chemotherapy combination across histologies and PD-L1 expression levels, which could unlock an opportunity to help a larger population of lung cancer patients.  Turning to Hematology. At the upcoming American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting for ASH, we will provide updates to our developing Hematology portfolio. The nodal presentation we will provide a data update for our potentially registrational first-in-human trial of REGN5458. Our BCMA by CD3 bispecific antibody tested in patients with heavily pretreated multiple myeloma. REGN5458 to be a major advance in treatment of patients who have failed several prior lines of therapy, but the potential utility of our BCMA-targeted bispecific is not limited to this patient population. We will discuss our data and further development plans at our virtual ASH Investor event scheduled for Monday, December 13 regarding odronextamab or CD20 by CD3 bispecific. We are pleased with our -- with recruitment in our potentially pivotal trial since the partial clinical hall was lifted earlier this year. Exploration of subcutaneous formulation of odronextamab is on track to start by the end of this year. We are planning to initiate broader Phase III programs in 2022.  Our bispecific development program for solid tumors is progressing with our unique approaches, including the MUC16xCD3 bispecific as monotherapy in ovarian cancer as well as in combination with Libtayo or with our MUC16xCD28 costim. In addition, we expect to have initial data with our PSMAxCD28 costim in patients with prostate cancer in '22.  We are also excited about our EGFRxCD28 costim clinical program across multiple EGF high cancer settings, including lung cancer as well as our clinical stage METxMET bispecific and our METxMET antibody drug conjugate, presenting a new  for Regeneron into the realm of drug conjugates linked to our potentially best in class bispecific antibodies.  In conclusion for Oncology, we are approaching an important new phase for Regeneron. We have several novel Phase I/II programs in clinical development with more expected in the coming months. We also have large Phase III studies planned such as our LAG-3 Libtayo for first-line advanced melanoma against the pembrolizumab monotherapy comparator as well as large registrational programs for our Hematology/Oncology bispecifics. We're excited about the potential that these important investments in our portfolio may bring to patients.  I would like to conclude with our Regeneron genetics medicines in our collaboration updates. We are uniquely positioned to combine products of our established biologics portfolio and emerging findings from our genetics medicine efforts. As part of our collaboration with Alnylam, we are looking forward to multiple updates on our C5 program. As we already mentioned ASH meeting, we will show first-in-human data for our C5 antibody, pozelimab in combination with the C5 inhibiting siRNA, cemdisiran. We will present initial results in healthy volunteers, which supports development of this first-of-its-kind combination of an antibody and an siRNA therapeutic. Early data on siRNA monotherapy mediated C5  did not achieve complete terminal complement blockade, which is necessary for adequate disease control in PNH or paroxysmal nocturnal hematuria. Adding the antibody specific for the same target protein could provide patients with a lower dose therapy and a more convenient extended dosing regimen while providing more complete C5 inhibition, resulting in better efficacy and less breakthrough hemolysis.  We have also recently initiated a Phase III study testing the C5 antibody and siRNA combination in myasthenia gravis. For PNH, starting next year, we are planning to test our combo in both naive and switch patients tested against standard of care therapies, including ravulizumab and eculizumab. This study has the potential to show a true benefit of the combination approach for the treatment of this disease.  Also in collaboration with Alnylam, some of our initial genetic target discoveries are reaching the stage of clinical readouts for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or NASH, a disease where finding compelling treatment options has been difficult. We're using the siRNA approach to silence the gene we identified as a potential target. Recall, we discovered that people with a protective HSD17B13 gene variant have a 30% to 70% lower odds of chronic liver disease. Our collaborator, Alnylam, will show initial healthy volunteer safety data for the Alnylam HSD, the HSD17B13 targeting siRNA at their upcoming R&D Day later this month.  Finally, in October, the Regeneron Genetics Center published a manuscript in nature, which highlighted achievement of the milestone of sequencing almost 0.5 million exomes from the U.K. Biobank database. This nature paper for the first time describes rare variants of genes that could be potential drug targets for diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, asthma and others.  And with that, I will turn the call over to Marion.
Marion McCourt: Thank you, George. Our third quarter business performance demonstrates the strength of our commercial portfolio. We are executing well on our in-line brands and are maximizing opportunities for diversified and sustainable growth through ongoing launches.  First, I will highlight recent achievements with REGEN-COV, our COVID-19 antibody cocktail, which is available in the U.S. under emergency use authorization by the FDA. In the third quarter, U.S. net sales were $677 million, primarily based on the initial deliveries of our third government agreement, which was announced in mid-September. Demand for REGEN-COV accelerated sharply over the third quarter as this promising treatment option continues to help fight the surge in COVID-19 cases. REGEN-COV is increasingly seen as standard of care for outpatient treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis in appropriate patients. Our field educators continue to support key stakeholders in health care systems at administration sites.  While COVID-19 cases have thankfully decreased over the last several weeks, demand for REGEN-COV remains high with many patients receiving treatment. REGEN-COV has broad therapeutic application in current and potential future integrations across the spectrum of disease from pre-exposure prevention to hospitalization. We look forward to the FDA's decision on our application for a full approval expected in April of 2022.  Beyond REGEN-COV, we delivered strong growth from our core business in the third quarter. Starting with EYLEA, third quarter global net sales grew 15% year-over-year to more than $2.4 billion. In the U.S., net sales grew 12% year-over-year to nearly $1.5 billion based on category recovery and EYLEA's competitor share gains. EYLEA secured nearly 50% of the overall category and over 75% of the branded category based on our overall platform of efficacy, safety and convenience.  There are positive early indicators from our unbranded direct-to-consumer campaign that educates patients with diabetic eye disease on the importance of vision care. Retina specialists have applauded our efforts encouraging diabetic patients to seek treatment to prevent irreversible vision loss.  EYLEA's competitive profile, coupled with favorable underlying demographic trends give us confidence in Regeneron's ongoing leadership position in retinal diseases.  Turning to Libtayo. Global net sales were $120 million. In the U.S., net sales reached $78 million despite continued COVID impacts on new patient starts. With new indication launches at early stages, the vast majority of sales came from advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma or CSCC, where Libtayo is the #1 systemic treatment. Building on our success in CSCC, we are quickly establishing Libtayo as standard of care in advanced basal cell carcinoma for patients in the second-line setting or where a Hedgehog inhibitor is not appropriate. In lung cancer, we are working to secure a physician experience with Libtayo as a competitive monotherapy treatment option. We look forward to the potential chemotherapy combination approval, which would unlock the much larger group of first-line patients eligible for anti-PD-1.  Briefly turning to Evkeeza, which is now being used to treat more patients than the prior standard of care, we continue to see initiations in both switch and new-to-category patients, illustrating how our innovative patient identification efforts can be used to support those with HoFH and in the future, other rare diseases.  And finally, to Dupixent, in the third quarter, global net sales grew 55% year-over-year to $1.7 billion and U.S. net sales grew 48% to $1.3 billion. This growth was driven across all approved indications, with new patient starts above pre-COVID levels. In atopic dermatitis, prescribing trends are strong across the spectrum of moderate-to-severe disease, including adolescent and pediatric patients. Dupixent continues to capture market growth based on well-established efficacy and safety, breadth of current indications and unmatched physician and patient experience. There continues to be substantial potential growth in atopic dermatitis, including in children as young as 6 months in age and more broadly in Dermatology with new potential indications of chronic spontaneous urticaria and prurigo nodularis.  In respiratory disease, Dupixent continues to surpass recent competitive biologic launches. In asthma, we see ongoing potential to differentiate Dupixent through its competitive profile and label expansion as the market recovers from COVID, when asthma-related emergency room visits were down nearly 50%. Our launch in pediatric asthma is underway, extending this treatment option to 75,000 children in the U.S. who suffer from this often debilitating disease.  Dupixent's label was also recently updated to include an additional marker of type 2 inflammation called pheno, which extends the eligible population beyond those with high eosinophilic levels. In addition, Dupixent can be prescribed for steroid-dependent asthma regardless of eosinophilic levels.  In nasal polyps, we continue to see growth with Dupixent leading the market despite new competition. Dupixent continues to be the preferred choice of ENTs and allergists regardless of prior surgery.  In summary, our commercial team continues to deliver strong growth across the portfolio with differentiated brands, ongoing and potential future launches, we remain on track for long-term growth. Now, I'll turn the call over to Bob.
Robert Landry: Thank you, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis where applicable. In the third quarter, Regeneron once again delivered strong top and bottom line growth on increasingly diversified revenue streams with contributions from REGEN-COV in our robust core business. For the third quarter, total revenues grew 51% year-over-year to $3.5 billion. Total diluted net income per share grew 84% year-over-year to $15.37 on net income of $1.8 billion. Excluding revenues related to the COVID-19 antibody cocktail, total revenues grew 18% versus the prior year. Starting with REGEN-COV. In the third quarter, we recognized $677 million of U.S. net sales, which consist largely of the initial deliveries of approximately 300,000 doses to the U.S. government under the new 1.4 million dose contract as announced in September. Our collaborator, Roche, record sales of the COVID-19 antibody cocktail known as Ronapreve outside the U.S. In accordance with our Roche agreement, as a true-up payment for global profits, we recorded an additional $127 million as Roche collaboration revenue. In the fourth quarter, we expect to deliver approximately 800,000 doses of REGEN-COV in the U.S. out of which, Roche will supply approximately half of these doses. We will record all REGEN-COV U.S. net product sales. Given the mix of manufactured product supply to the market by Roche and Regeneron, the true-up payment for global profits is expected to result in 0 Roche collaboration revenues in the fourth quarter. The remaining doses from the U.S. government contract are expected to be delivered in the first quarter of 2022. I will now move to our Bayer collaboration. Ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales reported to us by Bayer worth $931 million for the third quarter of 2021, representing growth of 19% on a reported basis and 18% on a constant currency basis. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $365 million, of which we recorded $351 million for our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $582 million in the third quarter of 2021. Our share of the profits from the commercialization of Dupixent and Kevzara was $387 million, which compares favorably to our share of profits of $213 million in the prior year. We also recognized a $50 million sales milestone payment related to achievement of $1.5 billion of ex-U.S. sales for the collaboration on a rolling 12-month basis. Moving on to operating expenses. R&D decreased slightly to $592 million, primarily due to lower spending of REGEN-COV development as compared to the third quarter of 2020. Next, SG&A expense increased 34% year-over-year to $391 million, primarily due to costs related to growth initiatives for EYLEA and higher headcount. Cost to goods sold increased versus the prior year from $122 million to $224 million, primarily due to REGEN-COV manufacturing costs. Cost of collaboration manufacturing increased 50% year-over-year to $214 million, driven by higher production to support the growing Dupixent sales. Finally, the effective tax rate was 10.8% in the third quarter of 2021. Shifting to cash flow on the balance sheet. Year-to-date, Regeneron has generated $4.3 billion in free cash flow and ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities less debt of $8.7 billion. We continued to utilize our strong balance sheet in accordance with our capital allocation priorities of investing in internal R&D, funding strategic external R&D partnerships and returning cash to shareholders. Accordingly, in the third quarter, we repurchased approximately $191 million of our shares. To conclude, I'd like to provide select updates to our 2021 guidance. A complete summary of our latest full year guidance is available in our press release published earlier this morning. With our -- we are updating our 2021 gross margin guidance to be approximately 88%. This estimate is inclusive of an expected payment to Roche as a true-up of global profits for the COVID-19 antibody cocktail, which will be reported as cost of goods sold. As a result, we expect our gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter to be the lowest of the year. We are also updating our 2021 R&D guidance to be in the range of $2.55 billion to $2.6 billion. The change to the guidance range is related to updated phasing of expenses and lower spend on REGEN-COV. Looking ahead, we will continue to make investments into both our commercial business and our broad pipeline for long-term growth. In particular, we expect to advance critically important development programs in 2022, including the late-stage studies for the LAG-3 Libtayo combo, BCMA by CD3 and C5 along with branded comparators, as George mentioned earlier, in advancing programs with our collaborators. In conclusion, we're pleased with the third quarter as we invest in our robust pipeline to drive sustained long-term growth. I will now turn the call back to Justin.
Justin Holko: Thank you, Bob. Didi, that concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call for Q&A. . Please go ahead, Didi.
Operator: . Our first question comes from Geoff Porges of SVB Leerink.
Geoffrey Porges: Congratulations on the really remarkable results and the outlook. George, perhaps I could ask you about the costims. We've been wondering when we're going to see the first data for the CD28 costims. Could you clarify exactly what we should expect to see next year? And from which combinations? And then just related to that, just these coming up, and there's a lot of discussion about 4-1BB. Could you clarify why you chose to pursue CD28 for your costims rather than 4-1BB?
George Yancopoulos: Yes. As we indicated, we'll be hopefully providing data in the coming year, and it all depends on how the trials progress. Obviously, one has to deal with combination trials where one is dose escalating. And so those are what are limiting getting to effective doses and so forth. In terms of the choices, it all dependent on the science. Our various studies preclinically and in humanized animal models, which show that it was, in our minds, it made most sense to initiate our efforts with the CD28 costim approach.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Raymond of Piper Sandler.
Christopher Raymond: I guess maybe more of a macro question. I know the ink is hardly even dry, I guess, on some of the prescription drug pricing framework negotiations and the write-up that's a company that from Congress. But this is something I'm sure you guys are watching closely. And obviously, any changes to Medicare Part B is potentially impactful to your business. Just any thoughts here on the impact to EYLEA, especially when considering the cap on out-of-pocket spending that's been proposed and discussed?
Leonard Schleifer: So Chris, you're right. The ink isn't dry. Some of the bill has been written in disappearing ink and some is in changing ink, but -- so it's hard to get a fix on it. I would say -- as I understand the bill and based on the most recent update, the cap on expenditures is limited to Part D, as in David, drugs. So it would not affect Part B, as in boy. I think I've got that right as I said -- as you said, the ink is really not dry. I will say that, generally speaking, it is quite remarkable just from my personal perspective, that the industry that is most responsible for getting the country in the world out of the pandemic in as best shape as we can is the source of such great attack. But fortunately, I think that some rational heads have prevailed and the most draconian ideas have been written in that disappearing ink.
Operator: Our next question comes from Yaron Werber of Cowen and Company.
Yaron Werber: Congrats on the team on a great quarter. Really just a quick one actually on the pozelimab and cemdisiran combo. I'd already mentioned some potential combo treatment studies, PNH and MG. Again, some of the other C5s, really kind of wanted to ask a little bit about how you're thinking about real-world use of this one. I know there's a lot of movement in -- especially the MG space. Is this something that we should expect to compete maybe more with Soliris? Or are you thinking a little bit further up the line against IVIG or some of the FcRns? Just kind of want to get your thoughts there.
George Yancopoulos: Yes. I mean we are hoping that this is going to turn out to be the best-in-class in terms of efficacy and also in terms of convenience for these disease categories. So yes, we're thinking about and depending on how the landscape evolves, that, that could be the opportunity that we would be going after.
Operator: Our next question comes from Josh Schimmer of Evercore ISI.
Joshua Schimmer: For the high-dose aflibercept Phase III studies, what signals are you looking for a potential filing as OCD sickness benefit alone insufficient to move forward. Is that going to be under a new BLA or an SBLA? And as such, how do you think that would fall under proposed drug pricing legislation and whether it would reset the clock for that product?
Leonard Schleifer: Yes. I'll comment on the regulatory assets and George can comment maybe on the design aspects. But at the moment, we don't think this would be a new BLA, and this would be part of the -- this would likely be an SBLA, George?
George Yancopoulos: Yes. Basically, we are, as you said, we're looking, of course, to look at differences in terms of anatomic improvements, but the trial is a noninferiority study. Where we're going to be testing is whether patients that are being treated at a dramatically increased interval do as well as regular dose EYLEA had an 8-week interval. So it's going to depend on hopefully seeing that substantially higher numbers of patients are going to be able to be treated at extended dose intervals compared to the 2-milligram dose while achieving similar visual acuity effects.
Operator: Our next question comes from Carter Gould of Barclays.
Carter Gould: Excellent results, guys. I wanted to ask on REGN14256, I guess, the new running partner for imdevimab. And if development was really in response to a specific shift you're seeing in the variants or lower efficacy? Or if you were looking to optimize on other domains? And I guess, in responding to that, could you also address kind of your expectations for running studies, conducting studies with a, I guess, a lower background rate of hospitalization?
George Yancopoulos: Yes, all good and somewhat complicated questions. Right now, obviously, as we've said, our cocktail remains active against all the known variants of concern that have emerged and created issues for other antibodies and so forth. However, we want to be prepared. So we're creating a complementary cocktail that if ever variants would arise that would raise problems for our current cocktail, we would have a complementary cocktail that the way we designed it would hopefully be unaffected by the same types of mutations. So it's to be prepared for that possibility that as the virus continues to evolve, we might need a cocktail that might not be sensitive to the same mutations as the first cocktail. But the current cocktail is still active against the variants of concern. Yes. There's a lot of questions in terms of how to design the study, where to do it, depending on rates of hospitalization and rates of infection. So these are the complications that we've had to navigate throughout this pandemic, as you might remember. And throughout this pandemic, we have managed to carry out the largest COVID-19 program for treatment and for prevention using antibodies. And we hope that, that all the knowledge that we gained from learning how to navigate changing, fluctuating infection rates and hospitalization rates and so forth, we can continue to take advantage of that and continue to carry out our program efficiently and as quickly as possible.
Leonard Schleifer: Yes. Let me just add to that and emphasize what George has said in his earlier remarks, which is that a lot of what we see as the big future need is in the pre-exposure prophylaxis. And that pre-exposure prophylaxis is likely not to go away because of the ongoing infections, the breakthrough infections that still occur in fully vaccinated people. Mind you, with the orals coming, we'll see whether they actually get to the United States. They do have some safety and efficacy issues as a class so far. They have not demonstrated the comparable core study comparisons, notwithstanding the kind of efficacy that monoclonals have delivered nor have they satisfied so many people's satisfaction, the safety concerns around using ImmunoGen perhaps okay for short term. But when you're getting into longer-term prophylaxis of the immunocompromised, which is where George mentioned, we have a lot of work ongoing. It's really important to remember that we expect to have -- our molecules should be able to be given quite less frequently, I think, one might expect because you're looking at a prophylaxis mode. And we think that they should, based on the evidence we have, delivered really rather remarkable efficacy in that setting as they already have in the non-immunocompromised. So as the market transitions to a prophylaxis mode, we see an ongoing demand and need, which we're preparing to meet for monoclonal cocktail therapy.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kennen MacKay of RBC Capital Markets.
Kennen MacKay: First, let me say to Len that I got your commentary towards political or rather governmental purchases of the REGEN-COV antibody cocktail. Thank you for being the voice of science and reason here. Maybe for my question, I have actually really admired your BD strategy, which shows a lot of awareness recognizing areas of expertise, but also limitations and looking to be in partnerships and licensing to outsource the latter. I was wondering what you're really interested now on the BD front, if there are any technologies that are jumping out as additional areas of opportunity for the company? And then sort of partial to that, whether you are at all interested in this newly emerging field of protein degradation and protein degraders, as Oncology targets?
Leonard Schleifer: George should take this. He's been the architect of the scientific underpinnings of our BD strategy and having a remarkable vision to be able to integrate that with our core expertise, George?
George Yancopoulos: Well, yes, I think if we were looking to get into new technologies and have new relationships, I don't think we would be telling you about them at this time.
Kennen MacKay: Wait, George. Could you comment on your prior strategy on how siRNA and ?
George Yancopoulos: Well, I think, yes, what Len referring to is I think that the whole team, the whole company at many levels from the business development group through -- the science research folks through our premanufacturing group has done a spectacular job of pivoting us from a solely biologics company to a genetic medicines company. What we've managed to do is starting with our Regeneron Genetics Center is create what we believe is perhaps the world's most powerful technology to identify new genetic targets based on our sequencing of almost 2 million individuals, all linked to electronic digital records.  That allows us to understand, we think, more powerfully than anybody else, the role of genetic variation, both in disease protection and causation, which have led to a whole series of new disease targets for both protection and causation. And for those, some of those are addressable by biologics and they're part of our existing approaches with biologics, but we had to use new approaches. And for those purposes, we started creating some of these important outside alliances and collaborations with companies like Alnylam for the siRNA approaches, we talked a little bit about and with Intellia with CRISPR-based approaches. Many of these, we've been able to build and create and take them to another level based on our very productive collaborations with these 2 great companies that we're now collaborating with. And we also invested enormously internally in terms of building our own gene therapy approaches. So we believe that we're positioning ourselves to become leaders for the foreseeable future over the next decade or so in the genetic medicine space. It's becoming an increasingly important and larger part of our portfolio. It's almost a whole separate company, we believe, in terms of the opportunities and the value that it generates. While we're maintaining our leadership position with biologics, not only with classical antibodies but also with bispecifics and all sorts of engineered formats of biologics. So I think it's been a tremendous job by our entire team and organization to essentially create this entirely new capability.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ronny Gal of Alliance Bernstein.
Aaron Gal: So following on the last question, can you comment a little bit about when we can see your first kind of CRISPR-based technology in a trial that you run coming into the clinic? Will it be in 2022 or 2023? And then with this full additional company, should we expect the R&D cost to continue to rise roughly at the rate they've historically been?
George Yancopoulos: Okay. I'll remind you that I believe we announced last quarter, our first CRISPR results which were the first obtained by anybody in history in terms of using a systemic CRISPR-based therapy to actually modify genes within human beings. It was an incredibly successful study that we did in collaboration with Intellia. It was the first-ever systemic investigational CRISPR-based gene knockout approach. And in the first set of patients that we treated, we show that a single dose of this CRISPR-based therapy led to very dramatic and dose-dependent reductions in the target protein coming from the target gene. I think that the world viewed this as incredibly exciting data. I believe we announced it in June of '21. And I think it's just the beginning of a very large program. We have about 20 preclinical programs now under evaluation that will be rolling out in terms of going into the clinic and producing clinical results over the next couple of years.
Robert Landry: And Ronny, let me punctuate, right? So we'll give kind of guidance in our fourth quarter earnings in early February. I will tell you, if you look at our kind of run rate this year, R&D relative to 2020, we're coming out at roughly a 7% increase if you take the midpoint of my guidance. And I guess my word of caution is a lot of that's heavy REGEN-COV in 2020. So we're going up against the big REGEN-COV number in 2020 as compared to what we incurred in 2021. So that 7% is, I'd say, artificially light compared to where we're going to eventually end up and we do give that guidance. So I just want to make sure people are not kind of doing same year run rates as they're seeing in 2021.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Charlie  on for Matthew. Can you please comment on the Libtayo activities and the commercial dynamics, given the relatively modest kind of quarter-to-quarter growth?
Marion McCourt: Sure, Charlie. This is Marion. Let me take that. First off, we have great ambition, of course, for Libtayo. As I mentioned, the bulk of our sales today are from our launch of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Understandably, our more recent launches have brought us again into derm with basal cell carcinoma, where Libtayo is very quickly becoming the standard of care for appropriate patients based on its clinical profile and based on, obviously, patients unfortunately fail with hedgehog inhibitors, which also can be really difficult to tolerate. So we're very pleased with how that launch is going early days. Most important, however, is our lung launch. The initial launch we had in monotherapy is understandably for a smaller target group of patients. We do believe, however, though, the experience that physicians are gaining with Libtayo in first-line monotherapy treatment is very, very important and bodes well for when we hopefully have the larger indication approved for chemo combo. And that as many of you are aware is a much larger population of patients, perhaps 4- to 5-fold more patients, and we certainly look forward to potentially being able to launch that larger indication in lung.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas of Truist.
Robyn Karnauskas: I was wondering if you can satisfy a little bit of my curiosity about the news flow coming out of your Intellia partnership. I guess the first question I'd ask is in the event that they'll be hosting next year, in the first quarter, how much durability data might we get for TTR? And then, George, you mentioned the additional indication over the next few years that you'll be going into. When are we going to be hearing about those, would we hear about a lot of them in the beginning of the year or would we hear about them over the course of the year, I know Intellia is of huge investor interest as well as mine.
Leonard Schleifer: I wonder if we shouldn't give Intellia the opportunity to give that kind of guidance, Robyn.
George Yancopoulos: I'm sure that might be the approach.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alethia Young of Cantor.
George Yancopoulos: Before you get with that question. I do think just to help Robyn out a little bit, I think one really important point is, yes, as the data continues to mature and certainly, we expect excellent duration data coming out over time and so forth. But I think we all have to recognize that this represents the first true validation of this entire field and approach. And our ability working with Intellia using our specific approach to actually turn it from dream into reality. And this obviously dramatically increases the probability of success of all of our future programs based on our collaborative technology with Intellia, including both knockout and insertion approaches, and we have to, of course, highlight and point out the lack of such proof of concept and success with any other approaches to date. And I think that, that really distinguishes our collaboration with Intellia. And obviously, should adjust the risk profile for all of our programs going forward, which, as Len said, hopefully, we and Intellia will be giving more resolution on going forward.
Leonard Schleifer: Go ahead, Alethia.
Alethia Young: Congrats on the quarter. I just had a question about kind of, obviously, you have very robust AOE data with Dupixent. Can you just talk a little bit about how you think about the market opportunity there? And like how -- what diagnosis is like there and how you can potentially expand that?
Marion McCourt: Sure. So we're very excited about the possibility of launching Dupixent also for eosinophilic esophagitis. As George was describing, there's tremendous unmet need in the marketplace in patients who truly are suffering and often end up in the emergency room with difficult procedures to try to remedy for the short-term, some of the difficult symptoms they have. The size of patient population for those who are undergoing recurrent treatment is about 48,000. And then obviously, there are patients who are entering the system beyond that. But probably just as a starter number that 48,000 to 50,000 who have failed multiple treatments is the core group. And then we will extend beyond that to probably about another 150,000 patients with EoE, who also have earned the need of treatment. But the failure group, obviously, of 50,000 is the most severe.
Justin Holko: Didi, we have time for two more quick questions.
Operator: Our next question is from Esther Rajavelu of UBS.
Esther Rajavelu: I have one on EYLEA, perhaps a multipart question. Can you give us some details on use among diabetics versus nondiabetic patients? And is the uptake among diabetics type to more consistent use among treated patients? Or are you onboarding new diabetics? And lastly, anything you can share on NPDR versus diabetic macular edema patients would be helpful as well.
Marion McCourt: Sure. So let me give you a little bit of background and some characterization. Certainly, our indications for diabetic eye disease are the fastest growing in terms of new patients proportionately coming into the treatment paradigm. We also see a growth in the diabetes treatment population for EYLEA opposite, for example, wet AMD. So now our wet AMD treatment is under 60% of the total utilization of EYLEA in the U.S. marketplace. The specific growth on diabetic eye disease by indication, it's difficult to give you the exact breakdown, but we are very optimistic on even the early efforts we see in market based on our new unbranded direct-to-consumer TV campaign, which is really educating diabetic patients broadly on the importance of having their vision checked, making sure it's part of the regular check-in as patients with diabetes have other areas that they standardly review and make sure of their care. Eye disease has often been neglected with very disastrous situations of vision loss that can't be corrected. So we see that as a really important area and one that will fuel diabetic eye disease treatment broadly. But even today, and before we embarked upon that program, we see it as a high growth indication.
Justin Holko: Didi, we have time for one more question.
Operator: Our last question comes from Yatin Suneja of Guggenheim Partners.
Yatin Suneja: Congrats on the quarter of good performance. Just quickly on the complement efforts. Can you just talk about other CNS or Neurology applications with either the monotherapy or the combination? And then with respect to the siRNA approach, could we take that -- could you take that into the eye and what the long-term vision there is?
George Yancopoulos: Yes, we're not going to say too much about your first question. But in terms of your second question, absolutely. And so when we establish this relationship with Alnylam in terms of using siRNA, it was actually directed towards 3 separate areas. So really was 3 separate collaborations. The one in the first that we thought that we'd be moving the most rapidly into the clinic and that has turned out to be the case were with liver targets, both sort of more conventional targets like the C5, but also targets that were coming from our own pipeline like the HSD target that we talked about. And that -- those are all moving along forward and we think a very exciting fashion as we've discussed. Another key area that you just opened up, which is still preclinically, but we're hoping to eventually move into the clinic is targeting the eye targets with siRNAs. And that's really a very important area for us, and it was a very important separate part of the entire Alnylam collaboration. And the third really critical foundational part of our collaboration with Alnylam involved using siRNAs to target in the brain. And that's also moving forward in a very exciting fashion, and we'll be talking a lot more about that going forward. So really, it's a 3 sort of pillar program, liver targets, eye targets and CNS targets. We're very excited and moving forward on all of them. And as we had guided early on, the first set of targets, of course, would be in the liver and then we'd be moving into the other 2 areas as rapidly as possible.
Justin Holko: Great. Thanks, everyone. That will conclude our call. Bob Landry and the IR team will be available today to answer any additional questions you may have. Thanks, everyone, and stay safe. Goodbye.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-08-05 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Tamia, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Justin Holko, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.
Justin Holko: Thank you, Tamia. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening to everyone listening around the globe. Thank you for your interest in Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, and welcome to the second quarter 2021 conference call. An archive of this webcast will be available on our website. Joining me today on the call are Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; Dr. George Yancopoulos, Co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer; Marion McCourt, Executive Vice President and Head of Commercial; and Bob Landry, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A. I would also like to remind you that remarks made on today's call include forward-looking statements about Regeneron. Such statements may include, but are not limited to, those related to Regeneron and its products in this financial forecast and guidance, development programs and related anticipated milestones, collaborations, finances, regulatory matters, payer coverage and reimbursement issues, intellectual property, pending litigation and other proceedings as well as competition. Each forward-looking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected in that statement. A more complete description of these and other material risks can be found in Regeneron's filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2021, which we filed with SEC earlier today. Regeneron does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. In addition, please note that GAAP and non-GAAP measures will be discussed in today's call. Information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP is available in our financial results press release, which can be accessed on our website. Once our call concludes, Bob Landry and the IR team will be available to answer further questions. With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.
Leonard Schleifer: Thank you, Justin, and thanks to everyone joining today's call. We had an outstanding performance across the enterprise in the second quarter. Not only did our base business performed exceptionally well with strong growth from EYLEA, Dupixent and Libtayo, but we also delivered 1.25 million doses of REGEN-COV for the United States government, fulfilling the entire supply contract with BARDA. We also continue to advance multiple programs across our innovative R&D pipeline with several important readouts. Starting with EYLEA. Global net sales were over $2.3 billion growing 33% compared to the prior year, reflecting recovery from the COVID pandemic impact on the second quarter of 2020. In the U.S., sales grew 28% EYLEA continues to set a high bar in terms of efficacy, safety and convenience. Dupixent also performed exceptionally well this quarter with global sales of $1.5 billion and growth of 59%. This quarter also marks the first time we and Sanofi exceeded $1 billion in U.S. Dupixent quarterly net sales. There remains considerable room for further growth from our in-line indications as well as from potential new opportunities, such as in chronic spontaneous urticaria with CSU where last week, we announced positive Phase III study results. We have additional Phase III readouts in prurigo nodularis, eosinophilic esophagitis and pediatric atopic dermatitis later this year, which could advance our conviction of Dupixent is a pipeline in a product to address numerous inflammatory diseases. In oncology, the entire global net sales were $117 million and grew 46% with meaningful growth contributions from both inside and outside the United States. We also announced this morning that in a large Phase III pivotal study in non-small cell lung cancer, Libtayo, combined with standard chemotherapy reduced the risk of death by nearly 30% and compared to chemotherapy alone. We are eager to share these data with regulatory agencies, which if approved, would dramatically increase the number of lung cancer eligible patients who could be treated with Libtayo. We also begin to see meaningful results from our Regeneron Genetics medicines pipeline. With our collaborators at Intellia, we showed the first ever proof-of-concept in vivo genome editing with NTLA-2001, investigation of CRISPR therapy for transthyretin amyloidosis or ATTR amyloidosis. This proof-of-concept study utilizing systemically administered CRISPR technology for genome modification suggests this approach could have broad applicability across a wide range of diseases. Beyond Intellia, our collaborations with Alnylam and Decibel are helping to form a whole new pipeline for next-generation therapies beyond our broad and diverse antibody pipeline. The second quarter represented another landmark in our efforts to combat COVID-19, which unfortunately, despite considerable rates of vaccination, continues to be a major global health service with rising cases and emerging variants. In addition to fulfilling our entire supply contract with the United States government, we were able to secure emergency use authorization updates for our lower 1.2 gram subcutaneous dose as well as for post-exposure prophylaxis for certain appropriate patients who are at high risk for disease. Utilization is increasing ready and currently more than 50,000 doses ordered per week. We also announced that the U.K. recovery study showed a 20% reduction in risk of death in hospitalized patients would not mounted their own immune response. With these results, together with supporting data from Regeneron study in hospitalized patients that George will discuss momentarily, REGEN-COV has the potential if so authorized to be the first treatment be using a wide spectrum of COVID-19 disease settings from prevention through the hospitalized setting. In summary, our core business is strong and continues to diversify, and our innovative pipeline continues to advance, positioning Regeneron well long-term growth. Now I will turn the call over to George.
George Yancopoulos: Thank you, Len. We have a lot to talk about this morning, which is all possible because of our Regeneron colleagues who have been working nonstop throughout this pandemic. And unfortunately, the world is still in the throes of this global COVID-19 pandemic. As the number of infected individuals in the United States are climbing again with nearly 100,000 Americans becoming infected every day. Therefore, I will start with Regeneron with REGEN-COV, our monoclonal antibody cocktail for COVID-19. In June, the REGEN-COV Emergency Use Authorization, or EUA, was updated to include the lower 1.2 gram REGEN-COV dose with both intravenous and subcutaneous administration for nonhospitalized patients. This EUA was supported by Phase III data showing that the 1.2 gram dose reduce risk of hospitalization or death by 70%. Just last week, the EUA was further expanded to include utilization in post-exposure prophylaxis for COVID-19 in certain populations, and also allows for repeated monthly dosing of REGEN-COV for high-risk patients, such as the immunocompromised who are at high risk of ongoing exposure to infected individuals in the same institutional setting. This latest authorization makes REGEN-COV the only treatment that is available for both treating infected individuals and also preventing infection in certain settings. We would like to emphasize that REGEN-COV is not a substitute for vaccination. Still under review by the FDA are additional data, which we believe could broaden the prevention application to pre-exposure prophylaxis as well as to extend the treatment paradigm to hospitalized patients. The details of Part A of our Phase III prophylaxis study in which we assessed efficacy and safety of subcutaneous REGEN-COV in preventing infection among previously uninfected individuals has just been published today in the New England Journal of Medicine. We believe there is enormous unmet need to try to protect immunocomprised individuals who have not responded to the vaccine and we hope that the FDA will agree that our data will support an authorization in this pre-exposure prophylaxis setting. For hospitalized patients, we recently reported that REGEN-COV tested as part of the Oxford University Phase III RECOVERY study met its primary outcome, reducing risk of death by 20% in hospitalized COVID-19 patients lacking immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Data from our own smaller study in hospitalized COVID-19 patients showed similar conclusions with 35% reduction in overall mortality in this study, which was limited to earlier-stage hospitalized patients with no oxygen or low oxygen support. These collective data from recovery and from our study in hospitalized patients have been shared with regulators. In addition, we are on track to complete the REGEN-COV BLA submissions in the second half of 2021. Outside of the United States, our collaborator Roche obtained emergency or temporary pandemic use authorizations for our COVID-19 antibody cocktail, known as Ronapreve outside the United States in more than 20 countries across the European Union, India, Switzerland and Canada, with more authorizations expected soon. Japan was the first country to grant formal regulatory approval to our antibody cocktail for COVID-19. Finally, REGEN-COV retains potent activity against all known variants of interest, including the Delta variant. For patients at high risk of serious consequences, including many with an inadequate response to vaccines, REGEN-COV could be an important option to patients and their physicians for the foreseeable future. Moving on to ophthalmology. In the coming months, we expect data from the Phase II study of high dose of libracept in wet AMD. This readout will consist of efficacy assessments on drawing in other anatomical measures as well as safety on the 8-milligram and the currently approved 2-milligram of libracept dose and an 8-week dosing interval. In the 106 patients dosed in the open-label Phase II to date, we have not seen any concerning safety signals. While the smaller study will not be definitive on durability measures, the Phase II data will help provide insights into the larger Phase III studies, which are testing high-dose aflibercept dosing intervals out to 12 and 16 weeks. I'm pleased to announce that the Phase III studies in DME and AMD have completed enrollment, allowing for Phase III data next year. Moving on to Dupixent in our immunology and inflammation portfolio. Just last week, we announced that a Phase III trial in chronic spontaneous urticaria, where CSU, met primary and all key 24-week secondary endpoints, showing Dupixent reduced itch and hive activity scores by nearly half. This is the fifth disease in which Dupixent demonstrated positive pivotal trial results and efficacy in this disease raises the possibility of IL-4 and IL-13 and are critical drivers in diseases not traditionally sought to be driven by type 2 inflammation. We plan to report results from a second trial in CSU patients who are not benefiting from the approved standard of care biologic in early 2022. This positive readout in CSU is continuing to build on Dupixent's efficacy and safety demonstrated across other inflammatory diseases. In the upcoming months, we also expect results from our confirmatory Phase IIIb study in adult and adolescent patients with eosinophilic esophagitis as well as readout of a Phase III study in prurigo nodularis. Thus far, Dupixent is approved in patients as young as 6 years old in atopic dermatitis and 12 years old in asthma. Later this year, we will report data from a Phase III study in preschool children as young as 6 months up to 5 years of age suffering from atopic dermatitis. In asthma, we anticipate a regulatory decision in October for children aged 6 to 11 years old in the United States. Moving to our anti interleukin-33 antibody Itupikumab. Results of the Phase II study in COPD patients were recently published in Lancet Respiratory Medicine. All the trial exhibited strong trends in its primary endpoint of exacerbation reduction in the overall population, which did not meet statistical significance, a prespecified subgroup analysis of former smokers with COPD is what accounted for the overall benefit with no negative subset in the remaining population. In the prespecified former smoker subgroup, Itupikumab demonstrated a 42% reduction in exacerbations and improvement in lung function of 0.09 liters compared to placebo with both endpoints reaching nominal statistical significance. Moreover, the publication includes genetic analyses that support a protective role for interleukin-33 in COPD. Based on these results, we and Sanofi are assessing the potential of Itupikumab in two Phase III studies focus on the former smoker population with COPD. I should also remind you that we have two ongoing studies we face -- two ongoing Phase III studies with Dupixent in a complementary COPD population. We are also progressing our novel approaches to treat allergies by using cocktails of monoclonal antibodies to directly bind and inactivate allergens, which have produced robust results in Phase II studies. Results of the initial Phase III study of our antibody cocktail against virtue allergy caused by the Betv1 allergen are expected later this year. The first Phase III study of an antibody cocktail for cat allergy caused by the Feld1 allergen, is now open for enrollment. We are enthusiastic about these innovative additions to our inflammation and immunology portfolio. In oncology, following its recent approvals in the United States or certain first-line non-small cell lung cancer in certain advanced basal cell carcinoma patients, Libtayo was subsequently approved in the EU for these settings. Furthermore, compelling overall survival data in second-line cervical cancer patients were presented at an ESMO virtual planar in May with the regulatory submissions to the FDA and EMA planned for this year. For lung cancer, we are pleased to report today that in our Phase III trial comparing with Tylus standard chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone the independent data monitoring committee recommended halting the trial for efficacy at the second interim analysis. Libtayo plus chemotherapy significantly improved overall survival as well as progression-free surveil compared to chemotherapy alone in first-line locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. With these data, Libtayo is now the second PD-1 targeting antibody that has been able to demonstrate significant overall survival benefit both as a monotherapy as well as in combination with chemotherapy for treating advanced lung cancer. With this validation, Libtayo provides an important foundation for a broad and multifaceted approach to address the great unmet need that patients with cancer in general and lung cancer, in particular, still face. In addition to our Libtayo monotherapy and chemo combination opportunities in lung cancer, we are developing several bispecifics. Our EGFR by CD28 costim and Libtayo combination is in dose escalation for lung and other advanced cancers. Our METxMET bispecific antibody is enrolling non-small cell lung cancer patients with a broad selection of patients, including MET exon 14 gene mutation, gene amplification and/or elevated MET protein expression. And as we introduced at our ASCO investor event, our first antibody drug conjugate METxMET ADC, is poised to enter the clinic in the coming months with a focus on patients with net overexpressing cancers, including lung cancer, where MET over expression occurs in as many as 25% patients. In terms of building on the potential of Tylus with combinations in skin cancer, we recently announced new clinical data for the combination Tyle with Fianlimab our LAG-3 inhibitor, in advanced melanoma at the ASCO annual meeting in June. The combination demonstrated a 67% response rate in PD-1 or PDL-1 naive patients with potential for a more favorable safety profile than with anti-CTLA-4 PD-1 combinations. We plan to initiate a Phase III study of Fianlimab and Libtayo as a first-line treatment for advanced melanoma in 2022. Ovarian cancer is the first tumor type for which we are clinically testing three powerful combinant approaches. First, our MUC16xCD3 bispecific with Libtayo, where we hope to share initial data next year. Next, our MUC16xCD28 costim bispecific with Libtayo. And third, our novel combination of the CD3 and costim bispecifics for which we have now dosed the first patient. This latter combination of two bispecifics of two different classes has potential to be a novel and disruptive approach for the treatment of solid tumors. Rounding out my commentary in solid tumors, our PSMAxCD28 program in prostate cancer continues in dose escalation with Libtayo, and we hope to share initial data next year. As we mentioned previously, we are planning on introducing a PSMAxCD3 bispecific to the clinic later this year, providing another unique experimental combination for prostate cancer treatment. The tumor viewed as nonresponsive currently to available immunotherapies. Moving on to hematologic cancers and starting with lymphoma. Odronextamab, our CD23 bispecific has demonstrated encouraging efficacy and durability of responses in hard-to-treat patient emulations. We have resumed enrollment in our potentially pivotal Phase II program in follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, with lifting of the partial clinical hold following protocol amendments for a modified step-up dosing protocol. Later this year, we plan to initiate testing of the exome subcutaneous formulation. And next year, we plan to initiate the Phase III program as well as combination trials with our lymphoma-specific costim bispecific. In multiple myeloma, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific is on track to complete enrollment potentially pivotal Phase II study next year. We will also initiate studies evaluating a subcutaneous formulation in combinations with standard of care. With our unique position to mix and match multiple modalities and targets with the goal of deepening the responses we are already observing with our BCMAxCD3 bispecific we are on track to start a combination study with a costim bispecific for multiple myeloma next year. I would like to conclude with our Regeneron Genetic Medicines efforts. As you know, these efforts start with our Regeneron Genetics Center and its ability to genetically identify and validate new disease targets and is coupled with emerging gene-based therapeutic solutions to address these targets, including CRISPR-based technologies with our collaborator Intellia, siRNA technologies with Alnylam as well as viral gene debility technologies we are developing in-house. The Regeneron Genetics Center continues to emerge as a world leader in human sequencing and in defining genetic variants that can either be protective or causative for human disease. Most recently identifying a major new gene target that protects against obesity as described in a high-profile publication in Science last month. For this newly discovered target, we are deploying several strategies to develop new classes of potential therapeutics to fight obesity and potentially type two diabetes. In terms of progress with our gene-based therapeutic approaches, together with the Intellia, we recently announced positive clinical data for the first ever systemically delivered CRISPR-based gene knockout in human patients. In the first 6 patients with transthyretin amyloidosis with TTR amyloidosis, a single systemic treatment led to dose-dependent reduction in the disease-causing protein with no serious adverse events observed through day 28. This proof of asset clinical data increases the probability of success for both our knockout as well as our insertion CRISPR-based programs, unlocking the potential of many future possibilities for Intellia and Regeneron. Currently, we're evaluating more than 20 preclinical programs under this collaboration, and Regeneron has the rights to develop up to 15 in vivo products with Intellia. Regarding our efforts with Alnylam, on an siRNA for a novel NASH target identified by the Regeneron Genetic Center, we are hoping to see initial healthy volunteer data by the end of this year. This 2-part first-in-human study is now enrolling NASH patients. We are currently evaluating about 20 preclinical programs under this collaboration and Regeneron has rights to develop up to 30 products with Alnylam. With that brief glimpse into the future of genetic medicines, I would like to turn the call over to Marion.
Marion McCourt: Thank you, George. Our business performance in the second quarter reflects robust momentum, competitive strength and focused execution across our commercial portfolio. Our in-line medicines continue to thrive, and our ongoing launches are progressing to plan, providing a platform for diversified growth. First, I will highlight our efforts supporting REGEN-COV, our COVID-19 antibody cocktail, which is available under emergency use authorization by the FDA. In the second quarter, U.S. net sales were $2.6 billion as a result of fulfilling our second contract with the U.S. government. There is significant ongoing need for effective treatments against COVID-19. As Len said, REGEN-COV utilization has recently accelerated and is now trending well over 50,000 doses ordered weekly. Uptake is driven by growing recognition of the importance of antibody cocktail treatment, focused educational efforts and competitive dynamics favoring REGEN-COV. We continue to work closely with all key stakeholders to increase REGEN-COV utilization and support hospitals and administration sites to reduce bottlenecks. The REGEN-COV antibody cocktail is both FDA authorized and NIH recommended and retains potency against known variants. We've also expanded our efforts following the recent post-exposure prophylaxis authorization, the first for an antibody therapy in this setting. Beyond REGEN-COV, our core portfolio performed very well in the second quarter. Starting with EYLEA. Second quarter global net sales grew 33% year-over-year to over $2.3 billion. In the U.S., EYLEA net sales grew 28% year-over-year to $1.42 billion, driven by underlying demand, category share gains and a favorable comparison versus the second quarter of 2020. EYLEA is the anti-VEGF category growth leader and preferred treatment option. As a reminder, EYLEA sets a high bar for efficacy and safety with more than 40 million injections administered worldwide, in a therapeutic category where patient vision and well-being are paramount. EYLEA continues to capture market and competitive share securing nearly 50% of the overall category and 75% of the branded category. Overall demand is improving with increased patient flow and return to pre-pandemic levels of new patient visits. Patients who may have delayed seeing the retina specialists are now seeking treatment. With this backdrop, we are accelerating promotional efforts to address the significant unmet needs in diabetic eye disease. We are confident in Regeneron's ongoing leadership position in retinal diseases, based on EYLEA's competitive advantages and future opportunities, including our high-dose program. Turning to Libtayo, where second quarter global net sales grew to $117 million, and the U.S. net sales grew 23% to $78 million. As expected, at this early stage of new indication launches, the vast majority of sales come from advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, where Libtayo is the number one systemic treatment despite new in-class competition. Our launches in both advanced non-small cell lung cancer and basal cell carcinoma or BCC are progressing to plan. In BCC, Libtayo brand awareness is high among treating oncologists. We are encouraged by meaningful patient starts in the second quarter as Libtayo becomes a standard of care. We're also making considerable progress in lung cancer where efforts are focused on establishing Libtayo in our monotherapy indication and will be an important foundation for our potential future chemotherapy combination launch, which will be based on the data announced today. Our expanded field force is now fully deployed and securing early successes with treating physicians. We're raising brand awareness, progressing formulary positioning and payer coverage, lung cancer thought leaders recognized Libtayo's clinical differentiation, highlighting the rapid response rates and efficacy in patients with clinically stable brain metastases or high PD-L1 expression. In this highly competitive market, we remain focused on differentiating Libtayo and increasing physician experience. Today's exciting chemotherapy combination news has the potential to dramatically expand the patient opportunity for Libtayo in non-small cell lung cancer. Turning now to Evkeeza, which was launched earlier this year in ultra-rare homozygous familial hypercholesteremia. Key thought leaders recognize the benefits of Evkeeza which delivers an efficacy, safety and tolerability in a market where many patients have struggled to stay on therapy in the face of life-threatening LDL-cholesterol levels. We're encouraged by early initiations across switch and new-to-category patients and can see a future where Evkeeza becomes the standard of care. Moving to Dupixent. Global net sales in the second quarter were $1.5 billion, growing 59% compared to the prior year. In the U.S., net sales grew 49% to $1.15 billion driven by broad-based growth across all approved indications. New patient starts are steadily growing and are above pre-COVID levels. In atopic dermatitis, prescribing trends are strong across a spectrum of moderate to severe disease including adolescent and pediatric patients. There is significant and sustained growth opportunity for Dupixent in a market where it is the #1 dermatologist prescribed biologic. This is based on its well-established efficacy and safety profile, broad label for patients is dealing is 6 years old and unmatched real-world physician and patient experience. In addition, as George outlined, we see an exciting future opportunities in dermatology, starting with CSU. Dupixent is the leading biologic and respiratory disease poised to capture meaningful growth now and in the future. Our asthma results outpace recent competitive biologic launches. Launch preparations are underway in the pediatric asthma setting the first regulatory approval expected in the U.S. this October. In nasal polyps, there's high demand among ENTs and allergists with patients initiated regardless of prior surgery. In summary, we delivered strong performance across our brands with current and potential future launches on track to deliver sustained growth. Now I'll turn the call over to Bob.
Bob Landry: Thanks, Marion, and good morning and afternoon to everyone listening to the call. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis where applicable. In the second quarter, our core business continued to deliver impressive year-over-year growth bolstered by strong execution across the company to deliver the full $1.25 million dose contract to the U.S. government for REGEN-COV. For the second quarter, total revenues grew 163% year-over-year to $5.1 billion. Excluding revenues related to the COVID-19 antibody cocktail, total revenue grew 22% versus the prior year. Total diluted net income per share grew 260% year-over-year to $25.80 on net income of $2.9 billion. In the second quarter, we recognized $2.6 billion of U.S. REGEN-COV sales, representing the vast majority of revenue related to the delivery of 1.25 million doses to the U.S. government. Due to revenue recognition rules, a residual $34 million of net product sales for doses delivered under this contract will be recorded in the third quarter. Given the delivery of these doses to the U.S. government and current utilization rates we anticipate the current U.S. government supply will be exhausted by the end of the year. We do not expect to record substantial additional sales this year in the U.S. in less the number of cases and related utilization continue to increase exponentially. I will now move to collaboration revenues, which were $955 million in the second quarter of 2021 as compared to $513 million second quarter of 2020. Let me begin with the Roche collaboration. Ex U.S. sales of the COVID antibody cocktail known as Ronapreve, outside of the U.S. were $470 million as reported to us by Roche, we recorded $168 million in Roche collaboration revenue for our share of profits from Roche's sale of Ronapreve, which is now available or approved in more than 20 countries. With new COVID cases on the rise globally, we expect the Ronapreve will continue to be a meaningful revenue contributor in 2021. With regard to our Bayer collaboration. Ex U.S. EYLEA net product sales reported to us by Bayer were $904 million for the second quarter of 2021, representing growth of 41% on a reported basis and 31% on a constant currency basis as a result of broad market recovery and a favorable comparison versus the prior year. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $349 million, of which we recorded $335 million for our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. Finally, total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $438 million in the second quarter of 2021. Our share of the profits from the commercialization of Dupixent and Kevzara was $328 million, which nearly doubled when compared to profits of $172 million in the prior year. Other revenue was $46 million in the second quarter compared to $212 million in the prior year. The decrease is primarily related to nonrecurring reinforce from BARDA in 2020 for development of COVID-19 and an Ebola treatments. We continue to expect 2021 other revenue to be less than half of what was recorded in 2020 on a full year basis. Moving on to our operating expenses. R&D increased 11% year-over-year to $643 million, primarily due to continued clinical development costs for our REGEN-COV antibody cocktail and higher headcount to support our expanding pipeline. Next, SG&A expense increased 21% year-over-year to $365 million due to costs related to COVID-19 related activities, launch investments for Libtayo, growth initiatives for EYLEA and higher headcount. Cost of goods sold increased versus the prior year from $93 million to $514 million, primarily due to REGEN-COV manufacturing costs. Finally, effective tax rate was 17% in the second quarter of 2021, reflecting the impact of REGEN-COV sales, which are taxed at the U.S. statutory rate. Shifting to cash flow and the balance sheet. In the second quarter of 2021, Regeneron generated $478 million in free cash flow and ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities less debt of $5.1 billion. We received the full $2.625 billion of cash associated with completion of our second REGEN-COV contract with the U.S. government in July. As the business continues its strong performance, we are reiterating our capital allocation priorities of investing in internal R&D, funding strategic external R&D partnerships and returning cash to shareholders. Accordingly, in July, we announced a new $1.8 billion expansion of our Tarrytown facilities, primarily directed toward additional internal R&D operations and capabilities. We also continue to advance our next-generation technology partnerships with companies like Intellia and Alnylam, which are beginning to bear fruit as targets get selected and programs move forward into development. Finally, in the second quarter, we repurchased $289 million of our shares, and we remain opportunistic buyers in the market. To conclude, I'd like to provide select updates to our 2021 guidance. A complete summary of our latest full year guidance is available in our press release published earlier this morning. We are updating our full year 2021 guidance for SG&A to be in the range of $1.54 billion to $1.62 billion. The change is related to increased efforts in the second half for REGEN-COV. We are also revising our full year 2021 guidance for R&D to be in the range of $2.65 billion to $2.75 billion. The change is driven by lower-than-expected spend on REGEN-COV. Finally, we now expect our full year 2021 non-GAAP effective tax rate guidance to be in the range of 14% to 16%, driven by higher sales of REGEN-COV, which, as I said, are taxed at the U.S. statutory rate. In conclusion, Regeneron performed exceptionally well in the second quarter with the core business continuing on a strong growth trajectory as we invest in our diverse and differentiated pipeline for long-term sustainable growth. With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Justin.
Justin Holko: Thank you, Bob. Tamia, that concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call for Q&A. To ensure we are able to address as many callers as possible, we will answer one question from each caller prior to moving to the next. Please go ahead, Tamia.
Operator:  Your first question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Chris Raymond: Just on the EMPOWER study guys, we're getting a few questions the comp to KEYTRUDA. I know it's hard to compare across trials, but it's a bit tricky because Empower had both squamous and non-squamous. But your 22-month median OS is right on top of the non-squamous experience for KEYTRUDA. I'm sure you're going to want to save a lot of detail for the full presentation, but can you maybe give us a sense of the balance here between squamous and non-squamous patients?
George Yancopoulos: As you said, I mean, we're going to provide the details in future publication and/or conferences. I think it's important to note, as you said, it's very difficult to compare across studies, done years apart. And especially when we allowed classes of patients that were not previously allowed in other studies and so forth. As you pointed out, the median survival numbers are right on top of each other. But as you also pointed out, we had two different subtypes in this study. I can comment in our preliminary analysis, and these remain to be fully validated and so forth. One of the subtypes our hazard ratio was better than what was observed with the KEYTRUDA study and the other one, it was worse. It's important to point out that these things bounce around in these cross-study comparisons. As you know, in other settings, which you try to do cross country -- cross-study comparisons, for example, when you compare our monotherapy results in the greater than 50% PDL population. It looks like our numbers are substantially better in the skin and particularly the CSCC comparisons they're better. So these things bounce around. It's always hard to do these things. But I think the important thing to point out is that in this field in lung cancer, very few have hit in both monotherapy greater than 50% and in chemo combination all comers. I remind you that Opdivo Jens and most of the PD-L1s did. So right now, the only 2 PD-1 antibodies that standalone, having demonstrated overall survival benefit, both in the monotherapy setting as well as now in the chemo combination setting. And I think this really well positioned Libtayo and across all the studies, I think it's -- the definitive conclusion is that it's a very active molecule that looks at least as active as any other agents out there.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Gavin on for Cory. Just a thought on the last question. In terms of the longer-term outlook for Libtayo in lung specifically, you talked about the IO combo as kind of the differentiating strategy. And I'm just wondering if you're maintaining that position? Or with the results in hand today, that view has changed?
George Yancopoulos: Yes. Well, we think that certainly, we should be competitive right now. The opportunity for this class, which is obviously dominated by KEYTRUDA right now because up until now, it was the only agent that had this strong data across the spectrum of monotherapy and chemo combination. We think that now we can be legitimate competitors here in the lung cancer space. We see our combination opportunities as future growth and differentiator opportunities. But in the short term, we expect to be a viable competitor now with these data. And in the future, we hope to use the combinations to take the standard of care and elevate results to another level.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Your line is open.
Ronny Gal: Question on the immunoco. Can you talk a little bit about the path to establish that antibody cocktail as a treatment for patients or immunocompromised before to before cancer driven and so forth? You need to have full authorization to begin to pursue this. But if we think about the product longer term beyond the current wave of the epidemic, what steps are you making towards establishing it as a long-term part of the treatment paradigm in various diseases?
George Yancopoulos: Yes. As you said, we think that the immunocompromised population which as I'm sure you all know, represents 3% to 4% of the U.S. population, that several million individuals, a variety of studies are showing that somewhere around 50% or more of these individuals do not respond after 2 or even after 3 attempts with the vaccine. And so these people are left without their own antibodies to protect them. So it's a huge unmet need setting where these individuals will not be protected. And as we're all seeing that it's very unlikely that we will be eliminating spread of infections through breakthrough infections, whether it was symptomatic or otherwise throughout the population for these individuals to be able to live normal lives they're going to need protection. And we believe that the most powerful protection is essentially providing them with these surrogate antibodies that our antibody cocktail provides. We already have very strong data, we believe, to support the notion that this agent can be used in chronic prevention settings, and we do intend to continue to explore future study opportunities where we can further enhance on the already existing data that shows that after the first week or so, we seem to obtain similar upwards of 90% protection against infection in individuals who do not have their own antibodies and are being exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. I think that, that is very strong data that bodes very well that this is potentially to be a very important treatment, particularly for these immunocompromised individuals who do not have antibodies on their own.
Leonard Schleifer: Yes. Let me just add that implicit in what George said is we're working with the agency to try and convince them that our data is strong. And the agency, obviously, has a lot on its plate, and it's trying, I think, to sort through whether or not these individuals should try a third dose or not of a vaccine. That has to get sorted out, I think. And the FDA has our data. And as George said, we're looking at ways to enhance our data, but we already believe that in a pre-exposure prophylaxis mode, we have strong data, but it's not been authorized by the agency and it's under review.
Ronny Gal: So you might understand you're seeking a label for chronic treatment of immunocompromised population? And do you think you have the data to obtain such a label?
Leonard Schleifer: So just to be clear, the current authorization allows chronic treatment but allows chronic treatment for people, for example, who are immunocompromised, but are in an institutional setting, working or living in a congress setting where they're exposed to infected individuals we would like to expand that to pre-exposure prophylaxis for the community-acquired infections. That is where immunocompromised people might be able to go out in the community and have some protection. So we do have chronic dosing for the immunocompromised in our current authorization, but that's restricted to this post exposure or ongoing exposure in the known infected people setting, and we're trying to expand that to protect these people in the community setting. It's -- we think the data are strong, but obviously, there's a lot going on and a lot of considerations, as I mentioned before, that need to get sorted out.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with SVB Leerink. Your line is open.
Geoffrey Porges: So many questions. Perhaps one for Marion on EYLEA, a really strong result. And by the way, congratulations on the spectacular quarter. On EYLEA, tremendous return to growth. Can you talk about whether there was any catch-up in the second quarter? Or is this a sustainable revenue run rate going forward? Because it's clearly significantly above where we were expecting. And then perhaps you could just give us a little bit more color on the proportion of AMD and DME.
Marion McCourt: Sure. And thank you, Geoff. Yes, delighted to comment. We did have a very strong quarter and certainly, EYLEA performance was driven by return of market growth and our own share gains versus competition in capturing that market growth. In order, we did see a return of patient flow to offices consistent with the pre-pandemic period. And there also is the consideration of some patients who may have delayed treatment coming back in. So it's a combination of factors but certainly a very strong performance for EYLEA. As well, to your question related to future growth by indication, we do continue to see diabetic eye disease as the indications that have the highest growth trajectory. So that's balancing out our wet AMD business, which is still the majority of roughly 50%, 52%, 55% of overall use of EYLEA.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Cowen. Your line is open.
Yaron Werber: Great. Maybe a question for Marion and Bob relating to REGEN-COV 2. Are you -- in order to get the next U.S. government order, do you -- are you waiting for approval? Or are they just waiting to exhaust our current supply and then reorder?
Leonard Schleifer: Maybe I'll take that question. The contract we have has been fulfilled. And so the government is going to need to decide whether or not they want to have another contract or they want us to switch over to a commercial model which could occur before or after a regular approval as it did with remdesivir. I think a lot of that is going to depend upon the government's assessment of what they think is the most efficient way to get people to use the product. There's been a tremendous acceleration in use our penetration in terms of addressing what we would say, estimated eligible patients has gone up dramatically to somewhere in the low single digits to almost 25% to 30% more recently in terms of eligible patients getting monoclonals. If that trend continues along with the trend of unfortunately, more cases, obviously, we're going to have to go with the direction that the government wants another contract or actual switchover. Capacity, of course, is always an issue, but we think we're sort of well positioned to continue to supply similar amounts that we've been able to supply and we'll have to look at -- and these demands can change pretty rapidly. And of course, we do have our partner, Roche, who's got capacity that we can perhaps turn to. So a lot of moving parts, Yaron. And the most important of which is what is the shape of the current surge in the pandemic.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Terence Flynn: Congrats on the Dupixent CSU data. I was just wondering if there's incremental SG&A that's going to be required to launch this indication or if you'd be able to leverage your existing commercial footprint? And then the corollary is just how to think about the continued ramp of profitability of the JV here into 2022? Are there any other significant investments that we need to consider in our models?
Marion McCourt: Sure, Terence. I'll start from the commercial perspective. So yes, we're really excited about adding potentially another indication for Dupixent. CSU is a large opportunity. They're about 300,000 potential patients with disease adults and very limited treatment offers for them today. We will be able to always look at the impact of our educational abilities and promotion by indication. But to your very clear point, we do have a leveraging opportunity here because we're already calling on the audiences that would be required to effectively promote CSU. It's premature for us to say absolutely what sort of additional effort we might need. But certainly, we will be able to leverage our current footprint in all areas.
Bob Landry: Yes. And Terrence, I'll just kind of punctuate what Marion said on that. Clearly, and you can see it in the MD&A that we disclosed, and you can do the calc right, our margins are getting better with this. I mean this is something that we talked about. Certainly, we've had a lot of ex U.S. launches, a lot of prelaunch expenses related to that. kind of held that back a little bit. I think you're now seeing certainly year-over-year, you're starting to see the fruits of the labor. And the leverage that we've been talking about for a while, again, kudos to Sanofi, another strong ex U.S. quarter by them as we continue to see the indications really starting to kick in ex U.S.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kennen MacKay with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Kennen MacKay: Huge congratulations on the quarter really across the Board commercially and clinically with a couple of surprises this season. Maybe a question on EYLEA. There was commentary from another earlier this Q2 earnings season that included conversation around somewhat aggressive development plans of EYLEA biosimilar. Just wondering sort of beyond the 2023 composition of matter patent, if you could talk to which intellectual property, you have the most confidence in keeping this franchise going, especially as it relates to the U.S.? Congrats again.
Leonard Schleifer: Right. It's a great question, but we're going to have to defer on that one because of ongoing patent issues and what have you. We really can't make a comment. Sorry.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Carter Gould with Barclays. Your line is open.
Carter Gould: Obviously, I want to kind of change gears a bit. Obviously, we've seen some pretty transformational events across how FDA is addressing Alzheimer's since your last quarterly call. You did announce an early-stage program conjunction with Alnylam, but just wanted to see if you gauge your appetite to jump in sort of the antibody-directed amyloid beta lowering game. There's a few companies that innovate and iterate antibodies as well as Regeneron. And so as you think about your Alzheimer's effort going forward, if that was a point of focus and any broader color on that space would be helpful?
Leonard Schleifer: Well, we should let the iterator and inventor answer that.
George Yancopoulos: Sorry.
Leonard Schleifer: We should let the iterator and inventor answer that. Go ahead George.
George Yancopoulos: I was going to just -- sorry, I didn't hear you speaking there. Yes, we have a very robust effort in neurodegenerative diseases here at Regeneron are not overly excited about some of the antibody developments and necessarily getting into those type of approaches. But we have a lot of things that we're actually very excited about in the neurodegenerative disease space. We think novel ways of addressing targets as well as brand new targets that haven't been discovered elsewhere. We will be discussing these efforts going forward in more detail over the coming months and year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Skorney with Baird. Your line is open.
Brian Skorney: Unfortunately, I kind of feel like this is going to be an evergreen question as we see SARS to genetic shift. But it seems like just this week, there's been some emergence of data for the lambasting showing potentially increased resistance of vaccination. Just wondering if you guys have any data yet on the antibody combo and how much activity might retain against the strength?
George Yancopoulos: Yes. I have to say that I'm not sure exactly what our results are and quantitatively. But so far, every variant and every strain that we've tested, we retained potency. And so far, there's hopefully no reason to think that's going to change because we prospectively took advantage of this cocktail approaches so that even if one antibody gets minimally affected, the other one can take its place. So we expect to retain robust activity. That said, I think we've also announced that we have second-generation antibodies that are also entering in the clinic where we're going to continue to retain broad coverage. But I believe that as far as it's been tested with Linda, we retain potency there as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Geoff Meacham: I just wanted to ask on commercial Libtayo. Just wanted to see what sort of success or what metrics you can give us commercially with the initial first-line lung monotherapy rollout as well as the derm indication as well, just see how that's going early in the launch?
Marion McCourt: Sure, Geoff. Happy to. So for Libtayo with our first lung indication in mono, as expected, that is the smaller indication. So we're really excited about the chemotherapy combination data that was shared today. And in fact, if I quantify it, that indication in terms of patient potential is about 4 times the size of the mono indication. But what we're doing today in the market commercially is certainly foundational to Libtayo and our oncology portfolio more broadly. I'll comment, we are still the standard of care in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. That was a very effective launch. We now have a competitor in that indication, but we retain our leadership. The basal cell carcinoma launch is also going well. And certainly, the efficacy and tolerability, safety of Libtayo is paramount for those patients, and we offer an alternative where the specialists in that area do believe Libtayo as evolving to become the standard of care. It's early days in lung. I think our team is doing a really good job. And when we talk to the opinion leaders, they're most excited, as I mentioned, about our rapid action, our efficacy even in those patients with stable brain metastases and with the high expression PD-L1 patients. So early days, we are right on track with where we expected to be, but there's a lot more potential and a lot more work to do.
Leonard Schleifer: We have time for maybe 2 or 3 more quick questions, Tamia.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alethia Young with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.
Alethia Young: I just wanted to talk a little bit about how you guys see what the therapeutic goals are for NASH for medicine and to your leader in genetics and there's been a lot of ups and downs in NASH?
George Yancopoulos: Well, I think there's a variety of goals, but our major question right now with our first program is we believe that we have a novel approach that addresses not the steatosis component, but the inflammatory component, which is something that really is not being addressed by other approaches, other targets, other agents. So that if we can actually stop or reverse the inflammatory response to the steatosis that will be an entirely different and also potentially complementary approach to what anything that anybody else is doing right now. I think the genetics very strongly point to that. That's what it actually shows that this genetic target affects and that's what the protective mutations are actually showing. So we're excited about looking at this opportunity, whether we can halt or even reverse inflammatory signals, inflammatory processes and thus, actual progression of the disease irregardless of steatosis.
Leonard Schleifer: Next question please.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike King with H.C. Wainwright. Your line is open.
Mike King: I'm not sure how long -- how quickly this question could be answered, but I'm just trying to get a better appreciation of what I would call the real-world use of REGEN-COV. Can you point to -- I think Len said think about 25% of patients, but I think that was eligible. I don't know if you have any market data from real-world use versus what's been shipped and paid for -- shipped to and paid for by the government? Can we understand how that rubber band flexes a little more?
Leonard Schleifer: Sure. So look, what we look at are the shipments from our distributor to institutions, hospitals, med centers and clinics, emergencies, et cetera, et cetera. And we believe, based on some real-world data that about 70% of the daily cases that occur are occurring in people who would be eligible for treatment, either because they're obese or they've got underlying conditions or they're elderly more -- we're seeing more younger and obese, frankly, than we -- than elderly that was seen earlier in the pandemic. So if you take, for example, that maybe it was 100,000 new cases, maybe 70,000 of them would be eligible. So that gives you an idea. I was just looking, Mike, at this to see what our repeat orders were. And the vast, vast majority, I think it's around or above 90% of the institutions ordering have or repeat orders, meaning that they're not people just stocking the stuff to have it around. They're using it up. And that's what our field people seem to tell us. I don't know if Marion wants to maybe add any more or not, but I hope that helps you.
Marion McCourt: That would be the characterization. I think the other thing that's important is we are continuing to educate and to help with some of the bottlenecks that have been experienced early days. So we are seeing growing utilization. And certainly, as Len mentioned, the patient criteria who are eligible for treatment is broad to Len's point, age-related obesity, hypertension, diabetes, respiratory immune issues. So there are a lot of patients who are very much in need of treatment, and we're doing everything we can to help them have availability of product.
George Yancopoulos: Yes. I'll just add a couple of thoughts or points to that is during the last sort of surge, as Len said, we were probably only reaching somewhat of 1% of the potentially eligible patients. We're now well into the double digits in terms of the percentage of the eligible patients that we're probably reaching. And we've had some feedback from some of these institutions where we distribute to where they're actually low on inventory, suggesting that they're not stocking it up.
Marion McCourt: Yes. The other thing, just to add because we obviously are all over this and get the individual stories. But the 1 thing that is so consistent when patients are doing poorly and then they're treated with REGEN-COV within a day, two days, they see a remarkable difference in the patient status that truly has been rewarding for those on the front line.
Leonard Schleifer: Tamia, we're going to have to cut it after 1 more question.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Yatin Suneja with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.
Yatin Suneja: Just a question on the Intellia collaboration. Can you just share your views on the gene editing space, your vision or where do you see the new indication and obviously, the strategic goal of the broad collaboration that you have with Intellia?
George Yancopoulos: Yes. Obviously, these first-in-human results are incredibly exciting, both in terms of the percent knockdown. And also in terms of thus far in these early days, the observed safety. And as we said, we have two types of broad collaborative program areas with Intellia, both of which we think are greatly bolstered in terms of confidence based on these initial results. We have a series of programs which similarly involve systemic-based approaches to achieve gene knockdown. So obviously, those are chances of success are greatly bolstered by what we've seen with these first in-human results. But we also have, I think, just as if not even more exciting, a CRISPR-based gene insertion program that we're very excited about. And since it depends on essentially overlapping technologies, this program and its chance of success has greatly been increased based on the results we've seen to date. So we think that with the fact that we have so many programs ongoing in our collaboration with Intellia more than 20 programs under evaluation, and we have the ability to move forward quite a few of these. We're very excited that this could really change the practice of medicine and really bring CRISPR-based gene therapy to patients into the world. So nothing to be more exciting from the gene medicines point of view.
Justin Holko: Thank you, everyone. Thanks for hanging in there a little longer today. Bob Landry and the IR team are around today to answer any further questions. We wish you a good end of the week and enjoy the rest of the summer. Please stay safe out there. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-05-06 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Mary and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.
Justin Holko: Thank you, Mary. Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening to everyone listening around the globe. Thank you for your interest in Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, and welcome to the first quarter 2021 conference call. An archive of this webcast will be available on our website. Joining me on the call today are Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; Dr. George Yancopoulos, Co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer; Marion McCourt, Executive Vice President and Head of Commercial; Bob Landry, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A. I would also like to remind you that remarks made on today's call include forward-looking statements about Regeneron. Such statements may include, but are not limited to, those related to Regeneron and its products and business, financial forecasts and guidance, development programs and related anticipated milestones, collaborations, finances, regulatory matters, payer coverage and reimbursement issues, intellectual property, pending litigation and other proceedings and competition. Each forward-looking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected in that statement. A more complete description of these and other material risks can be found in Regeneron's filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2021, which we filed with the SEC earlier today. Regeneron does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. In addition, please note that GAAP and non-GAAP measures will be discussed in today's call. Information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP is available in our financial results press release, which can be accessed on our website. Once our call concludes, Bob Landry and the Investor Relations team will be available to answer further questions. With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.
Leonard Schleifer: Thank you, Justin, and thank you to everyone joining today's call. We were off to a strong start in 2021, again delivering double-digit growth on the top and bottom lines. I am immensely proud of all that Regeneron continues to accomplish in the fight against COVID and for patients suffering from a variety of diseases. 
George Yancopoulos : Thank you, Len. With the COVID-19 still in the headlines, I will start with our monoclonal antibody treatment, the REGEN-COV cocktail. We recently reported data from the large Phase 3 outcomes trial in the outpatient setting confirming that REGEN-COV reduced the risk of hospitalization and death by 70% with both the 2.4 gram and the lower 1.2 gram doses.  We are pleased that based on these data, the NIH guidelines were updated in early April to include a strong recommendation for monoclonal antibody combinations to treat outpatients with mild or moderate COVID-19 as defined by the EUA criteria. We have also recently reported data from a large two-part Phase 3 trial of REGEN-COV with Part A in the preventative setting and Part B in the recently infected patients. 
Marion McCourt : Thank you, George. We are off to an exciting start in 2021. Our expanded commercial portfolio includes three recent product and indication launches and we continue to grow our largest brands, EYLEA, Dupixent and Libtayo based on competitive and differentiated profiles.  Beginning with EYLEA, first quarter global net sales grew 17% year-over-year to nearly $2.2 billion. In the U.S., EYLEA net sales grew 15% year-over-year to $1.35 billion based on increased demand and a favorable comparison to the early weeks of the pandemic in the first quarter of 2020. EYLEA is capturing category growth and continues to be the preferred treatment option.  In the branded anti VEGF category, EYLEA has approximately 75% share and is approaching 50% of the combined branded and unbranded category. EYLEA is differentiated by the combination of its efficacy, safety, dosing flexibility in range of indications. In addition, physicians have considerable real-world experience with more than 40 million injections administered worldwide.  Across the broader category, demand continues to improve in 2021 as patient flow normalizes and new patient volume grows, we are confident in our near and longer-term outlook based on favorable patient demographics, physician preference for EYLIA, growth opportunities in diabetic eye disease and future opportunities with our high dose clinical program.  Turning to Libtayo, first quarter global net sales grew to $101 million with U.S. net sales of $69 million. The vast majority of first quarter sales were in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma where Libtayo is the number one systemic treatment. We are excited by the recent approvals in non-small cell lung cancer and basal cell carcinoma or BCC, both of which represent meaningful growth opportunities for Libtayo.  In April, we deployed our expanded and highly experienced sales force across these indications to extend our Libtayo promotional impact.  In lung cancer, we have heard from oncologists that Libtayo is highly competitive based on the strength of our compelling clinical data and overall value proposition. Early launch indicators are encouraging with uptick evidence at top academic and community-based practices. We are advancing formulary placements, securing favorable peer coverage decisions and growing overall market awareness. Importantly, Libtayo was rapidly included in the NCCN guidelines with a Category 1 preferred rating.  The NCCN guidelines have also been updated to include Libtayo in BCC as the category to a option, Libtayo is the only anti-PD1 approved in advanced disease for this indication. Early feedback has been encouraging as physicians are eager to prescribe Libtayo based on its efficacy and tolerability.  Hedgehog inhibitors despite being used in its first-line treatment may not be suitable for patients for long-term or routine use. Libtayo is an important new care alternative for BCC patients.  In summary, our lung and BCC launches are progressing according to plan and we are highly focused on ensuring that appropriate patients benefit from Libtayo.  Turning now to EVKEEZA, which has also proved in the first quarter of 2021 and is in the initial launch phase. EVKEEZA represents a novel and effective treatment for patients with Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia and is recognized by treating specialists as an improvement over the current standard-of-care. Patient demand is steadily building with multiple patients already initiated on therapy.  Moving to Dupixent, global net sales in the first quarter were $1.26 billion, representing 48% growth compared to the prior year. In the U.S., broad based growth across all the proved indications generated net sales of $962 million with new patient starts now higher than pre-COVID levels.  In atopic dermatitis, Dupixent’s largest indication prescribing continues to be strong across the moderate and severe disease and across age groups following our adolescent and pediatric launches. There is significant for continued growth based on remaining unmet need among eligible patients. Dupixent is the number one dermatologist prescribed biologic based on the depth and breadth of its long-term efficacy and safety profile.  Turning to asthma, where we are actively preparing to launch in pediatric patients as young as six years of age later this year. Among adolescents and adults, we continue to meaningfully expand the number of Dupixent patients initiations driven by our extensive provider and patient educational efforts.  In addition, demand is strong among E&Ts and allergists for patients with nasal polyps. Dupixent is the fastest-growing biologic and respiratory disease in our approved indications with substantial room for growth.  I’d also like to highlight efforts supporting our antibody cocktail REGEN-COV. In the first quarter, we recorded U.S. net sales of $262 million under the first contract with U.S. government. REGEN-COV is currently authorized under an EUA in patients based on age and risk factors which represent close to 40% of all adults diagnosed with COVID-19.  We are focused on reducing bottlenecks and increasing utilization, particularly in states with high infection rates. Efforts include, direct support to key facilities, medical education for REGEN-COV, partnering with third-party stakeholders and educating consumers on the availability of antibody treatments.  As George mentioned, we are preparing for a potential update of the REGEN-COV EUA to include prevention as we hope to be able to address an unmet need for millions of patients who may be candidates for ongoing preventative treatment. Preventative care may also be important for those who have known COVID exposure and requires very rapid protection.  In summary, we delivered robust performance across our portfolio in the first quarter of the year. There is strong positive momentum from our inline business, encouraging early signals from our recent launches and substantial opportunity for continued diversified growth.  Now I’ll turn the call over to Bob. 
Robert Landry: Thanks, Marion. And good morning and afternoon to everyone listening to the call. My comments today on financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis where applicable. As Len stated, Regeneron is off to a strong start in 2021 as we continue to execute across the business delivering double-digit top and bottom line growth in the first quarter.  For the first quarter, total revenues grew 38% year-over-year to $2.5 billion, driven by growth in global EYLEA sales; increased Sanofi collaboration profitability driven by Dupixent and sales of our REGEN-COV antibody cocktail. Diluted net income per share grew 50% year-over-year to $9.89 on net income of $1.1 billion. Excluding revenues related to REGEN-COV, Regeneron achieved 20% total revenue growth versus the prior year. As you’ve heard from Marion, we completed our initial contract to supply REGEN-COV to the U.S. government in the first quarter assuming that we secure an updated EUA for the 1.2 gram treatment dose we expect to deliver at least 1 million of REGEN-COV at $2100 per dose for our follow-on contract with the U.S. government in the second quarter.  I will now move to collaboration revenues, which were $754 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared to $528 million in the first quarter of 2020. Starting with the Bayer collaboration, Ex-US EYLEA net product sales reported to us by Bayer were $824 million for the first quarter of 2021, representing growth of 21% on a reported basis and 12% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $323 million, of which we recorded $309 million for our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $365 million in the first quarter. Our share of the profits from the commercialization of Dupixent and Kevzara was $261 million, which compares favorably to profits of $171 million in the prior year driven by Dupixent. We recorded initial Roche collaboration revenues of $67 million for our share of gross profits from the distribution of the antibody cocktail by Roche outside of the U.S.  Other revenue to $50 million in the first quarter, compared to $63 million in the prior year. In 2021, we expect this line to be less than half of what we recorded in 2020 due to lower border reimbursements with the EBOLA and COVID-19 programs.  Moving on to our operating expenses, and starting with R&D. R&D increased 28% year-over-year to $673 million, primarily due to continued clinical development costs for our REGEN-COV antibody cocktail.  Next, SG&A expense increased 16% year-over-year to $355 million. The year-over-year increase was driven by commercial investments for Libtayo, cost related to the roll out of REGEN-COV and higher employee-related expenses.  Cost of goods sold increased versus the prior year from $70 million to $173 million due to REGEN-COV manufacturing costs and Praluent manufacturing cost in the in the U.S. which were recorded by Sanofi in the first quarter of 2020.  Additionally, in other operating income and expense, we recorded $4 million expense, compared to $25 million of income in the prior year. This is driven by interest expense related to our $2 billion debt issuance in August 2020 and lower investment returns on our existing cash and marketable securities.  Finally, the effective tax rate was 10.5% in the first quarter of 2021. Included in this rate is the benefit achieved by a reduction in uncertain tax position liabilities related to the IRS audits of the 2015 and 2016 tax years.  Shifting now to cash flow and the balance sheet. In the first quarter of 2021, Regeneron generated $553 million in free cash flow and ended the quarter with net cash and marketable securities of $5.1 billion. In the first quarter, we utilized $323 million of our $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization and we remain opportunistic buyers in the market.  I would now like to provide select updates to our 2021 guidance. A complete summary of our latest full year guidance is available in our press release published earlier this morning. We are updating full year 2021 guidance for COCM to be in the range of $660 million to $730 million, the lower guidance range is related to the timing of contract manufacturing of Praluent for Sanofi. We are also updating guidance for our 2021 non-GAAP effective tax rate to be in the range of 13% to 15%. The increase from prior guidance is driven by higher forecasted delivery of REGEN-COV under our second U.S. government contract, which is passed at the U.S. statutory rate.  In Regeneron is off to a strong start in 2021 and continues to execute across all aspects of the business. We are well positioned for the remainder of 2021 and continue to make those investments necessary to ensure long-term growth.  With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Justin.
Justin Holko: Thank you, Bob. Mary that concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call for Q&A. With several callers in the queue and to ensure that we were able to address as many as possible, we will answer just one question from each caller before moving to the next. Please go ahead, Mary.
Operator:  Your first question comes from the line of Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. 
Terence Flynn : Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. I guess, with respect to the competitive landscape for Dupixent, the JAK inhibitors have been delayed, but assuming that it do reached the market later this year including at the high dose. How are you guys thinking about that as a competitive headwind to Dupixent? And maybe, if you think about the longer term market opportunity, you could walk us through kind of where penetration stands right now in the adult and the adolescent setting? Thank you. 
Leonard Schleifer: Go ahead, Marion. 
Marion McCourt: Sure. So, I am having to start off, first, let me say that we are seeing tremendous experience with Dupixent in the marketplace today. And this obviously is a cost indications including atopic dermatitis. And also very importantly, across age categories which demonstrate not only the efficacy, the speed of action, the safety, the tolerability, we pay really close attention to competitors coming into the marketplace.  And certainly in the case of these JAK inhibitors we are well aware of the multiple delays, also recent clinical data that is calling into question issues of safety, especially at the higher doses, but even at the lower doses and the continuation of Blackrock’s warnings, we hear from our key opinion leaders who use Dupixent and see it as their main stay of therapy currently and going forward with great confidence in the safety profile.  This is a chronic therapy and certainly the risk of hematologic effects, malignancies, infection and so on are just not something that is tolerable for these patients when they have a tremendous alternative. So I think we feel very confident in our competitive profile going forward. And also remind that Dupixent, obviously, based on its mode of action, has great efficacy across Type 2 disease and other indications. Patients do sometimes have concomitant conditions. So, on balance, we’ll stay very close to this and to our key opinion leaders and specialists who are very, very confident in the profile of Dupixent. 
Leonard Schleifer: Yes, I would just add two points that, one is the safety will be particularly concerning, I think for the long-term treatment of children. And so, I think, as the safety profile that Dupixent has shown is really, frankly – it’s almost unparallel in terms of what you can do with the ageing on the efficacy side and not have any significant concerns on the safety side.  The other point in terms of the penetration, even if you look at how these markets have evolved, when more agents have come on for rheumatoid arthritis and for psoriasis, the penetration is so low here that, even with competition there is room for market growth rather than direct fighting it out in terms of a fixed amount of market share.  So, we expect our profile, safety as Marion says to be really firm on treating physicians’ minds and we do think the low level of penetration thus far does leave room for growth nonetheless. 
Justin Holko: Great. Next question please.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond of Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. 
Chris Raymond : Yes. Thanks. Just maybe another question on Dupixent. So, our checks indicate there is a lot of interest in AD with regard to add-on therapy and that there is a lot of Dupixent patients who may not be necessarily optimally managed, but are not exactly failing.  So, there is a lot of interest I guess with, maybe looking at atopical JAK or some other therapy. Just kind of curious if you guys have thought about maybe proactively looking at some combo work just to sort of ensure that Dupixent maintains its role as a core? Thanks. 
Leonard Schleifer: Well, George, you might want to comment if we have any interest in that, but in terms of the commercial side of this, when you talk to patients, the kind of patients we are treating moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, they have lesions over large fraction of their body.  I can remember exactly what it was in our trials, what we are seeing out there commercially is large fractions of their body are affected by this disease. And so, I think that adding topical perhaps, but people actually trying to get away from – trying to get away from having to lather up over their entire body.  The other thing about Dupixent that we can never forget is that, the broad aspects of approvals across lots of allergic diseases and with the growing number, it’s very important because these diseases do tend to run in groups. There are many people who have asthma and atopic dermatitis or asthma and nasal polyposis or atopic dermatitis and other allergic diseases which we are studying. So, I think that our broad profile across lots of other diseases is also going to give us a very strong competitive position. 
Justin Holko: Next question please.
Marion McCourt: Yes, I just - just going to add real quickly, this is Marion, on that question, I just wanted to share as well that, in the market experience, we do and obviously look at this very carefully to market research and have a very high level of satisfaction with Dupixent for patients with atopic dermatitis. So I just want to make sure that there is not an impression left that there lot of patients necessarily looking for something more who are treated with Dupixent for atopic dermatitis. 
Justin Holko: Next question please.
Operator: Next question comes from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. 
Cory Kasimov: Hey, good morning guys. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask on the COVID front. Do you have a sense of the remaining hurdles and anticipated timing for the low dose emergency authorization for REGEN-COV and are you continuing to ship high doses to antibody cocktail as you wait on it? Thank you. 
Leonard Schleifer: Right. Thanks for that question, Cory. We’ve been active discussions and productive discussions with the FDA. Obviously, one never knows what they are going to do exactly and when they are going to do it. But we anticipate an action by the FDA over the next – sometime in the next several weeks in terms of the lower 1.2 gram dose.  I think from there, they will turn their attention to the prevention data which they have in front of them as well as the subcu data, as well as the chronic prevention opportunities. So, I can assure you the FDA has been working really hard. We are in constant contact with them answering questions, going over things and as I said, we expect something to – anticipated decisions sometime in the next several weeks. 
Cory Kasimov: Great. Thank you. 
Justin Holko: Next question please.
Leonard Schleifer: And Cory, I am sorry, of course, we are continuing to supply the market and there is no shortage of product out there in terms of people needing to be treated now can be treated with the 2.4 gram dose and there is ample product available. 
Cory Kasimov: Perfect. Thanks. 
Operator: Next question comes from Geoffrey Porges of SVB Leerink. Your line is now open. 
Geoffrey Porges : So many things to ask questions about in such a little time. But, operating margin 48% to 49% the last couple of quarters, what would that have been without the COVID 2, the antibody and is it sustainable at the current level and I would squeeze in, and if the tax rate sustainable at the current level as well? Thanks. 
Robert Landry: Yes, I mean, I’ll talk about the tax rate. I mean, certainly there is a lot to be played out with regards to what’s going to happen on the tax rate. You heard what I said, we are obviously moving well within our full year guidance. We did have favorable outcome with regards uncertain tax positions that we are able to reverse, which kind of drove a little lower in the quarter on that front.  On operating margins, Geoff, you know, I guess, the one piece that’s not so transparent everybody is, we are still incurring a lot of R&D as it pertains to REGEN-COV with regards to the trials, the enrollment numbers. So, I don’t want people to come our way and say, you know, as a result of the Roche benefit we got in the REGEN-COV product sales that without that the margins would have been as good.  But we did incur a lot of expenses pertaining to that that are within the R&D line that we just don’t specifically talk about. The business on its own, excluding REGEN-COV it was 20% top-line and 35% EBI, okay? So, again, it shows you the underlying strength as you’ve heard from Len at the very beginning of his words in terms of how we are performing.  We think the operating margin is – continue to stay at that and improve at that level. I mean, certainly, it’s the leverage on Dupixent, right? To the extent you saw that Sanofi did a terrific job ex U.S. where we are starting to get a little momentum in terms of ex U.S. sales. So, to the extent that that will continue to play out, we’ll continue to get good operating margins associated with that and then that will drive our overall margins. 
Geoffrey Porges : Great. Thanks, Rob. 
Robert Landry: Thanks, Geoff. 
Justin Holko: Next question please.
Operator: Next question comes from Yatin Suneja of Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now open. 
Yatin Suneja: Hey guys. Thank you for taking my question. I have a question on the deployment of cash. Could you maybe talk about the top priorities? Are there areas where you would like to collaborate or bring in capabilities? And how should we think about BD? Thank you. 
Leonard Schleifer: Bob? 
Robert Landry: Sure. Our cash balance on a net cash basis sitting at $5.1 billion and we are roughly at $7 billion on a gross basis. And again, we like the flexibility that it affords us. I always need to make sure that internally, we have enough to obviously support the internal R&D of which we continue to go after different modalities and that’s kind of tied into our second leg of the stool where we don’t have kind of in-house capability on everything.  It’s great that we have the capability for George and the BT team to go out and get other technologies whether it be the Intellia-driven technology on CRISPR or Alnylam and alike. And we are continuing to play heavy in that space and we need to make sure that things we go after are most likely going to be early-stage.  We are not looking for kind of transformative kind of M&A deals on that front as of right now and we continue to stay hungry in that place with the right opportunities. And then as you saw, we did $325 million share buybacks. We have a $1.5 billion program that we authorized in January.  We are opportunistic buyers and we think the intrinsic value of where we see it compared to where the market is currently playing we are going to take advantage of that delta and we did such that in the first quarter and we are continuing to do that on that front. And that continues to be an active play for us. 
Yatin Suneja: Okay. Thank you. 
Justin Holko: Thanks, Bob. Next question please.
Operator: Next question comes from . Your line is now open. 
Unidentified Analyst: Hey guys. This is Alex on for Jeff. Thanks for taking our question. Just one on EYLEA, obviously, scrips and sales are holding up fairly well despite COVID-19 and new market entrants in wet AMD. But, looking to lifecycle management over the next few years, do you see this primarily coming from the high-dose formulation? And on this, is there a venue or an update on timing for data from the CANDELA study? Thanks.
Leonard Schleifer : Yes. I think that the lifecycle management continues to beat from more data that kind of data that we generated in diabetic retinopathy with the PANORAMA and Protocol W, which George reviewed, I think are very important results. And so, I think that will drive more treatment in that area. In terms of the high dose, I think you heard from George, that we’ll get some of the preliminary Phase 2 data later this year. And then, for next entrants, we have readying for the clinic a newer version, if you will, which we will unveil for you when we get that into the clinic.
Justin Holko : Next question please.
Operator: Next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas of Truist. Your line is now open.
Robyn Karnauskas : Guys thanks for taking the question. I am scared to ask this question, but, what is your latest thoughts on counterdetailing faricimab? What are you hearing from the specific centers that you think might be more likely utilize the product? And how do you counterdetail to prevent that from taking any share from EYLEA? Thanks.
Marion McCourt : Sure. So, let me say, first of all, obviously, the product you mentioned is not approved and still at the stage where the clinical data is being reviewed. As I mentioned to some of you who were on the last call, as we look at the clinical profile today of faricimab, we do not see a threat to EYLEA.  Certainly, some of the recent data had some questions on clinical profile and certainly with an increase in IOIO rate, question on the safety profile. I think the net conclusion on the key opinion leaders that I spoke to in retinal community was that they didn’t see an obvious benefit to the product and perhaps even questions in matching the safety, durability, and clinical profile of EYLEA across indications. I’ll mention that certainly with EYLEA, when an important attribute is the ability to treat and extend therapy and there is some elements of that clinical trial designed to constrain EYLEA’s dosing interval, we actually hear on a regular basis that one of the reasons why EYLEA is performing so well in the first quarter of 2021 and frankly performed so well last year is because of its efficacy and the ability to treat and extend for patients. We remain very confident in EYLEA’s profile against the competitive product you mentioned.
Justin Holko : Next question please.
Operator: Next question comes from Alethia Young of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.
Alethia Young : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on all the progress this quarter. I just want a couple of about the 6 to 11 asthma expansion indications. Just can you kind of talk about how you are thinking about uptake there. It feels like it could be pretty robust in light of the safety profile and the fact that kids are on their atopic march as well. So, just wanted to get your perspective on that thing?
Marion McCourt : Sure. You mentioned something that we look forward to and will be very much prepared for the pediatric launch for Dupixent in the asthma market later this year. We do see this as a tremendous opportunities for these really young patients, age six and up, who are struggling today and will benefit tremendously from the Dupixent ability to improve their airway function and reduce exacerbations and help these patients and their families with these children living more normal and healthy lives.  It’s very important and then, at the same time, recognizing Dupixent’s safety profile. So, at the same time, we take care of the asthma and as Len mentioned before the possibility of concomitant diseases associated with type 2 disease. So we do feel that this will be a very important indication launch. We look forward to and it once again confirms the efficacy and the safety of Dupixent.
Justin Holko : Thanks, Marion. Next question please.
Operator: Next question comes from Mohit Bansal of Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Mohit Bansal : Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the progress. One more question on the high dose EYLEA. So, we do know that back in the days, Roche also ran a trial, HARBOR trial, which you talked about  I understand that this trial is designed to be little bit different. It is not a superiority trial that you are running.  But, could that be helpful is my first question. And then, I mean, scientifically, why would a high-dose would result into some kind of better benefit in your opinion that give us some confidence there. Thank you.
George Yancopoulos : Yes, I think that basically a higher dose will simply - the notion is extend the duration of action. That would be the primary thing that we are looking at. So, obviously, it allows for longer duration of action because, you will go longer until you achieve the minimally effective dose. So, the notion is, is, can we show that we will now have increased numbers of patients, who can do well with every 12-week dosing or every 16-week dosing? So, that’s the major goal of testing the higher dose.
Leonard Schleifer : Yes. And as George was saying that, you’re trying to extend the action, but, if you look at an interval where in some patients, let’s say, you take them at an every eight weekend, but, there is still some people who are not completely dry, because the drug probably isn’t lasting the full eight weeks even. And so, you might see more drying as a manifestation of the longer action. So there is couple of ways to slice, but, surely, you’re looking to put more drugs and having it last longer.
Mohit Bansal : Got it. Super helpful. Thank you.
Justin Holko : Next question please.
Operator: Next question comes from Yaron Werber of Cowen. Your line is now open.
Yaron Werber : Great. Marion, maybe for you on asthma. Can you give us a sense of what’s the share now for Dupi in asthma? And we understand that some physicians for Centerra has been very aggressive on pricing. What can you do to offset some of that growth into Centerra? Thank you.
Marion McCourt : Sure. Happy to take your question. First, I’ll say, we are very pleased with the performance of Dupixent, both in terms of initiations and total scrips. We haven’t given details of share by indications. So I’ll stay away from that specificity today. But, as you can see from our total performance and the data shared, we certainly are performing very, very well in the asthma marketplace. I am not going to comment on other company’s pricing strategies, but what I can say is, when we look at the data comparing Dupixent uptake either initiations or total scrips, it compares very favorably to the IL-5s and we know that this is a result of the clinical profile, the safety profile and the value that not only pulmonologists, but also allergists are seeing in Dupixent for asthma. And as you know with allergists also treating patients with concomitant diseases.
Justin Holko : Next question please.
Operator: Next question comes from Kennen MacKay of RBC Markets. Your line is now open.
Kennen MacKay : Hi, thanks for taking the question. One on Dupixent maybe also for Marion. It seems like Dupi is growing much faster in asthma than in AD. But, it just seems like that because derm has such a larger sales basis. So, Marion, just wondering if you can frame what percent of Dupixent’s quarter-over-quarter growth is coming from asthma versus derm? Thank you.
Marion McCourt : Sure. So let me talk about the total indications that I can share with you is that, the dermatology, atopic dermatitis business in Dupixent is about 75%, about 25% in respiratory disease both asthma and nasal polyps, asthma, of course, being the larger of the two in respiratory disease. Both are growing very, very strongly.  And remember that we launched in atopic dermatitis several years before we did in the asthma marketplace. Both are growing very, very strongly and certainly, as we look at the future potential for Dupixent in atopic dermatitis, we have a long way to go. There is still tremendous unmet need across all age groups, the youngest patients, adolescents and adults. And then, the asthma marketplace as well, it’s important to note that today, about 75% of the patients in asthma going on Dupixent are biologic-naive. So, we’re getting these new starts. There is tremendous opportunity and Dupixent has been one of the growers of the overall asthma biologics marketplace.  As mentioned the - in response to the earlier question, we look forward to - with an FDA approval to launch in pediatrics later this year, but, among adults and adolescents, there’s still tremendous opportunity in asthma as well. Both are growth engines for the product.  And this is without even the many indications I look forward to launching in the future related to type 2 disease like eosinophilic esophagitis and some of the other areas in allergy that George mentioned in his update today.
Justin Holko : Mary, we have time for two more questions. We are going to try to squeeze them in quickly.
Operator: Sure. Next question comes from Brian Skorney of Baird. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you for taking our question. This is  dialing in for Brian Skorney. Our question is based on your partnership with Intellia. I see that we are anticipating the first in vivo CRISPR data pretty soon and we’ve seen good success here with the ex-vivo approach. Maybe, you can share your thoughts on in vivo approach and how we should think about it in terms of looking at the safety of this approach, not just for the ATTR indications, but more broadly for the proof-of-concept for the street? Thank you.
Leonard Schleifer : George, do you want take that?
George Yancopoulos : Yes, I think that is the most important aspect of this for us is, this is a platform. And as we’ve said, we have multiple targets that might be amenable to this platform that we’ve already identified through our Regeneron Genetic Center. And so, of great interest will be does it work and what will be the safety and the tolerability profile? So, we think that this will be a platform determining sort of a result, depending on how it turns out.
Justin Holko : Thanks, George. We have time for one more question.
Operator: Next question comes from Carter Gould of Barclays. Your line is now open.
Carter Gould : Great. Congratulations on the quarter and thanks for all the progress in tackling COVID and for taking the question. As you think – how should we think about - how do you think about appropriate REGEN-COV2 production in an increasingly sort of post-vaccination world and any read into how countries and healthcare systems are approaching supply and stockpiling?  And I guess, in answering that question, can you just clarify kind of where you and Roche stand in terms of capacity given the efficacy of lower doses and continued improvements in efficiency and scale? Thank you.
Justin Holko : Len, do you want to take that?
Leonard Schleifer : I don’t think we are really in a position. It’s better for Roche to comment on how the market is developing outside of the United States. But, I do know that they are working on a lot of different discussions with a lot of different jurisdictions. And there is, as we speak now, adequate supply. But, obviously, the pandemic changes pretty quickly. So, I think Roche is probably going to be better positioned to answer that, unless Justin has anything more specific for you.
Justin Holko : No, that’s it. Well, thank you for everyone joining the call today. We still have several callers in the queue that we didn’t get to; we apologize for that. We will follow up with you after the call. Thanks to everyone for dialing in. Be safe and have a good day.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today’s conference call. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-05 08:00:00) =====

With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.
Leonard Schleifer: Thank you, Justin, and thanks to everyone joining on today's call. 2020 was a devastating year for so many individuals and their families who succumbed to COVID-19. At Regeneron, we have done all we can to be part of the solution, and we'll spend quite a bit of time today trying to inform you of our efforts. 
George Yancopoulos : Thank you, Len. With the world still in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic, I will start with our efforts on REGEN-COV, our antibody cocktail targeting the SARS-CoV-2 virus.  Over the last few months, we have achieved several important milestones. On November 21, our antibody cocktail received FDA emergency use authorization for recently diagnosed, mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in high-risk patients. The EUA was granted based on the initial results in patients from our large study in the non-hospitalized setting. 
Marion McCourt : Thank you, George. We ended 2020 with positive momentum across our commercial portfolio as our core products, EYLEA, Dupixent and Libtayo, delivered strong performance in the fourth quarter. Our 2020 results coupled with near-term launch opportunities position us for continued diversified growth in 2021.  Beginning with EYLEA, fourth quarter global net sales grew 10% year-over-year to $2.2 billion. As we reported last month, US EYLEA net sales grew 10% year-over-year to $1.34 billion, the highest reported net sales since EYLEA's launch. EYLEA again outperformed the category with share gains from both branded and unbranded competition. EYLEA share of the branded category approached 75% for the quarter and EYLEA remains the number one prescribed anti-VEGF therapy overall in wet AMD and diabetic eye disease.  While volume in the overall anti-VEGF category declined in 2020, EYLEA was the only product in the category to grow. Patient volumes are now normalizing. EYLEA sets a high bar on efficacy, safety, dosing inflexibility and real world experience for current and future competition.  The anti-VEGF category continues to be supported by the aging population and increasing prevalence of diabetes. Realizing the full potential in diabetic eye disease remains a key initiative, representing a significant growth opportunity for EYLEA and is largely unpenetrated. We intend to initiate a direct to consumer campaign to create awareness for patients on the importance of vision care as part of managing their diabetes.  In summary, EYLEA had an impressive quarter and we remain confident in its outlook.  Next, we recorded $146 million for our antibody cocktail, REGEN-COV, in the fourth quarter. Where appropriate, we are deploying commercial efforts under the EUA to improve availability for this important treatment against COVID-19 for at-risk patients. We are engaging with all stakeholders to reduce bottlenecks and drive utilization rates higher. Regeneron is working to educate stakeholders, including patients, on the urgency to treat at-risk non-hospitalized patients within 10 days of receiving a positive COVID-19 diagnosis.  Initiatives to reduce administrative burden and direct patients to treatment centers are beginning to yield encouraging results. Physicians using REGEN-COV are providing very positive feedback on treatment results.  Let me also briefly discuss another new medicine, evinacumab, brand name Evkeeza. We're prepared for the February 11 PDUFA date for Evkeeza for the treatment of HoFH, a rare disease that affects approximately 1,300 patients in the US. There's high unmet need for these patients with this rare genetic condition as they struggle to keep their LDL cholesterol levels under control.  These patients face an increased risk of premature heart disease as early as their teenage years. We are leveraging our cardio metabolic expertise and existing commercial platform to drive uptake in this rare disease category.  Turning now to Libtayo, for the fourth quarter, global net sales grew to $97 million. In the US, net sales were $74 million, driven by steady volume growth in advanced CSCC. We are nearing the potential approval of two additional indications for Libtayo in basal cell carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer, both of which received priority reviews and have upcoming PDUFA dates. Our teams are eager and ready to launch once approved.  For basal cell carcinoma, there are no FDA approved treatment options once a patient progresses on or becomes intolerant to hedgehog inhibitors. Just as we did with CSCC, we will work to establish Libtayo as the standard of care in appropriate BCC patients.  We also look forward to competing in non-small cell lung cancer, where there's a large opportunity among patients with PD-L1 expressions at least 50%. Libtayo has a favorable product profile and a growing majority of treatment centers and oncologists have experience using Libtayo in their CSCC patients.  Physicians preferred choice and recent market research shows that nearly two-thirds of physicians are highly motivated to evaluate Libtayo for their lung cancer patients if approved. Additionally, we've built a highly experienced commercialization team with a significant launch experience with this class. If approved, we aim to rapidly increase market awareness of Libtayo as a compelling new anti-PD-1 monotherapy treatment option. Finally, moving to Dupixent, global net sales in the fourth quarter were $1.17 billion, representing 56% growth compared to the prior year. In the US, broad-based growth across all approved indications contributed to net sales of $926 million. We continue to see strong prescription trends across all approved indications. And weekly new patient shares have recently eclipsed pre-pandemic levels.  Atopic dermatitis, the largest indication, is a significant growth driver on Dupixent's rapid onset, proven efficacy and well established safety profile. Physicians continued to expand prescribing across both moderate and severe disease and in younger populations where safety is paramount.  Despite the impressive launch growth trajectory, there remains significant opportunity as only a small percentage of the over 2 million biologic eligible patients in the US have been unprescribed Dupixent.  Our initiatives aim to grow new patient starts as there is substantial opportunity for many more patients to benefit and support patients already on Dupixent to continue their treatment.  Moving to asthma, Dupixent is performing well in this competitive market based on its clinical efficacy and safety profile, which is compelling and differentiated to prescribers. Our market expansion efforts supporting HCPs and patients, including DTC, continue to have a meaningful impact on new initiations and launch preparations are underway in pediatric  pediatric asthma setting.  For chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, we see healthy demand and continued strong prescribing trends among ENTs and allergists. Dupixent is core to our diversified growth strategy where there remains substantial opportunity for future expansion.  In closing, we ended 2020 with momentum, delivering strong performance across our business. With several near-term launches ahead, we have important opportunities to strengthen our thriving commercial portfolio and capitalize on growth.  Now I'll turn the call to Bob.
Robert Landry : Thanks, Marion. And good morning and good afternoon, everybody. My comments today on financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis where applicable. For the fourth quarter of 2020, Regeneron delivered again double-digit broad-based top and bottom line growth. Our revenue streams continue to diversify with significant growth contributions from Dupixent and REGEN-COV, as we invest in our best in class pipeline for sustained future growth.  For the fourth quarter, total revenue grew 30% year-over-year to $2.4 billion, driven by growth in US EYLEA sales; higher collaboration revenues from our partners, Sanofi and Bayer; and sales of our REGEN-COV antibody cocktail. Diluted net income per share grew 27% year-over-year to $9.53 on net income of $1.1 billion. Since Marion discussed our US EYLEA results, I will start with our Bayer and Sanofi collaborations.  Starting with the Bayer collaboration. Ex-US EYLEA net product sales reported to us by Bayer were $859 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, representing growth of 10% on a reported basis compared to the prior year. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $361 million, of which we recorded $335 million for our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the US.  Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $317 million in the fourth quarter. Our share of the profits from the commercialization of non-IO antibodies was $230 million, which compares favorably to profits of $104 million in the prior year. This growth was primarily driven by higher Dupixent profits.  Other revenue increased to $123 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $96 million in the prior year. The primary driver is the recognition of $42 million from the US government associated with reimbursements of REGEN-COV development.  As we said on the third quarter call, this line item continues to trend lower due to the wind down of development reimbursements from the US government. In 2021, we expect to record approximately half of the $557 million recorded in other revenue for full-year 2020.  Moving on to our operating expenses, and starting with R&D. R&D increased 50% year-over-year to $675 million, primarily due to continued clinical development costs for our REGEN-COV antibody cocktail and higher headcount to support our expanding pipeline.  Next, SG&A expense increased 22% year-over-year to $381 million. The year-over-year increase was largely driven by increased headcount launch preparations for Libtayo and continued investments for growth in EYLEA. Cost of goods sold increased 79% from the prior year from $93 million to $166 million due to sales of REGEN-COV and Praluent in the US. Cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing was $174 million compared to $113 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily due to increased sales of Dupixent.  Additionally, in other operating income and expense, we recorded $145 million of income in the fourth quarter of 2020. This includes approximately $100 million of income related to higher recognition of upfront and milestone payments previously received from our collaborators with Sanofi, Teva and Mitsubishi Tanabe. Finally, in other income and expense, we recorded $2 million of expense compared to $25 million of income in the fourth quarter of 2019. This is driven by interest expense related to our $2 billion debt issuance in August 2020 and lower investment returns on our existing cash and marketable securities. Turning now to taxes. The effective tax rate was 7.7% in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 10.6% in the fourth quarter of 2019.  Shifting now to cash flow and the balance sheet. For the full-year 2020, Regeneron generated $2 billion in free cash flow and ended the year with cash and marketable securities, less long term debt, of $4.7 billion. We also exhausted our inaugural $1 billion share repurchase program in the fourth quarter.  As a result of our strong balance sheet and confidence in the growth trajectory of our business, we are announcing a new board authorized share repurchase program of $1.5 billion. This program is consistent with our capital allocation priorities of funding our broad R&D pipeline, investing in enabling and synergizing R&D business development opportunities, and returning cash to our shareholders. With this new authorization, we will continue to be opportunistic buyers where we see dislocation between our stock price and our intrinsic valuation.  Having reviewed our fourth quarter performance, I'd like to take some time to discuss the 2021 financial outlook. Starting with R&D guidance. We forecast our 2021 R&D expense to be in the range of $2.7 billion to $2.85 billion. We are continuing to advance programs in our diverse R&D portfolio with up to 7 INDs to enter the clinic in 2021, of which six were discovered in-house. This is an addition to INDs that entered the clinic in 2020, which George mentioned.  Included in our R&D guidance and based on current plans, we expect to spend between $275 million and $350 million on the REGEN-COV development program. We expect most of this REGEN-COV spend to occur in the first half of the year.  Next, we forecast our 2021 SG&A expense to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.63 billion. We continue to invest in multiple launches in 2021, including two new indications for Libtayo and efforts for REGEN-COV. Also, as you heard from Marion, this increased spending will also be driven by a DTC campaign for EYLEA as we continue to see significant growth opportunity in diabetic eye disease.  Next, we expect our 2021 product gross margin on a percentage of net product sales that we record to be between 87% and 89%. We expect 2021 cost of collaboration manufacturing to be in the range of $670 million to $750 million, driven by continued growth in our Dupixent franchise.  We forecast 2021 operating income and expense to be income of $150 million to $175 million.  Finally, we expect our 2021 non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 12% to 14%, inclusive of REGEN-COV sales in the US, which are taxed at the US statutory rate.  I'd also like to review our current supply agreements with the US government for REGEN-COV. We expect to recognize the remainder of the $466 million initial US government contract in the first quarter of 2021. We also announced last month a new agreement with the US government for additional doses of REGEN-COV. Right now, we expect to deliver approximately 750,000 doses by the agreed delivery date of June 30 of this year at the contracted price of $2,100 per dose, with the vast majority of these deliveries occurring in the second quarter.  As George mentioned earlier, we are evaluating a lower 1.2 gram dose for REGEN-COV. Should this lower treatment dose receive emergency use authorization or approval from the FDA, we aim to deliver up to 1.25 million doses by June 30, which is the maximum quantity that is authorized for purchase by the US government under the supply agreement. Importantly, if the lower dose is approved, the pricing per dose does not change.  Our ability to fulfill these finished doses is predicated on continued success in the manufacture of bulk product and access to third-party finished capacity, which is under heavy demand from COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers.  In conclusion, we are well positioned for significant growth with durable core products, multiple near-term launches and specialized growth opportunities, while investing in our R&D engine to drive sustainable long-term growth.  With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Justin. 
Justin Holko : Thank you, Bob. Michelle, that concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call for Q&A. We have more than 20 callers in the queue today. So, to ensure that we were able to address as many of these questions as possible, we are only going to answer one question from each caller before moving to the next. So, please do limit yourself to that one question. Please go ahead, Michelle.
Operator: . Our first question comes from Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler. 
Christopher Raymond: This question is on REGEN-COV. So, I heard Marion's prepared remarks around working to iron out some of the reported logistical and, arguably, financial barriers that have been talked about so much in the real world setting. But I'm guessing, with the development path being as compressed as it was, your commercial support is probably playing catch up a bit here. But can you maybe talk a little bit about – more specifically what you guys feel needs to be worked on the most? Is it education of physicians? Is it the logistical issues? What kind of support – any color there in terms of what exactly you need to do to sort of smooth things out would be great.
Leonard Schleifer: Marion can give you more details. But the way we look at it, we need to do work at all parts of the funnel, the top end of the funnel being getting physicians to actually prescribe the product for the appropriate patients and as well as at the bottom end of the funnel which gets quite narrow in some places allowing people to easily get administered the product once the physician wants to treat the patient.  And there's been a lot of progress on both ends there. On the bottom end of the funnel, there have been best practices emerging where people have linked directly medical record algorithms to positive patients, asking their doctor if they want to get a consult to administer the cocktail, and they've administered lots and lots of doses of monoclonal antibodies and these best practices are emerging around the country.  On the top end, there is still some skepticism that the data is incomplete, that the data isn't robust enough. And we certainly would agree that we don't have the normal data standards that you might have for a full FDA approval, but we remind everybody that we are in the midst of a pandemic where hundreds of thousands of people are going to die and have died. And sometimes, one has to look at the totality of the evidence and make decisions in that regard. So, we continue on the top end education and the logistics on the bottom end.  Marion might want to add something.
Marion McCourt: Chris, I would just add that, as Len pointed out, we continue to work with all of our stakeholders to improve in all dimensions, top level; and at the local level, it is not a traditional commercialization. Under the emergency use authorization, we're working very closely with the government in helping stakeholders with education. The efforts of our medical affairs team in the marketplace has been paramount, our trade and market access group, our policy and government teams. So, we have a lot of work to do. But we are making progress. And I do think that's very, very encouraging.  Most encouraging of all is when we talk to the physicians and KOLs that have used REGEN-COV, they report positive results. And some at this point, some facilities have used antibodies and our antibody cocktail to treat hundreds and thousands of patients. So, the best practices are growing, and we're trying to appropriately accelerate that learning. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan.
Cory Kasimov: On Dupixent, given the time on market and the broad favorable feedback everyone seems to get on the product, why do you believe it's only penetrated roughly 6% in the US for atopic derm? And what do you think is the key here over the next year or two to unlocking a lot more? Thank you.
Marion McCourt: Let me take a stab, Cory, on that. I think that for patients with atopic dermatitis, there had been so little for so long that, over the course of several years now where Dupixent has been in the marketplace, the amazing efficacy, the safety profile, the convenience of use is something that has required a lot of market education and a lot of market understanding.  And across the approved indications that we have in the US today, there are about 2.2 million eligible patients and only about 6% are getting treatment today. So, while favorable results in the understanding of Dupixent with dermatologists, allergists, all of our prescribers and obviously, in asthma, now with pulmonologists and allergists, for nasal polyps with ENTs as well, this is a remarkable alternative across Type 2 disease for approved indications today. But there's a lot of unmet need, and obviously the future indications will take us into new populations and new prescribers.
George Yancopoulos: I also think there's a lot of education that needs to be done, because obviously there's a long legacy in which people believe that drugs that you might take by mouth, things like JAK inhibitors or things like steroids are not as serious drugs as drugs that you take by an injection or biologicals.  And I think that most people – or most sophisticated people are beginning to realize now that it's the biologicals, particularly a drug like Dupixent which is more targeted, more natural, and less prone to an assortment of both on-target and off-target toxicities.  And so, people think, a pill, it's less serious. And I think we have to do a lot of education to explain that these biologicals are actually more targeted, more natural, they can be a lot safer. And though they're more powerful, you don't have to think of them as more serious in a negative way. So, I think there's a huge legacy of thinking of things like that, but the emerging data that's coming out now is going to help, I think, with these points that, if you're suffering from a disease like atopic dermatitis, you want to be on a natural approach, targeted biological, something that has an exquisite safety profile, like Dupixent.
Operator: Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.
Terence Flynn: Thanks, again, for all the work on the COVID front. Really appreciate all the effort. I know you guys have been working hard there. Just a question for George. You mentioned the efficacy signals you're seeing with your MUC16 bispecific in ovarian cancer. Just wondering if you can elaborate a little bit more there. Is that a RECIST response? Is it CA-125 or maybe another biomarker? And then, on the safety front, anything initially you can share there as well? Thank you.
George Yancopoulos: I can tell you when I say efficacy, it relates to both RECIST and CA-125 measures. I don't think that we have given any specifics on that, and we're waiting for an appropriate medical venue in which to present the data, but we are pretty excited about the preliminary evidence of activity. And as I said, we'll be giving all the details at an upcoming scientific meeting.
Operator: Our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges with SVB Leerink. 
Geoffrey Porges: George, a couple of questions on the – allergy related. You sound quite excited about the allergy programs now. And just wondering if you could tell us a little bit about the path forward for peanut allergy and whether you think this will ultimately be a maintenance treatment for a significant population. Thanks.
George Yancopoulos: I think that we're very excited about our entire allergy portfolio because we really think we have a collection of powerful, but also groundbreaking new approaches. So, as we all know, so many people, millions in the United States, are taking, for example, multiple shots weekly to try to get desensitized or undergo these very long prolonged oral approaches and so forth, often with unsatisfying results even after years of therapy. So, I think it's exciting as we announced that we were able to demonstrate a significant improvement in the amount of peanut tolerization that could occur in conjunction with a new oral desensitization approach.  And we think that this is going to prove to be generalizable across the board to many of these desensitization approaches where we hope that Dupixent will aid in making patients more desensitized, maybe able to tolerate these regimens better, as well as maybe improve more quickly.  And that's only one component of our allergy program. We're equally excited about a somewhat unrelated effort. We're the first people who are moving into the clinic antibodies that directly bind and neutralize allergens. I for one don't understand why this hasn't been done before. But our data, some of which we have, talked about publicly and even published, and some of it we will be presenting at upcoming meetings show that these are very powerful approaches. From the first injection, almost immediately, at the first time measures, we're getting the sorts of improvements that you see across studies resulting after years of desensitization therapy.  And we're talking about two of the most important allergies, which are both associated with asthma, in which settings because of safety concerns, desensitization approaches are not indicated. That is cat allergy and birch allergy. The results are really striking. We think this is an entirely new way to fight allergy, one in which you can almost see the benefit immediately. Once again, it's a very natural and biologic and targeted approach. There are millions of people who are affected by these, and I think many of them having – many of them in my family, I can tell you that they would – if we can really continue to show the sort of safety and efficacy that the initial studies are showing, I think a lot of people would welcome the opportunity to take a shot and have immediate benefit in terms of their serious allergies. And it's an entirely new approach.  And all of these things are synergistic, of course. We can imagine many ways in which we can be combining and mixing and matching various parts of our portfolio, including things like Dupixent and these anti-allergens, but with other approaches as well. So, we really think that we may be at the dawn of a whole new era of biologics approach to treating allergy, which I think can really change everything for so many people.  And we know that, according to the CDC, allergic diseases are now approaching and increasing in epidemic proportions. So, there's a real need out there. And there's a real need for totally new approaches. And so we're very excited about them.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ronny Gal with Bernstein.
Ronny Gal: Question around the plan for non-small cell lung cancer. With you guys being so close to the launch, I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit more about your launch plans. It seems that you'll have to use some sort of a targeting approach and segmentation to see where you will be able to penetrate the market given you coming in late. Can you share a little bit more about it? Kind of like what range of upside do we expect from this market? What would you be happy with?
Leonard Schleifer: I want to just make one comment about that we're coming in late, and then say that we probably won't answer our lunch plans. We have to get our final label. And we certainly don't want to tip off any of our competitors of what we're up to. But we're spending a lot of time obviously thinking about that.  But let me just address one comment you made, which was that, you said coming in late. I remember, it may have been you, but it probably was somebody else who asked this question, why were we even bothering with Libtayo in non-small cell lung cancer because by the time you get it approved, there'll be 10 others that are there. And I remember George answering that question saying, well, he's not so sure that there'll be 10 others, all antibodies aren't created equal, plus it would be a foundation for the rest of our business. And that wisdom has really panned out because if you look almost every day, there's another failure of a PD-L1 or an inferior PD-1 that doesn't combine, right? All sorts of things. And there really is only one right now, one gold standard, which is Keytruda. And obviously, we don't have any head to head data.  But when you look at our data, it's really impressive data. And so, we think that we should remind everybody that the questions that we got 5 or 10 years ago, why bother have sort of panned out more the way George had anticipated, rather than maybe everybody else had.  As far as specific lunch plans, we'll ask you to stay tuned because we're working hard at preparing. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Kennen MacKay with RBC Capital Markets.
Kennen MacKay: What a year indeed! Maybe a question on EYLEA. Len, a couple of years ago, you got it completely right on some of the emerging competition not being as big a risk as myself and some of the Street had anticipated would be. Just would love to get your perspective on some of the new data from the Ang2 and sort of how you're thinking about some of the evolving competition there again, given you're certainly right in the path?
Leonard Schleifer: I think George touched on it, but let me deal specifically as best we can for the product you referenced from Roche, which is a combination of anti-VEGF and anti-Ang2. I might start out by saying we have the greatest respect for Roche Genentech, the group, we partner with them in our COVID global efforts, and we watch them really establish the anti-VEGF class with Lucentis. So, we have tremendous respect for them.  But I think when it comes to Ang2, history has a very important lesson here, in that I was with George, I remember it, we were tracking – I was with George when one of his colleagues, they were working so hard to identify, purify and clone and sequence this really important molecule that was seemed to be a critical player in blood vessel formation and development, et cetera. And maybe the only real other critical factor other than VEGF. So, George and his group discovered this molecule, and nobody would like to see it bear fruit in terms of a treatment. But the data that we have just don't support that. Our data, we look very carefully, we could not find the benefit of adding Ang2 to the amazing effects that you get with a highly potent anti-VEGF compound, such as EYLEA.  So, when we look at the data you refer to, we haven't seen all their data and we'll look for it, but from what they've disclosed, some ways in the 40s-percent to be able to get to a 16-week regimen is what George referred to is exactly what EYLEA gets in the ALTAIR study.  So, we don't see so far any evidence – we'll look at the data – that there's anything more there than high dose anti-VEGF therapy, higher than Lucentis on a molar basis. And so, we'll have to wait and see. But one has to remember, though, so that safety, George mentioned, we have 30 million injections under our belt, that's a tremendous safety database. And you can see what happens that there's been a reminder out there just how important the safety side of this is.  So, we'll see. We have great respect for them. But we don't see any data right now to suggest Ang2 blockade is playing any differentiated role, if any role at all. I don't know, George, the discover of Ang2, you want to comment further. 
George Yancopoulos: Just very quickly. As Len said, we discovered the entire family of the angiopoietins. And we obviously made the first and we think the best antibodies against these factors. We tried them in combination studies. I think there is no evidence at all from any of the faricimab data that there's any additional benefit vis-à-vis mechanism of action of the combined blockade of the angiopoietin.  Two, I think that it's sort of a regulatory trick to try to create a differentiated molecule, put both activities within one. We think it's a better, more convincing, frankly, safer approach to actually test both blocking agents separately, rather than combining them in one molecule when there's no benefit other than pure regulatory tricks for combining them into one molecule.  The way we think that the data looks right now, it looks as if this is merely high dose Lucentis. And the data that they've at least reported to date suggests similar data to what we see right now currently with EYLEA. As Len mentioned, we have studies that show that up to 40% of patients can achieve 16-week dosing. I think the important add-on to it is, of course – is that we have our upcoming studies with high dose EYLEA. So, basically, what people are doing are they're taking carbon molecules which didn't fare as well, and they're high dosing them. Okay? We're taking EYLEA and we're high dosing it. And it's already starting at a place where its duration and its efficacy and its safety seem to be leading with really no evidence that the competition has anything significantly different. But now, we're testing the higher dose to see whether we can make EYLEA even better while still delivering the same safety and efficacy.  So, we're pretty excited about that. And as we said, we see there's no evidence that any of the competitors are providing anything different at this point. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman with Credit Suisse.
Evan Seigerman: Thanks for all the work on the COVID-19 antibody. So I'm looking at REGN1979. Assuming that the trial resumes near term, what do you really need to demonstrate in this Phase II, potentially pivotal file for submission next year? I believe you kind of highlighted that earlier in the year. 
George Yancopoulos: I think that, basically, what we have to do is just continue to see the efficacy and build on the duration that we've seen, while continuing to also decrease on any of the safety concerns and so forth. But I think the data, as it stands right now, would be very supportive of an approval as long as we can confirm it in larger numbers. And importantly, build on the already very impressive duration with some responses exceeding the year timeframes. So, we're very excited about it. Obviously, there's always concerns and hurdles we have to get over. But assuming that we can get past them and we can resume enrollment and continue with the study, we hope that the data as it matures and accrues will continue to support that it's an important option that these patients could have. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Yaron Werber with Cowen.
Yaron Werber: George, maybe just for you, you're all very excited about the costim strategy. We'll get data at some point in the late this year or next year. But how do you – when you're thinking about costim with a CD-28 and also hitting the CD-3 axis or the bispecific, how would that work? If you could just give us a preview. 
George Yancopoulos: Just in terms of the costim, so as we've shown in some very high profile papers in Science and Science Translational, basically, nature uses to activate T cells to do their job, particularly, for example, to kill cells. They need signal 1 through the T cell receptor itself, which is a CD-3 is an important components of that. But they also need signal 2 which some people refer to as a costimulatory signal. And so, by combining bispecifics that involve CD-3 engagement and bispecifics that involve CD-28 or costimulatory engagement, you're simultaneously activating both signal 1 and signal 2.  And we have shown rather compellingly in preclinical models that this really accentuates and really dramatically increases the ability of T cells to kill the target itself. Let me also remind you that the PD-1 and other checkpoint inhibitors provide a break. So, you have signal 1 and signal 2, which are driving the cells to kill. And then, you can have a brake signal that acts through checkpoints, such as PD-1. So, combining all three or combining them in pairwise fashion, in animal models, shows that you can just increase the amount of tumor killing that you get as compared with having just one of the approaches.  So, we're just trying to understand what nature does and how nature optimizes the process and then mimic it with these natural approaches to biologics that can activate in a targeted fashion only on the tumor target cells, depending on how well the targeting is, signal 1, signal 2, while releasing the brake.  So, the preclinical data is pretty compelling. And we can only hope that we approach it with what we're going to see in the clinic. And we do think that, over the next year, it's going to be very interesting to see how these dose escalation trials play out. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Luchini with BMO Capital. 
Matthew Luchini: I wanted to quickly come back to EYLEA competitive dynamics and just try to understand a little bit what your internal kind of market research is indicating about physicians' willingness to even really consider new drugs. In other words, maybe you could share a little bit of your perspective on what impact the brolucizumab experience last year has had on their willingness to step away from a proven agent like EYLEA.
Marion McCourt: I'm happy to take it. I'll start with where you ended. I do think that the experience of the Novartis launch reset the table on the importance of safety. And frankly, never assuming safety or assuming efficacy for any category, let alone when you're injecting into someone's eye and seeking to save their vision.  We look at the competitive dynamic, as you know, very, very thoroughly. And I do think that EYLEA during this period of time, the last couple of years, but certainly during the pandemic, the characteristics of the breath of indications, experience, the ability to treat and extend, now in a prefilled syringe for efficiency and throughput in the offices, and this remarkable safety and efficacy profile make it an incredibly compelling choice for retinal specialists and injectors.  We, obviously, even within our own portfolio, look to improvements, like the EYLEA high dose for the future, the ability to treat and extend even further. But obviously, we've very deliberately with our scientific team set very, very high bar for competition.
George Yancopoulos: I think that vision is so important. We all know it, we all treasure it. Okay? And I think that there's, hopefully, a new – a realization once again about how important it is and how a catastrophic event that causes permanent loss of vision can be so catastrophic and so damning. And I think that when you have such a safe and effective agent, with such an experience, one really has to take into consideration the risks, the potential catastrophic risks of trying new approaches, unknown safety risks with the potential catastrophic risk. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal with Citigroup. 
Mohit Bansal: Congrats on the progress. In our conversations with experts, doctors did talk about the potential use of Dupixent in milder patients, given the safety. So, to that end, do you need to do a clinical trial to get there? Or do you think it is already happening to some extent at dermatologists' offices? Thank you.
Marion McCourt: The profile today for Dupixent treatment is for patients with moderate to severe disease, both in atopic dermatitis and also for patients that require biologic asthma treatment. I'll let team members talk about additional clinical work to that component. But that is our focus of the population. As we discussed earlier, in the US alone, we probably have about 2.2 million eligible patients, just on the indications where we have approval today. But to your comment, what I hear about time and time again from our physician prescribers and key opinion leaders is the remarkable safety profile based on a very specific mechanism of action. And that confidence in being able to treat not only adults, now the younger age groups where we have indications, for example, in atopic dermatitis, not only for adolescence, but on pediatric patients down to six years of age.
George Yancopoulos: I think it's a great question and it reflects back on this issue about penetration and so forth. It didn't take much market research to know how Dupixent was initially being used or how most drugs are used. Though it was approved, for example, in the moderate to severe population in atopic dermatitis, all physicians initially started with their toughest, their hardest, their most serious patients before then gradually going backwards in the treatment paradigm. And that is one of the reasons why we're only penetrating about 6% of the moderate to severe population. So, I think that gradually, with more confidence, they're going to treat people who are on the more moderate side of things.  That said, I think the point that – the efficacy profile, but also the mechanism of action, the fact that you are probably in the long term may be benefiting the patient in terms of slowing or preventing the ultimate atopic marks that occurs in so many patients demands that we figure out a way to take this product to earlier patients. Those will, however, require additional studies. We're trying to figure out the best way to do it. But I for one do think that, for example, many more patients with much milder asthma or other milder forms of Type 2 disease that we know in many patients is just going to get worse over time. We owe these patients – we have to figure out through a clinical program, how to do the right studies, how to convince the FDA and how to move this treatment back towards these earlier patients.
Justin Holko : Thanks everyone for joining the call. Thank you for hanging in there a little longer than normal. Bob Landry and the investor relations team will be around after the call. We hope you enjoy your weekend. Please stay safe. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-11-05 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker Justin Holko. Please go ahead, sir.

Once our call concludes, Bob Landry and the IR team will be available to answer further questions. With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Dr. Leonard Schleifer.
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: Thank you, Justin, and thanks to everyone joining today's call. In the third quarter, Regeneron delivered another strong financial performance of double-digit top and bottom line growth while achieving numerous milestones in our research and development pipeline and making remarkable progress against COVID-19 with our novel antibody cocktail. Importantly, our growth and financial strength is being fueled by an increasingly diversified set of revenue and earnings streams while we invest in R&D for the long term. Furthermore, our results show the importance of products that meaningfully address serious medical needs and have the power to transform lives even during a pandemic. EYLEA is a great example. EYLEA Global net sales were $2.1 billion in the quarter and grew 9% compared to the same period last year. In the U.S., sales rebounded from second quarter COVID lows to $1.3 billion and grew 11% versus prior year. The efficacy, safety and convenience that EYLEA offers in protecting eyesight had proven to be highly valued by treating physicians and their patients as the product again outperformed the anti-VEGF market for retinal diseases. Next, we continue to build momentum with Dupixent as we in Sanofi recorded our first ever quarter of more than $1 billion in sales. This milestone speaks to the power of Dupixent across a broad array of type 2 inflammatory diseases and to our team's ability to execute despite COVID-19. Adding to this momentum, we've recently announced results from another successful Phase III trial, this time in pediatric asthma. We are eager to submit these data for regulatory review and expect that Dupixent will remain a robust and durable growth driver for years to come. In oncology, we are solidifying our leadership position in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Additionally, the FDA has granted priority review for our regulatory filings in lung cancer and basal cell carcinoma as we prepare for potential launches in these indications early next year. Regeneron is also making critical advancements in the treatment of infectious diseases. Last month, the FDA approved Inmazeb, the first-ever treatment for Ebolba virus infection. Building upon our work in Ebola, our team and rapid response technologies have developed our novel REGN-COV2 antibody cocktail in the fight against COVID-19. Last week, we announced another major data set from our outpatient study that showed our antibody cocktail significantly reduced viral loads as well as medically attended visits, such as emergency room visits and hospitalizations. We have submitted these data to regulators and eagerly await guidance on next steps. In closing, we could not be prouder of our teams and everything they have been able to achieve across the organization in the third quarter and in 2020 to date. Our momentum is accelerating with an impressive growth profile. In 2021, we look forward to building upon that momentum with several important launches for Libtayo, Dupixent and other programs, further enhancing our diverse growth platform. We are excited by the progress we are making against COVID-19, and we are confident that our investments in R&D to broaden and advance our pipeline across all stages will position Regeneron well for sustained growth. Now I'll turn the call over to George.
Dr. George Yancopoulos: Thanks, Len. And as Len just pointed out, we are advancing programs across all stages of our diverse and growing portfolio. With the pandemic unfortunately still raging and even escalating, we know there's a lot of focus on COVID 19, and we will start with our REGN-COV2 program. From the beginning, there was a lot of attention to our efforts against the coronavirus because of our success using a similar approach with Ebola. As you just heard from Len, we received FDA approval for our Ebola cocktail that our team delivered, validating our approach for not only this, but other deadly infectious diseases and particularly COVID-19. We're investigating REGN-COV2, our antibody cocktail for COVID-19 in infected patients as well as for prevention in several ongoing clinical trials. Earlier this year, we released a descriptive analysis of the first 275 patients in the REGN-COV2 seamless Phase II/III trial in ambulatory patients. Importantly, we obtained insights into the natural history of COVID-19 from these early data. Large numbers of patients normally generate their own antibodies against the virus early on, and this robust endogenous immune response is associated with rapid clearance of the virus and decreased need for medical attention. That's why most patients do so well. However, some patients are slow to mount an immune response and are at higher risk for attended medical visits. In line with this observation, our initial analysis show that providing our exogenous antibody cocktail did not provide much benefit to the fast responders, but it benefit those who did not mount their own immune responses efficiently, allowing REGN-COV2 to clear virus more rapidly and decrease the need for future medical attention in these otherwise slow responders. Last week, we provided important updates from this ongoing study in ambulatory COVID-19 patients. In a formal statistical way, we presented prospective validation of our earlier observation in a confirmatory analysis involving more than 500 additional patients. Data showed significant viral load reductions in patients treated with REGN-COV2 compared to placebo. And consistent with earlier data, these results were driven by the patients who had not mounted their own effective immune response at the time of treatment or had high viral loads at baseline. Importantly, results in the combined analysis of the first 799 patients enrolled in the study demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in medically attended visits, including hospitalizations and emergency room visits. This effect was most prominent with patients with high risk factors, high viral loads and those who had not yet mounted their own immune response. We shared these data with the FDA as an update to our EUA submission and await regulatory feedback. We are investigating the potential benefit of this REGN-COV2 cocktail in different stages of disease in our other ongoing studies, our household contact study, which is testing the cocktail as a prophylactic treatment, and it has enrolled approximately 1,000 patients to date. In hospitalized patients, we have 2 ongoing studies, our study as well as the U.K. RECOVERY Protocol. All Regeneron-sponsored COVID-19 treatment trials are being supervised by the same independent data monitoring committee, which recently recommended that we pause enrollment in 2 cohorts representing the most severe hospitalized patients, while recommending that all our other studies continue as initially designed, including the 2 less severe patient cohorts in our hospitalized patient study. Since the lower of the 2 REGN-COV2 doses demonstrated the activity comparable to the higher dose, suggesting that both doses maximize the benefit of this approach, we intend to investigate even lower doses going forward. If effective, this could allow us to extend the benefit of our cocktail to even more patients. As we await next steps on the regulatory front, we continue to ramp up production for REGN-COV2. Under our U.S. government agreement, we now expect to have 2.4-gram treatment doses ready for approximately 80,000 patients by the end of this month, 200,000 total doses ready by the first week of January and approximately 300,000 total doses ready by the end of January. We continue to increase our in-house production capacity for further doses of REGN-COV2 and are thrilled to be partnering with Roche to substantially expand global capacity of REGN-COV2 as their production comes online early next year. Moving on to Dupixent. We recently announced positive Phase III data in asthma for children ages 6 to 11. In this study, Dupixent reduced severe asthma attacks by up to 65% versus placebo over one year, and Dupixent also rapidly and sustainably improve lung function in these children. We are planning to file these data with regulators early next year. Additionally, in Europe, we received a positive CHMP committee recommendation for Dupixent in atopic dermatitis in children ages 6 to 11. The Dupixent clinical program continues to progress and expand across a wide range of type 2 inflammatory conditions. In September, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation for Dupixent in eosinophilic esophagitis based on early Phase III results, which were recently presented at medical meetings. Before the end of the year, we expect to report Phase II data of Dupixent in combination with oral immunotherapy for peanut allergy. Additionally, Phase III studies are ongoing in several additional dermatology and pulmonary indications with readouts expected in 2022 and 2023, and we expect to begin additional Phase III pivotal trials by the end of the year. Putting this all together, Dupixent will soon be pivotal trials for 8 type 2 diseases that are not currently in the label and could address disease in nearly 1 million additional patients in the United States alone. Dupixent is also an important part of our 2-pronged approach against chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, along with etokimab, our anti interleukin-33 antibody. Based on achieving a prespecified efficacy milestone in an interim analysis of our first Phase III study in type 2 COPD, we initiated a second Dupixent Phase III study. Data readouts are expected in 2023. We believe that our anti IL-33 antibody could help an additional group of COPD patients beyond those with type 2 disease. Based on a proof-of-concept data that has been submitted for publication, we believe that blocking IL-33 could be especially useful in the former smoker COPD patient subset. The pivotal etokimab program, consisting of 2 parallel Phase III studies, will initiate by year-end. We hope that Dupixent and etokimab can provide real benefit for the many desperate patients suffering from COPD. Moving on to oncology and first Libtayo. At the European Society for Clinical Oncology, the ESMO meeting in September, we shared results of our first pivotal -- of our pivotal first line non-small cell lung cancer study as well as our locally advanced basal cell carcinoma or BCC study. These data are now filed as supplemental label applications with the regulators with the FDA recently awarding priority review for approval of Libtayo as a monotherapy in a proposed lung cancer indication with an action date of February 28, 2021. We also announced that we completed enrollment in the Libtayo chemotherapy combination trial in first line lung cancer with first results from this study available as early as next year. Also, the BCC results presented at ESMO showed that Libtayo has the potential to be the first approved treatment with a clinical benefit in the advanced BCC setting following failure of a hedgehog inhibitor. The FDA granted a priority review for our BCC filing with an action date of March 3, 2021. We continue to make significant progress with Libtayo as a foundation to our oncology strategy. Moving on to our oncology bispecific efforts. We are in a pivotal program in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas for our CD20xCD3 bispecific [indiscernible] also known as REGN1979. We are working towards initiating a pivotal program for REGN5458, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. And in solid tumors, dose escalation for REGN4018, our MUC16xCD3 bispecific continues in the first-in-human study in ovarian cancer in which we are observing preliminary evidence of activity. We are excited about the encouraging data we are observing in the studies of our CD3 class of bispecifics. However, we believe that our key potential advantage over other approaches is our ability to mix and match these CD3 bispecifics with not only our anti-PD-1, but also with our next class of bispecifics, the novel CD28 or costimulatory bispecifics. Our CD3 bispecifics currently in the clinic are designed to be paired with matching costim bispecifics for targets on a variety of different cancers with the intent to synergistically unleash the power of immuno-oncology more broadly than currently approved treatments. Our first costim bispecific, PSMAxCD28, in combination with Libtayo for prostate cancer is progressing through dose escalation cohorts, and thus far, the therapy is well tolerated. We will soon start trials with 2 novel costims, MUC16xCD28 in combination with either our MUC16xCD3 bispecific or with Libtayo for ovarian cancer. And our EGFRxCD28 in combination with Libtayo for solid tumors, including in lung, head and neck and colorectal cancers. The first member of a third class of tumor-targeting bispecifics, our MET X MET bispecific, has recently completed dose escalation and is currently in the dose expansion phase of the first-in-human trial. Remember, this bispecific targets 2 distinct epitopes on the MET oncogene, causing rapid internalization of this receptor and ablation of its signaling. MET mutations are present in 3% to 4% in MET gene amplifications and about another 3% of non-small cell lung cancers. Across our pipeline, we are pleased with the progress we are making across all stages of our rich oncology portfolio to compete, enhance and extend the power of immuno-oncology to more patients suffering from a wide variety of cancers. Beyond oncology, our pipeline continues to expand. In our C5 program, we will shortly begin dosing healthy volunteers in combination with Alnylam's C5 RNAi inhibitor, cemdisiran. The goal of the combination approach is to achieve convenient self-administration with a subcutaneous dosage form in addition to the more complete and durable blockade of the complement activation in patients suffering from paroxysmal nocturnal hematuria and other complement-mediated diseases. This will be the first example of a combination of an antibody with an RNAi against the same target. And we believe that this could be the first in a series innovative antibody RNA combination that could change the treatment paradigm in multiple disease settings. We are also excited about additional collaborative programs with Alnylam, including utilization of their siRNA approach against targets that we have identified through our Regeneron Genetic Center. As Alnylam has just announced, we have initiated dosing in sRNA against one such target, HSD17B13, for the treatment of NASH. Additionally, I want to acknowledge an important milestone for another innovative collaboration we have with Intellia. In the very near term, the first patient should be dosed with the groundbreaking systemically delivered CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing therapy, a potential one-and-done treatment for transthyretin amyloidosis or ATTR. As the first systemically administered gene editing intervention, we hope that this will provide proof-of-concept for future systemic gene editing efforts. Alnylam and Intellia collaborations represent an important new strategy for Regeneron as we attempt to broaden our efforts in the future of genetic therapies where we combine our capabilities and expertise to help empower those of our partners and to help change the practice of medicine and make new forms of gene therapy a reality. By the end of this year, we and our collaborators will have introduced 8 new investigational therapies into the clinic, an accomplishment we are proud of in a challenging year. To conclude, we are looking forward to several catalysts over the next several months. We expect imminent updates and additional data readouts on our REGN-COV2 therapy, first regulatory approval for evinacumab by February of next year, approval for first line lung cancer and basal cell carcinoma indications for Libtayo, filing for Dupixent in pediatric asthma and many more to come. It is a very exciting time at Regeneron. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Marion.
Marion McCourt: Thank you, George. Our third quarter commercial results reflect a solid execution across our core brands, EYLEA, Dupixent and Libtayo. We remain confident that the competitive strengths of our growing and diversified commercial portfolio will carry us through and beyond the COVID-19 environment. I'm going to begin with EYLEA, which grew 9% year-over-year to approximately $2.1 billion in global net sales. In the U.S., EYLEA grew 11% year-over-year with net sales of more than $1.3 billion as the anti-VEGF demand recovered. In the U.S., EYLEA outperformed the category with shared gains from both branded and unbranded competition. In fact, EYLEA's share of the branded U.S. category grew to more than 70% for the quarter based on volume, and EYLEA remains the #1 prescribed anti-VEGF therapy in wet AMD and diabetic eye disease. Patient volume increased as those who delayed treatment earlier this year have returned to retina offices. EYLEA's market-leading clinical profile offering dosing flexibility, real-world experience and established safety led to a quicker recovery and stronger growth across all indications than the competition. EYLEA's flexible 12-week dosing regimen in wet AMD and the newly launched prefilled syringe also support EYLEA's market-leading value proposition. We are monitoring the recent spike in coronavirus cases across the country. In some hotspots, retina offices are beginning to see some modest reductions in patient volume, which may impact future EYLEA demand. That said, retina offices have become highly effective in managing their patients in this environment compared to the early days of the pandemic. In summary, EYLEA had an impressive quarter. Turning next to Libtayo. Third quarter global net sales grew to $96 million. In the U.S., net sales were $72 million with consistent and steady volume growth aided by the gradual reopening of infusion centers and an increase in breadth of prescribing. Libtayo continues to drive overall market growth in advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and remains the most prescribed systemic treatment for CSCC. EYLEA remains the anti-PD-1 of choice with nearly 90% market share of the class. The overall profile of high response rate with many complete and durable responses positions Libtayo for continued growth. To fuel additional growth, we anticipate 2 new potential indication launches in non-small cell lung cancer and basal cell carcinoma in the first quarter of 2021. For basal cell carcinoma, we aim to build upon our success in CSCC and establish Libtayo as the standard of care for non-melanoma skin cancers. We expect Libtayo to be first-in-class and will work to establish it as the standard of care in second line BCC. Non-small cell lung cancer is the largest opportunity within the PD-1 space with more than 200,000 new diagnosis of lung cancer in the U.S. each year. We plan to leverage our oncology presence as the majority of treatment centers and oncologists are familiar with Libtayo in CSCC. We believe that patients, providers and payers prefer choice in determining the most appropriate treatment. Libtayo demonstrated an overall survival benefit in a real world, higher-risk population of patients, including patients with stable brain metastases, infections and progressive disease. These data, along with an additional product attributes, support Libtayo as a potential new option for anti-PD-1 monotherapy in the treatment paradigm. Finally, moving to Dupixent. Global net sales in the second quarter were $1.1 billion, representing 69% growth compared to the prior year. In the U.S., broad-based growth across all indications contributed net sales of $851 million. Among all specialties, patient visits improved throughout the quarter as the health care field has adapted to treating patients in the COVID environment. Current weekly new patient starts have recovered and are nearing pre-pandemic levels. The 300-milligram pre-filled pen was launched this quarter, providing additional patient convenience and choice. Atopic dermatitis remains Dupixent's largest indication and is a significant growth driver based on its rapid onset, proven efficacy and well-established safety profile. We continue to expand prescribing across both moderate and severe disease. Despite the impressive growth trajectory since launch, a low percentage of biologic eligible patients have been treated, leaving substantial opportunity for more patients to benefit. Our ongoing launches for both adolescents and pediatric patients are progressing very well. Since the May launch of the pediatric indication, we are seeing encouraging trends, comparable to the adolescent launch where initiations grew rapidly and HCPs were quick to prescribe. Significant runway is evident with approximately 400,000 adolescents and 90,000 children in this country that could benefit from Dupixent therapy. Moving to asthma, Dupixent continues to perform well in the competitive asthma space based on its clinical efficacy and safety profile. Our national DTC campaign is well underway, and we are seeing an uptick in new initiations. We look forward to submitting our pediatric clinical data to regulators, which could lead to further label expansion and benefit as many as 75,000 eligible children. Additionally, we see strong uptick in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. Since approval last year, patients have been initiated on Dupixent regardless of prior surgery, while the availability of elective surgeries has improved as healthcare facilities have reopened. Demand for Dupixent remained strong among ENTs and allergists. Dupixent is making an important contribution to our business, and we're excited about the significant opportunity for future growth from our in-line business and from new potential indications, age groups and geographies. In closing, our commercial teams delivered strong performance across our diversified portfolio. We have a set of meaningfully differentiated products that are growing despite COVID-19. Additionally, we will enter a new phase of launches in 2021, including evinacumab for HOFH, pediatric asthma for Dupixent and lung and BCC for Libtayo. These launches will add to our momentum and the significant growth of our business. These are very exciting times at Regeneron. I'll turn the call to Bob.
Bob Landry: Thank you, Marion. For the third quarter of 2020, Regeneron delivered strong based growth on both the top and bottom lines, resulting from continued execution across all aspects of our business. Improving Dupixent profitability and contributions from additional revenue sources highlight the continued diversification of our business. For the third quarter, total revenues grew 32% year-over-year to $2.29 billion, driven by strong U.S. EYLEA growth and higher Sanofi collaboration revenues as a result of increased Dupixent sales and achievement of a $50 million sales milestone. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share grew 25% year-over-year to $8.36 on non-GAAP net income of $961 million. Since Marion discussed our U.S. EYLEA results, I will start with our Bayer and Sanofi collaborations. Starting with the Bayer collaboration. Ex U.S. EYLEA net product sales reported to us by Bayer were $780 million, representing a growth of 7% on a reported basis, compared to the prior year and a 22% improvement from second quarter 2020 lows. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $300 million, of which we recorded $288 million for our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $353 million in the third quarter. Our share of the profits from the commercialization of non-IO antibodies was $213 million. This compares favorably to profits of $94 million in the prior year, which was primarily driven by higher Dupixent profits. We also recognized a $50 million milestone payment from Sanofi as a result of Dupixent, Praluent and Kevzara ex U.S. sales achieving $1 billion in the trailing 12-month period. Next, we announced in July a $450 million supply agreement with the U.S. government for batches of REGN-COV2. We record sales as batches are supplied to the government. In the third quarter of 2020, under this agreement, we recorded an initial $40 million of sales for REGN-COV2. We expect that in the fourth quarter of 2020, we will record sales approximating half of the value of this agreement. Sales for the remaining batches are expected to be recorded in the first quarter of 2021. In other revenue, we recorded $159 million versus $37 million in the prior year. The primary driver of this increase is the recognition of $70 million from the U.S. government associated with reimbursements of our Ebola and REGN-COV2 development recognition of $28 million in connection with the Regeneron Genetic Center sequencing a certain number of exomes as well as a reimbursement for ex U.S. supply of Praluent to Sanofi. Looking ahead to fourth quarter in 2021, we expect the other revenue line to trend lower in the absence of an RGC milestone and reduced reimbursements from the U.S. government on Ebola. Moving to our expense base and starting with R&D. Non-GAAP R&D increased 35% year-over-year to $629 million, driven by significant clinical development costs for our REGN-COV2 antibody cocktail, higher headcount to support our expanding pipeline, increased clinical manufacturing activities and continued advancement of our partner programs with Alnylam, Intellia and other early-stage partners. Next, non-GAAP SG&A expense increased 10% year-over-year to $291 million. The year-over-year increase was largely driven by increased headcount as well as commercial costs for EYLEA and Praluent. Cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing was $143 million, compared to $110 million in the third quarter of 2019, primarily due to increased sales of Dupixent. Non-GAAP cost of goods increased 22% from the prior year related to higher sales of Libtayo and the inclusion of sales from Praluent and REGN-COV2. Turning now to taxes. The non-GAAP effective tax rate was 16.3% in the third quarter of 2020, compared to 13.6% in the third quarter of 2019, primarily due to discrete items to the quarters. Shifting now to cash flow and the balance sheet. Regeneron continues to maintain a strong balance sheet, ending the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $5.9 billion. Our third quarter free cash flow was negatively impacted by the extension of EYLEA payment terms to support physician offices during COVID. We expect this will reverse in 2021 as payment terms return to normal. Additionally, in the quarter, we issued $2 billion of long-term debt, leveraging historically low interest rates while decreasing our cost of capital. With the issuance of this debt, we expect to incur approximately $45 million of incremental interest expense on an annual basis. Finally, we repurchased $100 million of stock in the third quarter as part of our $1 billion Board-authorized share buyback program. Now I'd like to spend a few moments to provide updates to our full year 2020 guidance. We updated our guidance on several expense line items where, in many cases, we either lowered or narrowed guidance range. Please refer to our press release for our entire updated 2020 guidance. Specific to R&D. We are revising upward our forecasted 2020 non-GAAP R&D expense to be in the range of $2.42 billion to $2.47 billion. While we increased R&D guidance on our second call to reflect REGN-COV2 expenses, we have since substantially expanded the scope and enrollment targets across the REGN-COV2 clinical program, which will result in increased expenses in the fourth quarter and into first half 2021. Also, while we are not providing 2021 guidance today, we do expect that 2021 full year R&D expenses will increase to fund in advancing and expanding pipeline as well as early stage partnership assets. In conclusion, Regeneron's business remains healthy, and we continued to deliver strong year-over-year growth as we diversify our revenue and earnings and advance our robust pipeline. We remain well positioned for future growth with healthy core brands and multiple near-term launches while investing in our R&D engine to drive longer-term growth. With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Justin.
Justin Holko: Thank you, Bob. Deborah, that concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call for Q&A. We have more than 20 callers in the queue. So to ensure that we are able to address as many callers as possible, we will answer one question from each caller before moving to the next. Please go ahead, Deborah.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll go with our first question. We've got Carter Gould with Barclays.
Carter Gould: I guess for George and Len, clearly, a lot of enthusiasm around the potential for the costims as we look to some of those readouts. I guess when we look to 2021, are we going to have a clear signal if these are living up to their promise in 2021? I know moving through some of these dose escalations takes time, but do you guys have confidence we'll be in a position to have a clear read on if they're living up to their hype next year?
Dr. George Yancopoulos: Well, it all depends on, as you said, these dose escalation studies, how they progress and proceed, we certainly hope that we will be getting signals of efficacy sooner rather than later, but it all depends on the clinical development and how that all goes. But we remain incredibly enthusiastic and excited about this class, and we're investing enormously. As I said, we have pairs of CD3 and CD28 bispecifics for numerous different cancers, not only the ones that are already in the clinic, but ones that will be entering into the pipeline over the next year or 2 or 3. So we're very excited about this class and the potential of combining them with the 2 sets of bispecifics as well as with the PD-1.
Justin Holko:
Operator: And your next question comes from Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler.
Chris Raymond: Just on REGN-COV2. Just wondering if you could walk through the biology behind why there would be a safety signal in these vented or high-flow oxygenated patients. I mean, I guess, especially given how clean it looked in mild-to-moderate cases, is there some threshold of viral load? Or is it underlying overactivation of the immune system that's driving this problem? And can you maybe describe the ADEs, please?
Dr. George Yancopoulos: So first of all, we should point out that we remain blinded to what's going on in those 2 cohorts that were paused. They weren't halted, they were paused so that the IDMC could evaluate the ongoing patients and then decide what to do going forward. We do not know whether there really is any safety signal. And as you said, I think theoretically, there is not really a great deal of rationale why there might be a safety signal there. You could come up with all sorts of complicated scenarios to explain it. But until we're unblinded to the data, until we really get to look at it, at this point, it could simply be that there's lack of efficacy or maybe even early trends which will reverse. So as you said, theoretically, it does not make a great deal of sense. I think the whole concept of what they call ADE or antibody-dependent enhancement, is something that does not look like it's really playing a role in this disease. So we remain hopeful that there is not going to be a safety signal and eventually, at least in some subset of these patients, even the hospitalized patients that we may provide a benefit.
Operator: Your next question comes from Evan Seigerman with Crédit Suisse.
Evan Seigerman: I'll limit it to one. So in the 10-Q, you listed the EUA for the AB cocktail during this quarter. Is this official guidance from the FDA? And any idea as to what patient population that this EUA would be granted for?
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: So it's Len. We have said that we are focusing on the patient population where the data comes from, which is outpatients who have the best baseline characteristics, which would make us think that they would benefit the most, whether that's risk factors or high viral titer or eventually perhaps low antibodies. Those are the sorts of patients we are focused on as an outpatient. There is no PDUFA time line for the EUA. We expect action in the relative near future, but there's no guarantee that will come. The FDA is doing a very careful analysis. We can tell from the kinds of questions we're getting. And we hope that it will be -- reach a successful conclusion. But we don't know the time line because there are no specific time lines. We do know they're working just about as hard as we can imagine and have seen the FDA work. So we're hopeful soon, we'll get an answer.
Operator: Your next question comes from Yatin Suneja with Guggenheim Partners.
Yatin Suneja: Question is on EYLEA. Obviously, a very solid quarter. Can you maybe just give us some sense on the relative contribution from AMD versus other indication? How the market share is evolving in DME? What level of penetration you have achieved? And then obviously, COVID is spiking in the Q4...
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: Well, you have to ask one question. So far you're up to 3. Marion can handle the first one.
Marion McCourt: I'll do -- I will do my best. And first, let me comment that in the times of pandemic, there probably was more of an impact on patients with diabetic eye disease not either receiving a diagnosis or coming in for treatment, but were starting to see recovery in that. I'm pleased to report that on the split of use of EYLEA by indication, we are approaching 60% for wet AMD, which means over 40% of our business is coming from other indications inclusive of the diabetic eye disease. So on balance, we continue to see diabetic eye disease as our largest future opportunity going forward, but we are the market-leading anti-VEGF therapy across all indications.
Operator: Your next question comes from Yaron Werber with Cowen.
Yaron Werber: Just a quick follow-up on the REGN-COV2. The ongoing studies, George, are still across all patients, not just seronegatives. You clearly saw activity in seronegatives. Lilly sort of, obviously, both with their single and combo, really didn't see the same data. So any explanation to that? And why are you still sort of doing studies across all patients?
Dr. George Yancopoulos: Yes. I'm not sure what you mean by Lilly didn't see the same thing. They didn't actually look for where their effect was. And right now, the way the program works is, we are not having any evidence of any untoward effect and maybe just a very small benefit in the seropositive patients who have their own antibodies. I think that if one could actually do point-of-care testing, which is unfortunately, at this moment, not immediately available in most cases. Once the drug might be available, let's say, under an EUA, you might want to limit it to patients based on those characteristics. However, because the benefit/risk does not have any evidence of negative untoward effects in those individuals, one could just treat the entire population, even though the benefit is mostly driven by those who, as we described, are seronegative, have higher viral loads and/or have high risk factors.
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: Yes. Just -- so just to amplifying on what George said, Yaron, and he said it, I just think it's worth repeating that we did see an effect in the overall population. It's just, as he said, that effect was driven by the people who needed the antibody and that they hadn't mounted their own immune response. That observation, which is something that the team predicted, which is that people who mounted their own immune response wouldn't benefit so much from giving them more of an antibody makes perfect sense. And those that hadn't mounted their own immune response would benefit much more also makes perfect sense, and that is exactly what they saw. And you even see it in the placebo-treated patients that if you don't have antibodies, you start with a very high viral load. If you do have antibodies, you're already 3 logs lower. So all of the biology that George and the team predicted and described was borne out in a very exciting way. So I think it's just a matter of where you see the effect being driven by, not whether or not you can treat an entire population.
Dr. George Yancopoulos: And I'm sure, by the way, if Lilly did the same detailed analysis, they would see that their benefit would also be driven by the same sets of patients. They just didn't do those analyses.
Justin Holko: Next question please.
Operator: Next question comes from Geoffrey Porges with SVB Leerink.
Geoffrey Porges: Just a follow-up question on COV2. I'm just not sure how this is going to work. We can't even execute testing in this country reliably. So how are you going to screen the individuals who aren't mounting an immune response on an outpatient basis and then initiate treatment on an outpatient basis? It's just confusing. So help us understand that. And would it be sensible to treat everybody going to hospital for elective procedures of any kind or something else along those lines? It's just a little confusing how you're going to use this medicine.
Dr. George Yancopoulos: Right. I think what -- as we just said, and as Len amplified on, the effect is seen in the overall population. It's just driven by those individuals who have the characteristics that we described. The notion is that just as in the clinical studies, it could be given to all of the eligible outpatients because there is no risk to be -- to the individuals who won't benefit the most. So I think that -- the strategy, of course, I think, would be taken would be to limit the drug right now without doing any of the advanced screening and so forth. But to the people who are at the highest risk of progressing to needing medical attention, give it to those people, irregardless if you don't have the point-of-care testing, irregardless of their baseline viral load or their antibody status. In the future, if such testing became available, then you might not want to waste the drug on the people who might not benefit. But initially, I think it would be given to the people who are at the highest risk of developing complications with the goal of preventing those. As we showed in the study, you will reduce dramatically the need for further medical attention. If you give it to individuals and the higher risk the population that you give it to, the NMT goes down. But the only reason really to limit it at this point is because there's going to be limitations for the amount of doses available to treat.
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: Yes. Let me just also add to that, Geoff, 2 things. First of all, as -- I think George pointed out in his presentation when we first disclosed this data. There's a very high correlation between the baseline viral load and whether or not you have antibodies. It's -- on average, you're 3 logs higher if you don't have antibodies and viral load. So you could use viral load. And everybody who's going to get treated has a viral load test. They have a PCR test. It's reported as -- back as positive, but there's actual cycle time. So I think the testing of reporting -- a testing doesn't necessarily have to change, perhaps the reporting has to change in terms of what your cycle time is. A very low cycle time, meaning very high viral load predicts low or no antibodies. So that could be used, as George said, to screen patients. The second thing is our partner, Roche, is really one -- probably is the leading company for testing. They have a platform for antibodies that can test hundreds of millions of people per quarter, and it's deployed in, I think, like 70,000 different points of care. So we're working with them to see whether that test can be validated with our dataset or not. So I think there are lots of ways to get at this. You could use -- you can treat everybody, obviously, limiting to the people who have risk factors or you could start to narrow it down to people who have high viral load, low cycle time or eventually with our partners' capabilities, people who at point-of-care have no antibodies. So I think there's a lot of flexibility. It's just that we don't have all this buttoned down in this emergency situation. And it will probably evolve fairly quickly if we get an EUA.
Dr. George Yancopoulos: But just to simplify, initially, we believe it will be used in the overall population based on risk factors with that regard to serology or viral load. And as Len said, eventually, as these approaches evolve and change, it may allow targeting of the drug to those who might even benefit the most.
Justin Holko : Next question please.
Operator: Your next question comes from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan.
Cory Kasimov: I have plenty more on COV2, but given the number we've already had there, I'll change the subject. I want to ask Bob about the R&D spend and really thinking about trends going forward. So in terms of the investment you're making on the antibody cocktail, how long do you expect this to kind of persist for? And just kind of overall, wondering if you can give us any sneak peak into 2021?
Bob Landry: Sure. Thanks, Cory. Let me see if I can give you a little bit of color. So as I said in our prepared remarks, we're not going to provide 2021 R&D guidance today. We do expect that next year's R&D expenses will be higher to support pretty much everything that George said with regards to the expanding pipeline, early stage assets, the partnerships with Alnylam and Intellia, which are really starting to blossom and certainly our ongoing COVID-19 efforts. If you look at 2020, where we sit right now, we anticipate spend of approximately $400 million on our efforts against COVID-19 within the year of 2020. So if you back that spend out from our full year 2020 non-GAAP R&D guidance midpoint, our underlying growth rate in R&D spend, excluding the COVID program efforts, is trending about 15% higher than our 2019 as our -- as we move forward. So Cory, I would use that kind of as a stake in the ground in terms of where we're going to go. I mean, certainly, our COVID-19 spending is going to continue on. People can see on clinicaltrials.gov the extent of the programs that we have, trials that we have going, that will play a factor into 2021.
Justin Holko: Next question please.
Operator: Your next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist.
Robyn Karnauskas: Another one on COV2. So just because it seems like this pandemic is just getting much worse in the United States and globally, can you talk about your efforts to expand manufacturing next year beyond the 300,000? And then I was just curious, given how profile it was that the President and others got a different combination therapies, can you biologically talk about your thoughts on should this drug be combined with Dex or other drugs immediately upfront biologically? And when would you just start like maybe a combo trial that would sort of evaluate that, sort of really make sure that this is a cure rather than just reducing the viral load and reducing time to recover in some patients?
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: Right. George can -- sorry, I was going to say, George can deal with that. I was going to just deal quickly with the manufacturing question, which is we are scaling up and we expect to be able to make substantially more next year than we were able to make this year. Obviously, we'll have a full year of manufacturing, which we didn't -- we did not have a full year of manufacturing to deliver the 300,000 doses. And we expect to have more facilities that are now operational and dedicated, plus we expect to multiply that with our partner, Roche, who really has been a terrific partner so far. And they, as you know -- because we see their might because we compete with them in many fronts, they're really sophisticated in the biologics space with their Genentech history and the manufacturing capacity. And they're working very hard to bring online very enhanced and large manufacturing capacity. I'll let George deal with the question about combination therapy.
Dr. George Yancopoulos: Yes. I think the most important thing to note is because the mechanism of action, our treatment is just an antibody that is essentially analogous to the endogenous antibodies that many of the individuals are making. As I described, we're just providing it to those people who are either slow or failing to make their own antibodies. There's no expectation and no mechanistic rationale for any safety interactions of concern. There should not be any reason why you couldn't mix this with essentially any drug that doesn't have untoward side effects because all we're doing is giving you more of the antibodies that your body normally makes. So that said, you could theoretically combine our treatment with any other treatment without any reason to believe that there would be negative interactions. I remind you that right now, where our data stands and where we are -- we have filed for the EUA is in the outpatient setting, where these other modalities are not being given at this point. So it's going to take future studies plus analyses in the hospitalized patients where you look at patients who had combination therapies to determine whether patients who have these combinations do better than patients who just receive one or the other therapy alone. But in the outpatient setting, right now with our data, it will be our antibody because those are not patients where remdesivir or dexamethasone is currently a standard of care.
Justin Holko: Next question please. Next question.
Operator: Alethia Young with Cantor.
Alethia Young: I just want you guys to talk a little bit about the potential growth opportunity you see there. Obviously, you've had incredible launch so far, but you've gone deeper into commercial marketing and DTC. And I just kind of want to think about how do you drive deeper penetration into biologics, both -- biologic market, both in ADN and also -- sorry, asthma?
Marion McCourt: Certainly, I'm happy to comment. And today, certainly, we reported, as did Sanofi, very strong results for Dupixent, both in the U.S. and ex U.S. markets. The really important thing to keep in mind is while we've made certainly inroads in helping atopic dermatitis patients and patients with respiratory conditions of asthma and nasal polyps, there is still are -- in all of those indications that are currently approved, not to mention the future indications, a lot of incremental unmet need. And then beyond that, to your point of strategies and promotional platform and activities to advance the market, Dupixent has been very responsive to promotion. We've been seeing certainly uptick in new initiations and also a remarkable consistency of patients staying on therapy because of the results that they're receiving either in their skin condition or their respiratory condition. So we'll continue to do that. We're looking at a lot of different mechanisms for advancing our promotional platform. We have highly effective field teams in the marketplace. We also benefit from very strong reimbursement across indications and across age groups and certainly, we'll continue to advance on all the in-line indications we currently have, and we'll be very, very well prepared for our future indications as well.
Justin Holko: Thanks Marion. Next question please.
Operator: And your next question comes from Ronny Gal with Bernstein.
Ronny Gal: Congratulations on the very nice quarter. My question is actually on the EYLEA, Lucentis dynamics. You've shown a 10% revenue growth. They've shown a 5% revenue decline year-over-year. So obviously, capturing share. But I was wondering about the new patient volume. If you can just share with us, if you could, kind of like where are we in terms of patient starts versus a year ago? And how far do we have to go before we come back to line? And anything you can share about pricing terms as it seemed to be -- you just commented this in the press release, if you can give us a bit more there?
Marion McCourt: Ronny, in terms of performance of EYLEA in the anti-VEGF category, as I mentioned, we are seeing a rebound in terms of patient treatment coming back into offices. We see an advance in EYLEA's performance versus a year ago. And then coupled with that, we are seeing an increment in share gain from both branded and unbranded competitors. I also mentioned, if I just put it into volume terms for you in the branded marketplace that EYLEA now approaches just over, in fact, 70% of the branded market in the quarter by volume. So we're seeing robust performance and we would attribute that to EYLEA's overall value proposition for retina specialists in choosing anti-VEGF therapy, the -- certainly, the clinical profile, efficacy profile, flexibility of dosing. Now the prefilled syringe is incredibly timely is a convenience, but also in the current environment of office throughput in efficiency, and then beyond that, the established safety.
Justin Holko: Operator, we have time for 2 very quick questions if we could try to squeeze them in.
Operator: Your next question comes from Biren Amin with Jefferies.
Biren Amin: Can you just talk about the competitive landscape in retina with your thoughts on faricimab, given we've -- they're going to have Phase III data relatively soon?
Marion McCourt: Sure. So I think we all learned a lot about -- I'm sorry, Len, you go first. I'll come back if you'd like.
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: No, no. Go ahead, Marion.
Marion McCourt: No. I was just going to comment that I think that the -- for a product entering the marketplace today, it's not assumed anymore that a safety profile will be there until the product has actual market experience. So I just would mention at the start, we always monitor competition very, very carefully, both in market currently and future competition. But certainly, EYLEA sets a very high bar in terms of the clinical profile, the safety profile and the level of experience. But Len, over to you.
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: No, I think you covered it. Let's go to the next question and the last question.
Operator: And your final question comes from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Dan on for Terence. Just for the Phase II trial of your BCMA bispecific antibody. Just wondering if you could share any more details on the trial and if you're working to develop a subcu formulation?
Dr. George Yancopoulos: Yes. I think that right now, we'll -- you'll get updates on the BCMA program at ASH. We have announced that we're going to be entering into a pivotal program very soon. And I guess it's fair to say that it makes sense that we would be developing, yes, a subcutaneous formulation.
Justin Holko: Thanks to everyone for joining today's call. We appreciate you dialing in, knowing that many other companies are reporting today. So thank you for your attention and for your questions. Bob Landry and the IR team will be available for additional questions and calls as needed today. Thank you, everyone. Be safe.
Operator: This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-08-05 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Q2 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Justin Holko, I will now turn the call over to you.
Justin Holko: Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening to everyone listening around the globe. Thank you for your interest in Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and welcome to the second quarter 2020 conference call. An archive of this webcast will be available on our website.

With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer. Len?
Leonard Schleifer: Thank you, Justin and thanks to everyone for joining the call. I hope all of you are staying safe and well. We very much appreciate your efforts to join given the pandemic conditions and even on top of that northeast some power disruption from the storm, but business continues. We had an eventful and productive second quarter in terms of financial results, business development and corporate accomplishments. In the second quarter, our results demonstrated resilience and strength despite the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to driving double-digit top and bottom line growth, we continue to deliver meaningful advances in our broad and innovative pipeline as well as in our fight against COVID-19 with our novel antibody cocktail. Regeneron continues to execute well in this unprecedented time for our company and our nation in the world. Starting with our products, EYLEA global net product sales were $1.75 billion in the second quarter, a modest decline of 6% compared to the prior year. In the U.S., we generated sales of $1.11 billion, with a pronounced and sustained rebound in demand in May and June, following the decline in sales we experienced in early April. This rebound has continued into July and demand is now approaching pre-COVID levels. The efficacy, safety and convenience of EYLEA have proven to be even more viable in the world of COVID-19. As you will hear for Marion, EYLEA outperformed the broader anti-VEGF class this quarter. Demand for DUPIXENT also proved to be robust in the second quarter, with global sales growth of 70% compared to last year. Sales were nearly $1 billion on continued market penetration in atopic dermatitis, asthma and new launches. Adding to the DUPIXENT momentum, the FDA approved a new indication for atopic dermatitis in children aged 6 to 11. Furthermore, we demonstrated dramatic results in eosinophilic esophagitis, where patients reported a nearly 70% reduction in symptoms further exemplifying the potential of DUPIXENT to bend the arc of certain Type 2 inflammatory diseases. We look forward to additional DUPIXENT milestones, including an upcoming Phase 3 readout in pediatric asthma and enrollment of a second Phase 3 study in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We and our patients and customers have a tremendous amount of enthusiasm for this product and we are still in the early days of unlocking its full potential with our partner, Sanofi. In oncology, Libtayo is the leading systemic treatment for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. We are seeking approvals in basal cell carcinoma and non-small-cell lung cancer with regulatory filings to be submitted imminently. With our chemotherapy combination study in non-small-cell lung cancer nearing full enrollment, our excitement for Libtayo continues to grow. Beyond Libtayo, we are broadening and advancing our biospecifics portfolio, generating further momentum for our ontology strategy. Turning to our efforts to fight COVID-19, we are advancing the development of a novel antibody cocktail known as REGN-COV2 that may both treat and prevent infection from the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We are now in Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials and hope to generate initial data by the end of September as George will discuss in further detail. We also signed two major agreements in recent weeks. We announced a $450 million agreement with BARDA and the U.S. Department of Defense to manufacture REGN-COV2. We also signed a 6-year $345 million agreement with BARDA for our novel Ebola antibody cocktail, further demonstrating the potential of our end-to-end technologies to deliver shareholder value in addressing infectious disease threats. Finally, on the corporate front, we contemplate – excuse me, we completed a large secondary offering of more than 13 million shares of our common stock held by Sanofi. Using our strong balance sheet, we also repurchased $5 billion or 9.8 million shares from Sanofi, effectively eliminating their ownership position in our company and demonstrating our confidence in the trajectory of our business. For Regeneron shareholders, this transaction provided immediate accretion and removed a significant overhang related to the exploration of Sanofi’s lockup period at the end of this year. Regeneron is a business that is indeed firing on all cylinders. We thank all of our colleagues across the company who have been working with resolve and resilience in these extraordinary times of the pandemic. Our strong business performance, cash flow, balance sheet and advancement of the next generation of innovations for important medical needs, has us positioned to weather COVID-19 and emerge from the pandemic to drive continued long-term growth. Now, I will turn the call over to George.
George Yancopoulos: Thank you, Len. And with all of us still in the throes of the COVID-19 epidemic, I will start with an update on our antiviral antibody cocktail that has the potential to both possibly protect against infection and also treat those already infected. Based on our Ebola program, our new non-human primary data for our COVID-19 cocktail as well as our understanding of immune response, we believe that our COVID-19 treatment is well positioned to help patients prior to and early in infection. We initiated our clinical program in June, barely 5 months after we started this treatment, developing this treatment. Our rapid timeline was possible due to our VelociSuite technologies, which were developed in-house over decades to allow for specific turnkey disease interventions and were recently applied to develop a similar approach against Ebola, which we hope will prove to be the first treatment approved for this disease with a PDUFA date in October. We are conducting 4 trials of Regeneron COV2, our antibody cocktail: one in hospitalized COVID-19 patients; a second, ambulatory study in outpatients who are diagnosed with COVID-19; a third, preventative study in household contacts with COVID-19 patients being carried out in collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease; and a fourth, multi-dose, healthy volunteer study. Our studies are adaptive in nature as we learn more about the virus and our antibody cocktail and other studies are being planned as well. All of these studies have passed several safety assessments with no safety concerns observed to-date. Despite the challenging environment, in which these studies are being conducted, we are targeting to report initial virology and biomarker data from the treatment studies by the end of September with clinical outcome data to follow as enrollment progresses. In June, we have published two important papers in science on our antibody cocktail, in which we described the details of how the two antibodies in our cocktail block the coronavirus spike protein, and importantly, highlighted the significance of using the antibody cocktail versus single antibody approach. We showed that the cocktail approach avoided viral escape due to viral mutation, which rapidly occur when using single antibody approaches. In addition, we have recently generated important data in non-human primates, which has been both posted on bio-archives. These studies showed that in this setting, our antibody cocktail can not only effectively prevent infection primates matching or exceeding recently published prevention data achieved with vaccine approaches, but also that our cocktail can treat those already infected by accelerating viral elimination. I next want to highlight the outside support we have received for our strategy in addition to conducting our Phase 3 prevention study in collaboration with the NIAID, which substantively expands our reach to investigate our cocktail in the preventative setting. We recently signed a manufacturing contract with BARDA as part of Operation Warp Speed to make initial lives of our cocktail at risk so that the drug could be available as soon as possible, if proven efficacious and approved by the FDA. While we are all hoping that vaccines prove successful and we ourselves are partnering on some novel second generation vaccine approaches, we believe that our neutralizing antibody cocktail could play an important role as a rapid first line in defense, in those for whom the vaccine is not available and in the long-term could also provide protection for those least likely to respond well to a vaccine, such as the elderly and immunocompromised. Moreover, unlike the vaccine and as supported by our initial primate studies, our cocktail may not only prevent infection, but could also have the potential to treat those already infected. Moving on to our efforts outside of COVID-19 and starting with DUPIXENT, the demonstrated safety and efficacy of DUPIXENT are further bolstered by the recent FDA approval in children with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, children as young as 6 years old. We are not stopping there as we are conducting a study in even younger atopic dermatitis patients. And for children with asthma, we plan to submit a BLA supplement for approval in pediatric asthma by the end of the year, pending upcoming Phase 3 data. We are also enhancing convenience for all patients with the recent FDA approval of our 300 milligram auto-injector. Outside of the United States, DUPIXENT was approved in China recently, which represents a major milestone as we work to ensure patients everywhere have access to this life changing medicine. Our DUPIXENT clinical program continues to deliver positive results in additional Type 2 inflammatory indications. In May, we announced that we met the primary and key secondary endpoints in Part A as our pivotal trial in the eosinophilic esophagitis. Patients treated with DUPIXENT demonstrated significant clinical and anatomic improvements, with almost a 70% reduction in disease symptoms compared to an approximately 30% reduction for patients on placebo as demonstrated by the Dysphasia Symptom Questionnaire. We are currently enrolling Part B of this trial and communicating with regulators about filing requirements for this indication. In addition, the first pivotal DUPIXENT trial in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease typified by Type 2 inflammation or Type 2 COPD completed a pre-specified analysis by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee requiring a certain threshold reduction in exacerbations, which was met and thus triggered opening a second pivotal trial for this potential indication. Approval in Type 2 COPD would unlock another important opportunity for depiction to help patients with Type 2 inflammatory disease, who currently have limited options. Moving on to our oncology portfolio and starting with our PD-1 antibody, Libtayo. At the virtual ASCO meeting, we presented a clinically meaningful cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma data follow-up, followed by a label update as well. As reported at ASCO, was up to 3 years of follow-up, while the overall response rates remain stable approaching 50%, the complete response rates have climbed to 20% in metastatic CSCC increasing from the 7% rate reported in the initial preliminary analysis, providing one of the most dramatic examples of ongoing and prolonged benefit from an immunotherapy treatment. Moreover, this data firmly established Libtayo as first-in-class for this dermato-oncology cancer setting with compelling long-term clinical data. In addition last quarter, we announced positive first-in-class data for a second dermato-oncology indication that is basal cell carcinoma, which we will be submitting for regulatory review. Finally, we are excited about the opportunity for Libtayo in non-small cell lung cancer based on our recent positive Phase 3 trial with Libtayo as monotherapy in PD-L1 high patients, which we will also be submitting for regulatory view. And we have completed screening patients for enrollment in our follow-on chemo combination study in lung cancer. Libtayo is foundational to our oncology strategy and we are making significant progress with Libtayo in skin cancers, lung cancers and our numerous combination and collaborative studies. Our CD-3 bispecific clinical program is moving forward despite operational challenges imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Regeneron 1979, our CD20xCD3 bispecifics has shown robust efficacy in both follicular lymphoma and more aggressive disease, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Our potentially pivotal Phase 2 study continues to enroll globally and we are having productive discussions with regulators to expand the registrational program with combinations and in earlier lines of treatment. We are preparing to explore novel combinations, including a combination from novel class of costimulatory bispecifics, that is one targeting B-cell specifically. We recently published a second major paper featured on the cover of Science Translational Medicine in June describing how these co-stimulatory bispecifics can synergize, not only with CD3 bispecifics, but also with PD-1 blockers. By the way, we are actively working on subcutaneous delivery of this potentially important drug candidate. Our BCMA by CD3 bispecific is moving forward and we are planning to initiate potentially pivotal studies in various multiple myeloma settings. Moreover, we intend to explore standard novel combinations, including with a co-stimulatory bispecific targeting plasma cells. We expect to provide updates for both our CD20 and BCMA programs at ASH later this year. I would like to expand a bit on our co-stimulatory bispecific effort as it represents an important example of the ongoing innovation in oncology for Regeneron. As I said, we are planning on combining such costims with both our CD20 and BCMA bi-spec programs for lymphoma and myeloma. But our first co-stimulatory bispecific is already in clinical development. This first-in-humans co-stim PSMAxCD28 is in combination with Libtayo for prostate cancer and is continuing to enroll in the dose escalation stage of clinical investigation. We are also excited about two additional co-stim bispecifics scheduled to enter the clinic this year. These new co-stim trials include EGFRxCD28 in combination with Libtayo, which will be explored in several solid tumors, including lung cancer and head and neck cancer as well as MUC16xCD28, which will be tested for patients with ovarian cancer as well as in other settings. Our MUC16 co-stim will be studied in combination with either Libtayo or MUC16xCD3 bispecific, which is already in clinic. The span of our toolkit enables us to explore these and many new combinations that based on preclinical evidence could provide meaningful advances for a wide variety of cancer patients. Moving on from oncology, I would like to provide an update on our fasinumab program. We have previously announced positive top line efficacy data in a fasinumab Phase 3 FACT long-term safety study, or FACT LTS substudy. And today we are announcing that two additional Phase 3 studies in patients with osteoarthritis pain, FACT OA1 and FACT OA2 met the co-primary efficacy endpoints for the fasinumab 1 milligram monthly dose versus placebo. The fasinumab 1 milligram monthly dose also showed nominally significant benefits in physical functions in both trials and pain in one of the two trials when compared to the maximum FDA approved doses of NSAIDs for osteoarthritis. The less frequent dose of fasinumab 1 milligram every 2 months used in an arm of the FACT OA1 trial showed numerical benefit over placebo, but did not achieve statistical significance. In the initial safety analysis from the Phase 3 trials, there is an increase in arthropathies reported with fasinumab. In the FACT LTS substudy, there was increase in joint replacements with fasinumab 1 milligram monthly treatment, during the off-drug follow-up period. Although this increase was not seen in the other trials to-date, additional longer term safety data from the ongoing trials is being collected and is expected to be reported early next year. Finally, I would like to briefly address other exciting developments in our pipeline. We are planning to publish evinacumab results in homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia shortly and we have submitted our applications to the FDA and to EMA. Regarding our garetosmab program for fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, or FOP, we are planning to submit data to regulatory authorities in the first quarter of next year pending results from the crossover arm of our trial, where placebo patients are now receiving active drug. Our hope is to replicate the dramatic 90% reduction in new lesion formation that we saw in the first part of the trial. At the European Hematology Association Meeting in June, we presented promising pozelimab monotherapy interim results in paroxysmal, nocturnal, hematoglobinuria patients. We are hoping to start to start testing a combination with Alnylam's RNAi treatment, cemdisiran, by year end. And last but certainly not least, we are starting to enrol our Phase 3 study of the high dose EYLEA in DME and wet AMD. High-dose EYLEA has the potential to reduce dosing frequency, while maintaining the efficacy and safety of our medicine that is trusted by doctors and patients worldwide. To conclude, our broad and diverse pipelines is growing and progressing even in this COVID 19 environment, I could not be prouder that even in these extraordinary and challenging times, our people are continuing to push on every front in our efforts to bring important new treatments to the patients who need them. I now turn over the call to Marion.
Marion McCourt: Thank you, George Our second quarter business performance reflects the resilience and competitive strength of our core brands: EYLEA, DUPIXENT and Libtayo. We remain confident in our ability to navigate through COVID-19 and position our portfolio for future growth as demand recovers. I am going to begin with EYLEA, which had $1.75 billion in global net sales. In the U.S., EYLEA net sales were $1.11 billion, which is just 4% lower than the same quarter last year despite the impact of COVID-19. EYLEA outperformed the overall anti-VEGF market in the U.S. with continued share gains from both branded and unbranded competition. In fact, EYLEA’s share of the branded U.S. market reached 73% of net sales for the quarter solidifying our leadership position in the anti-VEGF market. The impact of COVID-19 on U.S. sales was sold predominantly in April after the sales improved throughout May and into June as retina specialists reopened the offices and patient volume increased. The combination of three EYLEA attributes differentiated efficacy, safety and dosing flexibility are highly valuable in easing physician and patient burdens caused by the pandemic. Physicians may treat with extended dosing of up to 12 weeks in appropriate patients and the recently launched pre-filled syringe offers additional efficiencies for patient care. EYLEA demand continues to show steady improvement and the volume of new patients in the market is approaching pre-pandemic levels. We are closely monitoring the recent resurgence of COVID-19. Under all scenarios, we remain highly committed to supporting the retina community through virtual and in-person platforms to ensure the continuity of patient care. In summary, we are encouraged by the rebound in EYLEA demand in recent months and we will continue to advance efforts to support our customers and their patients during these unprecedented times. Turning next to Libtayo, second quarter global net sales grew to $80 million, with the U.S. contributing $63 million. In April, patient office visits declined and some infusion centers temporarily closed. This briefly impacted Libtayo demand, which rebounded during May and June. In the U.S., Libtayo advanced its leadership as the number one systemic treatment for advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or CSCC. Libtayo has experienced rapid growth in advanced CSCC, with 70% of patients now treated with anti-PD1 therapy. We expect future growth as Libtayo as new Libtayo competitive profile strengthens with new long-term data demonstrating longer durability, higher overall responses and nearly 3x the rate of complete responses based on additional years of follow-up. Looking ahead, we are preparing for potential future launches with our collaborator Sanofi in both non-small-cell lung cancer and basal cell carcinoma. Both represent meaningful growth opportunities for Libtayo. The anti-PD1 and PDL-1 market continues to grow at a significant pace with current annual med sales of nearly $25 billion. Non-small cell lung cancer is the largest opportunity within this market, with more than 200,000 new diagnoses of lung cancer in the U.S. each year. Patients, payers and physicians’ preferred choice in determining the most appropriate treatment and should Libtayo be approved, it has demonstrated very competitive clinical results to-date in the advanced PD-1 positive patient population studied. Finally, moving to DUPIXENT, global net sales in the second quarter were $945 million, representing 70% growth compared to the prior year. In the U.S. broad-based growth across all approved indications contributed net sales of $770 million. Following an initial dip in mid-May, new patient starts have increased as physician offices reopened. Current weekly new patient starts have recovered to approximately 87% of pre-pandemic levels, a sign of robust demand for DUPIXENT. DUPIXENT’s compelling clinical profile enables the product to thrive even in the current environment. DUPIXENT is administered at home and does not require laboratory testing or monitoring to initiate most new patients. Importantly, DUPIXENT is not an immunosuppressant and we expect the U.S. launch of the 300-milligram pre-filled pen in the third quarter, providing additional patient convenience and choice. Atopic dermatitis is DUPIXENT’s largest indication and remains a significant growth driver. We continue to expand physician prescribing across both moderate and severe disease. To-date, only a small percentage of biologic eligible patients, have been treated, leaving substantial opportunity for more patients to benefit. Additionally, new long-term data demonstrate sustained efficacy over a 3-year period along with confirmed safety. We also continue to expand into younger populations. The U.S. FDA recently approved DUPIXENT to treat children aged 6 to 11 used with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, which impacts approximately 90,000 children in this country. DUPIXENT is the only biologic medicine approved for this population and leading launch indicators are very encouraging. Many children suffering with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis are being treated by the same physicians who have extensive clinical experience with their adolescent and adult patients and have great confidence in the DUPIXENT safety profile. DUPIXENT also continues to outperform in asthma as measured by more new patient initiations over the last year compared to other biologic competitors. We see further opportunities to expand patient awareness of DUPIXENT and our national DTC campaign, which is underway. Among those already on treatment COVID-19 has limited impact as patients adhere to their therapies to maintain and improve respiratory function. Finally, we see strong uptake in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. Since approval last year, patients have been initiated on DUPIXENT regardless of prior surgery. Demand has increased among ENTs and allergists with the limited availability of elective surgeries in the last quarter. Overall, we see great opportunity for DUPIXENT which is positioned for significant growth through expanded indications, age groups and geographies. In closing, our teams and business remain resilient as we execute on our strategy to deliver value for customers and stakeholders. Now, I will turn the call to Bob.
Bob Landry: Thank you, Marion. For the second quarter of 2020, Regeneron delivered strong results on both the top and bottom line. Our continued ability to generate this year-over-year growth is an encouraging signal of our diversified growth potential now and beyond COVID-19. For the second quarter, total revenues grew 24% year-over-year to $1.95 billion driven by higher Sanofi collaboration revenues as a result of increasing for DUPIXENT sales. Additionally, we recorded significant revenues associated with our infectious disease efforts against both Ebola and COVID-19. These revenues are recorded in our other revenue line. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share grew 19% year-over-year to $7.16 on non-GAAP net income of $854 million. Since Marion discussed our U.S. EYLEA results, I will start with our Bayer and Sanofi collaborations. Starting with the Bayer collaboration, ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales, which are reported to us by Bayer were $641 million, representing a decline of 10% on a reported basis compared to the prior year due to the COVID-19 impact. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $244 million, of which we recorded $231 million for our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $269 million in the second quarter. Our share of the profits from the commercialization of non-IO antibodies was $172 million. This compares favorably to profits of $39 million in the prior year period, which was driven by higher DUPIXENT profits. Before moving to expenses, I will discuss our second quarter 2020 other revenue line item, in which we recorded $212 million, up sharply from the $20 million in the prior year period. The primary driver of the year-over-year increase is the recognition of $126 million associated with BARDA for our research and manufacturing efforts for both Ebola and COVID-19. We record R&D reimbursements from BARDA in other revenues. Moving to our expense base and starting with R&D, non GAAP R&D increased 36% year-over-year to $580 million driven by significant development costs for both our antibody cocktail and KEVZARA clinical trials for COVID-19, in addition to higher headcount and increased clinical manufacturing activities, a portion of which were reimbursed by BARDA. Next, non-GAAP SG&A expense increased 19% year-over-year to $301 million. The year-over-year increase was driven by the inclusion of PRALUENT commercialization costs in the U.S., higher contributions to non-profit patient assistance organizations and higher headcount related costs. Non-GAAP cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing was $173 million compared to $79 million in the second quarter of 2019. The year-over-year increase is due to manufacturing cost associated with higher DUPIXENT volumes sold by Sanofi, Ebola production and PRALUENT supply for Sanofi’s ex-U.S. markets. Turning now to taxes, the non-GAAP effective tax rate was 0.9% in the second quarter of 2020 compared to 19.1% in the second quarter of 2019. The lower tax rate versus last year was primarily due to increased tax benefits associated with stock option exercises in the realization of those benefits earlier in the calendar year compared to prior years. Shifting now to cash flow and the balance sheet. Year-to-date, Regeneron generated $1.34 billion in free cash flow. In the quarter, we spent $5 billion to repurchase approximately 9.8 million shares of our common stock as part of Sanofi’s sale of substantially all of their equity stake in Regeneron. As Len mentioned, the secondary offering in repurchase were strategic transactions that provided Regeneron’s shareholders immediate accretion, removed uncertainty regarding Sanofi’s equity position and is a testament to our confidence in the strength of our business now and in the future. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $5.7 billion and $1.5 billion in debt financing under a bridge loan related to the Sanofi stake repurchase. Now, I would like to spend a few moments to discuss the financial outlook for the remainder of the year. We maintained or lowered the midpoint of our guidance on several expense items. Please refer to our press release and financial disclosures for entire updated 2020 guidance. Here I will discuss the guidance items related to our increased efforts in the fight against COVID-19 as we leverage our end-to-end capabilities of drug discovery development and manufacturing. We are updating our forecasted 2020 non-GAAP R&D expenses to be in the range of $2.27 billion to $2.37 billion. For COGS, we are raising our forecast for 2020 non-GAAP expenses to be in the range of $435 million to $485 million. The increase in both R&D and cost of goods sold guidance are related primarily to our efforts against COVID-19. For R&D, we anticipate that more than half of the increase to our 2020 R&D guidance will be reimbursed for COVID-19 efforts. Those reimbursements will continue to be recorded in other revenue. We are also providing updated guidance for our tax rate. We anticipate our updated 2020 non-GAAP effective tax guidance to be in the range of 10% to 12%. In conclusion, Regeneron’s business remains healthy and we continue to deliver strong year-over-year growth despite the global impact of COVID-19. Our strong balance sheet, improved competitive outlook, increasingly diversified commercial portfolio and robust pipeline positioned Regeneron very well for sustained long-term growth. Now with that, I would like to turn the call back to Justin.
Justin Holko: Thank you, Bob. Stephanie, that concludes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the call for Q&A. We have several callers in the queue and to ensure that we are able to address as many questions as possible, we will address one question from each caller before moving to the next. Please go ahead, Stephanie.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.
Terence Flynn: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question and thanks for all your efforts on the COVID front. I just had one on the manufacturing side, I was wondering if you can give us anymore detail about your manufacturing costs for the antibodies or if you could at least confirm that these are well below $100 per gram. And if you won’t answer that question, I was just wondering Marion, if any perspective you can share on the opportunity for DUPIXENT in China and specifically what you guys think NRDL reimbursement? Thank you.
Leonard Schleifer: Terence, hi, it’s Len. I don’t think we can comment on our COGS, but Marion can certainly comment on China.
Marion McCourt: Sure, very happy to. Terence, thank you for the question. We are really excited about the opportunity in China and I will also remind that Sanofi has the responsibility for China. I am very encouraged by the progress to-date. And as it relates to specifics on reimbursement, I would guide asking our Sanofi colleagues to describe that in more detail, but as you know, tremendous market opportunity, incredible unmet need and a remarkable clinical profile and we are really excited about the opportunity.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Geoffrey Porges with SVB Leerink.
Geoffrey Porges: Good morning and thank you very much for taking the questions. Congratulations on the results and all the progress in the quarter. Perhaps a few questions on the COVID program, George, you referred to the animal data and the high dose used 50 milligrams per kilogram is quite a lot of antibody. Could you give us a sense of first, is that the dentist that you expect to take forward in the pivotal trials for treatment and how much lower could it be for prophylaxis? And secondly, if that indeed turns out to be the dose, could you give us some indication of the number of courses that you could envisage having supply for this year and next year, given the available capacity now?
George Yancopoulos: Yes. We have modeled the doses in the blood levels from the primate studies in order to design our human studies. And so we are hoping and targeting to achieve similar blood levels in the humans as we are achieving to achieve the relative efficacies in the primate studies. At those levels, we are at the production level that we could be delivering hundreds of thousands of doses per month for the prophylactic dose level and tens of thousands of doses per month for the treatment levels assuming that in that those sorts of ranges that we are predicting right now but of course all that is all pending the trials and seeing what doses really work hopefully some of the doses work and so forth. So there's still a lot to figure out that those are the levels that we are targeting and those are the numbers of doses that we are anticipating that we could deliver depending on how all the clinical trials work out.
Justin Holko: Next question, please.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Yaron Werber with Cowen.
Leo Ai: Hi, good morning. This is Leo Ai for Yaron Werber. Thanks for taking our questions and Congrats on the side of the quarter and the good progress I just had two questions regarding your COVID-19 program. The first question is regarding the durability and safety of your neutralizing antibodies, it seems that some other antibody developers are kind of modifying the actually, demand of their antibody candidates to either extend the half-life or minimize the efficacy dose-limiting toxicities. Can you kind of discuss if you made any modifications to your candidates? And my second question is regarding the prevention study it seems to me that the ongoing Phase III study is looking at the preventing infections in household contacts of infected individual I am just wondering because the trial design looks more like postexposure prophylaxis. I'm just wondering you can provide any features regarding your plans on the prevention Trials are we looking at like the pre-exposure prophylaxis in other high-risk populations
George Yancopoulos: Well there is a lot of questions sort of in there so one in terms of engineering our antibodies, historically, we've had very good success with achieving very good half lives and duration and durability without making modifications which as always come with certain risks so at least for our first generation antibodies based on the historical success were going with unmodified antibodies in terms of the concerns for antibody dependant enhancement we have done extensive studies and efforts on that including with antibodies that we have or have not modified effector function. And based on all of our data and all of our results we are going forward with antibodies once again that are not modified based on the confidence in the data that we have generated with our preclinical experience and finally what was the last question.
Justin Holko: The prevention study?
George Yancopoulos: The prevention study, yes, so some of those patients who have only been exposed that there will be ongoing exposure as well. So it is going to be both a pre and a post exposure prophylaxis effort and we will be characterising whether the patient in the household that we are treating have already been exposed in terms of whether already infected or not in our analysis.
Justin Holko: Next question, Stephanie.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler.
Chris Raymond: Thanks. So just on the EYLEA high dose program I know from just looking at it from trials.gov website, it looks like your larger DME and AMD trials aren't projected to read out until 2022 but there may be a smaller trial I think, CANDELA, reading out in 2021 So I guess some and the question here is I know you guys have not really guided to data yet but will we get a sense of the feasibility at its approach next year especially given if it is a higher dose and you got to be mindful of information etcetera but also may be remind us why are you guys never went the route of using a half life extension like a biopolymer? Thanks.
Leonard Schleifer: So, I will take the first part but George you can take the latter in terms of the data we really have not guided it depends on we are sort of trying to do things in parallel get some Phase 2 data while we are enrolling the Phase 3. So we will just have to see how that comes how that comes along George can comment on the difficulties of biopolymer work.
George Yancopoulos: Right. So we have been investing enormously in efforts with biopolymer extension and so forth. And as we all know and as has been demonstrated recently with the problems of a major competitor, EYLEA sets a very high bar for safety and for efficacy and particularly from a safety point of view. And in all of our efforts, we have not been satisfied with our biopolymer efforts that those modifications meet that high bar, particularly for safety. And so we have been hesitant to move those programs further into the clinic, because of the concerns that we found with those approaches when we compare them and test them in our preclinical settings. In terms of the high dose EYLEA, we are hoping that we will be able to maintain that safety – the high safety bar with a high dose area, but to extend the dosing as you know, right now, studies show that depending on the patients, about 50% of the patients can go to T-12 dosing using the current dose of EYLEA. And what we are hoping is that we maybe able to increase the percentage of those patients who can go to longer term dosing using this higher dose, but to achieve that in as safe manner as we have historically with EYLEA to-date. So that’s the basis of our strategy.
Leonard Schleifer: Yes. I just might add that we are not sure there is any evidence that there is a dose dependent effect on inflammation at least with the high-quality EYLEA that we make. So I am not sure that’s necessarily going to be the case.
Justin Holko: Next question, Stephanie?
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Truist.
Robyn Karnauskas: Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. Good morning. So, question on fasinumab since you announced your top line data this morning. Can you just give us some sense in the hip and the knee? You just talk more broadly about the market, but the hip and the knee, what a monthly dose, what the opportunity might be given that, that would be profile and your strategy for going after now that you know what that profile is going after your other joints? Thank you.
George Yancopoulos: Well, I think the biggest concern is obviously having to do with the benefit risk and the safety profile. Obviously, there is enormous need for alternatives in the pain field and there are so many tens of millions of people who are living with osteoarthritis pain with limited options and concerns about all the available medications, with all the concerns and problems with opioids in particular, but also with NSAIDs and so forth. All of these patients are potential candidates for the NGF inhibitors. So, we are still awaiting and needing to readout additional safety data from our program. And I think it’s going to still be determined in terms of the relative benefit risk as to how important a drug this can be for the so many patients who are in need here.
Leonard Schleifer: Yes, Robyn, I just wanted to mention, glad to see you have got a new name there, Truist, sounds good. I don’t know if it’s the truest, we like to think Regeneron is the truest. But in anyway, the notion of whether the risk benefit is going to work, as George pointed out, I mean, to some extent, we are sort of behind the alliance of Lilly and Pfizer in this class and they have announced I think that their action date is December, they have recently said there is not going to be an advisory panel. So, we will get to see as we are preparing our file in collecting that’s why they will get to see how the FDA views all of this and what constraints or restraints they might put or if they will or they won’t approve it. So you will get a little bit of an insight into the class, because it does appear that we see the same kinds of adverse events in general, in terms of arthropathies and these increased joint replacements that we saw off drug that has been seen with the members of the class.
Justin Holko: Great. Thanks for the question. Stephanie, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from the line of Geoff Meacham with Bank of America.
Geoff Meacham: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. I had one on Libtayo, obviously, you guys have basal cell and monotherapy in lung as label expansion opportunities. I just wanted to characterize your – the trends in 2Q today and maybe your market share is. Do you feel like you're at saturation today or is there still an opportunity in your co-indication today? Thank you.
Marion McCourt: Sure. So this is still relatively early in the launch for Libtayo. The team has done a great job of establishing Libtayo for these patients with locally advanced and metastatic disease with the alternative of Libtayo. But certainly there is significant opportunity to expand our utilization. And, obviously, as you mentioned, as we potentially get into future indications even more volatile
Leonard Schleifer: Yes, obviously, the big indication where most of the sales in this space are is lung cancer, non small cell lung cancer and so our exciting data, which will be basis of a filing a monotherapy, and we are moving rapidly towards closing out the final patients enrolled in the chemo combination study. So lung cancer is really the bigger future opportunity if we can successfully complete that.
George Yancopoulos: And of course, ultimately as we tried to highlight it is a little disappointing, how the PD1 class has not had as dramatic efficacy as one would have wanted in so many other cancer settings. And that’s why we have our very exciting and innovative collection of by specifics and other combination opportunities. But now that we have our own PD1 as a foundational component, we can now be trying to increase and add efficacy in all these other cancer settings where right now the PD1 class is not really shown as much benefit as one would want, but maybe we can now really create enormous benefit in the sales by making the right combinations, particularly with our bispecifics, but with other combination opportunities as well.
Justin Holko: Thanks, Jeff. Next question, Stephanie.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein.
Ronny Gal: Good morning. Thank you for taking our questions and congratulations on a nice progress. Back to the COVID-19 cost sales one question I have is about the hospitalization patient trial. Which is how do you monitor against patients mounting the autoimmune response and kind of confounding did it that way? And related the release of the biomarker data late summer, does that tell us something about the completion of the efficacy readouts, or is there some relationship there we can follow? Are they going to press release the completion of the enrollment just to give us an idea how do we know that antibody efficacy data is coming?
George Yancopoulos: These are all the great questions, and in fact we are analyze our own data exactly with regards to some of the points and concerns that you have we are measuring among the biomarkers, we're measuring patients' endogenous response to their antibody titers, and we are comparing and dividing the patients based on their baseline levels of antibody titers to see whether the patients who respond the best are the people who are now mounting are too early in the course of their disease. And we have this adaptive design, we are going to continue to generate data and evaluate data. We will hopefully be reporting some of that data publicly, but then using that data to make decisions in terms of the adaptive future portions of our design.
Ronny Gal: Thanks.
Justin Holko: Next question, please.
Operator: Next question is from the line of Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research.
Tim Anderson: Thank you. I have a question on DUPIXENT and COPD, COPD remains the Holy Grail for asthma biologics and there have been earlier preliminary COPD, COPD data sets with other products that looked good, only to fail in Phase 3. So I’m wondering if you can put into context the results from the interim look at your COPD trial that you referenced or at least whether those go no go criteria were the same that other biologics have relied on, or was that interim efficacy bar set higher with DUPIXENT than with competitor biologics at the same stage of development?
George Yancopoulos: Yes, I am not sure that the earlier biologics, that you are referring to demonstrated much different data in your Phase 2 and Phase 3 programs and the problems were was that at best they were demonstrating somewhere around a 15% reduction in their exacerbations and depending on the Phase 3 studies Those were on the border of achieving clinical significance. And that’s why those programs didn’t move forward. So, we did not release the details of the bar that we set. But we did say that the bar that we set had to do with exacerbations and we have to achieve a minimum threshold reduction in exacerbations in order to trigger going forward and triggering the initiation of an additional phase III. So obviously, the fact that we met a threshold bar for reduction in exacerbations, I think creates some excitement, that assuming that we can continue to achieve these sorts of reductions in exacerbations that this could be an important drug for COPD.
Tim Anderson: Right.
Leonard Schleifer: Yes. I just want to echo what George said, because this is a little different than most other sort of, futility analyses where you say, well, even if you have a slim chance you sometimes you will let the trial go forward, as George said, and then just trying to put a exclamation. It was a stringent that means it, it was hard to pass that bar, because obviously Sanofi and Regeneron, we didn't want to take on another whole Phase 3 program, which is obviously takes a lot of time, money and effort. Unless we were told and we didn’t see the data, we just know that we passed this stringent bar if you will.
George Yancopoulos: And the bar was for reduction in exacerbations.
Tim Anderson: Right.
Justin Holko: Next question please.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Yatin Suneja of Guggenheim Partners.
Yatin Suneja: Hey guys. Congrats on all the progress. A question on the commercial front with regard to the cocktail approach that you have, can you can you comment on how do you see the adoption in light of the recent data that we are seeing with vaccine given that they provide a little bit longer protection is that the antibody approach has a lower potential to fail versus a vaccine or and hence you are almost guaranteed protection may be perhaps if you can talk about how the market plays out once you have vaccine available? Thank you.
Leonard Schleifer: I wasn’t sure whether there was two parts of that question whether there’s some insight on the technical aspect. If George understood that he can certainly answer that but from the commercial side I think it’s what’s been said for a long time this passive immunization with an antibody cocktail provides immediate immunity. So in the setting of until there’s a vaccine, if this comes first that would be great. But even after this vaccine, there will be many people who are not vaccinated or whose vaccination effects wore off and they got ill or even if they were vaccinated, they didn’t get enough of a response. So we think there is lot of places for this passive immunization with an antibody cocktail. George, I am not sure did you follow that at that point?
George Yancopoulos: I think that you got it.
Justin Holko: Thanks. Next question please.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Alethia Young with Cantor.
Alethia Young: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. I am just kind of curious about what is going on with evinacumab for the ANGPTL3 program. I know that you’re following, but I thought it was a relatively kind of small market opportunity, but just wanted to kind of think about that and what are the potential expansion opportunities from there?
George Yancopoulos: This is ANGPTL3 you said evinacumab was a little hard to hear.
Alethia Young: Yes. Oh, sorry.
George Yancopoulos: Yes. But, I think I got it.
Alethia Young: What are the commercial potential and life beyond that indication as well?
George Yancopoulos: This is a very important proof of concept setting these are if we get approved as you say it’s for homozygous FH, it’s for a very rare genetic population. And particularly, what we showed was efficacy in patients who have no LDL receptor function. So that means that this drug in this pathway work totally different than all other drugs at lower lipids and cholesterol and it may have important growth opportunities after this in the sense that since it is lowering lipids, not only cholesterol but triglycerides, by these independent mechanisms, it is entirely possible and we are thinking about it about where there is a broader opportunity eventually, for this class of drugs. But we are also very excited about the near term opportunity that we hope we are going to get agreement from the FDA shortly in the homozygous FH population, particularly those who don’t respond to any of the existing drugs.
Marion McCourt: And I’ll add just you mentioned size of the population, the – this is a rare condition and in the U.S., there is a population of patients about 1,300 who would be eligible candidates, but we feel we would have an opportunity to help very significantly with this rare and challenging disease, ex-U.S. it’s about 1,700.
Justin Holko: I think we have time for one more question, Stephanie.
Operator: Thank you. Your final question will come from the line of Evan Seigerman with Credit Suisse.
Evan Seigerman: Thanks for squeezing me in at the end. Looking at that antibody data in September would that be assuming it’s positive, is that enough to get an EUA from the FDA and if not, what else you need to generate and when could we see that data? Thank you.
Leonard Schleifer: Well, it will all depend on the data and how good it looks. So, there is so many variables that I think it’s really impossible to give a fair answer to that question.
Evan Seigerman: Okay. Thanks.
Justin Holko: Thanks, Evan. Thanks for everybody dialing in. This concludes our call. Bob Landry and the IR team will be available after the call to answer further questions. Stay well and safe everyone. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-05-05 08:30:00) =====

Once our call concludes, Bob Landry and the IR team will be available to answer further questions.With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer Dr. Len Schleifer. Len?
Leonard Schleifer: Thank you, Justin. And thank you to everyone for joining the call. I hope all of you are staying safe and well during this difficult time. We're living in a new reality, the reality of COVID-19. I am incredibly proud of the leadership role Regeneron is taking in the fight against COVID-19.Clearly, this pandemic is unprecedented in our lifetime, for our company, our country and the world and the world economies. Regeneron has spent decades and billions of dollars developing proprietary technologies that have created medical breakthroughs, such as Dupixent and our novel antibody cocktail for Ebola, which is now under FDA review.These same technologies are now well purposed for finding a treatment against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We are making rapid progress and scaling up supply of our novel antibody cocktail, which we expect to be in clinical trials this June. We are optimistic about this approach, which George will describe in greater detail.Also we are working swiftly with our collaborator Sanofi to find a definitive answer on whether there is a role for Kevzara in helping to alleviate the devastating inflammation that affects patients who are critically afflicted with this virus. We are grateful for the tremendous partnership across industries, governments and agencies such as the FDA and BARDA, as we unite in the common cause to eradicate this disease.Beyond our therapeutic efforts we continue to respond to other urgent COVID-related needs. We recently produced and donated viral transport media to New York State for use in 500,000 test kits and have provided financial support to non-profits at the heart of the pandemic response, in New York and beyond.Furthermore, we are sensitive to the rapidly evolving marketplace and working with customers to ensure that patients are able to receive the treatments they need to preserve vision, as well as to treat inflammatory conditions, cancer and other ailments that persist despite the realities of social distancing.Turning to some brief commentary on the first quarter, where we delivered another strong performance. In the quarter, negative impacts from COVID-19 were minimal. Our core brands EYLEA, Dupixent and Libtayo drove significant top and bottom line growth, based on demand, while we invested in and advanced our innovative pipeline.In this quarter EYLEA global net product sales grew 6% to $1.85 billion, including U.S. EYLEA net sales growth of 9% to $1.17 billion. In the last two weeks of March and early April, overall demand and new patient starts were softer due to COVID-19. However, we are encouraged by the rebound in demand in the most recent weeks. Marion will give you more color on this.First quarter Dupixent sales more than doubled compared to last year and are now annualizing at more than $3.4 billion on continued market penetration and new launches in multiple disease settings. While there are early signs of impacts on new patient starts, we expect continued resilience for Dupixent during this COVID-19 period, given the profound efficacy and safety profile.With an anticipated regulatory action in pediatric atopic dermatitis later this month and other data readouts in 2020 and initiation of new Phase III trials assessing Dupixent in several other type two inflammatory diseases, this exceptional medicine continues to be positioned for long-term growth. Importantly Dupixent is driving continued diversification of our earnings base and enhancing our strong current and long-term financial position.We also announced recently that we have completed the restructuring of our agreement with Sanofi on Praluent which will lead to immediate accretion and further strengthen our overall portfolio.2020 has brought urgent new priorities. Even though, we are experiencing impacts to trial enrollment and new study starts we remain on track for several significant clinical milestones particularly in oncology. Recently, we announced that our first-line clinical trial in lung cancer assessing Libtayo was stopped early on an interim analysis due to superior overall survival versus chemotherapy. We will look to submit these data to regulators as soon as possible. We also intend to submit data for the Type one basal cell carcinoma and expect new data from our bispecifics program later this year. Additionally, the long-awaited Phase3 readout from fasinumab our anti nerve growth factor program for osteoarthritis pain will occur in the coming months.Before handing the call over to George, I want to share the immense pride and gratitude we have for our people working hard at Regeneron during this time. Even in the current environment our entire business is operating as our people drive important work forward that is essential to our mission to patients and to near and long-term value creation for shareholders.Our ability to do this rests on the talent and strength of our workforce, which in spite of COVID-related disruption maintains incredible commitment focus and effort to advance the breadth of Regeneron's work. They are the foundations for moving forward, our mission in normal times and especially now. We are optimistic that Regeneron and our society will prevail through these unprecedented times and we will work tirelessly to that end.Now, I'll turn the call over to George.
George Yancopoulos: Thank you, Len. And since the devastating COVID-19 crisis is foremost on everyone's mind I will first discuss our efforts in this area. As you all know, our state of the art and proprietary VelociSuite technologies, which we have built over the last few decades. It can be very powerful for responding to new targets and pathogens, as we recently proved by rapidly creating an antiviral antibody cocktail as an effective treatment for Ebola.Recall, the FDA recently granted priority review to this treatment for Ebola with the target action date of October 25, 2020 based on the results of the Phase 3 PALM clinical trial conducted in the Congo, which was stopped early because of our Regeneron EB3 antibody cocktail proving superior and preventing death compared to the previous standard of care the so-called ZMapp antibody as well as to Remdesivir.In terms of COVID-19, while society is awaiting an effective vaccine that could still be a year or two away, we are employing a two-pronged approach that could serve as a useful bridge and/or as an alternative to a vaccine. First and most importantly, we are developing a novel antiviral antibody cocktail just as we did for Ebola. We have already announced that we have utilized our VelociSuite technologies to rapidly generate and select thousands of potent antiviral fully human antibodies from both our genetically humanized Velocimmune mice as well as from convalescencing human volunteers, creating what we believe is the largest and deepest collection of potent antiviral antibodies to choose from.We have selected two distinct antibody cocktails from this collection, our initial cocktail as well as the backup. And we have already begun large-scale manufacturing and anticipate initiating clinical trials with elite cocktail in June. With Ebola, we set the record of nine months from initiating the project to starting human trials. Now, we hope to break that record with five months from project initiation to the clinic. Based on our experience with the Ebola and other viruses, we hope that this specifically designed antiviral approach has a significant chance for success in providing both a prophylactic treatment to prevent infection in those at risk as well as for treating those already infected and symptomatic.Our second major COVID-19 approach involves repurposing KEVZARA our anti IL-6 receptor antibody approved in rheumatoid arthritis. Based on a small uncontrolled case series from China, there was reason to believe that blocking the IL-6 pathway might address the underlying inflammation leading to acute respiratory distress in so-called severe COVID-19 patients meaning hospitalized patients needing oxygen support, but not on ventilators as opposed to so-called critical patients, who largely require ventilators.We initiated an adaptive Phase 2/3 trial to explore KEVZARA in both the severe and critical patient populations. Our initial data from both the Phase 2 and Phase 3 portion of the trial indicated that KEVZARA at least at the doses tested which paralleled those used in the China reports did not provide a major benefit for severe patients.On the other hand the Phase 2 portion of the trial suggested a potential benefit in critical patients. And the Phase 3 trial in this group is ongoing. Additional efforts, both in our program and by our Sanofi partners in Europe, and the rest of the world are further testing both of these populations, including at higher doses. Our results and efforts with KEVZARA highlight the challenges with using repurposed drugs, the inability to rely on uncontrolled and even small controlled trials and thus the importance of running large well controlled Phase 3 studies to obtain real answers as to whether a drug has benefit and the quantitative extent of that benefit even in a pandemic setting.It is important to point out that our efforts with COVID-19 are being developed under an ongoing collaboration with BARDA, a division within the U. S. Department of Health and Human services and also involve incredibly collaborative relationships with so many critical partners from the FDA to the leadership of New York State to the many hospitals and physicians at the front lines, who make the effort to engage in these trials and the many stricken patients who volunteer to participate.I also want to thank all the individuals at Regeneron who have continued to work tirelessly on these programs despite all the logistical and operational and health challenges created by the COVID-19 crisis.Moving on from COVID-19, I first want to touch upon our EYLEA programs. Physicians consider safety to be essential in selecting anti-VEGF treatment. Over the last several months, another recently approved anti-VEGF product was recently associated with the serious new vision-threatening safety concern involving occlusive retinal vasculitis in the context of intraocular inflammation.In light of the frequency and serious nature of the safety concern, Regeneron and our partner Bayer conducted a broad review of our clinical trial database as well as our post-marketing global safety database to identify any similar safety events with EYLEA.In the critical trial database from eight Phase III trials involving tens of thousands of injections, there was no reports consistent with the safety concern. Moreover in the extensive post-marketing experience involving more than 32 million doses of EYLEA sold in more than 100 countries worldwide since its approval more than eight years ago, the rate of any possibly related safety event was less than one out of every 6 million EYLEA doses sold.And such cases were always associated with presumed infectious Endophthalmitis. Thus based on our reviews of the EYLEA clinical trial database and post-marketing surveillance occlusive retinal vasculitis in the context of intraocular inflammation does not appear to be a safety concern with the use of EYLEA.Next, I want to discuss DUPIXENT. Later this month, we anticipate an FDA decision extending DUPIXENT approval to six to 11-year old children suffering from atopic dermatitis. DUPIXENT would be the first biological indicator for this pediatric population.We hope this potential approval will continue to reflect the remarkable safety profile of DUPIXENT as evidenced by the absence of a black box warning or any associated serious infection risks which are often seen with immunomodulatory biologics and with JAK inhibitors.We also expect FDA action on our 300-milligram auto-injector which would allow for an additional dimension of convenience to an already strong profile for the medicine. Additionally, later this year, we anticipate data from our Phase III pediatric asthma trial the Phase II portion of our eosinophilic esophagitis program and we remind you that we have pivotal studies in chronic spontaneous urticarial, prurigo nodularis, and bullous pemphigoid, as well as studies in oral immunotherapy with our collaborator Aimmune.We continue to build on DUPIXENT's story which has already changed the lives of so many people suffering from type 2 inflammatory diseases such as asthma atopic dermatitis and chronic rhinositis with nasal polyps with more than 150,000 patients treated globally since launch.Next, I'm excited to share important updates on our immuno-oncology efforts. As you know most cancer patients are still not successfully addressed with immune therapies leaving us with a major challenge of enhancing responsiveness in tumor settings where immune therapies already have some efficacy such as lung and melanoma, while also trying to extend the benefit to patients with tumors that are currently not highly responsive such as prostate, pancreas, and colon.Having our own effective anti PD-1 antibody is foundational for our efforts to enhance and extend the benefits of immunotherapy as we had hoped such an antibody could play an important role both as a monotherapy but also in combination with other antibodies and bispecifics derived from our own homegrown pipeline as well as in combination with a number of collaborative agents and vaccines.Defying early optimism, developing effective anti PD-1 antibodies has proven to be very challenging. It is remarkable that in the decade since the first approval of an immuno-oncology agent, only one PD-1 antibody has been approved as monotherapy in first line non-small cell lung cancer.Although that therapy has on its own completely changed the paradigm of how lung cancer is treated. At the end of last year we announced interim results from our first line non-small cell lung cancer study in so-called PD-L1 high patients. Revealing that our PD-1 antibody Libtayo as monotherapy had objective response rates of 42% compared to 22% for chemotherapy indicating profound clinical activity.Just last week, we announced that the independent data monitoring committee recommendation led to an early termination of this Libtayo monotherapy trial due to a highly significant improvement in overall survival with Libtayo decreasing the risk of debt by 32.4% compared to the platinum doublet chemotherapy.This result was obtained early despite a third of the patients entering the trial within the past six months and chemotherapies -- chemotherapy patients being able to cross over to Libtayo upon disease progression. No new Libtayo safety signal was identified. We are planning to present detailed trial data at a future medical meeting and will complete regulatory submissions in the next few months.And just this morning, we announced that we had identified yet another first-in-class cancer setting where Libtayo as monotherapy exhibited profound and clinically meaningful activity just as we had previously done for squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or CSCC where Libtayo is rapidly becoming standard of care.Our potentially pivotal study in second-line advanced basal cell carcinoma of the skin or BCC demonstrated clinically meaningful response rates of nearly 30% in locally advanced patients who had progressed on prior Hedgehog inhibitor treatment.Impressively, more than 85% of the patients who responded to treatment have experienced durable responses of more than 12 months. We intend to submit dated to regulatory authorities in the coming months. Basal cell carcinoma presents another promising opportunity to extend our dermato-oncology portfolio beyond the current squamous cell carcinoma indication.BCC is the most common cancer in the world, while only a very small percentage of cases require systemic therapy, the extremely large incidence of this cancer means that there are still thousands of people with advanced basal cell carcinoma in need of treatment.I'd like to frame the significance of these milestones for cancer patients and for Regeneron. In aggregate, our studies have now demonstrated that Libtayo is a potent and effective PD-1 monotherapy treatment, where we now have the potential subject to regulatory approval to offer patients with lung cancer, a competitive alternative.In addition and very unexpectedly to some, we have now been able to identify two new cancer settings where PD-1 monotherapy demonstrates profound clinical activity based on our studies. First, advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and now advanced basal cell carcinoma of the skin.Moreover as Libtayo is establishing itself as a leading PD-1 antibody for monotherapy and allows us to pursue our strategy of using it in combinations to enhance and extend benefit. For example, we are investigating Libtayo in combination studies with our two classes of bispecifics, our CD3 class as well as our custom class. That is we have already initiated a trial combining Libtayo with our PSMA costim bispecific to try to endow responsiveness in prostate cancer.We have also initiated a trial combining Libtayo with our MUC16 by CD3 bispecific to enhance responsiveness in ovarian cancer. We're also starting trials combining Libtayo with our other checkpoint inhibitors and with other collaborative assets. For example, we have initiated a trial combining Libtayo with our LAG3 antibody to try to enhance responsiveness of first line melanoma where we are also combining Libtayo with various collaboration assets and vaccines.I should note that, although all our programs are being impacted by the COVID-19 crisis and additional future impacts are difficult to predict, our bispecific programs which have been particularly affected are ones that we are working very hard on to try to continue to enroll. Our potential in pivotal programs for our CD20 by C3 bispecific are enrolling in relapse refractory follicular lymphoma in relapsed refractory diffuse large b-cell lymphoma and in this setting following CAR-T cell therapy failure.We anticipate full enrollment over the next year. And I remind you that we have demonstrated very promising initial efficacy and durability in all of these settings. Similarly, our BCMA by CD3 bispecific for myeloma is continuing to enroll in its proof-of-concept study where it continues to deliver promising activity as is our MUC16 by CD3 bispecific for ovarian carcinoma.All together, these are very exciting times for immuno-oncology here at Regeneron, as we believe we have therapies that are showing important promise as monotherapies as well as the opportunity to combine and match these therapies as is appropriate to enhance and extend the benefit for additional cancer patients in need.Before handing the call over to Marion, let me conclude with a couple of brief updates on other areas of the pipeline. We are on track to complete our regulatory submissions for evinacumab, our ANGPTL3 antibody for homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia patients later this year. Recall, in our Phase III trial, evinacumab reduced LDL or bad cholesterol by an impressive 49% in patients not well controlled with other lipid-lowering treatments including anti PCSK9.We're also planning an FDA submission of the data package for GARETOSMAB, our Activin A Antibody for fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva in the second half of 2020, following dramatic results showing 90% reduction in new bone lesion formation and pending confirmation of these data from the second half of the study. We continue to explore the process of our C5 antibody and the potentially game-changing nature of the combination of this antibody with the siRNA program, which we are performing in combination with Alnylam. We continue to move forward with intent on initiating registration studies over the next 12 months.Finally, the opioid crisis continues and the need for alternative chronic pain solutions remain. We are making progress with fasinumab, our nerve growth factor antibody for osteoarthritis pain. We completed enrollment in our Phase III studies last year and we are expecting to see data midyear.With that I will turn the call over to Marion.
Marion McCourt: Thank you, George. Our business performance in the first quarter reflects continued healthy demand driven growth of our core brands, EYLEA, Libtayo and DUPIXENT. While COVID-19 began to impact our business in the latter half of March, our first quarter results were strong.I'm going to begin with EYLEA performance. EYLEA had an impressive start to the quarter with continued share gains. Global net sales grew 6% year-over-year to more than $1.85 billion and U.S. net sales grew 9% to $1.17 billion versus the prior year. COVID-19 began to negatively impact EYLEA sales with a greater impact from the pandemic on patients with diabetic eye disease than on patients with wet AMD. There was a sharp decline in overall demand in the last two weeks of March and first two weeks of April, followed by a sharp rebound in the most recent two weeks.Overall, in the month of April, demand was approximately 15% lower than the same time last year. We're encouraged by the recent rebound, although it is difficult to predict future COVID-19 impact. Despite these circumstances, we've been extremely impressed with retina specialists' efforts to ensure continuity of patient care. Physicians use EYLEA to preserve the patient's vision because of its breadth of indications, dosing flexibility, convenience and safety. EYLEA dosing can be extended up to 12 weeks in appropriate patients and the recently launched Pre-filled Syringe offers additional efficiency of care.Additionally, we've evolved our efforts to support the retinal community through virtual engagement, as well as providing patient ads to self-monitor vision. We have plans in place to support customers and meeting anticipated higher demand for EYLEA once social distancing measures are relaxed. In summary we're confident that EYLEA can navigate through and grow beyond COVID-19.Turning to Libtayo. First quarter global net sales were $75 million. In the U.S. sales reached $62 million and we continue to extend Libtayo leadership as the number one systemic treatment for advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma or CSCC. We continue to grow Libtayo in CSCC with nearly 65% of CSCC patients who receive systemic therapy already being treated with an anti-PD-1.And in addition to growing the market we're also capturing more of the therapeutic class demonstrated by nearly 90% of new PD one patients with CSCC receiving Libtayo. We're also closely monitoring the impact of COVID-19 on Libtayo, while office visits and chemotherapy administration have declined in general Libtayo used remains steady and treatment decisions for eligible patients are being made on a case-by-case basis.Overall we're proud of our progress with Libtayo. In addition our team is busy preparing for potential future launches with our collaborator Sanofi in lung cancer and basal cell carcinoma. In 2019, the worldwide anti-PD-1 and PD-L1 market was just over $21 billion.In the U.S. alone the 2019 market in non-small cell lung cancer was $13 billion. $8 billion of which was first-line with the vast majority of sales still coming from KEYTRUDA with more than 200,000 new diagnoses of lung cancer in the U.S. each year oncologists prefer having a choice in determining the most appropriate treatment for patients.Finally moving to DUPIXENT. Global net sales in the first quarter were $855 million. In the U.S. net sales reached $679 million, representing 124% growth compared to the prior year. We continue to grow prescribing across all indications including new-to-brand patients.In the first quarter we did not see a material impact of COVID-19 on DUPIXENT sales. In the month of April, the rate of new patient starts on DUPIXENT was impacted due to COVID-19. DUPIXENT has several unique competitive advantages that assist physicians in today's challenging environment.It can be administered at home. It does not require laboratory analysis to initiate most new patients and DUPIXENT is not an immunosuppressant. Expected approval of the auto-injector in June will provide additional convenience for product administration.Atopic dermatitis remains a significant growth driver for DUPIXENT. We've expanded prescribing across both moderate and severe disease and the eligible treatment population continues to grow.In the first quarter of 2019, DUPIXENT was approved in adolescents and we look forward to the PDUFA decision for 6 to 11-year olds targeted towards the end of May. We have seen rapid uptake of DUPIXENT and adolescents since its approval. Largely due to physician experience in older populations which provides comfort in its efficacy and safety in these younger patients.In asthma, DUPIXENT continues to outperform other recent biologic launches. We've seen limited volume impact from COVID-19 particularly since medications such as DUPIXENT are viable for patients to maintain respiratory function. While in early days the asthma DTC campaign is already generating significant patient interest.Finally our commercial efforts in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps continue to contribute meaningfully to the brand. Patients have been initiated on DUPIXENT regardless of prior surgery since approval. And during the COVID-19 pandemic there is an even greater need for DUPIXENT in these patients due to the limited availability of elective nasal polyp surgery.Taken together we remain committed to realizing the tremendous growth potential of DUPIXENT through expanded indications, age groups and geographies. In closing despite the current circumstances, our brands remain resilient. We continue to execute on our strategy and are working diligently to meet the evolving needs of our customers and patients.I'll turn the call over now to Bob.
Bob Landry: Thanks Marion. For the first quarter of 2020, Regeneron delivered solid results on both the top and bottom line, despite COVID-19 beginning to impact our business operations in the latter half of March.Today, I will first briefly discuss the first quarter results and then conclude with our 2020 guidance, effective January 1, 2020 we implemented changes to our accounting presentation related to certain reimbursements and other payments from collaborators. As such our first quarter 2020 and comparable 2019 financial statements have been prepared under the new accounting presentation.We made these changes to better reflect the nature of the company's revenues earned and costs incurred pursuant to arrangements with collaborators. Importantly, these changes provide a simplified presentation of our financial results. They do not impact income from operations, income taxes, net income or net income per share. For more information regarding these changes please refer to the slide presentation in FAQ on the Regeneron Investor Relations website.Turning now to the results. First quarter 2020 revenues grew 33% year-over-year to $1.83 billion driven by continued growth of both EYLEA and Libtayo, as well as higher Sanofi collaboration revenues as a result of strong performance from our DUPIXENT franchise. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share grew 48% year-over-year to $6.60 on non-GAAP net income of $771 million.Since Marion discussed our U.S. EYLEA results, I will start with our Bayer and Sanofi collaborations. Starting with the Bayer collaboration. Ex U.S. EYLEA net product sales which are reported to us by Bayer were $682 million representing growth of 2% on a reported basis compared to the prior year.Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $281 million, an increase of 7%. We recorded $254 million for our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S.. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue which under the new accounting presentation consists of our share of antibody profits and reimbursements for the manufacturing of commercial supplies was $247 million in the first quarter. Our share of the profits from the commercialization of non-IO antibodies was $171 million compared to a loss of $28 million in the prior period driven by higher DUPIXENT profits.Effective April 1, 2020, we finalized the planned PRALUENT restructuring with Sanofi. In the U.S., Regeneron will have sole responsibility for PRALUENT and we have begun recording net product sales as of April 1. Outside the U.S. Sanofi will have sole responsibility for PRALUENT and will pay Regeneron a 5% royalty on such net product sales, which we will record in other revenue. As for Kevzara, Regeneron and Sanofi continue to assess potential terms of this restructuring following the recently launched clinical program evaluating KEVZARA in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.Moving to our expense basis starting with R&D. Non-GAAP R&D increased 23% year-over-year to $527 million driven by advancements in our earlier stage pipeline, higher headcount and an increase in clinical manufacturing activities.Next first quarter 2020 non-GAAP SG&A expense increased 27% year-over-year to $307 million. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher headcount and commercial investments to support the continued growth of our business. First quarter 2020 non-GAAP cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing was $139 million compared to $101 million in the first quarter of 2019. The year-over-year increase in COCM was primarily due to manufacturing costs associated with higher global sales of DUPIXENT and manufacturing costs in connection with our BARDA Ebola agreement.Finally, we introduced a new line item called other operating income and expense this quarter. This line item is located within expenses and primarily consists of the recognition of upfront payments and development milestones that were initially deferred and are recognized over time from our collaborators Sanofi, Teva and Mitsubishi Tanabe. For the first quarter of 2020, we recorded other operating income of $40 million compared to income of $57 million recorded in the first quarter of 2019.Turning now to taxes. The non-GAAP effective tax rate was 9.5% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 16% in the first quarter of 2019. The year-over-year decline in the non-GAAP effective tax rate was due to increased tax benefits associated with stock option exercises in the first quarter of 2020.Shifting now to cash flow and the balance sheet. For the first quarter of 2020, Regeneron generated $528 million in free cash flow. In the quarter, we repurchased $273 million worth of shares in open market transactions. The pace of share repurchases slowed considerably towards the end of the first quarter of 2020 given the recent share price appreciation. Our fully diluted share count that we report for a given quarter is highly sensitive to the average stock price. If the average stock price for the second quarter is similar to the current stock price levels, we would estimate that our weighted average share count used for calculating non-GAAP EPS for the second quarter will be in the range of 121 million to 123 million shares. And finally to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $7.2 billion in minimal debt.Now I'd like to spend a few moments to discuss the financial outlook for the remainder of the year. We assume that the COVID-19 impact on our business will peak in the second quarter 2020. We anticipate a recovery as the year progresses, as economies gradually reopen, social distancing guidelines are relaxed and doctor and hospital visits return to prior levels. From a supply chain and manufacturing perspective, Regeneron has historically maintained high levels of inventory in the event of a prolonged impact to our manufacturing and production capabilities.Currently, we see minimal disruptions to our supply chain and our manufacturing activities and we have adequate supply of commercial product on hand to meet demand. Our 2020 annual financial guidance reflects our latest assessment of our business in this current environment with limited precision. Certain elements of our spend will be dictated by the continued severity and length of the COVID-19 impact in our efforts associated with KEVZARA and our SARS-CoV-2 antibody cocktail. These factors may materially impact our guidance. We will assess carefully whether further updates to our guidance may be warranted.Now moving to our 2020 financial guidance. And starting with R&D, we forecast our 2020 non-GAAP R&D expenses to be in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.04 billion. We are continuing to invest in our pipeline and research capabilities which remain critical to the long-term growth of the business. Our oncology pipeline continues to grow. And as conditions allow, we intend to advance programs through development.Additionally, we are funding external partnership obligations, as jointly developed molecules are rapidly advancing. Our R&D guidance also includes the portion related to our COVID-19 activities where we will be reimbursed at least in part by BARDA. Unlike R&D reimbursements from collaborations which are netted in the R&D expense line item under the new accounting presentation, these reimbursements from BARDA will continue to be recorded in other revenue.Next to SG&A. We forecast our 2020 non-GAAP SG&A expenses to be in the range of $1.19 to $1.29 billion. We are continuing to invest for product growth now and once the COVID-19 impact abates. For EYLEA, we are continuing to make investments in diabetic eye diseases. For Libtayo, launch preparations are underway for anticipated launches in basal cell and non-small cell lung cancer.Starting this year, we are providing guidance for COGS and COCM. For COGS, we forecast 2020 non-GAAP expenses to be in the range of $295 million to $355 million, primarily comprised of U.S. EYLEA, U.S. Libtayo and U.S. PRALUENT manufacturing costs in the payment of Sanofi for 50% of the gross margin associated with U.S. Libtayo.For COCM, we forecast 2020 non-GAAP expenses to be in the range of $600 million to $700 million, primarily comprised of global DUPIXENT, global KEVZARA, x U.S. EYLEA, x U.S. PRALUENT and Regeneron EB3 manufacturing costs. As a reminder, we are reimbursed for COCM costs, reimbursements are recognized within the Sanofi and Bayer collaboration revenue lines and other revenues. Reimbursements should closely approximate COCM expenses for quarterly reporting periods subject to timing and other considerations.For the new line item of operating income and expense, we expect this to be in the range of $175 million to $205 million of income this year. And finally the tax, we anticipate our 2020 non-GAAP effective tax guidance to be in the range of 12% to 14%.In conclusion, we had a solid start to the year despite initial impacts from COVID-19. Our balance sheet increasingly diversified commercial portfolio and robust pipeline enabled Regeneron to withstand the impacts of COVID-19, while making prudent investments in executing on meaningful near-term opportunities to position Regeneron for sustained long-term growth.With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Justin.
Justin Holko: Thank you Bob. Crystal that concludes our prepared remarks, we'd now like to open the call for Q&A. Just a word that, we have more than 20 callers in the queue, so to ensure that we are able to address as many as possible, we will answer one question from each caller before moving to the next. Please go ahead, Crystal.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Evan Seigerman from Credit Suisse.
Evan Seigerman: Hi, all. Thank you for taking my question, and congrats on the progress this quarter. Thank you also for your efforts in combating the pandemic. So with data from both the frontline lung trial last week and basal cell carcinoma today, can you expand as to what's next for your oncology franchise? How do you plan on competing with the standard of care in the front line lung setting and more broadly across tumor types amenable to IO therapy?
Leonard Schleifer: So, George?
George Yancopoulos: And I guess that most importantly, as we noted, the lung field is dominated by leading antibody that has produced the most impressive data. We are very excited that our monotherapy trial has delivered data that looks very impressive in terms of the overall survival endpoint. And we have an ongoing combination trial with chemotherapy as well that we're excited about having it read out over the coming year or so.And so I think that this is going to position us well in such a large opportunity, where physicians and patients are looking for alternatives to have an agent that has such profound activity as a monotherapy. But in addition, we have all these combination programs that I was referring to. We have we believe one of the most exciting homegrown pipelines of additional agents that we could combine to not only enhance the activity in these settings where the PD-1 monotherapies are already active, but also to extend to new settings and new indications, such as I mentioned, whether it be prostate cancer or ovarian cancer or others where right now the activity is not what we would want.So I think that we've put ourselves into a pretty exciting position, where we have some of the most exciting agents with identified profound clinical activity as monotherapies, but we now have the opportunity to mix and match these as is appropriate to enhance and extend the activity. So we're very excited about the oncology situation.
Leonard Schleifer: Yes. And just to add on the commercial side, it's Len and maybe Marion can chime in. You know obviously we collaborate with Sanofi where we take the lead in the United States. They take the lead outside the United States, but we work together with them. And this disease is dominated by lung cancer, maybe Marion a little bit about the numbers the incidence prevalence what kind of marketplace we're going into?
Marion McCourt: Yes. So lung cancer is a disease with a very large incident population of more than 200,000 newly diagnosed patients each year. So, we do think that there's tremendous opportunity and know that oncologists prefer having a choice in determining treatment for their patients.So we're excited about the data and we'll work carefully with Sanofi on launch preparedness, and certainly have built a commercial team that has extensive experience in competitive launches. We look forward to this opportunity if in fact we have an approval for lung and for basal cell.
Justin Holko: Thanks, Evan. Next question?
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with SVB Leerink.
Geoffrey Porges: Thank you very much and congratulations on both the surprisingly strong quarter, but also all the progress on the pipeline. George, we haven't had a lot of access to talk to you about the COVID programs. But could you just expand a little bit on the backup program what its nature is? And the related question of what do you view as the risk of both ADE and also of the antibodies in some way contributing adversely to the inflammatory syndrome in the tail end of this disease?
George Yancopoulos: Yes. Those are great questions. So what we were able to generate, because we have these very robust platforms both the ability to get fully human antibodies from our genetically humanized mouse model, as well as from recovering humans. We generated a collection of thousands and thousands of antibodies.Getting many antibodies that really were at the top end historically at the best level of binders and blockers and antiviral neutralizers that you've ever seen based on the literature and the history. And so what we did was, we simply selected several cocktails of the best antibodies where we put them together, and we created our initial cocktail and a backup cocktail just in case for some reason something goes wrong with the initial cocktail. So they're actually quite similar. It's just a different collection of antibodies for the backup as well as for the primary.Now we think that based on the history of treating infectious disease and viral diseases with highly potent neutralizing antibodies, the risks of things such as antibody-dependent enhancement and so forth are actually quite limited. You actually see these, for example, in certain classes of viruses, the Flaviviruses, the dengue type viruses and so forth in particular, but that's because of the biology of the viruses there.With most other viruses when you have highly potent neutralizing antibodies these risks are mitigated. We do have -- in addition to our backup collection of antibodies, we do also have our antibody cocktails made with what we call Uber-stealth constant [ph] regions, which would completely mitigate against that possibility. But for the current approaches that we're taking, we're going to be going forward with the fully armed antibodies, because we think the risks of ADE with very potent neutralizing antibodies is actually quite low.So I think that the history of antiviral antibodies, our experience the way they work our own antibodies and other programs most notably in Ebola, we think that there's a very significant chance that these specifically designed, very potent neutralizing antibodies will have a significant impact on the disease. We think that there's a great chance that they can be very powerful prophylactic and preventive agents. But we also think that they can treat patients who are already symptomatic with disease.And we don't think that right now there's any evidence that suggests that the antibody response is what's contributing to the inflammatory responses in the lung. And as, of course, as has already been seen and described in the disease, the majority of patients do recover and their recovery is coincident with their producing viral responses.So altogether I think there's a lot of reason to have a lot of hope that this approach really has a chance to make a difference as we said both in prophylactic treatment, but also in treating symptomatic patients.
Justin Holko: Thanks, Geoff.
Geoffrey Porges: Thanks for taking my question.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan.
Cory Kasimov: Hey, good morning, Leonard. Thanks for taking the questions. Just to follow-up on Geoff's question on the COVID-19 front. George, how you're thinking about the clinical trial designs for your antibody cocktail both from a prophylactic standpoint, as well as a therapeutic? And on the latter, do you plan to either go head-to-head or on top of remdesivir if you run initial studies in a hospital setting? Thank you.
George Yancopoulos: Well, we're planning on doing three sets of trials in the prophylactic or prevention setting in people who are at high-risk in early treatment that is patients who are not at the level that they would be normally hospitalized. But patients who are identified they're symptomatic. If they do go to an ER, they are sent home, but they don't need oxygen support.However, significant number of them do develop more serious disease and then have to return to the hospital. So the idea would be to stop the disease in those individuals and stop the progression and the need from them going back to the hospital. And then we're also going to go to the hospitalized setting very similar to what we're doing with KEVZARA and where the Remdesivir data has read out.So certainly, the only setting where it would be on top of an existing standard-of-care potentially would be in the late treatment setting, we would certainly be going on top of standard- f care there whether it be Remdesivir or maybe we'll see whether there's data from other agents by that time as well.In the prophylactic setting, there is no need and there's also no other standard of care and in the same thing in the early treatment. And I would remind you once again that based as I said on our experience in other programs and most notably a good example is the Ebola program, the earlier that one treats, the better one does.I remind you early in the disease for Ebola, which is obviously a much more lethal disease with much higher levels of severe disease and death we were able to save more than 90% of the patients when we went with early treatment. So I think that there's a lot of reason to think that in this setting these sorts of antibodies both in the prophylactic setting and in the early treatment setting can have really profound benefits on their own.
Justin Holko: Thank you for the question, Cory. Next.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research.
Tim Anderson: Thank you very much. On your antibody cocktail. I'm wondering, if you think Gilead's actions with Remdesivir essentially set the bar for other companies in terms of what they may be expected to do specifically in terms of giving away some portion of initial therapy free at the outset? Thank you.
George Yancopoulos: Len, you want to take that? Len?
Leonard Schleifer: Yes, hi. Sorry. It's Len. We've spent all of our energy right now focused on getting the technical success that George described and that we hope to see. And in parallel, we have been working to clear manufacturing capacity in our New York plant so that we can make it at large scale. We hope to be able to have a couple hundred thousand doses by the end of the summer and then continue to manufacture from there. In terms of pricing, donations, and fair values and all that sort of stuff that's just got to come down the road a little bit.
Tim Anderson: Thank you.
Justin Holko: Next question.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal from Bernstein.
Ronny Gal: Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. I want to go back to Libtayo non-small cell lung cancer. I hear you about physicians wanting to have a choice in monotherapy between KEYTRUDA and a second product. The question is why should they choose Libtayo, the KEYTRUDA? I think you've got a product here, which is just to make the point a few years is the standard of care used extensively.Can you just share with us in your data, is there other elements of the data you're seeing from the trial would suggest that there is any group of patients where physicians should prefer Libtayo over KEYTRUDA what is your marketing argument here? And before I stopped there, I just want to thank you for all the efforts you're making against COVID-19 just adding to my peers here.
Leonard Schleifer: Thanks, Ronny. It's Len. It's way too early for us to be making any comparative statements. We literally, just recently got the, good news from the data monitoring committee that we met with highly statistical significance, as George described survival.We've got a lot more data to go. We've got a lot more studies to look at. It's not just one study. It's not just the cross-study comparison. There's going to be a lot more that goes into this. And we'll just have to see how this evolves.But the history of the industry typically is that, if there's just a couple of competitors, you have to remember that the size of this market. Last year it was about $22 billion of which about 70% or 75% was lung cancer. And that was largely driven by Keytruda sales. So there's a pretty big opportunity to have some important alternatives. And you just have to wait, I'm sorry Ronny to see how this all evolves when we roll this out.
Justin Holko: Sure. Thanks, Ronny. Next question.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond from Piper Sandler.
Chris Raymond: Yeah. Thanks. Just back to the antibody cocktail, I guess. So George, a lot of folks, I guess close to the FDA and maybe some with a fairly loud voice on these COVID matters, just keep talking about at least one of the therapies one of the antibody therapies, that's in development being available, as early as this fall.So I guess, maybe just talk about how is that possible, from a clinical development standpoint? And especially in light of the program you just described, George with the three different settings. Obviously, when there's something that's even under an emergency use authorization available, how do you conduct that? Thanks.
George Yancopoulos: Well, yeah. I think that, these are all great questions. We're in unprecedented times. I think that, the urgency and the collaborative spirit between regulators, between medical institutions, between companies, it has never been seen before. And also our commitment to this is something we've sort of done it before. But now we're trying to take it to the next level.So we are planning, as we said in June to simultaneously initiate trials, in the three settings that we're actually talking about. We are thinking of ways to synergize between the three classes of trials that we're talking about. And we are hoping -- I mean this is going to depend on a lot of factors. And there's obviously a lot of risk and concerns, whether this can be done, since it hasn't ever been done before.But we are really hoping that, we'll be able to not only initiate these studies, but able within a month or two to perhaps if these agents are working as well as we might hope they would work, as well as for example some of the precedents set by Ebola suggest that they might work, that we might within that month or two be getting data.If we were to get data, within those sort of timeframes as Len describes we have already committed at risk to manufacturing the drug supply this could be providing by the end of the summer, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of doses, of these antibodies. So, you're right. It's never been done before.On the other hand, I don't think we ever had quite a pandemic like this before. And I think that, some companies like ours have really put themselves in a position with the technologies, the commitments, the investments that we've made to put ourselves in a position, to maybe help out and make a difference here.And regulators like the FDA, BARDA everybody is coming together to try to help us in this situation to meet the urgency and meet the dire need that we might have here. And so the hope is yes, it might be possible by the end of the summer or the fall that, our antibody treatment could be available. A lot of risks, a lot of concerns, but we are working as hard as we can with so many collaborators to try to turn that into a reality.
Justin Holko: So we still have several callers – sorry, we have several callers still in the queue. So we'll extend for a few more minutes, if we can.
Leonard Schleifer: Let me just put a finer point on that. But just in a second. I completely agree with what George said. And I think if you listen carefully to what he was saying is that, because we're doing three different types of studies, the timing on the different studies might be quite different.If you're dealing with people, who already have the disease, then you're not waiting for that long period to occur, when you're trying to prevent the disease. And people who already have the disease, the cause of the disease sort of declares itself, over a several week to month period.And so you could imagine, depending upon what's going on. How many people are actually showing up at the hospital? How many people are hospitalized, in the ICU that that part could go a lot faster? But of course, you can imagine that George and the team have got a lot of great strategies, for the early part, to try and find people at high enough risk, which is the hard part in a preventative setting. Sorry next question.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.
Terence Flynn: Hi. Thanks as well from me for your efforts on the COVID front. Maybe another one for George on, bispecifics, I was just wondering if you've already generated data from your PSMA bispecific antibody as monotherapy. And if that's what led to your decision to initiate a combo trial with Libtayo?And then the second part of the question relates to your comment George about, seeing continuing promising activity. I was wondering if that was only on the BCMA bispecific, or has that also covered the MUC16 bispecific? Thank you.
George Yancopoulos: Yes, great questions. I guess, first of all, basically, we think that, the bispecific costims. We've described these in the literature. We have a lot of data on them. On their own they are designed to essentially have very little or no activity. And only when combined with either a CD3 bispecific or with a PD-1 agent do they then essentially synergize and amplify the benefit or activate the benefit of the other agent.And we've done a lot of work on that. Quite a bit of published work has already been shown on that. And the early data in the clinic are supporting that in that the monotherapy costim was not intended and did not show single-agent activity. We are now in the combination program, where we are hoping to now activate activity by adding the costim to the PD-1.That's how they were designed, that's what we're hoping to see and that is what we are hoping to be able to generate data that we will be giving you information on in the future. In terms of the promising activity, I think that yes, we have seen robust activity with the BCMA. We have not really reported anything on the MUC16. I can say that we are seeing evidence of activity and we'll give you more details on that in future times.
Justin Holko: Thank you, Terence. Next question?
Leonard Schleifer: One second, Terence if I may. We appreciate all the comments from the analyst community thanking us for what we're doing. We just want to say. we find your notes very useful and very helpful. The coverage of this pandemic, the useful information that all of you provide and what's going on and what the rates are of this and that and what to be expected we really appreciate that as well.
Justin Holko: Next question?
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Schimmer from Evercore ISI.
Josh Schimmer: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Another one COVID-19. How do you determine the optimal dose for passive immunization, especially if you have to adjust for different levels of exposure? How long do you think a single dose will confer protection? And then what are realistic goal in terms of the number of people you can support beyond August with prophylactic use considering potential supply constraints? Thank you.
George Yancopoulos: Okay. Well, basically we have accumulated over many years now, a lot of understanding about the doses that one needs to block viral infection particularly of respiratory and other diseases. So we actually know both in animal models and in humans the blood levels to block respiratory infection. And so we are targeting to be significantly above those blood levels for a minimum of at least a month for the prophylactic setting.So there's no guarantees. Once again these are all predictions based on experience in other programs with other viruses but including for example, the MERS coronavirus. And so we believe we have a good target blood level that we need to meet and achieve and stay above on for at least a month for the prophylaxis setting.And so the prophylaxis dosing is intended to last for at least a month. For example in our RSV program – for one of our programs there, we were able to have protection for several months. So minimum of a month is our current target based on maintaining blood levels that we believe you have to maintain above for preventing infection by respiratory viruses. What was the rest of the question?
Leonard Schleifer: In terms of supply – yes I'll take that George. Thanks. In terms of supply, we've going as fast as we can. We have an amazing capability in technology that allows us to get high producing cell lines very rapidly. We know how to make antibodies. We are one of the companies that can do this from end-to-end seamlessly. And so I'm optimistic that we can expand from the initial numbers we talked about and continue to manufacture.We have had inquiries from multiple other companies about perhaps wanting to manufacture a cocktail when we have good data and we suspect maybe the government may want that to happen as well, where we can expand through collaborative efforts and sort of take the unprecedented step of letting some of our technology outside the company for this purpose as well, because that's what probably will need to be done.
Justin Holko: Thanks, John. Next question.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber from Cowen.
Yaron Werber: Hey, good morning. Thanks for asking quick question. I'm going to shift a little bit George and maybe fasinumab, just so we don't lose track of that program. It sounds like that data is coming up pretty soon the Phase III osteoarthritis data. Any thoughts? And any thoughts on Pfizer-filed fasinumab for approval? So this is totally overlooked but I want to know what's kind of coming down as you can share? Thank you.
George Yancopoulos: Yes. Our viewpoint with fasinumab is that for a long time now as obviously, I think most people appreciate is that in many ways, this is a very risky program in that. There are – there is a now well-defined adverse event that we are trying to tighter around with the dose. And I think the major question for this program is whether we have been able to find a dose that threads the needle between the safety concern and between providing sufficient benefit to patients.I think if you see other competitors' data here, it's been a little difficult for others to thread the needle. So this is what we're going to see, especially when we see the data that comes out from our ongoing program that we'll be getting by the middle of this year, how well we've done to actually find a magic spot on the dose response curve, where we have sufficient safety but sufficient benefit and how that might compare to what others have achieved.So we are as anxious and excited as you are to see whether we may have threaded this needle in a way that really provides an important alternative for patients as we know there is a crying, literally a crying need here for new pain medications and particularly for the osteoarthritis population and we are hoping that we may have threaded that needle.
Justin Holko: Thanks, Yaron. We're going to try to cut the call about quarter to the hour that leaves us with time for one to two more questions. Next question, Crystal.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Carter Gould from Barclays.
Carter Gould: Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I pass on my congrats on the Libtayo data sets and thank you for all the COVID efforts. Maybe just focusing back on Libtayo for a second. It sounds like most of the commentary is, sort of, reaffirmation of the development strategy here and, sort of, validation of the efforts to-date. I guess -- but with this data in hand particularly the lung data does this, sort of, either accelerate your focus on broad -- further broadening out of the novel-novel combinations or potentially a shift to bringing in outside agents maybe a shift in, sort of, that partnership strategy? Thank you.
George Yancopoulos: Right. I think that this is really a landmark for the field, but also for us. Keytruda has stood really unchallenged now particularly in lung cancer, which is driving most of the sales for this entire field. Because others haven't actually been able to show that they've had a Keytruda-like agent. I think that I understand the concerns about people talking about how are you going to compete?But having something that's already showing this profound clinical activity that we're now seeing as a monotherapy with also, having also identified this is another thing that people have to appreciate new first-in-class indications that have been missed by the rest of the field. First with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma now with basal cell, I think are establishing Libtayo as a legitimate monotherapy alternative.And as Len said, when you have opportunities such as $8 billion opportunities in first line history shows that bona fide competitors with profound clinical activity they are going to get significant shares. But I think, it's exactly as you said, we believe we are now in a position where we can compete in these monotherapy situations, but it only amplifies our excitement and our commitment to the combination approach. And of course, as you say we are working hard to find the right outside collaborators. And I think we've already announced quite a few of them that we're very excited about, that we're already starting combination studies on and so forth, but we are just as excited about our internal homegrown pipeline.We have been preparing, a series of combination assets just for this moment now where we will have this potent powerful PD-1 antibody of our own. Our entire strategy depended on it and now that the molecule has come through and proved that it really is a bona fide monotherapy competitor out there we are now just doubly motivated and compelled to now build upon that with all these combination opportunities that have been coming out of our labs for the last few years. So we could not be more excited that we will now have the ability to not only compete as a monotherapy, but now to add with all these combinations, all these bispecifics, the costim bispecifics and so forth as well as these collaboration assets. And we think this is a really exciting time not only for us, but for the field because I hope you all realize how the immuno-oncology field despite all the initial excitement has not moved forth as much as I think we all would have wanted it to have moved forward.We haven't seen the magic combinations. We haven't seen the dramatic increases in to new cancers. We think we have the opportunity to take that field to the next level and having the foundational PD-1 antibody of our own really gives us that opportunity. So these are really exciting times for us, but I think for the field that -- for the first time in a decade maybe substantial new advances, a new age of immuno-oncology may be coming now.
Justin Holko: Crystal, we have time for two, three quick questions.
Leonard Schleifer: You can be sure we're getting together with our collaborator Sanofi on this and going to look carefully about how to move this forward and how to compete well with the data, we have and other data we want to get.
Justin Holko: Crystal, this is time for two more quick ones.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Bank of America.
Geoff Meacham: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question and for squeezing me in. I want to ask another one on COVID cocktail. Just to follow-up George on some of your earlier comments about rolling out efficacy studies next month. I'm assuming that or can I infer that you're bypassing traditional Phase I safety studies and healthies and then when you think about manufacturing scale up what's the opportunity to outsource or to partner should you have much higher demand and success obviously in the pivotal study? Thank you very much.
George Yancopoulos: Yes. I think that we have been already in active conversation with regulators exactly on the points that you talk about. And I think these are unprecedented times and I think also when you have the history with these types of agents, it does allow you and it does allow the comfort of the regulators that one could be moving forward very quickly. And so as you might imagine along the lines of the things that you proposed these are exactly the sorts of things that we're talking about with regulators. And we're trying to employ into our designs.In terms of your second part of your question, I think, Len already started talking about this point, which is we have made a huge commitment to enable our entire upstate New York manufacturing facility to be devoted to this effort, which on its own could supply hundreds of thousands if not over the course of time maybe even on the order of a million or so doses per month. However, even that might not be sufficient depending on the demand, depending on whether there's a second wave, depending on what happens with vaccines and so forth. So we are actively talking about collaborations with others who are very interested in bringing their resources to the table here too.As we said, there's enormous collaborative spirit that I think we haven't seen before between companies to come together, to help each other out, to really make a difference here in this pandemic. And so that opportunity is really out there. We're actively talking with people. And of course it all depends on whether these antibodies deliver. But if they deliver and depending on the state of the pandemic if there's more need I am sure that there will be ways that either we on our own or with major collaborations will be able to supply more to more patients.
Justin Holko: Okay. Crystal, last question. Unfortunately, we have a lot of people still in the queue but this will be our last question
Operator: And your question comes from the line of Yatin Suneja with Guggenheim.
Yatin Suneja: Good morning, everyone. And I also appreciate all the effort on the COVID front. I also would like to complement Bob for simplifying the accounting, really appreciating a much cleaner guidance that you provided today. So the question is on the EYLEA front. I think Marion, pre-COVID you were anticipating total market supply for prefilled syringe by March. Could you comment where you are in terms of the supply of PFS? And any impact you saw of PFS an idea performance in 1Q? And also, I'm not sure if there was any inventory dynamic that you commented on earlier today. Thanks.
Marion McCourt: Okay. So sure. Let me take those. I'll start with your last. So in terms of inventory, we have stayed at normal levels. So we're not seeing anything unusual in terms of inventory. Your next question on prefilled syringe, we do think prefilled syringe is a very attractive alternative in the marketplace. And the use of the prefilled syringe has gone up to about 75% of total use of EYLEA. We have, as you know, introduced prefilled syringe in a staggered way starting towards the end of last year. But it's been very well received and we do intend to have not only prefilled syringe, which of course is growing in popularity, but we'll also maintain vials in the marketplace.And then I believe the other item that you were commenting on was in terms of the COVID impact, and as I shared certainly in the first quarter we had very robust performance with EYLEA, and saw our sales grow in the U.S. marketplace 9% in net sales over the prior year. We did see, as I mentioned, a decline in overall demand in the last two weeks of March and that continued into the first two weeks of April, then we saw a sharp rebound in the most -- meaning a positive trend in the last two weeks. So that when you put all that together and all those factors together, demand in the month of April was approximately 15% lower than in the same period last year.But I go on to say, it's hard to predict what will happen with the COVID impact going forward. But we remain very confident in EYLEA's profile, our commitment to the retinal specialist community, and the -- obviously, the very attractive profile we have, both clinically and from a safety standpoint with EYLEA. We're supporting our offices through appropriate promotion and support so that when patients flow -- returns in a more robust fashion, we certainly look forward to the opportunity to help those patients with EYLEA and support our prescribers.
Justin Holko: Thank you everyone. That's going to conclude our call. We appreciate everybody hanging on a little longer today, given all the things that we had to speak to and all the great questions that came in. Bob Landry and the IR team will be available following the call to answer further questions. Thank you.
George Yancopoulos: Stay safe.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-02-06 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Sylvia, and I’ll be your operator for today’s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference call is being recorded.I will now turn the call over to Justin Holko. Justin, you may begin.
Justin Holko: Thank you, Sylvia. Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening to everyone listening around the world. Thank you for your interest in Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and welcome to the fourth quarter 2019 conference call. An archive of this webcast will be available on our website.Joining me today are Leonard Schleifer, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; George Yancopoulos, Founding Scientist, President and Chief Scientific Officer; Marion McCourt, Senior Vice President and Head of Commercial; and Bob Landry, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A.I would also like to remind you that remarks made on today’s call include forward-looking statements about Regeneron.

Additional information about those measures is also available on the Investor and Media section of our website. Once our call concludes, Bob Landry and the IR team will be available to answer further questions.With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer Dr. Len Schleifer.
Leonard Schleifer: Thank you, Justin. Thank you to everyone for joining our call today. The fourth quarter capped off a strong 2019 for Regeneron. Our three growth drivers EYLEA, Dupixent and Libtayo drove double-digit growth on the top and bottom lines while we continue to make substantial investments in our innovative R&D pipeline.In the quarter, EYLEA global net product sales grew 11% to $2 billion, including U.S. EYLEA net sales growth of 13% to $1.22 billion even with the launch of a new competitor. For the full year global net sales of EYLEA grew 12% to $7.5 billion. We remain confident as we expand our leadership position in wet AMD and diabetic eye diseases.Dupixent sales are now annualizing at $3 billion as we expand our footprint in the retreatment of type 2 inflammatory diseases. Global net product sales grew 136% to $762 million in the fourth quarter. And just last week we announced that the FDA accepted for priority review our filing in pediatric atopic dermatitis, which if approved will represent a breakthrough for children six to 11 years old suffering from this debilitating disease. We are still in the early days of Dupixent with many global launches just starting and several potential new indications in late-stage development.As expected, the profits from our antibody collaboration with Sanofi continue to increase creating further revenue and earnings diversification for Regeneron. On the strength of Dupixent, we generated profits of $104 million for the fourth quarter and $209 million for the full year, despite the losses associated with Praluent and Kevzara.To that end, we have been working hard to address Praluent and Kevzara performance to further enhance profitability of the collaboration. In December, we and Sanofi announced a major restructuring of the alliance that will improve profitability, increase efficiency, and enhance focus on Dupixent. We remain on track to close the transaction in the first quarter.In oncology, we continue to make progress both commercially and in R&D. Sales for Libtayo, our anti-PD-1 therapy grew to $75 million in the fourth quarter. In the U.S. we extended Libtayo’s leadership position as the number one systemic treatment in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.As we look to 2020 for Libtayo, we are excited about the late-stage data readouts in basal cell carcinoma and the interim analysis for our pivotal monotherapy study in non-small cell lung cancer.We are also making significant progress on our bispecifics program in oncology. We had a strong showing at the American Society of Hematology Meeting in December where we presented initial data for a BCMAxCD3 antibody, as well as updated data for our CD20xCD3 antibody.While each of these programs could be important individual treatments over time, they also represent validation of our bispecifics program, which along with Libtayo form a diverse and powerful toolkit to potentially address malignant diseases.Regeneron has a track record of tackling some of the world’s most challenging health issues, while creating long-term value to shareholders. Looking back at 2019, we achieved six important regulatory approvals across our growth drivers of EYLEA, Dupixent and Libtayo. Beyond these approvals, we made significant advances in our pipeline which George will discuss.Additionally, I would like to call your attention to the global health crisis on coronavirus. We have answered the call for help and are responding diligently with HHS to develop potential treatments. George will also further outline this effort.Regeneron is entering 2020 from a position of financial strength. We have the necessary capital to advance and expand our wholly-owned R&D pipeline. Additionally, we continue to seek value-creating business development with a focus on technologies that enable and accelerate our own technologies in drug discovery and development. And when market conditions create opportunity, we will continue to buy back shares under our share repurchase program where we continue to see a significant dislocation between our share price and the long-term value of the company.In conclusion, we are pleased with our continued operational and financial execution that is creating near and long-term value. We are entering 2020 with strong momentum and we remain confident in our strategy and in our business.Now, I'll turn the call over to George.
George Yancopoulos: Thank you, Len. I will provide an overview of our diverse pipeline, which is made possible by our foundational technologies that allow us to rapidly identify and validate genetic targets and go quickly and efficiently to turnkey therapeutic solutions, whether through internally developed approaches such as VelociGene, Velocimmune and the Regeneron Genetic Center were important new collaborative capabilities, such as those with our Alnylam, Intellia, Bluebird and others.Starting with EYLEA. This weekend at the Baskin Palmer Angiogenesis Meeting, we will present the two year data for the PANORAMA study in nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy, which showed a market reduction in the risk of developing vision-threatening complications.At the same time we will discuss the rationale for clinical testing of high-dose EYLEA, currently in a Phase II trial in wet AMD that will provide initial safety and efficacy data. A Phase III trial in DME will begin mid-year closely followed by a Phase III study in wet AMD.Moving on to Dupixent, our dual blocker of both the interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 pathways, which is changing the lives of so many people suffering from allergic diseases such as asthma, atopic dermatitis and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps with more than 125,000 patients treated globally since launch.Just last week, we announced that the FDA is undertaking a priority review to extend approval of Dupixent to children aged six to 11 years suffering from moderate to severe atopic dermatitis with a target PDUFA date of May 26, 2020.If approved, this will be the first biologic indicated for these children. We would hope that this approval will continue to reflect the remarkable efficacy and safety profile of Dupixent. As evidenced by the absence of a black box warning or any associates serious infection risks which are often seen with other neuromodulatory biologics and kinase inhibitors.While Marion will update you on quarterly performance, I would like to highlight other near and long-term opportunities for Dupixent. Eosinophilic esophagitis or EOE is a currently underdiagnosed but increasingly recognized serious allergic condition with limited effective treatment options.Following up on our promising proof-of-concept study, we will read out on the Phase II portion of our Phase II/III study in adults and adolescents by mid-year while the Phase III portion continues to enroll. Additionally, we are studying a Phase III study in pediatric EOE patients in the second half of the year.On a related front, we are excited about our collaborator Aimmune’s recent approval for Palforzia, an oral immunotherapy for peanut allergy. But there is still an enormous need for therapies for the treatment of food allergies, as many of these patients are at risk for EOE and other allergic conditions. We think Dupixent study in combination with Palforzia has the potential to further improve the outcomes for these patients.I am also pleased to share the pivotal studies for Dupixent in the new indications we announced last November are kicking off. Studies for chronic spontaneous urticaria, prurigo nodularis and bullous pemphigoid have already started. The study in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis will commence in the first half of this year.Now let’s turn and spend a few moments on immuno-oncology, where we are strategically positioned to compete, enhance and extend the benefits of immunotherapy to many more patients that are currently benefiting today.With Libtayo, we have an important opportunity to compete in the PD-1 treatment landscape. Combining Libtayo with other antibodies from our VelociGene and Velocimmune derived toolkit including bispecific antibodies, we are looking to enhance responsiveness for the more than half the patients that do not respond to PD-1 therapy alone.Moreover such combinations have the potential to extend our reach to patients with cancers such as breast, colon, pancreatic and prostate which show very limited response to checkpoint inhibition at this point.For Libtayo in addition to being foundational to our combinatorial approach in oncology, we are expecting some near-term milestones. Later this year the independent data monitoring committee will conduct pre-specified interim analysis assessing overall survival for the pivotal Libtayo monotherapy study in non-small cell lung cancer.At the last quarterly update, we announced that an interim analysis of the first 361 randomized patients, the confirmed objective response rate as determined by investigators was 42% for Libtayo versus 22% for chemotherapy.Although, promising in terms of indicating profound clinical activity for Libtayo and lung cancer objective response rate is not a validated endpoint for regulatory approval in this setting.Our other pivotal lung cancer study in which Libtayo is being tested in combination with chemotherapy is more than 50% enrolled and is expected to fully enroll by midyear.While, we are investigating different combination approaches with Libtayo melanoma skin cancers, where less than half the patient’s benefit from PD-1 therapy alone, we believe patients with non-melanoma skin cancers still remain underserved and we are working to expand the available treatment options for these patients.Libtayo remains the first and only approved therapeutic in advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or CSCC with a safety profile that is similar to that of the other group PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors.Following on recent promising results with Libtayo in neoadjuvant CSCC which we recently announced, we are now enrolling a registrational study in the adjuvant study setting, as well as a follow-up neoadjuvant CSCC study.We are also looking forward to the potentially pivotal data readout for basal cell carcinoma of the skin in mid-2020. If the data are positive we are hoping to proceed with the regulatory filing this year.And we continue to make exciting progress with our bispecific antibody platform. At the American Society of Hematology or ASH meetings we presented data from our first class of these antibodies. The CD3 bispecifics that are designed to bring a killer T-cell to a tumor and trigger the so-called signal one in the T-cell activation process leading to tumor cell destruction.For REGN1979 our CD20xCD3 bispecific, we reported 95% overall response rates with 77 complete response rates in 22 late-stage follicular lymphoma patients. In late-stage diffuse large B-cell lymphoma we observed 71% overall response rates all of which were complete responses in 7 CAR-T naive patients.Moreover and quite remarkably, we saw a 50% overall response rates in 12 patients who had failed CAR-T therapy with 3 of these patients achieving a complete response to treatment with REGN1979. Clearly this bispecific has demonstrated promising single agent clinical activity in late-stage patients and supports initiation of a potentially pivotal Phase II program for REGN1979 in several monotherapy studies including relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma, relapsed/refractory DLBCL as well as several other non-Hodgkin's lymphoma subtypes. We are also planning to initiate chemotherapy combination studies this year in earlier lines of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.At the same ASH meeting we presented preliminary data for our second CD3 bispecific. REGN5458, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific in late-stage multiple myeloma. Remarkably the first patient in this program was dosed at the beginning of 2019 and we were able to show initial efficacy and safety data at the ASH meeting later the same year.In the higher of the two initial doses, objective responses were observed in three out of four patients, two of which achieved MRD negativity. These were all very advanced patients who had failed a median of seven lines of prior systemic therapy, including anti-CD38. We are currently enrolling higher dose escalation cohorts.This year, we also advanced our novel second class of bispecifics into the clinic. These bispecifics are referred to as CD28 or costim bispecifics. Because they activate the CD28 mediated costim inventory signal also known as signal two that is normally record to optimize cell killing by T-cells.Researchers have avoided targeting this T-cell activation pathway for almost 15 years ever since the disastrous clinical trial involving CD28 superagonist, which indiscriminately activated T-cells in the bodies of healthy volunteers leading to cytokine storm and severe toxicity.In contrast, our CD28 bispecifics are designed to avoid this problem by locally engaging T-cells only at the tumor site. As validated by our preclinical studies, some of which were published a few weeks ago in science translational medicine, and which demonstrated synergistic activity when costims were combined with Libtayo or with other bispecifics even for tumors historically unresponsive to PD-1 blockade.At the end of last year, we enrolled our first patients in the clinical trial of our first costim PSMAxCD28 in combination with Libtayo in advanced prostate cancer patients. We expect additional costims to enter in the clinic in 2020.Now I'd like to move on to the rest of our pipeline. With the C5 blocker, pozelimab, our goal is to achieve a more complete blockade of inappropriate complement activation compared to the currently available therapies and to do this with a more convenient self-administered subcutaneous dosage form.Results from an initial six-patient cohort of our Phase 2 study in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria patients announced in December, showed that our subcutaneous weekly regimen, the pozelimab maintained lactate dehydrogenase, a biomarker for red blood cell damage, at normal levels at week eight.Importantly, we are uniquely positioned to test a novel approach by combining pozelimab with our partner Alnylam's anti five - anti C5 siRNA, which has the potential to maximize efficacy, while further significantly reducing dosing frequency.This will be the first in a series of opportunities for combination of our antibodies with siRNA. We will be initiating our potentially pivotal program with pozelimab as well as combinations with the siRNA this year.I’d like to provide an update on a few other late-stage programs. Earlier this year with top line results of the Phase 2 study of Garetosmab, our Activin A antibody for fibrodysplasia ossificans progressive, a devastating orphan disease in which patient's muscles, tendons and ligaments are progressively replaced by bone, forming a second skeleton that traps them in their own bodies often leading to asphyxiation.In the 44 patient study, Garetosmab demonstrated a nearly 90% reduction in formation of new bone lesions compared to placebo. This treatment has the potential to transform the course of this disease. We plan to discuss the data with the regulators, as well as initiate a study in pediatric patients.In 2020, we are also planning a regulatory submission for evinacumab, our ANGPTL3 antibody for homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia patients. We are also anticipating readout of the fasinumab or anti-NGF studies in osteoarthritis pain including the long-term safety study, as well as Phase 3 studies comparing it to naproxen and NSAIDs.Finally, I’d like to finish by discussing our partnership with BARDA. Part of the office of preparedness and response to the Department of Health and Human Services. Together, we hope to exploit our rapid response capabilities to address emerging infectious disease outbreaks.We initially built this program and work with BARDA to address the 2012 MERS epidemic. MERS is a coronavirus closely related to the Wuhan virus that's causing the current global public health emergency.Then in 2014, we turned our rapid response capabilities to focus on Ebola working together with BARDA and the World Health Organization, progressing therapeutic candidates in just six months and resulting in the potential cure even for sickest Ebola patients as was recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine and allowing for an ongoing rolling submission to the FDA for approval of our life-saving antibody cocktail.As BARDA announced just this week, we are now extending our collaboration with them to address the Wuhan coronavirus. We’re already scaling up one set of potential antibody treatments that could be available for testing or for compassion use in patients within a few months, as well as a new set of treatments that could be available soon thereafter.With that, I will turn the call over to Marion.
Marion McCourt: Thank you, George. We closed out 2019 on a high note with continued commercial execution across our portfolio. Our core EYLEA and Dupixent business [Technical Difficulty] in oncology.Starting with EYLEA, in the fourth quarter, we recorded our best performance in terms of volume and net sales since launch in 2011. Global net sales grew 11% year-over-year to more than $2 billion and U.S. net sales grew 13% to $1.22 billion versus the prior year. Growth was driven by increases to both market share and market expansion.EYLEA's sales grew in diabetic eye disease and in wet AMD despite a new anti-VEGF market entrant. Also while not a material driver of performance in the quarter, we introduced the EYLEA prefilled syringe in mid-December and anticipate full market supply in March. The overall anti-VEGF market continues to grow at a steady mid to high single-digit pace, underpinned by the aging population and increasing prevalence of diabetes.Our renewed strategy and incremental 2019 investments enhanced wet AMD leadership and drove further penetration in diabetic eye disease which has EYLEA growing faster than the market across all indications.As we have seen for the last several quarters, the growth rate in diabetic eye disease exceeds the growth rate in wet AMD. Accordingly, the wet AMD business represents less than 60% of total U.S. EYLEA net product sales.In 2020, we have significant opportunities to advance EYLEA's leadership position. In wet AMD, we are executing initiatives designed to position EYLEA as the preferred first-line treatment. Beyond wet AMD, we see tremendous opportunity in diabetic eye disease as patients remain largely underdiagnosed and undertreated.We're investing in targeted initiatives with physicians and consumers to increase diagnosis and treatment rates, as well as applying technologies to support screening and diagnosis. The totality of our clinical profile, safety record, dosing flexibility, breadth of indications and established reimbursement give us confidence in the future for EYLEA.Turning to Libtayo. Fourth quarter global net sales were $75 million. In the U.S. where sales were $61 million we've quickly established Libtayo as the leading system treatment for advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma or CSCC. Approximately 60% of CSCC patients now receive anti-PD-1 therapy, and in the anti-PD-1 class, Libtayo has nearly 90% share of new patients.In 2020, we’re investing to increase our commercial presence including expanding our field force to strengthen Libtayo's position as the standard of care in CSCC. Additionally, launch preparations for a potential approval in basal cell carcinoma are underway.Outside the U.S. initial CSCC launches are ongoing and led by our collaborator Sanofi. We’re encouraged by early prescribing trends and continue to see progress with access and reimbursement. Overall, we’re very pleased with the early impact we have made with Libtayo.And finally to Dupixent. Global net sales in the fourth quarter were $752 million. In the U.S. net sales reached $605 million, representing 134% growth as compared to the prior year. We continue to see strong prescribing trends across all indications with total prescriptions growing approximately 18% compared to the third quarter.Weekly new-to-brand prescriptions at quarter end were approximately 1,500 patients per week. Atopic dermatitis remains a significant growth driver for Dupixent. The brand continues to outpace other biologic launches in dermatology and there is significant room for further penetration.We’re expanding the market through increased prescribing across both moderate and severe disease. Additionally, the recent adolescent launches contributing to growth, aided by physician experience and comfort with Dupixent's efficacy and safety profile. As Len mentioned, we eagerly await the potential FDA approval in six to 11-year olds, where there is a significant disease burden for young patients and their families.In asthma Dupixent is outperforming other recent biologic launches with nearly 80% of Dupixent asthma patients being new to biologic treatment. We continue to demonstrate that our strategy to grow and compete in this market is working. There is significant opportunity to advance Dupixent's market position with less than 15% of eligible patients currently receiving biologic treatment.We recently began the rollout of our asthma direct-to-consumer TV campaign. Although early, our campaign is generating positive results from leading indicators. Finally, our launch in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps is off to a strong start. Patients are initiating on Dupixent regardless of prior surgery. Prescribing is being driven by both allergists and ENTs including many new Dupixent prescribers.We see tremendous growth potential with Dupixent and remain committed to advancing Dupixent prescribing to many more patients by way of expanded indications, age groups and geographies.In closing, we delivered strong growth across our core commercial franchise in the fourth quarter and throughout 2019. We are entering 2020 with significant momentum and confidence to drive the future.I'll turn the call over now to Bob.
Robert Landry: Thank you, Marion. For the fourth quarter 2019, Regeneron delivered another quarter of strong revenue and EPS growth. Fourth quarter 2019 revenues grew 13% to $2.17 billion, driven by continued growth of our core brands EYLEA, Libtayo and Dupixent. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share grew 10% year-over-year to $7.50 on non-GAAP net income of $858 million.Let me remind everyone when comparing to the prior year, the fourth quarter 2018 revenues included $149 million catch-up benefit related to the modification of the IO discovery agreement with Sanofi, which makes this quarter's growth even more impressive.Since Marion discussed our U.S. EYLEA results, I will start with our Bayer and Sanofi collaborations. Starting with the Bayer collaboration, ex U.S. EYLEA net product sales, which are reported to us by Bayer were $783 million, representing growth of 8% on a reported basis and 9% on a constant currency basis.Total Bayer collaboration revenue for the fourth quarter of 2019 grew 6% year-over-year to $321 million, of which $298 million was derived from our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S.Total Sanofi collaboration revenue in the fourth quarter was $427 million. Regeneron recognized a profit of $104 million from the commercialization of non-IO antibodies, compared to a loss of $44 million in the prior year period.Increases were driven primarily by higher Dupixent net sales, partially offset by the rollout of the Dupixent asthma DTC campaign, as well as incremental cost to support ongoing global Dupixent launches.Moving to our expense basis, starting with R&D. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $581 million for the fourth quarter of 2019, an increase of 9% compared to prior year. Non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as the total non-GAAP R&D expense less reimbursements from our collaborators was $393 million for fourth quarter 2019, an increase of 13% compared to the prior year. Higher R&D expenses result from broadening and advancing our pipeline of wholly-owned drug candidates particularly in oncology.We are also funding jointly developed molecules with strategic external partners. In November, we announced a research collaboration with Vyriad [ph] focusing on the development of new oncolytic virus-based treatments for cancer. Taken together, we continue to expect 2020 R&D expenses to increase.Next, non-GAAP SG&A expense was $446 million for the fourth quarter of 2019. This represents a 9% year-over-year increase, driven by higher headcount and related costs in commercialization expenses related to both EYLEA and Dupixent. We expect non-GAAP SG&A expenses to increase in 2020 as we invest for further growth in our three core brands EYLEA, Dupixent and Libtayo.In the fourth quarter of 2019 combined non-GAAP cost of goods sold and cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing were $208 million compared to $109 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. The year-over-year increase in cost of goods sold was primarily due to the company's obligation to pay Sanofi its share of Libtayo U.S. gross profits, third-party royalties on Lipton U.S. sales and higher inventory reserves and write-offs.The year-over-year increase in cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing was primarily due to recognition of manufacturing costs associated with higher sales of Dupixent.Shifting to cash flow and the balance sheet. For full year 2019 Regeneron generated $2 billion in free cash flow. We ended the year with cash and marketable securities of nearly $6.5 billion.Recall last November, we announced a $1 billion share repurchase program. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately $250 million worth of shares in open market transactions. We continue to repurchase shares opportunistically.Now, let me take a minute to discuss the restructuring of our antibody agreement with Sanofi. As we previously disclosed, the anticipated benefits of this proposed restructured agreement are improved profitability, increased efficiencies and simplification. Upon closing of the deal, we expect this transaction to be immediately accretive to Regeneron.We are working diligently to ensure an expedient close to the transaction this quarter. As such, we will provide annual guidance by the end of the first quarter to account for the various line items impacted by the restructured antibody agreement. Given the expected timing of the transaction closing continue to model Regeneron's financials for the first quarter as you have historically.Note that, our first quarter non-GAAP EPS results are typically lower than the fourth quarter of the prior year due to trends in tax rate and other seasonal market dynamics. We are generally comfortable with consensus non-GAAP EPS estimates for the full year. However, our quarterly reported increases from the beginning of the year to the end of the year will be more pronounced than what current consensus reflects.In conclusion, the fourth quarter capped off a strong year for Regeneron. We are pleased with our financial results and operational performance. We look forward to providing more details on the restructuring antibody agreement in 2020 Annual Guidance later this quarter.With that, I’d like to turn the call back to Justin.
Justin Holko: Thank you, Bob. We’d now like to open the call for Q&A. To ensure, we are able to address as many callers as possible, please limit your questions to one or two questions. Please go ahead Sylvia.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.
Terence Flynn: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just two for me. One on the first is with respect to bispecifics maybe George what gives you confidence that these will be successful in solid tumors? I know you guys have a number of different targets you're going after and waiting to see the data. But just maybe remind us what gives you confidence there? And then just on Dupi. Can you give us the sales split by indication or maybe the prescriber mix? Thank you.
Leonard Schleifer: George, why don't you start and then Marion you can take the Dupi question.
George Yancopoulos: Okay. So first of all, we have no reason to think that they wouldn't be. I know that there's a lot of speculation but it hasn't really been tested with reagents like our bispecifics to see whether solid tumors R&D are more resistant or not.But that notwithstanding, in case single agent therapy is not as effective for solid tumors, that is why we are preparing for that possibility with our various combinations. And our combinations include both combinations with these new classes of bispecs called costims which dramatically increased responses at least in preclinical models in the solid tumor setting, but also combinations with Libtayo and other kinds of checkpoint inhibitors and immunomodulatory agents.So the notion is though we're hopeful for single-agent activity, we are prepared that just like in many other cancers and many other treatment settings that combinations are going to be the key to success and we have a real exciting set of combination opportunities in the solid tumor space setting, as I said particularly with our costim bispecifics added to our CD3 bispecifics, as well as our PD-1, but other additional immunomodulatory agents.I'll turn the next question over to Marion about the Dupixent.
Marion McCourt: Sure. Happy to take. And this relates to your question on the breakdown of sales and performance for Dupixent. First, I'll just comment that we're seeing strong performance in sales growth and NBRX across all the indications. We haven't specifically given a breakdown by indication. Again, I confirm strength and strong performance and competitive performance in areas where we have competitors.But I can give you a little bit of in terms of how we're seeing the majority of our sales in NBRX’s in atopic dermatitis, that's then followed by asthma, and then third would be the nasal polyps where we're also seeing encouraging performance.
Leonard Schleifer: Next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, guys. This is Alex on for Geoff. Thanks for taking our questions. I have two. One on EYLEA and one on Praluent. So for EYLEA how are you guys thinking about the ongoing Beovu [ph] launch? Specifically do you view the earlier 12-week dosing as driving drug choice by prescribers? And any color you can give on ongoing or anticipated impact to rebates you provide for EYLEA to maintain formulary status?And then on Praluent, we've noted that the price reductions for the PCSK9 class has had an outsized benefit to Repatha volumes. Could you talk about the sales effort you and Sanofi have been taking in the U.S.? And what was the feedback from physicians and payers? And I guess ultimately how do you hope bringing these efforts entirely in-house will help drive volumes for Praluent? Thanks.
Leonard Schleifer: Sure, Marion?
Marion McCourt: Sure. So let me first comment on EYLEA performance. And certainly we worked very hard and have been in a competitive market with EYLEA for many years and certainly have established a very strong market leadership position.It's very early days for the newest competitor in the marketplace. But what I will affirm is that EYLEA has a profile that is incredibly well received and is referred to as the standard of care by our retinal specialists and injectors.Specifically, it's things like the clinical profile, as it relates to impact on visual acuity, multiple indications experienced not only clinically but with an established safety profile, reimbursement, dosing flexibility and also now dosage delivery with the prefilled syringe. So EYLEA has an incredibly compelling profile.As to competition both competition historically and future competition it becomes a matter of physicians determining what is the risk-benefit of using a different product and certainly there will be ample opportunity for retina specialists to make the choice in prescribing that's best for them. But to-date we hear very, very positive feedback in EYLEA.Certainly our most recent indication in diabetic eye disease, diabetic retinopathy is very important. As we described we did put forward earlier in 2019 a new strategy to make sure that we were making very firm our position in the wet AMD marketplace and then also extending in diabetic eye disease.So I think we feel really good about the performance that we saw in 2019. But we also see an awful lot of work ahead, because as I mentioned there's tremendous unmet need in disease burden and diabetic eye disease that we have not impacted yet. So, a lot of work going forward.You also have asked a question related to pricing in EYLEA. We don't give information on our pricing strategies. But I will say that we are very committed to physicians having choice of prescribing in all the categories in which we have competition and it's really important that doctors make the right choice for their patients. So we'll continue to take that position in the marketplace.I’ll move over to Praluent quickly. As was announced in the restructuring of our arrangement with Sanofi, Regeneron is now very pleased to be running the Praluent business in the U.S. It's early days. In the future, certainly we'll have more to say about our positioning in the market and our strategy in the marketplace. But I think at this point it's probably best that we let it go till the end of the restructuring agreement and the finalization of that transaction.
Leonard Schleifer: And just to add to Marion's points. She mentioned benefit risk for EYLEA and also safety for EYLEA. And I think it's very important to mention that physicians of course are very sensitive to this. And in settings where efficacy and durability are considered similar, they're going to pay very close attention to things like inflammation.And then certainly in the head-to-head studies, EYLEA was shown to have about four full lower levels of inflammation. And these are the sort of things that physicians pay close attention to when efficacy and durability are considered rather similar.
Justin Holko: Great. Next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Raymond from Piper Sandler.
Chris Raymond: Yeah. Thanks. Just a couple. So, just maybe first, maybe continuing on the EYLEA front. I think I heard you guys say that there was no stocking benefit in Q4 from the availability of the prefilled syringe.So, maybe can you talk about – this means there's a tailwind potentially for the first quarter? And maybe if you can put some brackets around that that would be helpful.And then, maybe for Bob. I think I heard you say Bob in your prepared remarks that you were comfortable with 2020 EPS consensus. And so, I know you guys are still in the process of trying to figure out how you're going to guide in the parameters, et cetera. But should we view this as a signal that maybe you guys are comfortable guiding to EPS at some point? Thanks.
Leonard Schleifer: Go ahead, Marion.
Marion Mccourt: Let me take the first part on EYLEA. And yes, you did hear me correctly that while we introduced the prefilled syringe for EYLEA in mid-December, it did not have an impact, a material impact. And certainly we were at normal stocking levels days on hand in the fourth quarter.One thing I’ll describe to you is we very deliberately have introduced the prefilled syringe in a staggered way. And this was obviously with such a large product so that there would be market experience and we would have a gradual introduction.We do plan to have availability of full market supply by the March timeframe and then physicians and offices will be able to make the decision as to whether they choose to use the prefilled range, which does have tremendous convenience and has had very positive early market feedback.But the vial will be available as well if there are instances where an office or a physician would like to use the vial. We do anticipate however though that the prefilled syringe will be very popular in the marketplace and over time will be the majority of our use, but it has been a staggered introduction.
Leonard Schleifer: Chris with regards to your question on guide, we are in a unique situation. By now, we would have given guidance at JPMorgan. We would have reconfirmed it on this call. And we just wanted to give you a sense a little bit direction instead of everyone driving blind with regards to where 2020 is expected to come.So again, we do our analysis and determined that we are comfortable with current consensus as it exists for full year EPS and we are not envisioning to give full EPS guidance at the end of the quarter. We will give other guidance as has been typical with maybe a little -- a few enhancements included.
Chris Raymond: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman from Credit Suisse.
Evan Seigerman: Hi, all. Thank you for taking my questions. And congrats on the progress last year. So on Libtayo non-small cell lung cancer, what gives you confidence that this trial will hit on the OS interim and high PD-L1 patients? And if successful would you file on this data? And how would you potentially position Libtayo versus other checkpoint inhibitors?
Leonard Schleifer: George, why don't you start?
George Yancopoulos: Yes. So as we said response rates are not regulatory approval endpoint. However, historically they've been shown to be a very good indicator for the activity. And in the setting of checkpoint inhibitors, they tend to correlate pretty well with what you see in terms of overall survival. And so our already reported response rates where we've almost doubled the response rate, certainly suggests profound clinical activity and is a real positive indicator.Of course, until we see the interim data, we won't know. But I think that that would put Libtayo in a very small space of agents that are now showing profound monotherapy activity in PD-L1 positive setting. So it would be a very exciting position to be in on top of this already demonstrated impressive best-in-class activity in the non-melanoma skin space.
Justin Holko: Next question please?
Operator: Our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges from SVP Leerink.
Geoffrey Porges: Thank you very much. Bob, just on the comment about accretion. Could you just give us a sense if the status quo prevailed, would your operating margin be consistent with last year or better? And then, presumably the intention of the agreement is that we would see operating margin improvement and that's how you get to it being accretive. So could you just comment on that?And then just a second question for George. You mentioned the costim program and I think we're all interested in seeing the first clinical data from that. That's not on your 2020 highlights. So should we be assuming that we don't see any clinical disclosure on the PSMA program until next year?
George Yancopoulos: Bob, do you want to start?
Robert Landry: So Geoff, I would concur with the assumptions that you made. I mean certainly, we've mentioned that Kevzara and Praluent have been a sizable drain with regards to the alliance profitability that we've shown.So certainly, the changes that are going to be made and coupled with the incoming royalties that we expect to get will certainly help our going forward margins.
Leonard Schleifer: George?
George Yancopoulos: Well as Geoff you probably followed closely with our first-class of bispecs, whenever you have a new class of agents and you're working with the FDA, of course the first purpose is to be moving as carefully and as safely as possible. And so for our first bispec, it took a long time to get to efficacious dose levels.When we finally got there, we had actually show that we have gotten there with a pretty safe approach, which now other people are trying to emulate. And then, we were able to pretty rapidly as I described with our second dose level get to efficacious dose level with our second CD3 bispecifics.So now, the CD28 class represents once again a new class. We are hoping that we're going to repeat that sort of experience and the timing of it of course is dependent on so many factors.So, depending on how it goes, we may reach effective dose levels sooner rather than later and get data sooner rather than later. But the major point is that we're working with the FDA and with our collaborators to make sure that we use this innovative new approach as safely as possible.So it all depends on how the dose escalation goes and when we get to what we think are the effective dose levels and it could be sooner or it could be a little later. And all we're hoping is that we're going to see the same sort of profound activity that we saw with our first-class of bispecifics which is really suggesting that they may be best-in-class.And if we can now layer on a completely new class that has synergistic activity, I think that will be very exciting and important for patients for all these settings where they're not responding right now to immunotherapy or where their responses are not as optimal as we would want.
Justin Holko: Great. Thanks for the question, Geoff. Next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from Yatin Suneja from Guggenheim Partners.
Yatin Suneja: Good morning everyone and congrats on a very good quarter. Just a question on a C5 antibody that you have, give us a little bit more insight into how you are thinking about broadening the development? Are there disease indication that you could potentially prioritize which might not be as competitive and might be a little bit broader?And then a quick one for Bob, on the Sanofi collaboration, relative to Q3 are there particular factors that might have impacted the results in Q4? Thank you.
Leonard Schleifer: Thank you. George, why don't you start in C5 and then Bob?
George Yancopoulos: Yes. As you said, we agree with you. We believe that there are a lot of settings for C5 beyond the PNH setting. I think that what we've disclosed so far and what we're talking about right now is the PNH. Why?Because the data are so clear-cut in terms of what the high bar that we have to reach to believe that we have something that could be a real improvement for patients and for the class.And so once we hit that bar there, we would be pretty confident then that it would also continue to maybe be a real advance for patients in best-in-class in all these other settings that you referred to. So we're certainly not ignoring those. But what we're talking about and focusing about right now is the really well understood space of PNH.
Leonard Schleifer: Great. And Bob?
Robert Landry: Yes. The question with regards to whether or not the Sanofi deal has given us benefit versus in Q4. I would say, we continue to go after operating expenses for PRALUENT and KEVZARA and we did see some of that in Q4. Again this is an issue that we've been going after. And we've had some success in terms of lowering the operating expenses associated with that.We did take a restructuring charge in Q4 and you'll see that outlined in our earnings announcement that was issued earlier this morning. And the big benefits you will begin to see will take place kind of effective Q1, where -- as we speak right now we're changing the operations of the businesses.
Leonard Schleifer: So I just wanted to add to my comments on the C5. And as I said, we set a pretty high bar for ourselves with just our antibody. And as we've announced the data suggests that that antibody is meeting that high bar by itself on its own which I think puts us in a very, very exciting position because now we have the opportunity to even take it to a completely new level with this exciting collaborative opportunity with the Alnylam siRNA.So the fact that our antibody by itself is looking like might be meeting this high bar of being a best-in-class agent providing big advantages to patients on its own having the opportunity to then combine it with the siRNA really I think is very exciting for the field and for patients.
Robert Landry: Let me just clarify one other thing. With regards to Q4 on the alliance profitability, we were -- we did incur significant expenses associated with the asthma DTC campaign which had a rollout effective in Q4 and I'm sure a lot of people have seen that throughout the quarter.
Justin Holko: Great. Thanks for the questions. Next question.
Operator: And the following question comes from Yaron Werber from Cowen.
Yaron Werber: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I have a couple of questions. The first one is, George maybe for you on Libtayo and maybe help us understand a little bit as you think about the hazard ratio versus what keynote showed and if you recall correctly -- was able to get stopped early.Obviously there was no PD-1 approved then and that study at about 305 patients, the hazard ratio was 0.5. Do you think you got sufficient power with a bigger sample to essentially match or beat that hazard ratio?And then maybe Bob for you. Just it sounds like you're comfortable with consensus you mentioned for this year when we're looking at consensus non-GAAP is about 2,590 in earnings. Are you comfortable with that including the restructuring? Or are you comfortable with that even excluding the restructuring? Thank you.
Leonard Schleifer: Go ahead George.
George Yancopoulos: Yes. Well as you said, we have the power and the expectation is that, if we were to hit an interim, we would have a hazard ratio that would be comparable analogous to those seen by Keytruda in its monotherapy first-line lung studies. So that is the expectation the power is there to potentially see that in the interim analysis. Bob?
Robert Landry: So the question on comfortability in the restructuring. We are comfortable with the consensus with the restructuring built into that. And again, let me remind you as I stated on the call the first quarter non-GAAP EPS results are typically lower than the fourth quarter of the prior year due to trends in tax rate and other seasonal market dynamics.
Yaron Werber: And maybe George just for you, when the interim initially in that study was based on 361 patients, Keytruda stopped with the same response rates based on 305. So are you thinking that the next 240 patients are going to have a better response than the first 361 in the study to be able to match the hazard ratio? Or is there - it depends on how many patients are in that interim analysis and it could be another one?
George Yancopoulos: When you're talking about the ratios…
Robert Landry: One second George before you get into. I just wanted to comment so there's no misunderstanding. You cited a hazard ratio of 0.5 and I think that was for the chemo combo therapy in 24 for the overall survival hazard ratio was 0.6. And in 42 just to double check it was 0.69. So I just want to make sure we have the right hazard ratios out there. Sorry. Go ahead George.
George Yancopoulos: Well, yeah. I was going to say well the hazard ratio actually was 0.63 for Keynote-024 and 0.69 for Keynote-042. But you also mentioned the ratio. So the first 361 patients in that interim analysis what we announced was the response rates. And our ratio for response rates in those patients was actually better than the ratio of any response rates that have been reported by Keytruda in first-line lung setting.However, the data was immature. That's response rate data the hazard ratio that you're referring to is overall survival. That requires much more mature data where you're following patients out for obviously survival.So, the early data it was that obviously we're reporting on the more mature response rate data, which are pretty close or should reflect what the ultimate data will look like. The survival data, we have to wait and see for those events to start accruing.And what we said is the ratio of the response rate is very favorable when you compare that, because in all the studies that have either succeeded or failed the response rate data ends up being pretty predictive of the overall survival hazard ratio.And what we are saying is that as the data is maturing now, we have the power if we have overall survival hazard ratios akin to those sorts of between 0.6 to 0.7 numbers that as the data matures we will have the power to see that.
Justin Holko: Great. Thanks for the question, Yaron. We have several callers still in the queue. I'm going to ask that each caller ask one question. We'll try to get to two or three more if we can.
Operator: Our following question comes from Mohit Bansal from Citigroup.
Mohit Bansal: Great. Thanks for taking my question. And it's pretty amazing that to see double-digit growth in EYLEA after so many years. Could you please help us characterize this growth a little bit further in terms of AMD versus non-AMD indications?I know you have been putting more effort in the diabetic IDCS. So as we go forward, how do you envision that segment growing over time actually? Thank you.
Leonard Schleifer: Marion?
Marion Mccourt: Sure. So I'm happy to comment. As I mentioned, the overall market is growing obviously driven by demographics and then also the diabetic population sadly is growing as well. I really don't have specificity to give you on market growth, particular by indication.But I can give you some of the trends that I think will be helpful. We are seeing greater growth in our EYLEA business coming from diabetic eye disease, while still growing and performing very competitively in wet AMD not only in the fourth quarter but through the entirety of last year.In terms of going forward though as I mentioned before the source of business is shifting somewhat. So as we looked at the fourth quarter performance I shared with you that our EYLEA business for wet AMD is just under 60% of the business. So that's a migration to a greater source of business coming from diabetic eye disease.And then if we looked at the overall business, I would also add in, probably if you do the math that leaves maybe about 30% of business coming from diabetic eye disease and approximately 10% of business coming from retinal vein inclusion.
Justin Holko: Great. Next question.
Operator: Our following question comes from Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan.
Cory Kasimov: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Another one for Marion. Can you just talk about how the commercial approach for Dupi for kids aged 6 to 11 with atopic derm might be different than the older populations you currently serve and what your market research suggests about the potential pent-up demand in the segment?
Marion Mccourt: Sure. So as I reflect on atopic dermatitis for adults adolescents first I shared with you that we're in the early days. For atopic dermatitis with adults, we've only really captured about 20% of the population of moderate to severe patients that are in need. Adolescents obviously has been a more recent launch. The adolescent population is approximately half or so of the adult population for atopic dermatitisAs we come into pediatrics, obviously we don't have an indication there. We're doing our final preparation work for the launch. We're very excited about this population because these - these very young patients are suffering tremendously as is their entire family.I think the experience that we've had with adults and adolescents bodes well for our ability to be very successful with the pediatric indication as soon as we have the approval. So we look forward in the future to giving more insight and more content on our strategy, size of population and our go-to-market profile.But we feel very, very positively about what's happened to date in atopic dermatitis and where we're going in the future. Frankly, we – FDA willing we cannot wait for this indication so we could help more patients.
Justin Holko: Thank you. We're bumping up at the top of the hour. We're going to go with one more question.
Operator: Our final question comes from Hartaj Singh from Oppenheimer & Company.
Hartaj Singh: Great. Thank you for the question. Just wanted to ask Bob one question. Bob I know you had indicated that for 2020 you would see increases in the non-GAAP, SG&A and R&D. And I think you've already given some sort of guidance thinking about consensus earnings.But could you sort of flesh that out a little bit as to whether you expect that to grow below I guess revenue and sort of differentiate between the two? Thank you very much.
Robert Landry: Yeah. Hartaj, thanks for the question. I'm going to wait until we iron that out with regards to -- at the end of Q1 where we give our guidance related to that. There's a lot of moving parts associated with exactly what the Kevzara and Praluent responsibilities are going to look the deal closing timing associated with that.And possibly the related modification of the agreement, which may allow us to change the financial presentation associated with that. So there's again a lot of moving parts. So if you can just kind of park that question until the end of into March. Thanks.
Justin Holko: Great. Thanks, Bob. Apologies to folks in the queue who we did not get to and for running late here on the call this morning. The IR team and Bob will be around after the call to take any of your questions. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-11-05 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Sheryl, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this conference call is being recorded.I will now turn the call over to Justin Holko. Sir, you may begin.
Justin Holko: Thank you, Sheryl. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening to everyone listening around the world. Thank you for your interest in Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2019 Conference Call. An archive of this webcast will be available on our website.Joining me today on the call are Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; Dr. George Yancopoulos, Founding Scientist, President and Chief Scientific Officer; Marion McCourt, Senior Vice President and Head of Commercial; and Bob Landry, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Len Schleifer: Thanks, Justin. Thanks to everyone who's joining the call today. We had another great quarter, marked by continued execution, to deliver double-digit top and bottom line growth while making progress with our innovative R&D engine. EYLEA global net sales grew 14% to $1.9 billion, including U.S. EYLEA net sales growth of 16% to $1.2 billion. We continued to build on our leadership position in retinal diseases with market share gains across wet age-related macular degeneration and diabetic eye diseases.DUPIXENT continued to deliver strong growth while transforming the lives of thousands of patients around the world suffering from a number of Type 2 inflammatory diseases. Global net sales of DUPIXENT are now annualizing at more than $2.5 billion. Launches in atopic dermatitis, asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps are generating broad-based growth for this important brand. We're still in the early days of DUPIXENT as approvals around the world continue and our enthusiasm continues to increase.Through the strength of the performance of DUPIXENT, we generated improved profitability for our own -- for our antibody collaboration with Sanofi. We expect profits to continue to increase, further diversifying our earnings base driven by growth in DUPIXENT as well as effective cost management across the collaboration.Importantly, our efforts in oncology are bearing fruit in the form of global launches of Libtayo, our anti-PD-1 therapy in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma; as well as new data from Libtayo in lung cancer; and our portfolio of innovative bispecific antibodies, including our BCMA antibody in multiple myeloma. We aim to be a leader in immuno-oncology by bringing important new treatments to patients with both blood and solid tumor cancers.Beyond oncology, we have novel programs that have generated significant late-stage results that we intend to file with regulators, such as evinacumab in homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Similarly, results from the PALM study in the Democratic Republic of Congo demonstrated that our antibody combination was superior to the standard of care in preventing death from Ebola in the recent outbreak. We expect further pipeline readouts by the end of the year as George will speak to in a few moments.Taken together, we continue to demonstrate that Regeneron has the talent and track record to tackle some of the world's most scientifically challenging health issues while creating long-term value for shareholders. We continue to execute on our strategy, and a result -- and as a result, are in a strong financial position. We think carefully about how -- about our capital and how to deploy it strategically.As such, we will continue to invest in R&D, as we have shown that those investments have generated significant value for shareholders and for patients. Business development efforts will continue as we seek the best science and capabilities to pair with our own innovations. Beyond R&D, and based upon our confidence in the business to deliver value both in the short and longer term, we are initiating a $1 billion stock buyback program.These are exciting times for Regeneron. We have strong momentum as we head into the end of the year and into 2020.Now I'll turn the call over to George.
George Yancopoulos: Thanks, Len. I will begin with DUPIXENT. There is nothing more gratifying than hearing directly from so many individuals about how DUPIXENT changed their lives after years of suffering from diseases such as asthma, atopic dermatitis and nasal polyposis. Just last week, a co-worker shared her story, how she was dreading her fourth surgery for nasal polyposis and instead convinced her doctor to try DUPIXENT. Not only did her nasal polyposis vanish without surgery, but her co-morbid asthma also dramatically improved.Such stories reflect the science behind DUPIXENT. Many patients suffer from a body-wide hyperactivation of the Type 2 immune pathway, which manifests in disease at many different sites, including the lungs, skin, upper respiratory system and even GI tract. DUPIXENT can be life-changing as it can reverse the systemic Type 2 hyperactivity, thus simultaneously treating multiply apparent, distinct disease entities.The other remarkable aspect of DUPIXENT is its safety profile. Since Type 2 hyperactivity is often counterproductive, DUPIXENT is not immunosuppressive. Across all of our studies, we have not seen increases in serious infections. In fact, in our AD studies, where people are prone to skin infections, we actually have seen a numeric decrease in infections.The DUPIXENT opportunity is growing in several ways by expanding to new territories to younger age groups into new Type 2 diseases. For example, the nasal polyposis indication was recently approved by the European Commission. We are submitting for atopic dermatitis in the pediatric population later this year and we are enrolling Phase III studies in eosinophilic esophagitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In addition, there are numerous ongoing or soon to be initiated trials in additional Type 2 diseases, including bullous pemphigoid, prurigo nodularis, chronic spontaneous urticaria, hand and foot atopic dermatitis, alopecia areata and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.We're also very excited about the potential of DUPIXENT to accelerate and enhance allergen desensitization. Our combination trial with the immunotherapy for grass allergy will be presented at a future medical conference. And data in combination with Aimmune's AR101 for peanut allergy are planned for late next year. Related to our DUPIXENT efforts, we are expecting a readout of our interleukin-33 antibody, Regeneron 3500, in atopic dermatitis and COPD over the coming year.As you know, DUPIXENT is currently approved for uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma and atopic dermatitis and is approved in earlier stages of these diseases. However, because of its efficacy and safety profile, including the lack of immunosuppression, we believe DUPIXENT can have an important benefit earlier in these diseases, where biologics have thus not -- thus far not been utilized. And we are considering studying DUPIXENT in patients with these earlier stages of disease.Now we'll turn to our immuno-oncology efforts. First, I want to remind you how challenging it is to create best-in-class biologicals and how often failure is still the rule. The foundation for Regeneron's success over the years has been our technology platforms that we have repeatedly used to produce first-in-class or best-in-class biologics, whether EYLEA for eye diseases, PRALUENT for heart disease, DUPIXENT for allergic Type 2 diseases or the recent stunning success with our Ebola antibody cocktail. I need not remind you that in all of these settings, there were very few, if any, successful competitors. Instead, numerous competitors, including some of the biggest biopharma companies in the world, failed. And now we feel that we can create similar advantage by bringing our next-generation technologies to immuno-oncology.Arguably the biggest advance in this field has been PD-1 blockade. But even here, most efforts to develop PD-1 or PD-L1 blockers have not produced best-in-class results, with Merck's pembrolizumab being a clear outlier. Moreover, even with this best-in-class PD-1 blocker, most cancers do not respond. And for those that do, only a fraction of the patients have satisfactory response. We are very far from curing cancer in general. This is why we feel that with our technological advantages, we can make a major contribution.First of all, we believe we can use our VelocImmune human/mouse, the widely acknowledged gold standard for making fully human antibodies, to make best-in-class checkpoint blockers such as for PD-1. Moreover, we have developed a next-generation VelocImmune mouse that, when combined with our recently described Veloci-Bi platform can produce the most natural antibody-like bispecifics more rapidly and routinely than other approaches. Our bispecifics naturally have long half lives without complex engineering, without mutations and can be delivered like normal antibodies without requiring constant infusion. This has allowed us to emerge as a leader in the so-called CD3 bispecific space, in which a bispecific can be used to link a killer T cell to a tumor target.Moreover, we have invented what we believe is the next important class of bispecifics, which we call co-stimulatory, or co-stim, bispecifics that can synergize with both our PD-1 antibody and with our CD3 bispecifics. We believe that progress in cancer will require amplifying and deepening the responses and settings where PD-1 antibody is already active as well as activating responses where PD-1 has little or no activity, such as in prostate, pancreatic, colorectal and other settings. We hope that our bispecifics will demonstrate such synergies together as well as with our PD-1 antibody.We have already begun establishing the individual efficacy profiles of our 3 classes of immuno-oncology agents. In terms of our PD-1 antibody, Libtayo, we defied expectations by identifying important new cancer setting where PD-1 therapy had not previously been characterized despite the broad efforts in the field. We obtained rapid approval in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or CSCC, based on some of the best response rates yet described for a PD-1 block into a solid tumor setting, approaching 50% in late-stage metastatic and locally advanced CSCC. While others have subsequently explored their PD-1 therapies in this setting, Libtayo remains the first and only approved therapeutic in advanced CSCC, and based on cross-study comparisons, has an outstanding efficacy profile.We believe non-melanoma skin cancers represent an important previously untapped opportunity, and we are working to expand our leading position in this space. A registrational study in adjuvant CSCC is already ongoing. In addition, Dr. Neil Gross of MD Anderson recently presented exciting early results with Libtayo in neoadjuvant CSCC with 70% response rates and 55% complete pathological responses. And we are now planning a larger new adjuvant study.We're also looking forward to a potentially pivotal data in the first half of 2020 for another -- from another important common skin cancer where PD-1 therapies have not been extensively characterized. That is basal cell carcinoma. Finally for skin cancers, we're also exploring Libtayo in melanoma in various combination studies intended to show increased benefit over PD-1 therapy alone.Beyond skin cancers, we are working to establish Libtayo as a therapeutic in non-small cell lung cancer, the largest current PD-1 opportunity. Along these lines, earlier today, we provided an update on our lung study with Libtayo monotherapy in high PD-L1 expressers. This 700-patient study is now over 90% enrolled. Based on an early interim analysis of overall survival in about 1/3 of anticipated events, the IDMC recommended continuing the trial as planned.We also announced that in the first 361 randomized patients, the confirmed objective response rate as determined by the investigators is currently 42% Libtayo versus 22% for chemotherapy. These objective response findings, while not sufficient for regulatory approval in this setting, support our hope that Libtayo may prove an important therapeutic and non-small cell lung cancer. The next event-driven interim analysis for overall survival is anticipated in 2020.In terms of other important phase -- in terms of our other important Phase III study in lung cancer, which is comparing Libtayo with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone. We expect full enrollment in the second half of next year.As with our PD-1 antibody, we are also establishing the efficacy and safety profile of bispecifics first as single agents. Starting with our CD3-class of bispecifics, we have already reported that Regeneron 1979, our CD20xCD3 bispecific, demonstrated impressive single-agent response rates in late-stage lymphoma patients, including in those that have failed CAR-T therapy.At the European Hematology Association meeting, based on a small number of patients, we reported 93% objective response rates with 71% complete responses in late-stage follicular lymphoma and reported 57% response rates in late-stage diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients, including 2 responses in 4 patients that had failed CAR-T therapy.While the ASH abstracts that we'll be posting tomorrow will only include older data, our presentation at ASH will include additional patients in longer duration of follow-up with about 20 patients at effective dose levels for each of follicular lymphoma and DLBCL. We have already initiated a potentially pivotal Phase II study which intends to enroll independent arms with different subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.In terms of our BCMAxCD3 bispecific, based on early single-agent proof of concept data that we will present at ASH, we are encouraged about the potential of this treatment for multiple myeloma. Remind you that the abstracts -- the ASH abstract posting tomorrow will also reflect all the data, including only our first dosing level with the BCMA bispecific. We look forward to updating these results with promising new data from our second dosing cohort at ASH.Finally, our third CD3 bispecific, MUC16xCD3, continues in a trial as a single agent and will shortly start a combination phase with Libtayo. In terms of the first example of our entirely novel class of so-called co-stim bispecifics, our PCMAxCD28 bispecific, we have begun dosing patients in recently initiated combinations with Libtayo. In this prostate cancer setting, which is normally not responsive to PD-1, we hope that our PCMAxCD28 bispecific can trigger responses as it has in preclinical studies.In summary, we are very excited that the initial entries for our three different classes of immuno-oncology therapeutics are establishing their individual potentials, and we are entering into the next stage, exploring combinations. In terms of combinations, we're not limiting ourselves to our internal portfolio. Our external immuno-oncology collaborations fall into 2 broad categories: Cell therapy, including CAR-Ts and other approaches; and vaccine-like approaches. Once again, these all have the potential of being explored individually but also in combination with our PD-1 and other checkpoint inhibitors as well as with our 2 classes of bispecifics. Altogether, we believe we are making significant progress on our strategy to become a leader in the immuno-oncology space.I would like to finish with brief discussions updating our ophthalmology efforts and also briefly touch on our rare disease portfolio. For EYLEA, we are planning registrational clinical programs in wet AMD and DME, evaluating a novel and higher-dose formulation of 8 milligrams in 8-week -- sorry, in 12-week and 16-week regimens. The Phase II trial in wet AMD is underway. Beyond EYLEA, we are continuing preclinical development of a new VEGF blocker, gene therapy and other novel approaches, including with our Alnylam collaborators.We have also made substantial progress in our rare disease portfolio. In mid-2020, we are planning a regulatory submission for evinacumab in homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia based on Phase III data showing nearly 50% LDL reduction in patients already treated with statins and PCSK9s. By the end of 2019, we're also expecting a readout of garetosmab for fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva. And we are becoming increasingly excited about our C5 program.Let remind you, we set a very high bar for entry into existing markets with novel agents. In the case of C5, our goal was to achieve convenient self-administration with a subcutaneous dosage form as well as more complete blockade of inappropriate complement activation. We are encouraged by our progress towards these goals and plan to present our first data for our C5 antibody, pozelimab, in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria patients at a future medical conference. We're also exploring options for combination with cemdisiran, a novel SRNA developed by our Alnylam collaborators.In closing, this is a very interesting time to be at Regeneron. Now we'll turn the call over to Marion.
Marion McCourt: Thank you, George. We continued to execute well in the third quarter led by our core EYLEA and DUPIXENT businesses as well as promising Libtayo market introduction. Starting with EYLEA. Global net product sales grew 14% year-over-year to $1.9 billion. In the U.S., net product sales grew to $1.2 billion. This represents 16% year-over-year growth. A combination of overall market growth and share gains drove strong third quarter performance of EYLEA. Growth in the overall market continues at a mid- to high single-digit range, underpinned by the aging population and increase in diabetes prevalence. EYLEA's share of the branded market also increased to 73% of net product sales for the quarter driven by physician preference for EYLEA. We continue to invest in EYLEA to advance our market-leading position across all indications.Let me take a moment to remind you of select strategic commercial initiatives to enhance our market-leading position in wet AMD and further penetrate diabetic eye disease, where there is significant growth opportunity. In wet AMD, we are growing our position by focusing on EYLEA's rapid and sustained outcomes to improve and protect vision. Wet AMD currently represents just under 60% of EYLEA business and EYLEA continues to grow in this patient group. In diabetic eye disease, our expanded field team is making tremendous strides. Our strategy is to increase diagnosis and treatment rates by educating health care professionals, consumer awareness and applying technologies to support diagnosis. With approximately 15% of the market receiving an anti-VEGF treatment, there's an important opportunity to help patients preserve and improve their vision. Our growth in DME indicates our strategy is delivering results.Our diabetic retinopathy launch is off to an encouraging start, with EYLEA use increasing in both proliferative disease and severe non-proliferative disease. We anticipate EYLEA use to increase as retina specialists see the benefits of actively treating these patients. Finally, we plan to launch the EYLEA prefilled syringe before the end of this year. Taken together, EYLEA has compelling efficacy and safety, breadth of indications, dosing flexibility and clinical and real-world experience.Turning to oncology. We're commercializing Libtayo with Sanofi. Global net sales of Libtayo were $52 million, including $4 million from our recent ex U.S. market launches that began this quarter. In the U.S., we continue to establish Libtayo as a standard of care across all lines of therapy for advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or CSCC. Libtayo is now the #1 systemic CSCC treatment in terms of total patients. It is outperforming chemotherapy and has made rapid share gains within the anti-PD-1 class, where Libtayo has 80% share in new patients. We expect growth to continue based on demographics, enhancements in patient identification and referrals. In addition, recent updates to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, or NCCN guidelines, list Libtayo as the preferred single-agent systemic option. Libtayo is the only CSCC, anti-PD-1 treatment with a 2A recommendation. Ex U.S. launches in CSCC are currently underway in multiple markets, including Germany, the U.K. and Brazil. While early, we are seeing encouraging progress on access and reimbursement as well as prescribing trends and physician interest.Moving to PRALUENT. In the second quarter, global net sales were $70 million. We are working diligently with our collaborator Sanofi to address brand profitability.Turning to KEVZARA. In the third quarter, global net sales were $55 million. In the U.S., we see steady growth as KEVZARA continues to make headway in the IL-6 subcutaneous class, with 48% share of new-to-brand prescriptions and 30% share of total prescriptions. Now for DUPIXENT, which is transforming the lives of patients suffering from many Type 2 inflammatory diseases. Global net product sales in the third quarter were $633 million. In the U.S., net product sales reached $508 million, representing 131% year-over-year growth. Total prescriptions in the U.S. grew approximately 21% compared to the second quarter. We continue to see strong prescribing trends across all approved indications. Weekly new-to-brand prescriptions for the third quarter averaged approximately 1,350 patients per week, up from 1,200 in the prior quarter.In atopic dermatitis, DUPIXENT continues to outpace other biologic launches in dermatology. For adults, we are pleased to see an increased number of patients with moderate disease being prescribed DUPIXENT earlier in the treatment paradigm and ahead of immunosuppressant therapy. We see ample opportunity in atopic dermatitis as approximately 20% of adult patients with the greatest need have used DUPIXENT. Additionally, our ongoing launch in adolescents continues to contribute meaningfully to the brand.As a reminder, DUPIXENT is the first biologic approved for atopic dermatitis in adolescents, many of whom remained uncontrolled using topical therapies. This launch has been aided by physician experience with the efficacy and safety and adults.In asthma, DUPIXENT in positioned to capitalize on this significant market opportunity. Approximately 75% of DUPIXENT asthma patients are new to biologics, demonstrating our ability to grow this market. Prescribing trends are accelerating among both allergists and pulmonologists. With only 15% of eligible patients being treated with a biologic, there's significant opportunity to educate patients about DUPIXENT. As a result, last month, we initiated our asthma direct-to-consumer TV campaign.Finally, our launch in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps is going extremely well. Encouragingly, patients are being initiated on DUPIXENT regardless of prior surgery. As a reminder, in the U.S., up to 90,000 adults with this disease are considered uncontrolled despite prior surgery or systemic corticosteroid use. About 55,000 patients have had prior surgery. While early in the launch, we believe this will be a meaningful growth opportunity for DUPIXENT.We have an unprecedented opportunity with DUPIXENT in Type 2 inflammatory diseases. The number of physicians prescribing is growing. And with more than 100,000 patients globally treated with DUPIXENT, the outlook remains exceedingly positive.In closing, the commercial organization delivered a solid performance in the third quarter. We have the right strategy and we are executing to deliver short- and long-term growth.Now I'll turn the call over to Bob.
Robert Landry: Thanks, Marion. For the third quarter 2019, Regeneron delivered double-digit growth on the top and bottom lines driven by strong performance from both EYLEA and DUPIXENT and increased profitability within the Sanofi Alliance. Total revenues for Regeneron grew 23% year-over-year to $2.05 billion driven by continued growth of our core brands, EYLEA and DUPIXENT. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share grew 14% year-over-year to $6.67 on non-GAAP net income of $762 million.Since Marion discussed our EYLEA results in the U.S., I will start with our Bayer and Sanofi collaborations. Starting with the Bayer collaboration. Ex U.S. EYLEA net product sales, which are reported to us by Bayer, were $730 million, representing a 12% reported and a 14% constant currency basis increase year-over-year. Total Bayer collaboration revenue for the third quarter of 2019 grew 15% year-over-year to $303 million, of which $275 million was derived from our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S.Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $404 million, up 58% year-over-year, as commercial profitability improved sharply. For the third quarter of 2019, Regeneron recognized a profit of $94 million in connection with the commercialization of non IO antibodies compared to a loss of $39 million in the prior year period and a profit of $39 million in the second quarter of this year. Both the year-over-year and sequential increase was driven by higher DUPIXENT profits. As we head into the end of the year and into 2020, we expect continued improved profitability driven by strong DUPIXENT net sales growth, continued cost containment on PRALUENT and KEVZARA and improvements in our operating leverage.Turning now to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $603 million for the third quarter of 2019 compared to $497 million for the third quarter of 2018, an increase of 22%. We are continuing to invest in our pipeline and research capabilities which is critical to the long-term success of the business.Our oncology pipeline continues to forge ahead, and we are advancing several wholly owned molecules into clinical development with more to come. In addition, we are funding external partnership obligations as jointly developed molecules are rapidly advancing. While we are not yet giving guidance for 2020, we anticipate non-GAAP R&D expenses to increase.Our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as the total non-GAAP R&D expense less R&D reimbursements from our collaborators, was $441 million for third quarter 2019 compared to $311 million for the third quarter of 2018. Based on the current forecast for the remainder of the year, we are tightening our previous full year 2019 guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to $1.68 billion to $1.71 billion.Next, non-GAAP SG&A expense was $379 million for the third quarter of 2019, a 16% year-over increase driven by higher headcount and related costs and launch-related expenses for U.S. Libtayo and for new indications for EYLEA and DUPIXENT. We are tightening our previous full year 2019 guidance for non-GAAP SG&A to $1.55 billion to $1.58 billion.Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses, line items found within Sanofi collaboration revenue, was $115 million for the third quarter of 2019. Based on spending trends and cost containment efforts related to PRALUENT and KEVZARA, we are lowering and tightening our previous full year 2019 guidance for Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses to $490 million to $510 million.In the third quarter of 2019, combined non-GAAP cost of goods sold and cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing were $210 million compared to $102 million in the third quarter of 2018. The year-over-year increase in cost of goods sold was primarily due to the company's obligation to pay Sanofi its share of Libtayo U.S. gross profits, lower fixed cost absorption and higher inventory reserves and write-offs. The year-over-year increase in cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing was primarily due to recognition of manufacturing costs associated with higher sales of DUPIXENT.Turning now to taxes. For the third quarter of 2019, our GAAP effective tax rate was 12.9% compared to 6.5% for the third quarter of 2018. Based on our actual results to date and forecast for the remainder of the year, we are raising our full year 2019 GAAP effective tax rate guidance to 12% to 14%. We continue to expect our full year 2019 non-GAAP tax rate to be higher than our full year 2019 GAAP effective tax rate.Turning next to our cash flow and balance sheet. Year-to-date, we've generated $1.35 billion in free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We ended the third quarter of 2019 with cash and marketable securities of nearly $6 billion.Earlier today, we announced a $1 billion share repurchase program. With that announcement, let me take a moment to discuss our capital allocation priorities. In terms of capital deployment, investing in our internal research capabilities and advancing our pipeline remains our top priority. As evident by our productivity and the high returns we've generated historically on our R&D, these investments are critical for our business and shareholders.Second, we seek to complement our internal efforts with external strategic partnerships and collaborations. Over the last 18 months, we've funded in excess of $900 million in equity and upfront payments, comprising more than 5 new strategic opportunities in the areas of RNAi therapeutics, oncolytic viruses and CAR-T therapies. Following these R&D investments, we assess additional strategic uses of our cash.Our overall business is growing with increasingly diversified revenue and cash flow streams. Coupled with the strength of our balance sheet and our confidence in the long-term outlook for the business, we view share buybacks at current trading levels as an efficient use of capital.In conclusion, we are very pleased with our financial results and performance this quarter. With continued execution on our R&D and commercial strategies, we are positioned for long-term growth.With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Justin.
Justin Holko: Thank you, Bob. Sheryl, that concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Chris Raymond from Piper Jaffray.
Christopher Raymond: So just maybe a question on the EYLEA franchise. And maybe just from a high-level perspective, you guys have been framing your next-generation efforts in a pretty similar way, I think, for a few quarters now. And so the high-dose formulations in the clinic now, which I think is new. But your discussion on the other mechanisms still seem to be framed in the same way that you had the last few quarters.And so I guess the question is I'm wondering if you can talk about where -- when we might see something from these novel mechanisms in the clinic. And maybe talk about these efforts in the context of the IP runway you have with EYLEA. And then maybe a second part of the question, can you describe more tactically any continued impact from the supply hiccups of compounded Avastin on the quarter?
Len Schleifer: So Marion will take any comments about the Avastin supply issues. Let me just say that -- I'm not going to comment on our patent situation here. I can say one thing for sure, is that our data exclusivity runs some ways into 2024, so we have a reasonable runway there. In terms of timing, obviously, we're working hard. We tend, Chris, not to predict when things will finally go into the clinic. But as soon as they do, we will let you know. We're hard at work at it. And the one that we mentioned, the high-dose, the new formulation, is now underway in our Phase II program. Marion, you want to comment on the Avastin situation?
Marion McCourt: Sure, Len. And just to comment, in the third quarter, there were some temporary spot shortages of Avastin in select geographies, so they may have given some modest benefit to EYLEA. We mentioned the same in the second quarter. And the one thing I can add is that we are hearing that patients that are started on Avast -- excuse me, started on EYLEA because of these shortages do continue on EYLEA therapy. So we'll continue to monitor the situation, which is episodic. And of course, in many instances, are related to ongoing issues with compounding and quality concerns.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ronny Gal from Bernstein.
Aaron Gal: A couple, if you don't mind. First, on the CD3xCD20. George, it looks like you might have actually got here with Roche. Can you comment a little bit about your -- the -- kind of how you differentiate your program from the Marcelin [ph] program, the developed program?And are you going straight into first line with this? Or are you still thinking it's going to be in a relapse setting for the next set of trial? And if you can remind us whether the partnership with Sanofi gives them the right to enter this program? Or is it still at your control. And given you're now in a kind of an excess cash situation, you have more choice about what you're going to do with this?
George Yancopoulos: Well, maybe I'll start at the back because it's the easiest. It's a wholly owned program that we control and nobody has an option on it. Number one. Number two, in terms of the comparisons with Roche, I mean, obviously, these are cross-trial comparisons. But we're very encouraged with how our data looks and how we both have a -- how we have a chance to have best-in-class potential. One of the most important things, we believe, about not only this program but our immuno-oncology franchise in general, is that we have, we believe, an unparalled opportunity to generate synergistic therapeutics that can work very powerfully together. So we are certainly going to be exploring our CD20xCD3 in combination with our PD-1 antibody, Libtayo, which we're very interested in. But also, we have an assortment of additional bispecifics in the settings where one might need additional efficacy. We believe that we can add to it, and we've certainly shown that and demonstrated that in preclinical models.So we think that, that's what really differentiates us, is that we really have a lot of tools in our tool kits a lot of possibilities for combining a lot of things with synergistic capabilities together. In addition to the fact that each one of our individual agents, we believe that based on the emerging data, has a chance to be best-in-class. And we're moving very aggressively into a near-term pivotal, approvable trials. And we'll be moving into earlier stages as well.
Len Schleifer: Certainly, it's Len, just to echo what George said. We feel good about our position, but we don't take Roche lightly. They're a formidable -- Roche/Genentech are a formidable competitor with lots of experience in the CD20 space. But they may have historical approaches that may be -- might be disruptible by new agents and combinations.
Operator: Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America.
Geoffrey Meacham: Just have a couple for Bob. I wanted to ask about the commercialization-related expenses. Was this just lower reimbursable expenses to Regeneron? Or is it related to, say, DUPI profitability? Or is this sort of -- should be looked at as the next phase of the JV expense base overall? And then for George. Obviously, you've got Libtayo-chemo combos going and CTLA-4 combos going, but how much of a priority is it to test more novel mechanisms with PD-1, just given recent data from AZ and Bristol?
Robert Landry: Geoff, I'll start. Well certainly, with the launch of DUPIXENT in the new indications, I mean we're moving full speed ahead with regards to that. And we've been talking about PRALUENT and KEVZARA cost containment for the last couple of quarters I would say in the third quarter, you're meaning -- we meaningfully saw what we were -- have been working on with our Sanofi counterparts in terms of trying to rein in a little bit with regards to the amount of OpEx associated with PRALUENT and KEVZARA.
George Yancopoulos: Okay. And so certainly, we're following closely the PD-1 field. As you said, it is evolving. Our goal, as it's been from the beginning, is to have a foundational PD-1 therapeutic that is at least competitive, if not best-in-class. And so we're very excited, for example, about some of the data that we reported on today in terms of the response rates in our first-line monotherapy lung cancer study. But once again, the story is as you said, that we think that we have an enormous opportunity of combining with our novel sets of reagents. Some of which are already in combinations in the clinic not only with the entire assortment of checkpoint inhibitors but also with our entire assortment of bispecifics.So as I already mentioned, we're exploring combinations with the bispecifics of the CD3 class that are in the clinic already, but we've already initiated our second class of bispecifics, these co-stimulatory bispecifics, which have the opportunity to activate PD-1 responsiveness in tumors that are not normally responsive to PD-1. So not only can they enhance responsiveness in tumors that are responding to some degree already, but they can actually endow responsiveness in those that don't in preclinical models. And we hope that, that pertains, obviously, in the clinic. This creates, we think, a great way of extending the benefit that immuno-oncology has already provided by taking it deeper in cancers that are already responsive, but also opening up cancers that haven't responded to date.So I do want to just emphasize again, why do we have this ability? Because we have a unique platform for making these bispecifics. As far as I'm aware, we're the only platform that couples essentially a naturally derived bispecific antibodies using a genetically humanized mouse, together with this Veloci-Bi platform that we recently announced, to rapidly and routinely make natural bispecifics that behave just like normal antibodies.You don't have to give them by constant infusion. You don't have to introduce linkers. You don't have to make mutations in there so that they have longer half-lives because they look, and they're manufactured in fact, just like regular antibodies. They behave like them. You can give them normally like you give biologics. You don't have to go to special -- extensive lengths to manufacture them. This allows us to rapidly and routinely make many of these and put them into the clinic very rapidly in these various combinations and target them in exactly the way we want to, in some cases, initiate; or in other cases, trigger or activate a co-response. And I think it's the collection of these put together that allow for very exciting combinations, as I said.
Len Schleifer: Yes, and let me just add something very quickly. Geoff, you also alluded to there were other combinations out there, whether it be CTLA-4, LAG-3 or what have you. We in this field recognize that not all antibodies are created equally. As George said, I mean, you've got some antibody like a KEYTRUDA that worked in first line; and others, let's say, in PD-L1; or others even in PD-1 that may not work as well, didn't work. And so we have to make sure we explore some of these other antibodies, LAG3 or what have you ourselves, to be satisfied that there's not opportunity for a combination therapy there as well.
Justin Holko: [Operator Instructions]. We still have several callers that we'd like to squeeze in.
Operator: Our next question comes from George -- I'm sorry, Geoff Porges from SVB Leerink.
Geoffrey Porges: A quick question. You have three products that are -- look like they're annualizing at about $200 million a year in revenue: KEVZARA, Libtayo and PRALUENT. And certainly, Libtayo is still growing strongly. First, Bob, can you give us a sense of whether they're actually contributing to cash flow at that revenue level? And secondly, do you envisage any further changes in the commercial support, the structure behind those products, such that they could enhance the profitability or at least not drag on the profitability of DUPIXENT in the future?
Robert Landry: Geoff, I'll start. And you can imagine for competitive reasons, we're not going to get into kind of specific products with regards to what they're generating from a cash flow perspective. We've given kind of high-level cover -- color with regards to what the drivers have been. Obviously, DUPIXENT on our current profitability for the quarter. Repeat the second question, the second part of it.
Geoffrey Porges: Yes. Are there any changes that you could envisage in terms of the structure or the spend that, let's say, allow you to capture more of the profitability of DUPIXENT?
Len Schleifer: You have sort of faded out at the end. This is Len. But I think what you're asking, can we change the structure or the profitability? I think Sanofi and Regeneron are constantly looking at this. We see the same data you do. It is very early for Libtayo. So that's one thing. It's getting a little bit late for PRALUENT and KEVZARA. And we are focused on making sure we do the right thing overall for the -- so that they're not a drain on the overall alliance. You can be assured of that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.
Terence Flynn: I was just wondering, for your BCMAxCD3 bispecific, are you encouraged because you're seeing activity in a second type of cancer here with the platform or encouraged because you have a competitive efficacy profile relative to the CAR-T and ADC data we've seen from the competitors? And then any commentary you can share at a high level regarding the safety/tolerability profile at this point?
George Yancopoulos: Yes. I think that it's fair to -- I think you made two great points. I mean, I think, one, it's very important to see that the platform is consistently producing what looked like very competitive, exciting data. And so it's encouraging for that reason. And secondly, if the platform is producing competitive data in a particular area, then it's exciting for that reason as well. So I guess the answer is yes and yes on both of those.
Len Schleifer: We shouldn't go any further. We'll show you the data at ASH.
Operator: The question comes from Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley.
Matthew Harrison: George, I just wanted to follow up on some comments you made around C5. I guess, two parts here. So first, you mentioned a couple products that you expected at ASH, but you just said a future medical meeting for C5. Should we expect this at ASH? Or is this -- are we not going to see this at ASH? And then you also said that you're encouraged. So should we think about this as something that it looks like you plan to move into pivotal studies at this point?
George Yancopoulos: Well as I said, we had a very high bar before we would get excited about it, which was we want to feel like we could change the field. As you know, the current approaches are limited to intravenous delivery. We were looking for a subcutaneous, self-administered approach and we were also looking for more complete suppression of hemolysis. And so we are excited because we feel like we satisfied our high bar.In terms of where we're actually going to present it, we're hoping to present it as soon as possible in a major medical conference. And so that we don't get prevented from presenting it at such conferences, we can't tell you where we're presenting. Sorry about that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Yaron Werber from Cowen.
Yaron Werber: Great. So George, maybe just one for you relating to -- give us a sense. In the Phase II high-dose EYLEA study, you're testing 8 milligrams. Can you advance that right away into the parallel Phase III pivotals? Or do you need to show sort of safety first before you can move to a pivotal and the pivotal would have a different dose?And maybe if I can just throw in, any initial feedback on the Beovu launch that you're seeing in the last literally three weeks or so?
George Yancopoulos: I'll leave the last for Marion to comment on. But in terms of the first, of course, there's always safety concerns. But depending on whether one sees something unexpected or not, we are planning to do it exactly as you said. The Phase II is intended to simultaneously be providing data while we're running the Phase III to give us confidence that the high-dose EYLEA is actually performing and doing the things that we're predicting that it would actually do. So we're not limiting the Phase III by the Phase II data. And Marion?
Marion McCourt: Sure. And just first, we're pleased with the EYLEA performance through this third quarter and certainly been in a competitive market for some years. But specifically to the most recent launch, Novartis' launch, when you take all the important competition seriously and certainly have been prepared for new market entrants. But it is really early, so we can't report on any impact. We're not seeing any impact at this time. And I think the market will be looking to product profile to determine issues of safety, efficacy and product use.
Operator: Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman from Crédit Suisse.
Evan Seigerman: Congrats on the progress. So one for Bob. I was wondering if you could provide us some more color on the rationale for the newly announced share repurchase program. On this, this seems to be kind of a deviation from your prior capital allocation strategy. So why now? Do you believe that your share price is undervalued and that this is the best way to invest capital? Or are there other factors impacting the decision?
Robert Landry: Thanks, Evan, for the question. And again, we wanted to be kind of pointed during our script with regards to calling out the framework that we have on this because we do get a lot of questions on it. I think exactly where you kind of ended off on the question with regards to -- we currently like the valuation. Obviously, all the work we do inside here and what we know is coming and...
Len Schleifer: Bob, I got to interrupt you. I kind of hate the valuation.
Robert Landry: The valuation from a purchasing point of view is what we certainly like. Thanks for that help, Len, on that. We like the levels. And as I tried to point out, I mean, we sufficiently invest in R&D in the right areas. Things continue to move through the clinic. We are also going into external transactions. We mentioned in May the Alnylam transaction, and I talked about a little bit that -- there on the script. So now is the right time with regards to being able to kind of put additional capital to work. And again, to reiterate what you said, we do like -- we think the valuations are attractive from our point of view at this level.
Operator: Our next question comes from Yatin Suneja from Guggenheim Partners.
Yatin Suneja: Congrats on the quarter. The question is on the lung cancer update that you provided today. I mean, if you end up with an identical result to KEYTRUDA in the front-line lung setting, do you compete on anything other than the price? Is that going to be the strategy? Could you maybe comment on the strategy there?
Len Schleifer: Yes, it's a little early to comment on a strategy till we see the data. I just remind you, this is going to be a very large space. KEYTRUDA is annualizing right now at about, I think, $12 billion. And the whole space is predicted to go much larger than that with most of the sales, at least initially, coming in lung cancer.We have two strategies I think that George has been articulating for years. One is we need a foundational strategy so that if it just turns out the only checkpoint inhibitor that continues to make a difference, as it has for the last 5 years in lung cancer, is a PD-1 inhibitor, we want to be there with ours and we want to compete. And we'll see how the data goes. But it could be one experiment away with either some combination, a co-stim, a bispecific or something else. And then everybody's back, loaded up in the starting gate. So this has been, I think, articulated innumerable times by George: PD-1 is a foundational technology for us in the immuno-oncology space, lung cancer is the biggest opportunity, we want to be there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan.
Matthew Holt: This is Matthew on for Cory. So my question is on your BCMA bispecific programs. Can you talk about the differences between REGN5459 and 5458? What informed your decision to advance the former into the clinic? And whether this was in any way dependent on the initial 5458 clinical data.
George Yancopoulos: Yes. I mean, these are all great questions. I think the important point to make is, and it was brought up by a previous caller, that we are really validating our platform and we're excited that it looks like the platform works. And what we're beginning to understand is that one way to control, not only efficacy but also safety, is by the components that are used, particularly the constant components in our platform. I'll remind you, they're all created from entirely natural sequences of antibodies and so forth, so there's no immunogenicity problems.And so what we're doing, we committed not based on any data that we saw, but to test a couple of variants of the constant aspects of the platform to try to optimize the efficacy and safety profile. Though obviously we're seeing what look like very competitive profiles right now, we're always aspiring to even do better. So it's just a matter of building and optimizing our platform to maximize the efficacy, the safety equation as best as we can and learn that -- how we can take the platform and generalize it and optimize it to the best. And that's why we're testing, in some cases, at least two versions of related bispecifics.
Len Schleifer: So let me just repeat what George said, maybe in my words, is that the platform is powerful, and therefore the activation energy to try more than one thing is low. And so we have that as a competitive advantage.
Justin Holko: Thank you. I think we have one more -- time for one more question, Sheryl.
Operator: Our final question comes from Josh Schimmer from Evercore.
Joshua Schimmer: It looks like the sequential quarter-over-quarter growth of DUPIXENT in the third quarter was much lower than it was in the second quarter despite very strong underlying prescription trends. Can you discuss some of the factors underlying that, including potential inventory or gross to net fluctuations or any other factors that might have contributed?
Len Schleifer: Josh, Marion will take that.
Marion McCourt: Sure, happy to. So Josh, we're very pleased with the quarter-on-quarter performance. And as I mentioned in my script, when we just look at, obviously the percentage growth of TRxs quarter-over-quarter, and I believe it was 21%, it was quite substantial. As it relates to gross to net and inventory, I know that inventory is within the normal range and therefore don't have more to report on that area.
Justin Holko: Great. Thank you, everybody, for joining the call. We'll be around to take questions.
Len Schleifer: Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our conference for this morning. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-08-06 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Q2 2019 Earnings Conference Call. My name is John and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Please note the conference is being recorded.And I will now turn the call over to Justin Holko.
Justin Holko: Thank you, John. Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening to everyone listening around the world.

Once our call concludes, Bob Landry and the IR team will be available to answer further questions.With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.
Leonard Schleifer: Thank you, Justin. Before we begin, I'd like to extend a warm welcome to Justin who joined us earlier this summer after completing a 19-year training program at Merck and has immediately hit the ground running here at Regeneron. We're thrilled to have him as part of the team and we worked hard to make his first quarter a straightforward one.Thanks to everyone for joining the call and turning to our business. We had a great quarter actually marked by top and bottom-line growth as well as important advances across our innovative R&D engine. Sales at Regeneron products including those recorded by our partners grew 32% compared to the second quarter of 2018.EYLEA global net sales grew 13% to $1.9 billion including U.S. EYLEA net sales growth of 17% to $1.16 billion. The diabetic retinopathy approval in May continues to build upon EYLEA's leadership position in treating retinal diseases including Wet, age-related macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema, and retinal vein occlusion. We are also pleased to announce that our antibody collaboration with Sanofi achieved profitability this quarter. We expect profits to continue to increase driven by growth in Dupixent as well as discipline cost management across the collaboration to stem losses from Praluent by better aligning investments with revenues.Dupixent is fulfilling its potential to improve the lives of patients by transforming the treatment of a variety of Type 3 allergic diseases. Global net sales are now annualizing at more than $2 billion. Patient initiation in the U.S. are growing and many ex-U.S. launches are just beginning.Building on this commercial momentum in June, we received the FDA approval for Dupixent in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis. In the EU Dupixent was approved in May for severe asthma in adults and adolescents and as we announced this morning was just approved for atopic dermatitis in the adolescent patients.We also announced today the strong positive results of our Phase 3 study in children aged 6 to 11 with severe atopic dermatitis. We are enthusiastic about the current and future prospects of Dupixent as a treatment directed at the underlying cost of allergic diseases. Additionally, we are making significant progress towards our goal of building a leading presence in immuno-oncology.The U.S. and EU approvals for Libtayo in advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma are just the beginning. Our clinical efforts, which now includes multiple different immuno-oncology programs are studying a wide variety of potential drug candidates in several difficult-to-treat cancers including non-small cell lung, cancer basal cell carcinoma, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma and prostate cancer.Beyond Oncology, we continue to novel programs forward throughout early and late-stage development. George will speak to a few of these programs and additional data readouts are expected later this year. We have made critical advances that have led both to top line and bottom line growth, but we recognize that these advances maybe overshadowed by the current policy debates on the affordability and accessibility of innovative medicines. We continue to work with policymakers to develop responsible solutions that address affordability and accessibility, while preserving incentives to develop transformative treatments of the future.Now, I'll turn the call over to George.
George Yancopoulos: Thanks, Len. Let me begin with EYLEA, the market leader based on its ability to improve vision across multiple retinal diseases along with its safety profile established by over 25 million injections. In addition to EYLEA's indication for the treatment of wet AMD or macular edema following retinal vein occlusion and for diabetic macular edema or DME, the FDA label for EYLEA was expanded in May to include diabetic retinopathy without centrally involved AME based on the panorama study.In this diabetic retinopathy setting our updated label shows that EYLEA demonstrated an 85% to 100% reduction in the incidence of vision-threatening complications. In addition, we are awaiting FDA action on our resubmitted filing for the EYLEA prefilled syringe.In terms of our future innovation in retinal disease, we are planning to initiate clinical programs with a higher dose formulation of aflibercept in wet AMD and in DME by the end of 2019. These studies will test higher doses of aflibercept in 12 and 16-week regimens compared to the recommended EYLEA regimen of two milligrams every eight weeks. Beyond aflibercept, we are continuing preclinical development of a new VEGF blocker, gene therapy, and other novel approaches including with our new collaborators at Alnylam.I'd like to now turn to DUPIXENT, our Breakthrough Therapy that has already benefitting many patients in a wide variety of atopic and/or allergic diseases. As Len mentioned, we achieved several important regulatory milestones. Beyond the highlighted approvals, an opinion by the European Committee from Medicinal Products for Human Use or CHMP for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis is anticipated by the end of 2019.And just this morning we announced positive results of the Phase III trial in severe pediatric atopic dermatitis patients aged six to 11 years which we intend to submit to regulators in the coming months. I would like to remind you of the tremendous unmet need in this population.On average, the children on our study had nearly 60% of their body covered with lesions and had suffered from this disease for most of their lives leaving the children and their families devastated and without much hope.Not only did DUPIXENT dramatically reduce skin involvement as measured by EASI score by an average of about 80%, it also improved measures of anxiety, depression, and health-related quality of life for both the children and their families.The study also confirmed DUPIXENT's established safety profile and once again, numerically reduced skin infections. We are deeply committed to bringing DUPIXENT to patients suffering from a range of Type 2 inflammatory diseases driven by the interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 team pathways.With that goal in mind, we are actively enrolling patients in Phase III studies in the eosinophilic esophagitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD. As a reminder, we are also exploring the effectiveness of DUPIXENT in allergy desensitization settings such as for grass and peanut allergy.While allergy immunotherapy can be effective in the long-term, many patients can't complete the prolonged time course required for success because of allergic reactions which can be severe. We recently completed a small Phase IIa trial with about 25 patients per treatment arm, testing whether DUPIXENT could improve the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of subcutaneous immunotherapy or SCIT therapy for grass allergy. The preliminary results of this study showed that about 30 patients discontinued therapy in the SCIT group, mostly due to clinically meaningful allergic reactions compared to only a single patient who discontinued SCIT when combined with DUPIXENT and not due to an allergic reaction.And in the primary efficacy analysis, there was no difference in terms of reduction of the allergic symptoms with SCIT or in the combination. Thus we are encouraged by the potential of DUPIXENT to increase the tolerability of SCIT therapy and we're looking forward to presenting the results at a future medical meeting.Earlier this quarter, we reported that Regeneron 3500, our interleukin-33 antibody made primary and secondary endpoints in a proof-of-concept study in moderate-to-severe asthma patients, showing that Regeneron 3500 may provide an alternative therapeutic option for asthma. Although the Regeneron 3500 results were numerically lower than those for the DUPIXENT calibrator arm.In addition, the combination of Regeneron 3500 and DUPIXENT did not demonstrate increased benefit compared to DUPIXENT monotherapy in this trial, although the study was not power to this comparison. In addition, the next 12 months, we're expecting interim results from the Phase 2 Regeneron 3,500 studies in COPD and in atopic dermatitis.I will now shift gears to our immunotherapy efforts to treat cancer. Starting with Libtayo. Last month, our PD-1 antibody was approved in the EU for adults with metastatic or locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, who were not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation making Libtayo the first and only approved medicine of any kind for patients with advanced CSCC in the U.S. and Europe.With the goal of making Libtayo available from a broader population of CSCC patients, we started Phase 3 study in adjuvant CSCC. In addition to an ongoing investigator-initiated study, our study in the neurological setting is scheduled to start in the fourth quarter. Additionally, our pivotal study of Libtayo in basal cell carcinoma, the most common skin cancer is expected to read out in the first half of next year.Moving on to non-small cell lung cancer, we are pleased by the enrollment for our Libtayo monotherapy Phase 3 trial in high PD-L1 expressors. We have commenced enrollment in part two of our other Phase 3 lung cancer study, which will compare Libtayo plus chemotherapy to chemotherapy alone regardless of PD-L1 status or histology.Beyond checkpoint inhibition, our investigational bispecific antibody franchise consists of two broad categories based on the T-cell receptor to which the bispecific bind. The CD3 molecule or the CD28 customers are bispecifics. In total, we now have four bispecifics under clinical investigation. Our CD20xCD3, BCMAxCD3, MUC16xCD3 and notably the newest was addition of our first co-stimulatory bispecific PSMAxCD28. Additional candidates are expected to enter to clinic in the upcoming months and years.In June, we presented updated efficacy and safety data for Regeneron 1979, our CD20xCD3 bispecific. Regeneron 1979 continues to show high response rate in heavily pretreated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients. In particular, we observed complete responses in four out of seven diffused large B-cell lymphoma or DLBCL patients treated with Regeneron 1979 doses 80 milligrams or higher.Notably, four of these had failed prior CAR-T therapy, and two of which achieved complete responses. Regeneron 1979 has demonstrated manageable tolerability with no discontinuations to the syndrome or neurotoxicity to date. Recruitment for a potentially pivotal Phase 2 trial for Regeneron 1979 is now ongoing. The multi-arm study will enroll several disease-specific cohorts of relapsed refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients including follicular lymphoma, DLBCL, and other non-Hodgkin's lymphoma subtypes.Our two other CD3 bispecific antibodies MUC16xCD3 for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and BCMAxCD3 for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma are in clinical studies that are actively enrolling patients. We plan to present preliminary BCMAxCD3 data by the end of 2019.Finally, recruitment is ongoing for the first co-stimulatory candidate Regeneron 5678, which binds prostate-specific membrane antigen or PSMA on tumor cells, as well as the CD28 co-stimulatory molecule on T cells.Based on preclinical evidence, we are hoping to see synergy of our co-stims with Libtayo in disease settings, such as prostate cancer, that have proven resistant to immunotherapy alone. If successful, this innovative approach could open up the possibility of immunotherapy to a large number of patients who do not currently have this option.In addition, we expect a number of updates related to other programs emerging for our pipeline. By the end of 2019, we are planning to present our C5 antibody data in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, or PNH. By the end of this year, we also expect readout of our ANGPTL-3 antibody Phase 3 study in homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, as well as a readout of our Activin-A antibody pivotal study in the rare disease Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva, or FLP. Phase 3 studies of fasinumab, our advanced candidate for osteoarthritis pain are now fully enrolled and data are expected during 2020.Finally, we just celebrated the fifth anniversary of The Regeneron Genetics Center. To date, we have sequenced 700,000 individuals linking their exome data with detailed medical records. We continue to be excited about our ongoing effort here, including our work to sequence the U.K. Biobank database in collaboration with a consortium of leading biopharma progress.Mining of The Regeneron Genetics Center database had already discovered and/or validated a number of genetic drug targets across several human diseases, which are positively impacting our clinical development efforts.With that, I'll now turn the call over to Marion.
Marion McCourt: Thank you, George. In the second quarter, we executed well across our portfolio of existing lines of business and recent launches. Starting with EYLEA. Global net product sales grew 13% year-over-year to $1.9 billion. In the U.S. net product sales grew 17% year-over-year and 8% quarter-over-quarter to $1.16 billion.EYLEA growth is driven by share gain and market expansion, underpinned by the aging population and increase in diabetes prevalence. In the branded U.S. anti-VEGF market, our share increased to 71% of net product sales. In the quarter, a temporary shortage of Avastin in select geographies modestly impacted EYLEA net sales.EYLEA continues to help patients with a diabetic eye disease and this represents an important growth opportunity for the brand. In mid-May, the FDA approved EYLEA to treat all stages of diabetic retinopathy and our launched commence immediately. For this indication, EYLEA is the only anti-VEGF for approved with two dosing options, allowing doctors to customize treatment to their patients' needs.Our comprehensive plans to develop EYLEA's position in the diabetic retinopathy market are underway. We begin educating both physicians and patients upon approval encouraging early intervention for appropriate patients and ensuring EYLEA is the first-line anti-VEGF treatment. It's early days in the launch, but we're pleased with feedback from retina specialists and we're seeing positive early interest and uptake among major practices.We are investing in EYLEA's commercial platforms to advance our market-leading position across all indications, including wet AMD, DME and in diabetic retinopathy. Our expanded and realign sales force has a dual focus of growing both the diabetic eye disease market and our core wet AMD business.Robust engagement efforts with the retinal community, messaging both EYLEA's clinical and real world experience are well under way. Additional outcomes in safety remain the standards by which therapies are compared and EYLEA's rapid and sustained outcomes in improving and protecting vision are unsurpassed.We're committed to further strengthening our leadership position for EYLEA through continued innovation including in dose and delivery. Pending FDA approval the EYLEA prefilled syringe will be launched in 2019.I'd now like to turn to Libtayo. The launch in continuous squamous cell carcinoma or CSCC continues to gain momentum. And in the U.S. net product sales were $41 million for the quarter. Brand awareness within the medical community is growing demonstrated by the breadth of prescribers at major cancer centers and community practices around the country. Since launch, we made further progress in establishing Libtayo as the standard-of-care in advanced CSCC across all lines of therapy.Market research indicates more than three times as many CSCC patients are now receiving an anti-PD1 or PD-L1 treatment compared to before Libtayo's approval. We believe Libtayo is poised for continued growth. We have broad payer access and a QA recommendation from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. Libtayo is the only checkpoint inhibitor to have this designation in CSCC.Additionally, ex-U.S. launches in CSCC are underway and we look forward to data that could expand the potential of our dermatologic oncology portfolio into earlier stages of CSCC and beyond.Moving to Praluent, in the second quarter, global net sales were $74 million. In the highly competitive U.S. market, we remain focused on patient affordability and physician ease of prescribing. We are working closely with our collaborator Sanofi to greatly improve brand profitability.Turning to KEVZARA, in the second quarter, global net sales were $59 million. In the U. S. KEVZARA continues to make headway in the IL-6 subcutaneous class with an estimated 47% share of new patients-dispensed KEVZARA or NBRx and 29% share of total scripts or TRx.Now for DUPIXENT, which is transforming the lives of patients suffering from Type 2 inflammatory diseases, atopic dermatitis, asthma, and now chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis. Global net product sales in the second quarter were $557 million. In the U.S., net product sales reached $455 million, representing 151% year-over-year growth.Total prescriptions or TRx in the U.S. grew approximately 30% compared to the first quarter. This was driven by continued growth in approved indication, adult atopic dermatitis and asthma, as well as the launch in atopic dermatitis for adolescents.Weekly new-to-brand prescriptions or NBRx for the second quarter averaged approximately 1,200 patients per week, up from 950 in the prior quarter. This momentum is further evidence of the positive impact of our commercialization strategy and execution across all approved indications.As we mentioned last quarter, prescribing continues to grow in adult atopic dermatitis as more moderate patients are just prescribed DUPIXENT and more healthcare professionals gain brand experience. Our recent launch in adolescence is going well. As a reminder, DUPIXENT is the first biologic approved for adolescents many of whom remain uncontrolled using topical therapies.Market reaction has been extremely positive. Target physicians are prescribing and excited about the results they're seeing. There's significant uptake of both dermatologists and allergists and we're making meaningful inroads in reaching target pediatric dermatologists and pediatric allergists. In addition, market access coverage is already at or near levels of the adult population.Asthma is a significant opportunity and DUPIXENT is well-positioned for continued growth. DUPIXENT's differentiated clinical and safety profile continues to support uptake. The asthma biologic market has expanded 13% since Dupixent's launch demonstrating our ability to compete and grow this market. Allergists, who have experienced using Dupixent in atopic dermatitis now also see its benefit for their asthma patients. Prescribing more – prescribing among pulmonologists is also increasing and they are highly receptive to Dupixent efficacy, use in steroid-dependent patients, and self administration.And finally, in late June Dupixent became the first biologic medicine approved as an add-on maintenance therapy treatment for adults with an adequately controlled chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps. This indication is yet another first-in-class opportunity for Dupixent given the high unmet need.In the U.S. up to 90,000 adults with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps are considered uncontrolled despite the prior surgery or systemic corticosteroid use and about 55,000 patients are those that had prior surgery.Importantly, many patients with this disease have other Type 2 inflammatory diseases like asthma. In our two Phase 3 clinical trials almost 60% of patients also had asthma, which was improved with the Dupixent treatment. Our commercial efforts are focused on EMTs, and allergists and we're having constructive payer discussions. While early in the launch, we believe this will be a meaningful growth opportunity for Dupixent and we look forward to providing future updates.In closing, we're excited about our near-term performance and confidence that our ongoing commercialization efforts will drive long-term growth across core brands and ongoing launches.Now, I'll turn the call over to Bob.
Bob Landry: Thanks Marion. For the second quarter 2019, Regeneron executed well and delivered solid financial results on both the top and bottom lines. And as Len stated, we are pleased that the Sanofi antibody collaboration has reached commercial profitability. Total revenues for Regeneron grew 20% year-over-year to $1.93 billion driven by continued growth of our core brands EYLEA and Dupixent.Non-GAAP diluted net income per share grew 10% year-over-year to $6.02 on non-GAAP net income of $690 million. Our second quarter GAAP results were impacted by both the Alnylam upfront payment and the equity investment.In addition to Marion's earlier comments about EYLEA, I want to highlight two additional items related to U.S. EYLEA net sales for the quarter. First, inventory movements were immaterial in the quarter. Second, U.S. EYLEA net sales were impacted by an increase in sales related deductions.Moving to our collaboration revenue line items. Starting with payer, ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales, which are reported to us by Bayer were $715 million representing a 7% reported and a 13% constant-currency basis increase year-over-year. Total Bayer collaboration revenue for the second quarter of 2019, grew 10% year-over-year to $289 million of which $269 million was derived from our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S.For the Sanofi collaboration, we generated significantly improved results. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $349 million, up 47% year-over-year. This increase was primarily driven by improved profitability in the Sanofi antibody collaboration. In the second quarter of 2019 Regeneron recognized a profit of $39 million in connection with the commercialization of non-I/O antibodies compared to a loss of $69 million in the second quarter of 2018.Profitability came from higher global net product sales of Dupixent, partly offset by an increase in commercialization-related expenses to support ongoing Dupixent launches. Based on our current projections, we anticipate increasing profitability from the commercialization of non-I/O antibodies going forward.Turning now to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $589 million for the second quarter of 2019, compared to $470 million for the second quarter 2018 and essentially flat compared to the $583 million recognized in the first quarter of 2019, driven by continued investment in our research platform and pipeline.Our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as the total non-GAAP R&D expense, less R&D reimbursements from our collaborators, was $423 million for second quarter 2019 compared to $286 million for the second quarter 2018 and $419 million for first quarter 2019.The year-over-year increase is primarily driven by higher spend associated with our earlier-stage pipeline, clinical trial and manufacturing costs to support ongoing development programs and lower Sanofi reimbursement as a result of the amended Immuno-oncology Discovery and Development Agreement. Based on the current progress in our R&D pipeline and outlook for the remainder of the year, we are tightening our previous full year 2019 guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to $1.625 billion to $1.71 billion.Next, non-GAAP SG&A expense was $375 million for the second quarter of 2019 a 16% year-over-year increase driven by commercialization-related expenses to support ongoing Dupixent launches and EYLEA's recent launch in diabetic retinopathy. We are tightening our previous full year 2019 guidance for non-GAAP SG&A to $1.53 billion to $1.58 billion.Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses, a line item found within Sanofi collaboration revenue was $123 million for the second quarter of 2019. We are lowering and tightening our previous full year 2019 guidance for Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses to $500 million to $530 million.Turning now to taxes. For the second quarter, our GAAP effective tax rate was 14.1%. We are reaffirming our full year 2019 GAAP effective tax rate guidance of 11% to 13%. To assist with modeling, principally, due to the Alnylam $400 million upfront exclusion from non-GAAP earnings, the full year 2019 non-GAAP tax rate will be higher than our full year 2019 GAAP effective tax rate.Turning next to our balance sheet and cash flow. Regeneron ended the second quarter with cash and marketable securities of $5.55 billion. Through the first six months of the year, we generated free cash flow of $916 million. We calculate free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.Capital expenditures were $95 million for the quarter and $169 million year-to-date. Based on our updated capital spend plan and year-to-date spending levels, we are lowering and tightening our full year 2019 capital expenditure guidance to $380 million to $420 million. In conclusion, we're very pleased with our operational and financial performance this quarter. These financial results, along with the execution on our R&D and commercial strategies position us for continued long-term growth.With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Justin.
Justin Holko: Thank you, Bob. That concludes our prepared remarks and we'd now like to open the call for Q& A. To ensure that we are able to address as many callers as possible, please limit your questions to one or two question. Please go ahead, John.
Operator: And thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Carter Gould from UBS.
Carter Gould: Good morning. Congrats on the Sanofi collaboration tipping over into profitability and thanks for taking the question. One for George. I want to ask around the CD20 antigen loss you observed at disease progression and some of the patients responding to 1979. I was just interested in your current understanding of the mechanism; earlier given I believe this was rare with RITUXAN and how you see this potentially influencing how 1979 maybe positioned in the treatment paradigm? Thank you.
George Yancopoulos: I have to admit I didn't quite get your question there.
Carter Gould: Okay. It was around the CD20 antigen loss you saw in some of the patients treated and how you see that ultimately potentially influencing how the drug gets positioned in the treatment paradigm if it potentially takes away salvage options?
George Yancopoulos: Right. Well, I think that we have seen antigen loss to both CD20 and also CD19 which has occurred. So far it doesn't seem to have in these very late-stage patients dramatically affected the response rates or the durability. So, we're seeing the rates that we responded -- we reported. So, doesn't seem it's at this point a major issue.
Carter Gould: Thank you.
Justin Holko: Next question John.
Operator: Our next question is from Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley.
Matthew Harrison: Hey good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I wanted to ask on the initial BCMA data that you expect to present towards the end of this year. I mean how should we think about relevant comparisons here? Is this something you would compare against CAR-T against BiTEs, I'm just wondering how we should think about that and what the goal here is? Thanks.
Leonard Schleifer: Maybe George has more comments, but what I would say best thing is probably to wait for that data, but the way Sanofi and Regeneron and thinking about that in this part of the collaboration is that obviously if we can deliver anything close to what a bispecific can deliver then -- that a CAR-T can deliver, excuse me, then a bispecific being off-the-shelf and pharmaceutical like drug, pricing, consideration and things like that should obviously have a huge advantage in the marketplace.So, we would consider our competition more of things like the BiTEs and what have you. Obviously, we have already started out with long-lasting molecules with a well-designed; we make them straightforwardly through a proprietary approach. So, we think that we can compete and what you should be looking for is what kind of activity we can deliver. So, maybe we should just wait for that.
George Yancopoulos: Yes. And I think just to add that I think that obviously, we're hoping that it's going to confirm that our class of CD3 bispecifics are reproducibility sort of top-of-the-class in terms of producing the sort of efficacy that we've already seen with our CD20xCD3 bispecific. And so that's what we're hoping for.In addition to that we just want to point out that both with our own pipeline and obviously, with our partners' pipeline, there are myriad of combination opportunities. So, it's just sort of the beginning to show the activity with the BCMA bispecific. We can then add to it with the right set of combinations with components that both sides in the collaboration have to offer that we're very excited about, including for example our co-stims, which we have quite a few that could potentially collaborate clinically with the BCMAxCD3 bispecific.
Justin Holko: Thank you, Matthew. Next question?
Operator: Our next question is from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.
Terence Flynn: Hi. Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Congrats on the antibody JV profitability as well. Maybe just two on Dupixent, first on, I was wondering if you could share your thoughts about relevant size of the 6 to 11 year-old population here at atopic derm? And then would the pace of uptake be similar or faster than what we saw with adults in your view? And then on Dupi for grass allergy thanks for the additional data, just wondering next steps there for that program, if you could give us any more color on the forward? Thank you.
Leonard Schleifer: So why don't we take the Dupi – Marion will take the commercial question first.
Marion McCourt: Sure. And Terence just to clarify your question on Dupixent you were talking about the European population or you were you talking about the U.S. population?
Terence Flynn: Sure. I mean, both would be great, but I know you got the data this morning from 6 to 11. And again, I don't think you guys have characterized how big those groups are.
Marion McCourt: Right, right. So what I wanted to share with you, obviously with the atopic dermatitis population in the U.S. for adults, we've said about 300,000 to 400,000 patients are at greatest need of therapy. And I just want to lend the context that at this point, what we're very pleased with uptake and the difference that DUPIXENT is making in the lives of patients we've probably only so far reached about high-teens about 18% of the adult patient population. We're excited about the adolescence launch and we're seeing nice uptake there early days, again, a lot more work to do.We haven't yet given a characterization in the size of the pediatric population, but certainly will on the future as we get further into the data readouts and preparedness for launch of that indication, which certainly I can confirm we'll be prepared to launch as soon as we have the FDA approval.
Leonard Schleifer: Yeah. Just a slight follow-up, the uptake of the cream –Eucrisa was fairly brisk, I think in some of the younger patients. So we think that market is really one of great unmet medical need. And as George said, these are children we studied that had 60%, 60% of their body covered with lesions, having all sorts of effect on their mental health, their sleeping, their family, they are just building quality of life. So I think that in the severe patients, we would expect pretty brisk uptake, but it's going to obviously take some work, because you're treating children with a biologic, we still have to constantly educate and remind people what George said in contradistinction to other Biologics, where you see an increase infection or – listen carefully George mentioned that it was actually numerically decreased consistent that we've seen this cause a severe moderately severe atopic dermatitis patients and numerical decrease. So we think that as people get more and more and more comfortable with the safety and efficacy, this will move lower and lower down into the age groups as we get approval. George, maybe you want to turn to the grass allergy and what's next?
George Yancopoulos: Yeah. So as I mentioned, we were very excited by the potential of Dupixent to apparently increase the tolerability of skit therapy. I may have misspoke, obviously it was 25 patients per arm, and I said 30 patients discontinuous – 30% of the patients discontinued on SCID which is I think is about normal. Obviously, if you do the math, that's about eight patients. That's the exact number. But in any case – so as we noted, the ability of desensitization therapy to work is real, but it takes time and it comes at the cost of tolerability and many patients not being able to get through the therapy because of the severe allergic reactions. So it is obviously very exciting to see Dupixent have such an apparent benefit, albeit in an early study in small numbers, on the tolerability of the SCID therapy.We have a number of other ongoing programs in studying allergy and I think we're going to be looking at all these together before we come up with our formal strategy of how to go forward in this, but we do think that this is a very exciting area that can make a lot of difference to a lot of people who are suffering from allergies. So we're pretty excited.
Justin Holko: Great. Thank you, Terence. Next question.
Operator: Our next question is from Yaron Weber from Cowen.
Yaron Werber: Great. Thanks for taking my question and again nice results. I have – if you don’t mind, just two questions, the first one on Dupi. If you can just give us a sense across -- between asthma, AD and obviously, chronic rhinosinusitis is obviously just getting going. But what really kind of led to the growth this quarter on a quarter-over-quarter basis?And in asthma, where are you getting the majority of sales? Is that new to Biologics, or is it switching from Biologics? And then just a question on EYLEA whether we're hearing some reports on the field that there is now a slightly higher discounting program from Regeneron about a 4% and does that jive with what you're saying? Thank you.
Leonard Schleifer: So before Marion tackles those question, I'll say, it is Justin's first call and maybe he's being nice to you. We said one question per. That was three. We'll let Marion give you pass on then trying to deal with each of the questions.
Marion McCourt: Sure. I'm happy to. So I'm going to start with EYLEA. And let me first comment that we believe that physicians should make this choice on which anti-VEGF therapy they want to select for their patients and certainly EYLEA is the standard of care for many prescribers. Further, I'll just say that, we really are not commenting on pricing strategy. I'm happy to go into some of the other items as well. I'll see if I can remember the questions.We haven't given for Dupixent, we haven't. It is early days for many of our indications, so haven't given breakout of business by indication, because it would be premature. But I think in your question, there were a couple of specifics in there that I can give you. You were asking for a characterization in asthma of the types of patients that are being prescribed Dupixent and we are getting the majority of our starts from bio naïve patients. About 80% of our business is patients who are coming onto a biologic therapy and then, of course, the remaining are switches.The characterization I'll give you is that, certainly for the physicians who are prescribing both allergists and pulmonologists now, allergists obviously had a lot of experience with Dupixent from atopic dermatitis, but we are hearing very positive comments. And it's the differentiation of the clinical profile, the safety, the results they're getting in terms of the patient's ability to breathe more easily, and to go about their lives in a normal way, that obviously coupled with the ability for patients to self or have at-home administration.So certainly, asthma was a major contributor to our performance in the quarter, but as was atopic dermatitis. We continue to see substantial growth and as I mentioned earlier, there's still so much unmet need, certainly with adults. And now we're very excited to also be helping those adolescent patients who are very much in need. So, I think I would round it all up by saying that it's the combination of medications; the expansion of our platform is DUPIXENT that is contributing to this strong second quarter performance.
Leonard Schleifer: Thanks Marion. And just maybe add one thing to emphasize you said the combination indications, that's really resonating well for people for example who have both asthma and nasal polyps which is very commonly coexisting or asthma and atopic dermatitis, particularly in adolescence is a common coexistent. So, the ability to treat these comorbidities is a real advantage for our product and I think the allergists in particular who are the ones in sort of the center point seeing patients who have multiple comorbidities are really getting that.
Justin Holko: Thanks Yaron. Next question.
Operator: Our next question is from Geoff Porges from SVB Leerink.
Geoff Porges: Thank you very and congratulations on the quarter. A lot of things that I could ask questions on, but I'll just ask one with 10 subparts. On the 1979 study George, you mentioned that is going to enroll both DLBCL and follicular lymphoma and presumably also mantle cell. Do you envisage that it could be potentially pivotal in all those NHL subtypes? And will you be enrolling patients who are prior CAR-T failures in that trial? Thanks.
Leonard Schleifer: Yes. So, basically, the way our pivotal Phase II study is designed is with a number of arms actually each one dedicated precisely to exactly some of those subtypes that you're interested in.So, that yes, each one we would consider to have pending, of course, how active the data and the durability and so forth. Each one would have registrational possibilities and we also have a -- in the pivotal Phase II, we certainly will have the late-stage follicular lymphoma patients, the late-stage DLBCL patients, but also we have a program where we're focusing an arm specifically on CAR-T failures where we think obviously in such a high unmet need population where people have failed everything, if one sees the sort of activities that we're seeing in this very small numbers of patients so far being maintained and being durable that yes, that could also be a separate approval opportunity.
Justin Holko: That's two out of four prior CAR-T that George mentioned with complete responses was very encouraging.
Geoff Porges: Indeed.
Justin Holko: Okay. Thank you, Geoff. Next question.
Operator: Our next question is from Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan.
Cory Kasimov: Hey good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. I recognize this is probably a difficult one to answer, but we're frequently asked, so I'll ask you. How are you broadly thinking about the longer term outlook for EYLEA when you balance the possibilities of healthcare reform in Part B exposure pending competition Wet AMD and then your own new EYLEA launches and less exposed indications? Thanks.
Leonard Schleifer: Yes. Obviously, it is a difficult question to answer and we hope to give a good answer to it. Our view is more qualitative. If you look at the brand, we're seeing good growth and the good growth is not just occurring in the United States. Its occurring I think it was about 13% outside of the United States. For a brand that's this large and this late in the class that says that the demographics that we predicted would be having a positive impact. So, I do think there is plenty of room for growth. In terms of competition, obviously, as I think it was mentioned on the call at the end of the day vision and maintaining and improving vision is the goal of standard. It's what the FDA measures you by. I think it's what most patients care most about, and we are unsurpassed in that. Our long-term safety, I think we've given over 25 million injections. We are expecting action on our pre-filled syringe, which we worked hard at to come up PDUFA date's coming up pretty soon.So our enormous safety database is I think work in our favor. It is hard to do this, and if you're injecting 20 – as we said now up to 25 million injections into the eye, you have to be able to do that in a very reliable and safe way. If you look at some of the studies out there that have been focusing on let's say dryness is also if you look at them there is some data that's worth inspecting on the reactions in terms of inflammation. So, we also have to see how that sorts out plus we have the advantage of being able to give the dose monthly as well as every other month as well as all the indications. So I think we're well positioned from a near-term.In terms of your question about healthcare policy and overhang, obviously we watch that carefully. We're very involved in Washington. We know what's really important to us. We are sympathetic to the notion that some have that prices in United States are much higher and prices for the same drugs outside the United States, but we don't thing that the solution of tying prices in the United States for drug like EYLEA, where we don't control the price outside of the United States makes a lot of sense. That would be a huge negative to the biotechnology industry as a whole because so many biotechnology companies license away their rights for survival outside the United States, and they don't control the prices.So we were happy to see in the Grassley widen compromise that that was not in there. It almost got in there in an affirmative way that it couldn't happen that vote was 14-14. We watched that carefully. We're working at it and so we're hopeful that the policy debates that are taking place will not block innovation or rewards the good actors. We haven't had a price increase in EYLEA. So the notion of having an inflation rebate would not affect us. So maybe that's a qualitative summary of all the things that we worry about. We worry about competition obviously, we worry about the environment, we worry about the regulatory and patent exclusivity and so forth.
Justin Holko: Next question.
Cory Kasimov: Thanks, Len. Appreciate it.
Marion McCourt: There's one item. I might pick up a one thread in the question and this was just related to EYLEA and our indications, and obviously the growing indication which recently launching in diabetic retinopathy. To date, 60% of our sales are now coming from wet AMD. And with the expansion of our diabetes indications now over 30% of EYLEA sales are coming from the Diabetes indications, and of course recently including diabetic retinopathy and the balance for others.
Operator: And our next question is from Evan Seigerman from Credit Suisse.
Evan Seigerman: Hello. Thank you so much for taking the question. And congrats on the progress. One combo for Bob and Marion. So Bob you had mentioned that there was some sort of an Avastin shortage that may have benefited EYLEA sales in the quarter. And then more broadly speaking, how are you positioning EYLEA in light of upcoming competitive launches?
Marion McCourt: Sure. So let me take a start and then if Bob has elements to add. So I think, first, let me talk a little bit about the second quarter. We certainly have a strong quarter. It was influenced by a few factors and let me cover those. Certainly, there's market expansion in consideration. We do see growth from our wet AMD and DME indications. We began launching in diabetic retinopathy. As mentioned, we added customer-facing personnel to focus on our Diabetes indications.There was a modest, what we had characterized as a modest impact from Avastin shortages in some geographies in the U.S. and then as well we were up against a somewhat weaker 2018 second quarter comparison. So I did want to give you some relative context there. I think in terms of, as we look forward, we do think that for EYLEA as a standard of care with a huge end market, it's important to look at growth rates as the average of several quarters to get a true sense of what the growth profile has looked like historically and may go into future. And then in terms of preparation for competitive launches, we feel very well positioned to continue to perform well in the market with EYLEA and certainly we're very excited about the breadth of indications and the profile that Len just covered related to EYLEA.
Justin Holko: Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question is from Yatin Suneja from Guggenheim Partners.
Yatin Suneja: Hey, guys. Congrats on all the progress and thanks for taking my question. The question is on REGN3500, the IL-33 antibody that you have, could you maybe talk about the development strategy there, given that Dupi monotherapy was numerically better than IL-33 across all the end points that you have elevated in the asthma trial, could you maybe comment on the areas where you think IL-30 might play a differentiated role relative to Dupi?
Leonard Schleifer: Well, as you said, the hope would be that there might be, to particular patients who might better respond to, for example, or would like the alternative in IL-33 as opposed to a Dupi in asthma. And, of course, we're also waiting for upcoming data from our atopic dermatitis program and also from our COPD program, to really understand how we're going to position this. But we do think that this could be an important alternative option for some patients with Asthma, just based on the current data and we're waiting for more data to see how it evolves.
Justin Holko: Thank you. Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question is from Mohit Bansal from Citigroup.
Mohit Bansal: Great. Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Quick question on Praluent. Given that the challenges you are facing in the market, do you think there comes a point where you and your partner take a tough business decision? Or you think you can turn it around and achieve profitability for this drug in longer term? Thank you.
Leonard Schleifer: Yeah. Obviously, this is a highly competitive space. And we don't want to get too detailed about what our strategies are. Obviously, we said we're trying to match our investments appropriately. We do have some strategies. At the end of the day, heart disease is still a major killer. The PCSK9 is still a terrific drug. So, maybe that's all we should say at this point.
Mohit Bansal: Okay.
Justin Holko: Thank you. Next question please.
Operator: Our next question is from Kennen MacKay from RBC Capital Markets.
Kennen MacKay: Hi thanks for taking the question. Maybe one for George. I was wondering if you can just comment a little bit more on the high dose of aflibercept trials you're initiating and sort of how high you can go on those and really what the goals of the high dose are? Thank you.
George Yancopoulos: Well, obviously, from our earlier studies, we've seen that about 50% of patients can do well with a more prolonged dosing schedule that is on a 12-week interval. And so we're imagining that if we go to higher dose of aflibercept we may be able to push a higher percentage of patients to either a 12-week or maybe even a 16-week regiment. So, we're running the studies to actually test these longer intervals and see whether the higher doses will actually do that. So, we'll see.
Justin Holko: Great. Next question please.
Operator: Our next question is from Alethia Young from Cantor Fitzgerald.
Alethia Young: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a very good quarter. I guess I found the 18% or so number very striking about how much adults and maybe can you talk about some of the things that you're doing to drive penetration or is it the slow but sure process to get more people on the drug? Thanks.
Marion McCourt: Sure. So, I believe your question, Alethia, is in reference to the comment on DUPIXENT in adult atopic dermatitis. And I do -- yes, just to give a context, but my comment is to make a point that while certainly many adults that had very, very difficult moderate-to-severe disease are now being treated, there is tremendous potential for us to do more with DUPIXENT to help appropriate adults in need of therapy.And to your characterization, I do think that DUPIXENT is gaining momentum in atopic dermatitis, certainly in other indications as well. And it's not unusual for physicians first to prescribe to those patients who are their toughest patients, the most severe patients. We're seeing pickup in breadth and depth of physician prescribing of DUPIXENT and we also are seeing more moderate, moderate-to-severe patients being treated. So, it's encouraging because DUPIXENT is helping these patients in a way that we hear time and time again is transformational to their lives and as well transformational to the lives of the physicians who are treating them.
Justin Holko: I think we have time for two more questions John.
Operator: Our next one is from Hartaj Singh from Oppenheimer & Co.
Hartaj Singh: Great. Thank you for my question. I have one question on Libtayo. You had a stronger number than we expected for the second question. I think this PD-1 had gotten some really good data and just from what we've heard is being really accepted broadly. Can you just give us some color on the commercial rollout and how that has progressed? And any thoughts also on the lung cancer products you've got ongoing? Thank you.
Marion McCourt: So, I will give some comments related to commercial performance and with Libtayo, we certainly are making inroads to become the standard-of-care for CSCC patients as described in our label.Approximately 90% of new patient starts in CSCC within the anti-PD-1, PD-L1 class are now going to Libtayo. Further, we had excellent payer coverage that is already been achieved and further; we'll have a permanent J code in October 1st. So, certainly, we've made a strong start in the launch of CSCC for Libtayo.
Leonard Schleifer: About the lung cancer, I guess, early on there were a lot of the thoughts that the PD-1 space would be commoditized and that there would be so many PD-1s and it'd be sort of boilerplates just making other one. I think that, if one fairly looks at the data, these are not behaving the same and that's obvious for sure in the lung cancer space, where Keytruda is the unquestioned leader. And so we're very excited about the fact that, we think that our PD-1 might have very good activities already demonstrated as we've heard in certain settings. So we're excited to see, how it's going to perform in the lung cancer setting, and whether it will be one of the rare PD-1s that can really provide a lot of benefit to patients there.
Operator: And our last question from Brian Skorney from Baird.
Brian Skorney: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Two quick ones. Obviously, bevacizumab almost prescribed VEGF therapy despite being off label. It looks like there's one company plan on actually filing at BLA next year to market a brand at bevacizumab. How do you guys think about the market impact of an active sales force marketing bevacizumab versus more passive usage right now? And then just real quickly on Regeneron 4461. I know leptin was a pretty well researched target about a decade ago, never quite realized the terms. Can you your thoughts on what makes targeting the receptor with your antibody attractive and how you could overcome some of the prior history? Thanks.
Leonard Schleifer: Sure. Just very briefly, because we're running out of time and I'll take the bevacizumab question. George, will deal with the question on the insulin – I mean, on the leptin receptor. So in terms of bevacizumab, obviously you can't have biosimilar to bevacizumab in terms of approvals, because it doesn't have any approvals. So somebody if they want to get approvals obviously going to have do all of the different studies et cetera. And we already know that in large studies conducted independently by the government for example Protocol T bevacizumab was inferior clearly inferior to EYLEA. So I think that the use of bevacizumab is mainly one driven by its off-label exceedingly low price. So having another competition there with or without the sales force is doctors are well aware about this, we wouldn't expect to have a major impact in the market. George, on the leptin?
George Yancopoulos: Well, just to remind you, one of the major problems with leptin and metro leptin is it was developed was – it elicited unfortunately in quite significant percentage of patient's antibodies against the leptin. And a lot of these patients are patients who actually still have endogenous leptin activity. So when the antibodies come on board, the patients end up not only neutralizing the injected leptin, but they endogenous leptin they end up being worse off than they were beforehand and they're also left with nothing to actually being available to treat them, because you now can't give them leptin.So of course we are pursuing our leptin receptor activating antibody in that setting, but it would also provide a better alternative and would allow broader usage. There are other settings where one could have conceived using metro leptin except one who wouldn't have not wanted, to elicit this antibody response and have the potential to wipe out the endogenous leptin remaining activity. And so people were reticent to explore it more broadly in other setting. So on top of that, it is one of the first examples of our new activating antibody technology that allows us to, we hope, create efficient in vivo acting – activating antibodies for growth factor and cytokine and so forth. So for all those reasons, we're pretty excited about our leptin receptor program. But, of course, we'll be starting in the – in same sort of rare patients where leptin is mostly used right now.

With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.
Leonard Schleifer: Thanks Mark. Good morning to everyone. EYLEA and Dupixent kicked off a successful start to 2019. For the first quarter, total aggregate sales of all Regeneron-invented products were $2.27 billion, a 23% year-over-year increase. We are pleased with the early launch of Libtayo, a foundation immune-oncology and we made significant progress across our deep and diverse pipeline. EYLEA, which was approved in the U.S. late in 2011, continues to deliver in its eighth year in the market, with U.S. sales of $1.07 billion, a 9% year-over-year increase. I'm proud to say that EYLEA’s growth has come without price increases. EYLEA has an established efficacy and safety profile with over 25 million injections sold worldwide. In addition to a demographic tailwind in approved indications, we view our pending new approval in diabetic retinopathy as a new opportunity potential to potentially drive growth. While the potential to prevent patients with diabetic retinopathy from suffering blinding complications is very exciting, we recognize that it will require market development because it involves treating patients that are currently asymptomatic. To test the hypothesis that higher doses may improve upon EYLEA’s already market leading profile, later this year we plan to advance the clinical development of a higher-dose formulation of aflibercept and we continue to make progress on new molecular entities that have the potential to be even better. Let me turn now to Dupixent, a product with the potential to change the course of allergic type two diseases. First quarter net sales globally were $374 million, and patient feedback testified to Dupixent’s value proposition. We are seeing growth in both atopic dermatitis and asthma, and we expect further growth to be amplified by expanded age groups, new geographies and additional indications. Moving now to Libtayo. In its first two quarters on the market, Libtayo has established a foothold in advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or CSCC. We intend to build on that dermato-oncology foundation and expand into other indications. In addition to testing Libtayo and cancers in which PD-1 blockade is known to be effective, we considered an important component of potential future combinations that have the potential to broaden activity and deepen responses. Last month, we announced the collaboration with Alnylam that combines each company's unique assets and abilities and enables us to pursue intracellular targets in the eye and central nervous system, as well as a select number of targets in the liver. This deal exemplifies our business development strategy and we continue to explore many new and exciting opportunities. Advancing our internal pipeline remains a key priority. Leveraging our scientific capabilities and our world class genetics efforts, and partnering with other scientific driven companies is yet another way we plan to capitalize on our own research productivity and innovation. In summary, our core franchises of EYLEA and Dupixent are growing, Libtayo is establishing itself as the foundation of our diversified and comprehensive immune-oncology platform, and has had early commercial success in his first indication. We are advancing a broad and deep pipeline, rich in opportunity for sustainable, long term growth. For more on that, I will now turn the call over to George.
George Yancopoulos: Thank you, Len, and good morning everyone. Let me begin with EYLEA, which remains the gold standard for retinal disease. Despite efforts by many others to develop drugs with superior visual outcomes, EYLEA remains the market leader, based upon visual outcome and safety and is the measure upon which other therapies are compared. In terms of additional indications, in which EYLEA can benefit patients, we are looking forward to next week's FDA action date for our supplemental BLA in diabetic retinopathy. Furthermore, we are awaiting FDA action and our resubmitted filing for the EYLEA prefilled syringe hoping to launch in the second half of 2019. As Len mentioned, we also plan to initiate clinical development of a higher dose formulation of aflibercept and we continue preclinical development of a new VEGF blocker. Earlier research efforts are focusing on gene therapy and other novel approaches. I'd like to now turn to Dupixent, which is emerging as a new standard for type 2 diseases. In the first quarter of 2019, we achieved three important regulatory milestones; the FDA approval for adolescents age twelve through 17, with atopic dermatitis, a positive EU opinion for severe asthma and adolescence in adults and the U.S. and EU filing of our applications for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis for which we receive priority review in the United States with an action date of June 26. We hope to bring the benefit of Dupixent even younger, atopic dermatitis patients or Phase 3 trial in pediatric patients, aged six to eleven is now fully enrolled, and we expect to report results on this trial later this year. We also have an ongoing pivotal confirmatory study in the eosinophilic esophagitis as well as studies with peanut and grass allergy. Dupixent is delivering on its pipeline interproduct promise, demonstrating positive data in multiple allergic type-2 diseases confirming our hypothesis that Interleukin or an Interleukin-13 are the key drivers of allergic type-2 disease in general. Many of these different manifestations of an overactive type-2 inflammation occur simultaneously in the same patient. For example, in our adolescent atopic dermatitis trials, more than 90% had at least one other allergic condition with more than 50% suffering from co-morbid asthma. Obviously, there would be a huge patient benefit if they can take a single medicine from multiple diseases. Interestingly, there are numerous case studies published by outside investigators indicating benefits for dupilumab in an assortment of additional Type-2 related conditions, such as alopecia areata and Bullous pemphigoid that we have yet to study formally, and we are considering confirmatory studies in these settings. Of course, it is possible treat numerous immune diseases with drugs that are broadly immunosuppressive or to treat a single disease with drugs that are more disease specific. Dupixent is the rare example of a drug that has efficacy across a range of types of diseases that tend to afflict the same patient, with the favorable safety profile that has permitted development in teenagers and young children. In addition to Dupixent, we in Sanofi are also testing REGN3500, a fully human anti IL 33 Antibody in asthma, atopic dermatitis and COPD. The first of these proof-of-concept trials to read out is an asthma, where we expect to report top line results by mid-year. I will shift gears now from our efforts with immuno therapies in non-oncologist settings to our immunotherapy efforts to treat cancer, starting with our PD-1 antibody, Libtayo. Last month the European regulatory body issued a positive opinion for advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. This follows a September 2018 U.S. approval, which made Libtayo the third FDA approved PD-1 antibody and the first approved medicine of any kind for patients with advanced, cutaneous, squamous cell carcinoma. To extend Libtayo’s benefit in this disease, the second most common skin cancer, we will be starting a Phase-3 adjuvant trial this quarter, and a new adjuvant trial in the third quarter. We are also evaluating Libtayo in the most common skin cancer, that is basal cell carcinoma where we have fully enrolled the locally advanced cohort of our potentially pivotal trial. Moving to lung cancer, despite the headstart of other multiple other programs, Libtayo has the opportunity to become one of only two PD-1 antibodies approved for the first line treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, the most common cause of cancer death. A Libtayo monotherapy trial, which we doubled in size is about two thirds enrolled. We will soon begin enrolling patients in our Phase-3 non-small cell lung cancer trial comparing Libtayo plus chemotherapy to chemotherapy alone. This study will enroll both squamous and non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients regardless of PDL-1 expression. Beyond Libtayo, bio-specific antibodies, another key component of our immune-oncology strategy. We will present updated efficacy and safety data for our CD20xCD3 bispecific at two European Hematology Conferences in June. The data will include promising early results with higher doses, longer term follow up and efficacy in specific patient’s subpopulations such as CAR-T failures. Encouraged by high rates of deep and durable responses, we are on track to initiate two potentially registration phase two studies; the first an advanced relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma by mid-year and another an advanced relapse/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or DLBCL by the end of the year. We're enrolling patients in early studies testing our other two clinical stage CD3 bispecific antibody. MUC16 by CD3 for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, and BCMAxCD3 for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Based on currently available results, from BCMA targeted CAR-T and other approaches, there is still room for improvement, of fully human BCMAxCD3 with favorable pharmacokinetics and lacking potentially immunogenic features may provide the foundation for additional combination approaches. As far as we know, our bispecific platform is the only one that does not use artificial linkers, mutations or other unnatural sequences. We are also advancing our entirely new classes by specific antibodies as we will soon begin clinical testing of our first costimulatory or costimulatory bispecifics, REGN5678, which is designed to bind Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen or PSMA and CD28. We hope that our clinical studies will replicate our preclinical observations that this new class of co-slim bispecific has limited to toxicity while synergizing with Libtayo as well as with the CD3 class of bispecifics. Since prostate cancer has shown real, but limited responsiveness PD-1 therapy, we believe it may therefore be an ideal opportunity to detect a clear signal of additional activity if the combination of Libtayo and PSMA by C28 results in a substantially higher response rate than previously observed with PD-1 blockade. The ability to test multiple combinations of our own checkpoint inhibitors, CD3 bispecifics and co-slim bispecifics is a differentiated feature of our immune-oncology pipeline. However, heightening the immune response via combination approaches carries inherent risks, as occurs with CAR-T therapies. For example, in our initial study combining our CD20xCD3 bispecific with our PD-1 antibody, in which approximately 30 patients with advanced lymphoma have been treated with a combination, we observed enhanced cytokine release syndrome or CRS that might have been associated with increased tumor response, but also with increased toxicity including unfortunately two fatalities potentially related to the CRS. We plan to modify the dosing regimen with the goal of minimizing toxicity while potentially capturing the potentially increased activity. Over the coming months and years, we expect to advance a steady stream of bispecifics into clinical development. Just to remind you, Regeneron1979 C3 bispecifics other than those targeting MUC16 and BCMA in our new class of cost in bispecifics are all wholly-owned by Regeneron. Leaving our immune-oncology and moving to pain. As we have emphasized previously fasinumab, our anti NGF antibody involves a high risk program due to long term safety issues involving increased treatment associated arthropathies in and total joint replacements with this class. On April 30th, the Data Monitoring Committee recommended continuing the program at the ongoing lower doses, where we previously reported positive efficacy results. These are just a few highlights of Regeneron’s homegrown pipeline. Let me conclude with comments about the Regeneron Genetics Center, or the RGC in Alnylam collaboration. In March, the RGC provided to the global research community excellent sequences from the first 50,000 U.K. Biobank participants. Sequences are linked to detail de-identified electronic health records, imaging, and other health related information provided through collaboration among the U.K. Biobank, Regeneron, and GlaxoSmithKline. Regeneron is also leading a separate effort to sequence the remaining 450,000 U.K. Biobank participates, which we intend to complete by 2020 and is being funded by a consortium of biopharma companies, including Alnylam, AbbVie, AstraZeneca, BMS, Biogen, Pfizer and Takeda. Finally, I would like to acknowledge our new collaboration with Alnylam. Regeneron and Alnylam’s technologies are complementary and our companies share a commitment to patients into science. The emphasis of our joint work will be on diseases of the Eye and CNS and we will also work jointly on certain targets expressed in the liver, including C5, where we each have clinical stage assets. Regeneron’s antibodies are optimal for secreted in cell surface targets, Alnylam’s RNAi enables us to extend our therapeutic reach to inside the cell. With that, I'll turn over the call to Marion.
Marion McCourt: Thank you George and good morning everyone. I'd like to start with the EYLEA. For the first quarter, U.S. EYLEA net product sales grew 9% year-over-year to $1.0 7 billion. Overall market growth continues to be driven by the aging population, increase in diabetes prevalence, and physician preference for EYLEA. EYLEA is the world's leading anti-VEGF therapy for retinal disease. Based on its broad range of indications, demonstrated safety profile, dosing flexibility, and established physician confidence EYLEA market share continues to grow in the overall U.S. anti-VEGF market. This includes branded products, and off-label repackaged Avastin. In the branded U.S. market, EYLEA has about 70% share of net product sales. Among peers, EYLEA continues to secure approximately 90% first line access. We're committed to further strengthening our leadership position for EYLEA through continued innovation, in dose and delivery as well as label expansion opportunities. Diabetes is our largest growth opportunity. Very shortly, we expect to hear from the FDA on our filing submission for EYLEA and diabetic retinopathy. Diabetic retinopathy is not a benign condition. Patients with moderately severe and severe nonproliferation disease are at risk for potential blindness. Given the compelling data from our panorama trial, we think this is an important opportunity to help patients avoid these serious complications. If approved, we have comprehensive plans to develop this market. Our focus will be on raising awareness of the benefits of treating diabetic retinopathy, encouraging early intervention for appropriate patients, and ensuring EYLEA is the first line anti-VEGF treatment for diabetic retinopathy patients. Turning now to the Dupixent where global net product sales in the first quarter were $374 million. In the U.S. net product sales reached $303 million, representing a 159% year-over-year growth. Total prescriptions or TRX in the U.S. grew 18% quarter-over-quarter. This was driven by growth in adult atopic dermatitis, and in our new asthma indication, which launched in the fourth quarter. In March, the FDA also approved Dupixent in adolescent atopic dermatitis, which we anticipate will contribute to incremental growth. Across all indications, prescriber experience and depth continue to improve. Approximately 16,000 health care providers have prescribed Dupixent and we continue to see strong prescribing trends. Weekly new-to-brand prescriptions or NBRx for the quarter averaged 950 patients per week, up from approximately 700 in the prior quarter. In atopic dermatitis, more patients are now benefiting from Dupixent, including those with both moderate and severe disease. Prescriber debt has grown, as evidenced by a nearly 200% year-over-year increase in the number of providers, who have prescribed Dupixent to five or more patients. Additionally, patient awareness has improved benefiting from our promotional and educational campaigns. As a reminder, we estimate the target patient population most in need be 300 to 400,000 adults and just a small minority of patients have received Dupixent since launch. We also see an important opportunity in adolescent patients with atopic dermatitis. Dupixent is the first biologic approved in this patient group, who remain uncontrolled using topical therapies. While it's very early, market launch reaction has been extremely positive. Our promotional efforts are focused on the same allergist and dermatologists, who currently treat adults with atopic dermatitis, plus pediatric dermatologists and pediatric allergist. We have also been encouraged by payer receptivity to extending Dupixent’s access to this younger patient population. Additionally, we anticipate data from our pediatric study in atopic dermatitis ages 6 to 11 later this year. Turning now to Asthma, where Dupixent is quickly establishing a competitive market presence in the U.S. Dupixent has a differentiated, clinical and safety profile compared to other asthma biologics. It has a first-in-class mode of action that substantially reduces exacerbations and provides clinically meaningful improvement in lung function, for all the patient population and is the only asthma biologics that can be self-administered. Since Dupixent’s asthma launch last October, we estimate the asthma biologic market has grown by more than 10%. Nearly 75% of Dupixent asthma patients are new to biologics and significant opportunity remains for subsequent growth. Uptake has been driven by allergists who have experience using Dupixent in atopic dermatitis, and also pulmonologist who are highly receptive to Dupixent efficacy used in steroid dependent patients and self-administration. Additionally, we are excited about launching in markets outside the U.S. Dupixent was recently approved in Japan, and we expect an EU regulatory decision mid-year. Finally in June, we expect to hear from the FDA on our proposed indication in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis. This should help further differentiate Dupixent from the competition by demonstrating that the same treatment can address multiple related type-2 conditions that often present in the same patient. I'd now like to turn to Libtayo. In the U.S. first quarter, net product sales were $27 million, driven by prescription demand. Building on our success since launch, Libtayo’s brand awareness among the medical community has increased substantially. We made further progress in establishing Libtayo as a standard-of-care in advance CSCC across all lines of therapy. Our launch update has benefited from broad payer access with nearly all Medicare commercial and Medicaid lives covered. We expect the number of patients on Libtayo to grow, based on demographics, enhancement and patient identification and physician referrals. Libtayo is the only FDA approved treatment for advanced CSCC and the only anti PD-1 or PD-L1 with a Category 2A recommendation from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network or NCCN. Now onto Praluent. Just over a week ago, the FDA approved Praluent to prevent cardiovascular events. Praluent is the first and only PCSK9 inhibitor with data showing a meaningful reduction in all-cause mortality and we're pleased the data describing this mortality effect was included in the updated label. In this highly competitive market, we continue to be focused on patient affordability and payer access. Moving to Kevzara. Within the IL-6 subcutaneous class, Kevzara now has an estimated 45% share of new patients dispense drug or NBRx and 26% share of total scripts or TRx. We are working to accelerate Kevzara growth by securing a greater share of the IL-6 market and growing the market which is currently estimated at $450 million in the U.S. Now I'll turn the call over to Bob.
Bob Landry: Thank you, Marion, and good morning to everyone. Today I will discuss our first quarter 2019 financial progress, highlight various items and events that impacted our results, and provide updates to our full year guidance line items, which can be found in our press release that was issued earlier this morning. For the first quarter 2019, we reported non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $4.45 on non-GAAP net income of $518 million. Total revenues were $1.71 billion, a 13% year-over-year increase. Revenue growth continued to be driven by global sales of EYLEA, and increase in both Sanofi and Bayer collaboration in Libtayo net sales. For the first quarter 2019, global net products sales of EYLEA were $1.74 billion, an increase of 8% year-over-year. U.S. EYLEA net product sales increased due to higher sales volume partly offset by an increase in sales related deductions primarily due to higher discounts. U.S. distributor inventory experienced a slight quarter-over-quarter decrease yet remained within our normal one to two week targeted range. Ex-USA EYLEA net product sales recorded by our collaborator, Bayer were $669 million representing a 7% reported and a 15% operational or constant currency basis increase year-over-year. Total Bayer collaboration revenue for the first quarter of 2019 was $276 million of which $249 million was derived from our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. the $249 million represents year-over-year reported growth of 7% compared to the first quarter of 2018. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $246 million for the first quarter of 2019, a 30% year-over-year increase. We are projecting the Sanofi collaboration revenue line to increase over the remaining quarters of 2019. The year-over-year increase in Sanofi collaboration revenue was primarily driven by lower losses associated with the commercialization of non-IO antibodies driven in part by higher net sales of Dupixent and an increase in the antibody reimbursement of our Regeneron commercialization expenses. These increases were partly offset by a decrease in reimbursement of research and development costs under the IO discovering development agreement with Sanofi, as the amended December 31, 2018 agreement narrowed the scope of reimbursable activities to the BCMA by CD3 and MUC16 by CD3 programs. Second, Sanofi collaboration revenues associated with cost reimbursements from Sanofi for bulk drug manufactured by Regeneron were also adversely impacted by timing. In the first quarter of 2019, we recognized the loss of $28 million in connection with the commercialization of non IO antibodies, which compares favorably to a loss of $75 million in the first quarter of 2018. As noted, the lower share of loss versus the first quarter of 2018 was primarily attributable to higher global net products sales of Dupixent partly offset by an increase in Dupixent commercialization expenses to support the U.S. launch in asthma and ongoing global launches in atopic dermatitis. Turning now to expenses; non-GAAP R&D expenses were $583 million for the first quarter of 2019 compared to $458 million for the first quarter of 2018. The year-over-year increase in non-GAAP R&D expense was the result of the expansion in progression of our earlier stage pipeline, an increase in Libtayo development expenses, higher clinical manufacturing costs, and higher headcount in headcount related costs. This increase in R&D spend is consistent with our 2019 guidance and previously communicated commitment to reinvest the tax savings we are realizing from the enactment of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into research and development. Our non-GAAP on reimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as the total non-GAAP R&D expense less R&D reimbursements from our collaborators was $419 million for first quarter 2019 compared to $278 million for the first quarter of 2018. Included in our updated non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D guidance, our projected program initiation expenses related to our recently announced Alnylam collaboration. Despite the inclusion of these initiation expenses, we are maintaining the top end of our guidance in tightening the range. The $400 million upfront collaboration agreement payment to Alnylam will be recorded as an R&D expense in the second quarter, but will be excluded from reported non-GAAP R&D expenses. As a reminder, Regeneron’s year-over-year increase and full year non-GAAP unreimbursed guidance is primarily attributable to higher clinical trial and manufacturing costs to support Regeneron’s wholly owned programs, including four to six new molecules expected to advance into the clinic in 2019 on top of the five molecules that were advancing into the clinic in 2018, and lower Sanofi reimbursement as a result of the amended IO discovery and development agreement. Next, non-GAAP SG&A expense was $362 million for the first quarter of 2019, a 22% year-over-year increase. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher headcount and headcount related costs, primarily to support the Dupixent, asthma and Libtayo launches. Higher contributions to independent not-for-profit patient assistance organizations and an increase in U.S. commercialization related promotional expenses for Dupixent. We are lowering and tightening our previous 2019 guidance for non-GAAP SG&A expense. Also as a reminder, the year-over-year increase in our guidance is primarily driven by increased spend, support launches for Dupixent and Libtayo as well as incremental spend to support the potential new growth opportunity of EYLEA in diabetic retinopathy and increased patient assistance programs. Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization related expenses, a line item found within Sanofi collaboration revenue was $119 million for the first quarter of 2019. We are lowering and tightening our full year 2019 gains for Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization related expenses. For the three months ended March 31, 2019 combined non-GAAP cost of goods sold and cost to collaboration and contract manufacturing were $174 million compared to $108 million in the first quarter of 2018. With regards to COGS, remember that it includes Sanofi’s share of gross profits in connection with our commercialization of Libtayo in the United States. The year-over-year increase in cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing was primarily due to higher expenses in connection with planned, process validation of our Limerick manufacturing facility, higher inventory write offs and reserves, and the recognition of drug substance manufacturing costs associated with higher sales of Dupixent. Regeneron's process validation expenses and inventory write-off and reserves for first quarter 2019 were $44 million higher than the first quarter 2018. While these sorts of charges and activities can be difficult to predict, we currently don't expect to see increases of this magnitude impact any of our next three quarters. Turning now to taxes; our effective tax rate was 15.6% for the first quarter of 2019, compared to 18.3% for the first quarter 2018. As a result of incurring the $400 million Alnylam upfront collaboration expense in the U.S. we are lowering our full year 2019 effective tax rate to be 11% to 13%. The impact of the lower effective tax rate will likely be seen later in the year as the tax benefit of stock based compensation has historically been weighed towards the fourth quarter of the year. Turning next to Regeneron's first quarter 2019 cash flow, and March 31, 2019 balance sheet. Regeneron ended the first quarter with cash and marketable securities of $5.57 billion and generated free cash flow of $823 million for the quarter. We calculate free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Included in both balances was the first quarter 2019 receipt of $462 million of consideration from Sanofi related to the amended IO discovery and development agreement. Our capital expenditures for the first quarter, which has historically been our lowest spend quarter was $74 million. Based on our latest projections, we are lowering and tightening our full year 2019 capital expenditure guidance. Under the terms of the recently signed collaboration agreement with Alnylam we are obligated to make an upfront payment of $400 million and have also agreed to purchase $400 million of Alnylam equity, which equates to approximately 4.44 million common shares at the agreed upon price of $90 dollars per share. Subject the Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance, we anticipate closing this transaction and paying the $800 million during the second quarter. Additionally, we will provide Alnylam with a specified amount of funding at program initiation and at lead candidate designation and Alnylam will be eligible to receive up to $200 million in clinical proof of principal milestones for Eye or CNS programs. The clinical proof-of-principal milestones are not expected in 2019. With that, I would like to turn the call back to Mark.
Mark Hudson: Thanks. Bob. That concludes our prepared remarks. Before we get into Q&A, Len will have one thing to say.
Leonard Schleifer: Yes, one late breaking news. We just received the note, I'm pleased to inform you that the European Commission has informed us that on the 6th of May it adopted the EC implementing decision for Dupixent extension of the indication with the treatment of adults and adolescents with severe asthma with type-2 inflammation, characterized by raised blood eosinophils and/or raised FeNO and the addition of the 200 milligram dose strength in both the prefilled syringes and prefilled pen format. So the final full indication for Dupixent is now Dupixent, this is in Europe as indicated in adults and adolescents 12 years and older. As ad-on maintenance treatment for severe asthma with type-2 inflammation characterized by raised blood eosinophils and/or raised FeNO who are inadequately controlled with high dose inhaled corticosteroids, plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment. Now, we can go to questions again.
Mark Hudson: Operator, we'd like to open up the call for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Operator, you may open the line.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And from [Indiscernible]. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, hi good morning. So congrats on the launch of dupi. I have a question about dupi trends so far in asthma. It sounds like you're really capturing a nice share in terms of 75% or first the biologics. So I have a two part question. Number one, in terms of prior authorizations, what are you seeing for this new class versus the IL-5 class? And then secondly, when you're mentioning a 10% market growth, we're calculating the IL-5 is roughly doing about a billion and a half right now depending on how you project growth. Are you kind of talking about 10% of that is sort of a comp, and how do you see that market growing? Thank you
Marion McCourt: Sure. So let me take a start. I'll go to the last comment on the growth of the Asthma biologics market, and in our calculation was somewhat as you described. We look at all the biologics products that are currently indicated in the U.S. for asthma. And then since the launch of Dupixent for asthma, we're seeing the size of that market in total grow by about 10%. So certainly inclusive of Dupixent’s which we believe is significantly driving the growth, but also in combination with the IL-5 category you mentioned and also we would include Xolair of course as a biologic product within the asthma market. The next piece going back, we do see some very favorable indicators still somewhat early in launch, and most compelling of course is the profile and the unique aspects of Dupixent’s that is being showcased by allergists or the experience of Dupixent from atopic dermatitis but also pulmonologist, both the clinical profile, the safety profile and the fact that patients can self-administer. Again, early in the reimbursement cycle, I will comment only on Dupixent. It’s probably best that I not comment on an access for competitive therapies, but I can share that in early days, while we continue to work closely with payers, we have been pleased with the ability for patients to receive reimbursement and for physicians to participate and have ease of prescribing. So while we'll continue to work closely in that area, early days all aspects of the launch uptake, both patient experience, prescriber experience, and our patient access have been quite favorable.
Mark Hudson: Operator, next question?
Operator: From Goldman Sachs, we have Terence Flynn. Please go ahead.
Terence Flynn: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just a two part on Regeneron 1979. I'm just wondering when you guys will have visibility on if the Phase 2 trials will be or will not be registration enabling in lymphoma? And then the two debts that you mentioned, can you give us any more context there with respect to either you know the dose or if they were in FL or DLBCL and anything on prior treatment history? Thanks a lot.
George Yancopoulos: Well we will be certainly informing you when we know that these are registrational studies. In terms of the toxicities, I just wanted to remind you as I noted in my comments that these were seen in combination with PD-1. And as I noted that in some ways, it indicates that the theoretical concept of combining these two classes actually increases the immune activation is actually you know pertaining in the situation here. And what we believe is that we have ways of adjusting the dosing regimen, so that we can avoid the increase cytokine-release syndrome while capturing the potential increased activity of combining these two classes.
Leonard Schleifer: So Terence, just to amplify on the registrational aspect. It's nothing that we're being coy. I think, it -- there will be registration if the data are adequate. So obviously, we'll let what -- I think what George was trying to say is, we'll let you know when we have the data. We intend these to be registrational if the data continues to be as good as it was in the early studies.
Mark Hudson: Operator, next question?
Operator: From JPMorgan, we have Cory Kasimov. Please go ahead.
Cory Kasimov: Hey, good morning guys. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to follow up on the bispecific programs, and recognizing that it's still obviously relatively early days. How do you see the durability of response from 1979 stacking up against CAR-T therapies and the importance of this parameter for future broad commercial uptake? And as you're gathering experience in CAR-T experienced patients as well. How do you see 1979 initially slotting into the market place? Thanks.
George Yancopoulos: Well we have reported on durability and we'll continue to report on it in the upcoming conference. Most patients who remain on treatment maintain their responses. In terms of versus CAR-T as I noted, we will be reporting on promising early results in post CAR-T failures at the upcoming meeting. So we think that there is a lot of opportunity here for the CD20 bispecific, both in the relapsed refractory setting where we're setting it in. It's obviously going to be much more convenient and amendable therapy to more patients, who don't have to go through the whole process that's required for CAR-T therapies. The possibility that can actually also work in individuals who has failed CAR-T therapies is very exciting. Let alone the possibility that with its profile, and the way we give it that we can also be moving relatively rapidly into the frontline settings as well. So we think this is a very exciting opportunity that can really address a lot of the need in lymphoma from the latest stage patients who have failed every other kind of therapy eventually to a frontline therapy that could really impact the disease in the earliest of patients.
Leonard Schleifer: And just to amplify slightly, for those who are not dupi aficionados. We reported previously rather striking a response data including a high percentage of complete responses. What we think would be the effective doses. And so, when you start to see that in these very treatment experienced patients, it gets pretty exciting, pretty quickly.
Mark Hudson: Operator, next question?
Operator: From UBS, we have Carter Gould. Please go ahead.
Carter Gould: Morning. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to I guess stroll down a little bit more into the decision to move Dupi into a Phase 3 and COPD. I think before you talked about that being more of a Phase 2, Phase 3 study. It seems like a fully flushed out kind of Phase 3 and maybe just speaks to your level of confidence there given sort of the mixed history with -- negative history with the IL-5 and kind of what gives you confidence there? Thank you.
Leonard Schleifer: Maybe, I'll let George answer as well. But I would say, that one is comes more under the category of – we’ll need to see the data rather than a higher degree of confidence based upon some earlier studies. When we had done atopic dermatitis, what we had done our first asthma studies where we saw these clear-cut effects on FEV1 and even on loss of asthma control and dramatic responses in AD of course, you had a much higher degree of confidence. COPD is I think much tougher. It's worth looking at, but we wouldn't rank this as something with a high degree of confidence.
George Yancopoulos: Yes, I think what Len is alluding to is that COPD is a very complex disease. And the problem is that in the real world, the data suggests that it is indeed quite complicated in terms of it's impacted by asthma and type-2 diseases. And so, there are a lot of patients who have COPD whose diseases worsen with these related type-2 toxicity. The problem is finding the right patients to treat, and also negotiating with the FDA, who likes to study cleaner diseases. So I think as Len said, it's going to be, it can be a complicated story and we'll see what the data says.
Mark Hudson: Operator, next question?
Operator: From Barclays, we have Geoff Meacham. Please go ahead.
Greg Harrison: Hi this is Greg Harrison on for Geoff. Thanks for taking our question. Could you tell us maybe a little more about your overall strategy in the complement space, and what type of differentiation do you think you'd need to see with fasinumab [ph] to make it competitive in PNF for that efficacy or dosing convenience? And what other types of additional indications? Could you potentially pursue there? Thanks.
Leonard Schleifer: So I think it's a little bit early to get into that sort of competitive assessment. Obviously, as George mentioned, where we've got the ability to combine that with some iRNA from Alnylam. We're going to be working with them. The potential there might have some unique features. It's just a little early to say where we'll slot it and we'll have to see how the day develops. But obviously, we’re going to look at efficacy. We're going to look at interval etcetera.
Mark Hudson: Operator, next call?
Operator: From SVB Leerink, we have Geoffrey Porges. Please go ahead.
Geoffrey Porges: Thank you very much for taking the question. A couple of quick ones on R&D [ph]. First, George, could you give us a sense of when you might be in a position to make a decision on your NGF program, specifically whether it's go or no go, and whether that might be some savings to the otherwise upward trend in R&D? And then, secondly just to go back on the combination it definitely sounds like you've had a setback on the PD-1 bispecific combination. But what are your thoughts on the PD-1 combination with the [Indiscernible] molecule. How quickly might that advance? Are you concerned about some of the same other immuno toxicity liabilities or else TLF liabilities? Thanks.
Leonard Schleifer: Okay, well first on the NGF. As I mentioned the Independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board gave the go ahead just last week for us to continue with the program. So we they will continue to monitor the study and when we underline the study and so forth, we'll be able to better assess what the efficacy safety ratio is and where the program is going. So that's the story on NGF. I wouldn't necessarily classify the CD20 by CD3 combination with PD-1. As a setback, as I said, I mean, what it really indicates is a pretty dramatic increase in immune activation. As you know of course, these sorts of things were the things that demonstrated excitement in approaches like CAR-T therapies in fact it was noted in many cases that the people who had, the patients had the highest immune activation, had the highest anti-tumor responses. And we think this is likely to be the case in this setting as well. The benefit that we have with the ability to individually titrate and give them in a different sequence, allows us to much better find to the timing of the immune activations and allow us to better take advantage of the immune activation while controlling the potential cytokine-release syndrome. So we actually think it's actually an exciting indicator of combined immuno activation. And so we're very excited both of the combinations of our C3 bispecifics with PD-1, but also CD28 bispecifics of PD-1 and C3 bispecifics with the CD28 bispecifics. All three of those sets of combos are for an incredible exciting set of opportunities that in animal studies have really been game changing. And so we can only hope, that we can achieve the same sort of benefit risk in patients that we're seeing in those settings.
Mark Hudson: Operator, next question please?
Operator: From Morgan Stanley we have Matthew Harrison. Please go ahead.
Matthew Harrison: Hey good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the adjuvant studies that you're running in Libtayo, and maybe just comment how we should think about the data that you have in sarcoma informing those other skin cancer studies, and just your confidence around what we know so far on the molecule about that adjuvant study? Thanks.
Leonard Schleifer: Well, I think in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, obviously the very impactful efficacy that we saw in the latest stage patients gives us a lot of confidence that in the earlier stage patients, as is usually the case with cancer treatment that we'll be seeing even better benefits. And obviously, this increases very substantially the number of patients in those indications who might be able to benefit if our adjuvant and neo adjuvant trials in the cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma produce that sort of data that would be possible based on the data that we've seen the late stage patients. So that will be, I think a very exciting way to increase the benefit to a large number, more of patients. We don't have satisfactory treatments right now, and avoid them progressing to these later and much more debilitating stages. Similarly, in lung cancer, we're excited with our opportunity there in terms of our first line -- first line setting. And of course we're also hoping to move into earlier settings there as well.
Mark Hudson: Operator, next question please?
Operator: From Bank of America, we have Ying Huang. Please go ahead.
Ying Huang: Hi, good morning thanks for taking my question. So you mentioned that the total prescriptions for Dupixent increased 18% quarter-over-quarter. And then, new patients are coming out about right now at 950 per week. Can you provide a living more clarity about the breakdown between the patients coming from adolescence atopic dermatitis versus asthma? Where exactly are you seeing the most growth? Thank you.
Marion McCourt: So, it’s early days. So we're not at this time giving specific breakouts by indication, but I certainly can give you a feel for performance. First as you summarized some of the points that I'd made during the call on NBRx as one measures or new branded scripts on a weekly basis. We are seeing a significant increase when we look at this quarter's rate on a weekly basis of 950 versus prior quarter at about 700 scripts per week, so we're very pleased. What is occurring is we're actually seeing growth in all of our indications, which is a very exciting profile for Dupixent. We continue to help more adult atopic dermatitis patients. So we're seeing growth in that realm. Additionally, as I mentioned during the discussion of the call, we are seeing a very nice start to the launch of asthma, both from a standpoint of Dupixent’s profile, but also from the standpoint of being very competitive to other agents that are currently being used as biologics for the treatment of asthma. And then finally, on the most recent indication for adolescence is one that has been transformational certainly for patients and their families, but also as we hear stories all the time from physicians who are treating these patients. These poor young adolescents you know are very often challenged to participate at school, in their activities, on a daily basis. And we're hearing just wonderful stories on the difference that Dupixent is making for them, so we’re very early in this launch. We’re excited to be helping so many and we see continued growth across atopic dermatitis, asthma and all the various age groups we're now covering.
Mark Hudson: Operator, next question please?
Operator: From Piper Jaffray, we have Chris Raymond. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Alee [Indiscernible] for Chris this morning. Another question on Dupixent. We’ve gotten pretty consistent physician feedback from multiple points that the Dupixent sampling plan was suboptimal at least for dermatologists. So I guess the more recent feedback says that's improved lately. Could you just give us some background or color on your Dupixent sampling plant, especially as additional indications are launching? Thanks.
Marion McCourt: So, you know first I will say that is very important to us that our patients receive Dupixent and physicians have the experience that they need. There are availability of samples in the marketplace today. So as you indicate we do have a sampling program, but we also think it's very important that as patients are initiated on therapy, they're able to stay on therapy and we also have a number of support services that help patients and their prescribing physicians, make sure that patients can navigate payer reimbursement. And once on Dupixent can actually stay on therapy. We believe at this point we have the number of samples correct in the market to support our various indications.
Leonard Schleifer: So let me just amplify on that what Marion just said, because I think it is a tension between wanting to make it as easy as possible for the doctors and patients. On the one hand, on the other hand, the greater good we think of getting foreseeing if you will payers to make decisions, so that everybody can get access. And payers are very sophisticated as one payer said to me, keep it up Len we love those samples, it's like free drug. We'd like you to keep going forever. So there is this tension of forcing payers to make a decision on the one hand and striking the right balance for making it easy for patients to initiate the launch. The number of patients getting on the drug is really quite remarkable. So we think, we've got that balance working.
Mark Hudson: Operator, next question please?
Operator: From BMO, we have Matthew Luchini. Please go ahead.
Matthew Luchini: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to come back to the CRS with 1979, and recognizing what you've said so far. Just wondering if you might be able to put any more color around similarities or differences between the two patients that experience CRS those didn't perhaps in terms of prior -- number of prior lines of therapy, types of therapy, if they were both seen in FL or DLBCL, for example? Any other color you can provide would be helpful? Thank you.
George Yancopoulos: Well, maybe I will just start by reminding you that in some ways, this is very analogous to our early experience with CD20xCD3 monotherapy. Those early studies actually with our lowest doses, we actually saw a pretty profound CRS. And what the team didn't realize that we had the ability -- like I said, this is one huge advantage with these biologics, for example, compared to things such as CAR-T therapies that we can literally dial up and dial down the doses and adjust sequences and divide the doses, and we were able to control it. So now as we got to the much higher doses with much higher activities, as Len pointed out, where we're seeing in late-stage patients, high proportions of not only overall response but complete responses, this now comments with much less CRS than we saw in the early days because we learned how to adjust, divide and sequence the dose of the individual therapy. We think that were exactly an analogous situation with the CD20 combination with a PD-1. We're now at much lower doses of the CD20 in combination with the PD-1, but giving it in the way that we had avoided the CRS, we are now seeing it again, which tells us that we have higher immune activation and we're going to just do the same sorts of things that we did by taking advantage of our ability to divide the doses in sequence the regiments and so forth. And we're hoping in the same way that we shared with the bispecific on its own, we will be able to take advantage of this increase immuno activation but avoid the CRS. So we think these are really exciting times. We've seen it before, we got to what we believe now are, as Len said, the actual effective doses in these late-stage patients with monotherapy and we hope will now be able to do the same thing with a combination delivery even more efficacy without having to pay too much of a price in terms of increased toxicity.
Leonard Schleifer: Plus I think, one has to think ahead. We have a lot on the bispecifics. I think as George mentioned earlier, where you're going into some cancers where you don't see very many responses at all. And the notion that you can actually get these enhanced combined immune activations, I think is as important for these other programs as it is to 1979. We're actually you do quite fine as you get up to much higher doses, so I think this is – has really potentially profound implications for our other programs.
Matthew Luchini: Very good point.
Mark Hudson: Operator, next question please?
Operator: From Baird, we have Brian Skorney. Please go ahead.
Brian Skorney: Hey good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. Bob, maybe just kind of characterize when we look at earnings going ahead is a little bit of a retrenchment on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter compared to last year. And I know you guys don't provide bottom line guidance, but just maybe kind of from a target perspective, do you see 2019 as a year of EPS growth. And do you think it's just kind of a onetime items given a little drag or should we kind of expect 2019 to be more flattish, and look towards 2020 and beyond to see a return to growth?
Bob Landry: Yes Brian. So thanks. So we're not going to give guidance on this call with regard EPS. It's just not what we've done previously, and we tried to highlight with regards to gives and takes during the first quarter. I mean, certainly with regards to our cost of collaboration manufacturing calling out the Delta, which was a big increase year-over-year. We don't talk much about our supply chain other than saying we think it's best-in-class. These are very difficult antibodies that we continue to make. You know sometimes things like that happen. With regards to R&D, our guidance holds. We raised the lower end of our guidance, but that's because of the Alnylam transaction that we're going to execute in the middle of second quarter. We're taking on initiations and upon doing that there'll be payments to Alnylam. So we still are comfortable with regards to where we are from our guidance point of view. I will say expenses in Q1 from R&D came in a little harder than usual, but for the rest of the year we still feel comfortable with the guidance levels we've provided previously.
Leonard Schleifer: I mean, I do think to remind us a bit. The way we see the business, the top line are the products that have come out of Regeneron are continuing to grow, and the expenses are growing primarily because the research organization is just so dug on productive. I think it was mentioned that we put maybe four or five molecules in the clinic last year. We expect to put a similar number this year, and we have a steady flow projected for the year for 2020 and beyond. So with that, obviously we feel we should be investing in our research, because we think it has the potential to deliver a great return.
Mark Hudson: Operator, we’ll take one last question?
Operator: And from Cantor Fitzgerald, we have Alethia Young. Please go ahead.
Alethia Young: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Just one on Alnylam, I wanted you guys talk a little bit more about how you're thinking about using this platform technology versus the antibodies? And also I think you might go after larger or more rare opportunities and just your general perspective on the platform? Well thanks.
Leonard Schleifer: Yes. Well, we have enormous hope that Alnylam is going to be transformational opportunity. Why? Because both sides bring, I think a lot of unique and very exciting capabilities to the table. We've been obviously doing a lot of biology and genetics particularly in the eye and also in the CNS that we haven't really talked about, and most, if not the vast majority of the targets there are intracellular targets, and obviously Alnylam has the capability with their technology to start addressing some of these intracellular targets in these two spaces that are challenging with other approaches. And so this allows us to take advantage of our genetics, all the information coming out of our regeneration genetics and or all the biology we've been doing, all the animal modeling that we've been doing, and now take advantage of them with a whole new platform, not antibodies that as you know are limited to extracellular targets, secretive proteins and cell surface receptors, but an assortment of intracellular targets that we now think we can address both in the eye and CNS and address a whole new series of diseases where we have enormous knowledge and capability based on our genetics and a biology effort. So it's really coming together I think, two great likeminded companies, with very complementary approaches that we think together we can really make a difference particularly in these spaces.
Mark Hudson: Operator, this concludes today's call. Thank you everyone for joining. Again, Bob Landry, Jim Markowitz, and the IR team will be around to answer any further questions. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-02-06 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Paulette and I will be your operator for today’s call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mark Hudson, Senior Manager, Investor Relations. You may begin.
Mark Hudson: Thank you, Paulette. Good morning, and welcome to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals’ fourth quarter 2018 conference call. An archive of this webcast will be available on our website for 30 days under Events. Joining me on the call today are Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; Dr. George Yancopoulos, Founding Scientist, President and Chief Scientific Officer; Marion McCourt, Senior Vice President and Head of Commercial; and Bob Landry, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks, we'll open the call for Q&A. I would also like to remind you that remarks made on this call today include forward-looking statements about Regeneron. Such statements may include, but are not limited to, those related to Regeneron and its products and business, financial forecast and guidance, development programs and related anticipated milestone, collaborations, finances, regulatory matters, intellectual property, pending litigation, and competition. Each forward-looking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected in that statement. A more complete description of these and other material risks can be found in Regeneron’s filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, including its Form 10-K for the quarter ended December 31, 2018, which we plan to file with the SEC tomorrow. Regeneron does not undertake any obligation to update publicly, any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. In addition, please note that the GAAP and non-GAAP measures will be discussed in today’s call. Information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP is available in our financial results press release, which can be accessed on our website. Once our call concludes, Bob Landry, Jay Markowitz and the IR team will be available to answer further questions. With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.
Leonard Schleifer: Thank you, Mark, and good morning to everyone, who has joined us on today's call and webcast. 2018 marked Regeneron's 30th year anniversary and it was a remarkable year for the company. We are pleased with our pipeline progress, our commercial execution and our financial results. And we remain true to our founding mission of inventing important new medicines for patients in need. EYLEA, the market-leading anti-VEGF therapy approved across a range of retinal disease, continues to grow. 2018 U.S. net product sales were $4.08 billion, an increase of 10% year-over-year. And 2018 global EYLEA product sales totaled $6.7 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year. We continue to invest in retinal diseases and are pursuing new indications new formulations and new molecular entities. We have a PDUFA date in May for diabetic retinopathy without diabetic macular edema, or DME, and our submission was based upon our Phase 3 PANORAMA trial, in which we were able to reduce vision-threatening complications of diabetes. In 2018, we made progress fulfilling Dupixent's pipeline in a product promise by showing efficacy in additional diseases and patient populations. The clinical data continue to support our scientific hypotheses that Dupixent targets the molecular drivers of allergic and atopic deceases. In its first approved indication adult atopic dermatitis, Dupixent is now annualizing above $1 billion in net product sales in the United States alone. George and Marion will provide more detail, but let me emphasize that we are still in the early stages of the Dupixent opportunity with hopefully many more launches in new diseases, geographies and age groups. Finally, despite the remarkable accomplishments in the nascent field of immuno-oncology most cancer patients still don't benefit from this approach. We believe that the comprehensive and differentiated strategy that George outlined for you at the JPMorgan Conference is already beginning to deliver on its potential: to bring the hope and promise of immuno-oncology to many more patients. In September 2018, Libtayo became the third FDA-approved PD-1 antibody and the first FDA-approved therapy for the treatment of advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. In December at the 2018 American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting or ASH, we presented new data for REGN1979 our wholly-owned CD20xCD3 bispecific, which we are advancing this year into potentially registrational studies. We simplified and amended our immuno-oncology discovery agreement with our collaborator Sanofi. In the new agreement, we will continue to collaborate on the Libtayo as well as our MUC16xCD3 and BCMAxCD3 bispecific antibody programs. For the rest of our immuno-oncology programs including our co-stimulatory bispecifics Regeneron retains exclusive rights. In summary, in 2018 we continue to build upon the foundation that we established over the last 30 years, which positions us for future continued success as an innovative biotechnology company. And as I said at JPMorgan after 30 years all of us at Regeneron feel that we are just getting started. With that, I will now turn the call over to George.
George Yancopoulos: Thank you, Leonard, and good morning to everyone. I'd like to begin with our efforts to continue to expand and optimize the benefits provided to patients by EYLEA. As a reminder, in September of 2018, the FDA accepted our supplemental BLA for diabetic retinopathy with an action date of May 13, 2019. This potential label expansion to include patients with diabetic retinopathy without DME coupled with our existing approval in DME puts EYLEA on the forefront of treating diabetic eye diseases. Let me emphasize data from our Phase 3 PANORAMA study in diabetic retinopathy. In addition to anatomic improvement, we have for the first time shown that EYLEA can reduce vision-threatening complications in people who have diabetic retinopathy. Contrary to the perception of some that diabetic retinopathy is a slowly evolving condition, our PANORAMA study demonstrated that patients with moderately severe or severe diabetic retinopathy may progress rapidly developing vision-threatening complications or new onset DME. With more than 40% of the overall patient population suffering from these events and more than 50% of the patients in the severe category certainly showing the high risk that these patients are under. In the overall patient population, EYLEA reduced these events by more than 75%. In patients with -- in any case more complete data on the 52-week Phase 3 PANORAMA study will be presented in Angiogenesis Meeting on Saturday and has been submitted to the FDA. It is remarkable that despite many attempts to improve upon the efficacy of VEGF blockade for retinal disease based on the data we have seen no other mechanism has proven more beneficial and no other drug can have that pivotal trials has shown superior visual acuity compared to EYLEA, but we aren't standing still. Our goal is to further advance the treatment of retinal diseases. Later this year, we will begin clinical development of a higher-dose formulation of aflibercept to determine whether it can safely provide improved efficacy and longer-lasting benefit. In addition, we are actively developed a new molecular entities, which we may advance to clinical trials as soon as this year. And we are in the earlier stages of development for the gene therapies and other noble approaches. I'd now like to turn to Dupixent. Our own clinical study support decades of basic science suggesting the target of Dupixent that is interleukin-4 interleukin-13 signaling is a fundamental driver of type two inflammation common to many allergic or atopic deceases. This scientific insight underlies, the basis of why many believe Dupixent is a pipeline in the product. Following our FDA approval for adult atopic dermatitis in 2017 and our approval in asthma at the end of last year, we are anticipating three important upcoming regulatory milestones for Dupixent. First, a decision by the FDA in adolescent atopic dermatitis, with an action date of March 13, 2019; second an EMA decision in the first half of the year on asthma in adults and adolescents; and third potential FDA acceptance of the supplemental BLA for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis based on two overwhelmingly positive Phase 3 studies. As Dupixent potentially expands into adolescence with atopic dermatitis, it is important to remember, how serious and devastating this disease can be. The teenage years are hard enough without debilitating skin condition and may impact self image lead and the ability to concentrate in school. Most of the patients in our trials are disease covering over half their bodies. And patients have described the accompanying itch as similar to unrelenting poison ivy that never goes away. As measured by EZ score, Dupixent reduce the extensive severity of skin lesions by an average of 60% to 70%, with significant improvements in other measures including itch. Beyond, its potential approval in adolescence, we hope to bring the benefit of Dupixent to even younger AD patients. In this year, we expect to report results of the Phase 3 trial in patients aged 6 to 11 years. Turning to Dupixent in asthma. We are anticipating approval in the EU and Japan later this year. U.S. asthma launch is under way and it's particularly gratifying to see good early uptake among allergists, who have had prior experience in Dupixent for patients with atopic dermatitis. You will hear more about the asthma launch from Marion. It is widely appreciated for patients with serious allergic diseases. Our trials demonstrate substantial level of co-morbid conditions in individual patients. For example, in our adolescent atopic dermatitis trials more than 50% had asthma as well, and more than 60% to 70% had another allergic condition such as food allergy or inhaled allergies. Many believe that allergic atopic diseases is a systemic condition driven by immune imbalance due to the Type 2 inflammation, which manifests itself to different degrees in different parts of the body in different patients. Consistent with this viewpoint and with our own emerging clinical data, we're exploring multiple potential new allergic or atopic conditions for Dupixent. As I mentioned previously, we have a pending supplementary BLA for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis. In addition, we have recently initiated Phase 2/3 study of dupilumab in patients and adolescents with eosinophilic esophagitis. The Phase 2 study in collaboration with Aimmune Therapeutics of dupilumab in peanut allergy were we have complete enrollment in Phase 2 study for grass allergy. We'll update you in the future about new trials and new indications. We view our interleukin-33 program as a potential complement to Dupixent. We are studying REGN3500, our interleukin-33 antibody both as monotherapy as well as in combination with Dupixent in several indications including asthma, atopic dermatitis and COPD. We will report results of the Phase 2 study in asthma in 2019. Two Phase 2 studies in atopic dermatitis were recently initiated: an anti-interleukin-33 monotherapy dose response study and a combination study with Dupixent. While it is unlikely that interleukin-33 blockade alone will provide the degree of benefit observed with Dupixent, our program is designed to capture any potential incremental benefit that may result from the combination. Moving on now to our immuno-oncology portfolio. We recently unveiled what we believe is a rational and comprehensive immuno-oncology strategy with our PD-1 antibody Libtayo at its foundation. In September of 2018, Libtayo the third FDA-approved anti-PD-1 became the first FDA-approved treatment of any kind for advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or CSCC. Outside the United States, the European Medicine Agency is reviewing our regulatory application and we expect a decision later this year. To maximize the substantial Libtayo opportunity in dermatoencology, we will be commencing adjuvant studies in CSCC in the first half of 2019 with new adjuvant studies to follow. And we are studying Libtayo in other skin cancers that we believe will have a benefit. Beyond dermatoencology, we consider non-small cell lung cancer been major potential indication for Libtayo. Our Phase 3 program in non-small cell lung cancer is building on the rapidly evolving treatment paradigm. As we stated previously, we have doubled the size of our trial comparing Libtayo monotherapy to chemotherapy in PD-L1-high patients. Regard in combinations, we'll be focusing our efforts in first-line treating and combination therapy of Libtayo with chemotherapy. The ongoing Phase 3 combination study is being augmented to enroll non-small cell lung cancer patients irrespective of histology and the levels of PD-L1 expression and to randomize to Libtayo plus chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone. Amazingly enough despite the years of effort in many pivotal trials there's only one PD-1 or PD-L1 antibody approved as monotherapy in first-line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. If our ongoing trials succeed, we have the potential to be the second. Unfortunately for patients even in tumor settings with some response, the majority of patients still do not benefit from PD-1 blockade. Moreover, little benefit has been demonstrated with PD-1 and PD-L1 blockade or any other immunotherapy in many of the most common tumor types such as prostate, pancreatic, colorectal and breast. This honestly is an important area of unmet need. As you heard me say recently, we are excited about our bispecific franchise. And in particular two classes: the CD3 bispecifics and the costimulatory bispecifics. We believe that these bispecifics may have important anticancer activity on their own and in combinations that can include the Libtayo have the potential to extend the benefits of the immunotherapy in both immunoresponsive tumors as well as thus far immuno-unresponsive tumor types. Many of our CD3 bispecifics are already in the clinic with one of them showing impressive initial results as a monotherapy in very-advanced late-stage patients. In December of 2018 at ASH, we presented the exciting data from REGN1979 our CD20xCD3 bispecific for B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma or NHL. At doses we are considering for potential pivotal trials, treating these patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma resulted in a 100% objective response rate and an 80% complete response rate. Nine out of 10 patients maintained their response during treatment. And the one patient who progressed did so in the setting of prolonged treatment interruption. At higher doses, we're also seeing increases in the response rates in the harder-to-treat relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or DLBCL. And are approaching the level of response reported with CAR-Ts. Based on our emerging data, in 2019 we're planning to initiate potential pivotal studies with our CD20xCD3 bispecific for third-line follicular lymphoma as well as DLBCL. Our second CD3 bispecific antibody to enter clinical development targets MUC16 for ovarian cancer. The MUC16 epitope that we target is the remaining nub of membrane-bound protein that when shed is known as CA125, the well-known biomarker for ovarian cancer. And our BCMAxCD3 bispecific antibody has just entered clinical development for the treatment of multiple myeloma. We're encouraged by preliminary results of both CAR-T as well as BiTEs targeting BCMA in multiple myeloma and believe that our BCMAxCD3 bispecific has a potential of being an important addition in this new area. We recently announced that we're introducing to the clinic an entirely new class of bispecifics which we term costimulatory bispecifics. Compelling data in our animal models indicate that this new class of bispecific can enhance the anticancer benefit when combined with our PD-1 antibody as well as with our CD3 class of bispecifics. This year we will be introducing two of these costimulatory bispecifics into the clinic. We entered the field of immuno-oncology with a long-term and comprehensive addition. We have created a large number of rational combination opportunities, enabled by the mixing and matching of our technology platforms and capabilities. There are settings like advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma for Libtayo and advanced relapsed refractory Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma for REGN1979, where our antibodies have demonstrated an impressive single agent activity in the clinical trials. In many other settings, however, monotherapy is unlikely to be enough. This is where our combination strategy comes into play. And to supplement our internal efforts, we have collaborations and companies like bluebird that our therapeutic modality is potential synergistic with those that we have in-house. Let me change gears now to fasinumab, our antibody to nerve growth factor, or NGF, the chronic pain from osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. I want to highlight two key points regarding our ongoing program. First, as we reported in August, fasinumab continued to show good efficacy in our latest Phase 3 study. At week 16 the study met both co-primary endpoints and all key secondary endpoints. We believe that we may have identified the minimally effective dose that may mitigate treatment associated arthropathies in total joint replacement that have been observed at higher doses and are the major safety concern this class. With each day that goes by, we've got safety signals stopping the Phase 3 studies, we are just one step closer to bringing this drug to the many people who are now suffering and sometimes seek alternative treatments such as opioids. I've given you just a few updates about some of the seven Regeneron-discovered drugs that are now approved and 16 additional drug candidates in our clinical pipeline. We don't have time in our prepared remarks to discuss them all, we were happy to take questions during the Q&A. Before I close, I would like to highlight that the Regeneron Genetics Center has recently sequenced its 500,000 individual on top of this major accomplishment, our goal is to sequence another 0.5 million people in 2019. These genetic sequences are all linked to detailed electronic medical records. Along with our collaborators like Geisinger Health System and the UK Biobank’s and with funding from our colleagues in the biopharmaceutical industry, we are amassing what would be the world's largest big data human sequencing resource, which is making a significant contribution to a drug discovery and development efforts. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marion.
Marion McCourt: Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start with EYLEA. For the fourth quarter U.S. EYLEA net product sales grew 11% year-over-year to $1.08 billion and for the full year 2018 U.S. EYLEA sales grew 10% to $4.08 billion. EYLEA sales growth resulted from an increase in demand and not from price. Based on U.S. net product sales EYLEA continues to be the market leader with 72% of the overall branded U.S. anti-VEGF market in the fourth quarter. We continue to see overall market growth in both wet AMD and DME driven by the aging population increase in diabetes prevalence and physician preference for EYLEA. Approximately 90% of patients across all peer segments can access EYLEA as their first line of therapy. Regeneron will continue to stay engaged with stakeholders in order to preserve physician choice and patient access to EYLEA and its significant clinical benefits. Building on our leadership position and wet AMD and diabetic eye disease, we see a major growth opportunity for EYLEA in diabetic retinopathy without DME. The PDUFA date for this new indication is May 13th. As a reminder of the estimated 3.5 million people in the U.S. with diabetic retinopathy without DME approximately one million individuals have moderately severe or severe disease and are at greatest risk for progression in loss of vision. We believe the PANORAMA results that George discussed support early intervention with EYLEA and may help evolve the clinical treatment paradigm. Pending approval of EYLEA in this indication comprehensive plans are in place to support disease education focused on the benefits of early treatment. We also remain on track to launch EYLEA prefilled syringe in 2019 pending regulatory approval. Turning now to Dupixent. Local net product sales in the fourth quarter were $319 million and in the U.S. alone reached $259 million, representing 18% quarter-over-quarter growth, and 89% year-over-year. Prescriber experience and depth continued to improve with approximately 14% health care providers having prescribed Dupixent and over 46,000 patients have received therapy. There is a notable increase in Dupixent prescribing trends with weekly new-to-brand prescriptions or NBRx increasing to between 750 and 850 patients per week compared to approximately 500 to 600 per week in earlier quarters. We attribute our robust fourth quarter performance to patient and physician experience our overall promotional campaign, field force impact, national branded television advertisement for atopic dermatitis, and the asthma launch. On October 19th, the FDA-approved Dupixent's second major U.S. indication in moderate-to-severe asthma in patients aged 12 years and older with an eosinophilic phenotype or with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma. We expect a regulatory decision in the EU and Japan in the first half of this year. Three months into the U.S. asthma launch, we're encouraged by the early uptake in prescriber interest. Our goal is for Dupixent to be the preferred first-line biologic for indicated patients with moderate-to-severe asthma. At this point, in the launch, we estimate that over two-thirds of Dupixent asthma patients are new to biologics. Allergists and pulmonologists recognize the benefits of Dupixent's differentiated clinical profile as the first and only biologic that targets two key cytokines central to Type 2 inflammation. Dupixent is also differentiated on its efficacy and exacerbations on lung function, establish safety profile and flexibility as the only asthma biologic to offer self or at-home administration. In addition, we would like to emphasize the positive impact of allergists familiarity with Dupixent for their atopic dermatitis patients. Currently, a majority of our prescriptions are coming from the specialty. We look forward to providing insight on the asthma launch in the coming months. Additionally, we believe that substantial opportunity remains in atopic dermatitis. To-date, despite the impressive market experience that I described less than 15% of adult AD patients in greatest need have received Dupixent therapy. We expect further U.S. growth if the FDA approves Dupixent in adolescence ages 12 to 17 on our March 11 PDUFA date. As a reminder, we estimate that the number of potential adolescent patients is about half of the target adult atopic dermatitis population. Further, we expect data from our pediatric study in atopic dermatitis ages 6 to 11 in 2019. I'd now like to turn to Libtayo, which was launched in the U.S. on October 1, as the first FDA-approved treatment for patients with metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma or local advanced disease who are not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation. In the EU, we expect a decision later in 2019. In the U.S., fourth quarter net product sales were $15 million, driven by demand. This launch we've made in-roads in establishing Libtayo is a standard of care across all lines of therapy in advanced CSCC. Engagement with the medical community remains very positive, especially with medical oncologists and most surgeons. We quickly established broad market access in the reimbursement coverage for Libtayo, with approximately 95% of total commercial, Medicare and Medicaid lives covered. We believe that significant opportunities remain to increase Libtayo usage both for first-line and second-line treatment under our approved indication. As a reminder, CSCC is a life-threatening condition responsible for an estimated 7,000 U.S. deaths each year. Based on demographics and enhancements in patient identification referrals, we expect the number of newly diagnosed patients to rise annually. Now to Praluent. Global net product sales in the fourth quarter were $93 million, including $60 million in the U.S. In 2018, we made strides to remove access and affordability barriers. And we continue to engage with key stakeholders to drive demand. As a reminder, this market is highly impacted by discounting and contracting, which may affect net sales. As noted last quarter, we've submitted data from the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial to regulatory authorities in the EU and in the U.S. Earlier this week, we announced a positive CHMP opinion for the proposed indication in Europe. And in the U.S., the FDA target action date is April 28, 2019. Moving to Kevzara. Global net product sales in the fourth quarter were $35 million including $27 million in the U.S. as demand improved. Within the IL-6 subcutaneous class, Kevzara now has 38% of dispensed NBRx share and 23% of TRx share. Kevzara has reimbursement coverage for 98% of U.S. commercial lives with 79% of patients able to access Kevzara as either first-line biologic or after failing one or two other biologic therapies. I'll now turn the call over to Bob.
Bob Landry: Thank you, Marion, and good morning to everyone on the call today. Regeneron delivered record financial results during the fourth quarter of 2018 and completed a year of strong financial performance. For the fourth quarter, non-GAAP diluted net income per share grew 31% to $6.84 on non-GAAP net income of $786 million. And for the full-year, non-GAAP diluted net income per share grew 40% to $22.84 on non-GAAP net income of $2.62 billion. Total revenues were $1.93 billion for the fourth quarter and $6.71 billion for the full year 2018 which represented 22% growth versus fourth quarter 2017 and 14% growth versus full year 2017. For the fourth quarter of 2018, revenue growth continue to be driven by global sales of EYLEA and a significant increase in Sanofi collaboration revenue due to lower losses from the commercialization of antibodies and the recording of a cumulative catch-up adjustment to revenue, principally due to the amendment of the immuno-oncology discovery and development agreement. For the fourth quarter of 2018, global net product sales of EYLEA were $1.8 billion, an increase of 12% year-over-year. For the full year, global EYLEA net product sales were $6.75 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year. In our reported U.S. EYLEA results, distributor inventory experienced a slight increase in the fourth quarter of 2018 as compared to the third quarter of 2018, yet remained within our normal 1- to 2-week targeted range. Ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales recorded by our collaborator Bayer were $724 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 representing a 14% reported and an 18% operational or constant-currency basis increase year-over-year. For the full year of 2018, Ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales were $2.67 billion and grew 20% on a reported basis and 18% on an operational basis as compared to the full year of 2017. Total Bayer collaboration revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $302 million of which $271 million was derived from our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. The $271 million represents year-over-year reported growth of 17% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. For full year 2018, total Bayer collaboration revenue was $1.08 billion. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $428 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 and $1.11 billion for the full year of 2018. The increase in Sanofi collaboration revenue in the fourth quarter and full year 2018 versus the prior periods in 2017 was primarily due to increased spend and thus reimbursement for Libtayo clinical development activities, lower losses associated with the commercialization of antibodies and the recording of a cumulative catch-up adjustment to revenue of $149 million, primarily in connection with the amendment of the immuno-oncology discovery and development agreement. Under the terms of the amended immuno-oncology discovery and development agreement, Sanofi paid the company $462 million which included the reimbursement of fourth quarter 2018 Regeneron incurred research and development costs of $46 million, the prepayment of $120 million for development activities for two bispecific programs, BCMAxCD3 and MUC16xCD3 in a termination payment. Revenue associated with the cumulative catch-up is recorded in the other line item of the Sanofi collaboration revenue reported in table four of our press release. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we recognized a loss of $44 million in connection with the commercialization of products under the antibody license and collaboration agreement with Sanofi, which compares favorably to a loss of $114 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. But as anticipated, this quarter's loss was slightly higher than the $39 million loss from the third quarter of 2018. The lower share loss versus the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily attributable to higher global net product sales of Dupixent and to a lesser extent Praluent and KEVZARA, continued cost containment for Praluent, partly offset by an increase in Dupixent commercialization expenses to support the launch in asthma and ongoing global launches in atopic dermatitis. As we've discussed on our November 2018 earnings conference call, we continue to expect the Alliance's financial results remain variable for the next few quarters as we incur launch expenses for new indications, including a potential label expansion for adolescent patients aged 12 to 17 with atopic dermatitis and launches into new international markets. Turning now to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $533 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 and $1.96 billion for full year 2018 as compared to $444 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $1.78 billion for the full year 2017. The fourth quarter 2018 increase in non-GAAP R&D expense was the result of an increase in Libtayo clinical cost and higher overall R&D headcount and facilities-related costs, partly offset by a decrease in Dupixent and Praluent development costs. Our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense which is calculated as the total non-GAAP R&D expense, less R&D reimbursements from our collaborators, was $347 million for the fourth quarter 2018 compared to $265 million for the fourth quarter 2017. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by our share of higher immuno-oncology clinical cost and R&D activities associated with the growing number of wholly-owned programs. For year 2018, non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense was $1.22 billion. Our press release includes all the information required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense. For 2019, we are reaffirming our previously provided guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to be in the range of $1.59 billion to $1.71 billion. The increase in our 2019 non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D guidance as compared to full year 2018 is primarily attributable to higher clinical trial and manufacturing costs to support Regeneron's wholly-owned programs, including four to six new molecules expected to be advanced into the clinic in 2019 and lower Sanofi reimbursement as a result of the amended immuno-oncology discovery and development agreement. Next. Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $411 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 and $1.36 billion for the full year 2018. As noted, on our November 2018 earnings call, we realized a higher SG&A spend level in the fourth quarter of 2018 as compared to the first three quarters of 2018, primarily due to incremental spent for Dupixent, including DTC in the U.S. asthma launch, EYLEA, the launch of Libtayo, as well as higher contributions to independent not-for-profit patient-assisting organizations. We reaffirm our previous 2019 guidance for non-GAAP SG&A expense to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion. The increase in our guidance compared to full year 2018 is primarily driven by increased spend for Dupixent, EYLEA and Libtayo. Dupixent's increased spend will be focused on the recent U.S. launch of asthma, the expected U.S. launch in atopic dermatitis for adolescent patients and continued support for the atopic dermatitis indication for adults including DTC. 2019 EYLEA spend increases will be focused on capitalizing on potential new growth opportunity of EYLEA in diabetic retinopathy without DME as explained earlier by Marion and increased patient support programs. Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses a line item found within Sanofi collaboration revenue was $127 million for the fourth quarter 2018 and $426 million for the full year of 2018. We reaffirm our full year 2019 guidance of Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses to be in the range of $510 million and $560 million. Turning now to taxes. Our effective tax rate was negative 21% and positive 4% for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 respectively as compared to 69% and 42% for the fourth quarter and full year 2017. The effective tax rate for both the fourth quarter and full year 2018 was positively impacted primarily by the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the sale of non-inventory-related assets between foreign subsidiaries that was finalized at the end of 2018. Remember, the 2017 effective tax rate was negatively impacted by the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as we had to write-down certain deferred tax assets due to a lower Federal tax rate. In the fourth quarter 2018, we finalized our assessment of the remeasurement of our net deferred tax asset due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and elected to recognize deferred taxes for global intangible low tax income primarily referred to as guilty. The net tax impact from both the remeasurement of our net deferred tax asset and sale of non-inventory-related assets have been excluded from both fourth quarter and full year 2018 non-GAAP net income as outlined within table three of our press release. We continue to monitor regulatory guidance under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and changes in the global tax environment and will respond as appropriate to ensure our tax strategy is efficient and aligned with our business operations. We are reaffirming our 2019 guidance for our effective tax rate to be in the range of 14% to 16%. I want to remind you that as in prior years, we will have volatility from quarter-to-quarter in our tax rate due to the timing of deductions for stock-based compensation. Turning next to cash flow and the December 31, 2018 balance sheet. Regeneron ended the fourth quarter of 2018 with cash and marketable securities of $4.6 billion. And generated free cash flow in excess of $1.8 billion for full year 2018. We calculate free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures for the full year 2018 were $383 million. We are reaffirming our previous 2019 capital expenditure guidance of between $410 million and $490 million. With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Mark.
Mark Hudson: Thank you, Bob. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open up the call for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Ying Huang: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. First question on EYLEA, obviously you're waiting for FDA approval in diabetic retinopathy. Can you tell us whether you do think that's going to be a significant growth driver for 2019? Or do you think we should EYLEA -- we should expect EYLEA to provide market growth rate? And then maybe you can comment on the net pricing trend in 2019 for EYLEA as well? Secondly, can you talk about Dupixent outlook? Do you believe the asthma indication will start to be a more important growth driver versus atopic dermatitis for 2019? Thank you.
Leonard Schleifer: Okay. So thanks for the questions, Ying. On the issue of whether or not diabetic retinopathy is going to be a growth driver in 2019? I think it will be in the early stages of the launch that indication. It's going to think a lot of patient education because it's a paradigm shift. So we don't give guidance, but from a general point of view, I think is going to take some time to develop that market. Pricing trends, I'm not sure what you're getting at. Whether you're talking about external forces or not? But our price has been marked very modestly impacted to the negative side, based upon a slight discount that was provided across the board in 2018. And in terms of asthma, Marion?
Marion McCourt: I am happy to comment on asthma. So I gave you some information today on what is very early in the launch and favorable indicators. As I look at your question on asthma growth opportunities for the future, we do see that as very important. It's not the only Dupixent growth driver asthma describe the atopic dermatitis growth opportunity in adults and with FDA approval potentially with the adolescents this year. But back to your question on asthma, what's most interesting in these early stages of launch is the response that we're hearing from both allergists and pulmonologists to the differentiating profile of Dupixent. Both in terms of its clinical efficacy, the established safety profile and then also there's very, very important factor of patients being able to self administer or at home administer, that coupled with the fact that for some of these physicians, they're treating patients that have co-morbidities such as when other Type II diseases occur with asthma. So again it's very early days, but we feel good about the early launch. And I look forward to giving updates in the future. I'll also remind, just in terms of size of patient population for asthma biologics, it's about a 1 million patients. But to-date only about 100,000 patients have been treated, eligible asthma patients with Biologics. So it is a market with tremendous opportunity.
Mark Hudson: Operator next question?
Bob Landry: I'd like to just add to Len's point in response to the contribution in diabetic retinopathy market opportunity. I don't want to address the market opportunity specifically, but very importantly about whether this should really be paradigm shifting and whether or not there should really be a new way of treating patients? And I think that looking at the data, physicians are going to have make their decisions. But there is a lot of very important outcomes from our study. Number one is already mentioned. That the rates of visions threatening complications in progression in people who have moderate and particularly severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy is I think much higher than most people thought. Once people progress, treatment at that point we know, is probably not going to be as good as prevention. And I think it's a very important question now asked in terms of physicians in the entire community, should we be working harder to prevent onsets of the diseases and loss of vision that you may never get back? And in this particular case, is a little bit of prevention really worthwhile for the so many patients who are in a such high risk? And I think that something that the community I'm sure is going to be debating strongly especially when all this data is comes out and it is digested and is discussed.
Mark Hudson: Operator, next question please?
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Raymond from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Chris Raymond: Hey. Thanks. Just a – maybe a couple of pipeline questions. So first just on the CD20 costimulatory bispecifics. IgG antibodies have had some challenges I guess in the solid tumor setting due to the physiologic and physical properties of these tumors. So your bispecifics maintain an IgG-like structure. I guess, can you maybe talk about some of the properties of these antibodies that may allow for better tumor penetration? And how you going to be maybe little bit more descriptive of that as we get into the clinic with these two? And then, also maybe on your C5 antibody 3918, I think in your press release you talked about initiating a Phase 2 trial in PNH. But Len, I think I've heard you say last month in San Francisco that enrolling a switching study from eculizumab might be a challenge. So maybe any color there as to the plan just targeted at new patients or some other strategy? And maybe if there is some other complement-mediated disease that may make sense as well. Thanks.
Leonard Schleifer: So it's a highly competitive space. So we're not going to get too much into our thinking on C5. But as we get down the road, I think our strategy will emerge. I'm going to let George of course deal with the CD28 question.
George Yancopoulos: Yeah I think there's a whole field of pseudoscience that somehow seems to think that the problem with getting responses in solid tumors have something to do with antibodies not having access. Actually, if one really looks carefully and objectively at all the data, if anything there is better access to the tumor immune blood vessels become actually more permeable and leaky in the levels of natural antibodies as well as administering antibodies is actually much higher in those settings. So that has nothing to do with our strategy or our approach. Our belief and I think the overwhelming science argues that the lack of response to has much more do with very specific immune recognition issues. And that's exactly what our co-stems do. They add another level of activation specifically targeted against tumor which will add to the immunotherapy benefits of either, for example checkpoint inhibitors such as PD-1 or the more conventional CD3 like bispecifics. So it's all about properly manipulating the immune environment to attack the tumor. And the problems have really nothing to do with antibody access and whether you're using a full-length antibody or something that's smaller. And certainly, all you have to due to understand that is look at the performance of our CD3 bispecific compared to for example smaller bites. And that I think – even cross study shows that the activities are really not at all limited by the size of the reagents. And that's about it.
Chris Raymond: Okay. Thank you.
Mark Hudson: In the interest of time, I just want to – as a reminder to ensure that we get to many people as possible. We could just limit the Q&A to one question at this time. Operator, can you please go to the next caller?
Operator: Our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges from SVB Leerink. Please go ahead.
Geoffrey Porges: Thank you very much. And congratulations on both the results and not being mentioned in the safety union last night. I wonder if we could talk a little bit about the cadence through the year, Bob, your revenue and income statement is notoriously hard to model. And you did have quite a few one-time items -- non-recurring items in Q4. Could you give us a sense of how we should be thinking about collaboration revenue through the year? And whether we should expect it to be a step down in revenue in Q1 which is what we've heard about for many of your peers. Thanks very much. You also commented about the cadence or expenses through the year, just so we can try and get our models a little bit more in line with your outlook. Thanks.
Bob Landry: Yeah. Geoff, as you know, I mean, we don't get into that much specifics with regards to the quarterly division on expenses and on revenue. I will say which may not be so evident. With regards to the fourth quarter for Sanofi 2018, right, I mean, we did call out the catch-up adjustment that we’re talking about as a result of amending the I/O discovery agreement. So I think that that's clear. But what I also think didn’t get caught during the year is that we did terminate the I/O – sorry, the antibody discovery agreement at the end of 2017. So for each of my quarters in 2018 as it pertains to Sanofi, I was going up against the 2017 run rate that included $130 million of the antibody discovery agreement that I will not have to go up against in 2019. So when people saw the fourth quarter, sure, the one-time catch-up adjustment was significant. But also, I didn't go up against the 2017 fourth quarter Sanofi antibody development because it had been exhausted by the third quarter of 2017. So, again, a lot of maturations with regards to that. I don't see anything special with regards to how we would break out expenses throughout the year. I mean, we don't have that much seasonal impact. I have been reading the comments that you've said amongst our peers. I do not express to have the kind of the same to same inkling that you've heard from them. And that's what -- that's been put out to the street on it.
Mark Hudson: Operator, next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Terence Flynn: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. The first one is I was just wondering now the common period is closed, would be great to hear your latest thoughts on the Part B demonstration project. If you think the final version will include a provision for EU reference pricing? And if you can't answer that, would love to hear about insight on the Libtayo launch. Maybe just talk a little bit about more about the kind of breadth of prescribing? How many of your target accounts are already prescribing or connect over the course of the year? Thanks.
Leonard Schleifer: So I'll let Marion cover them in on Libtayo and we'll give you your two questions since you guys are so convicted on your opinions about us. We'll anticipate something has got to give regarding the international reference pricing situation, because the public, the administration, myself personally and a lot of people in the industry I think feel and Americans in general feel it's a bit unfair for America to produce all the drugs to its research and development ecosystem and finance it to its financial marketplace and then pay for it for its consumers. And then have a very well-healed European companies get those drugs at a much lower price. The trouble is figuring out a system that can really balance that. And as I've said before when you have a biotechnology companies who have given away the European rights, there is no way to connect those to pricing. You can open it up while you want, but you have different people making pricing decisions. So I think the administration does get that. To the extent that this will force people to give them as I said before courage we'll see. Our sense is a little bit of opposition to the way that has been proposed on the hill, but we have to see how it all come washes out. Marion on the Libtayo?
Marion McCourt: So happy to comment on the Libtayo launch. First and foremost, incredibly important because Libtayo is the first product with the approval that I mentioned earlier this morning on four CSCC patients with metastatic and advanced disease where previously they didn't have a treatment therapy. So we've had great interest. To your question on the targets of our activities. We've certainly seen uptake in appropriate way albeit early in the launch from some of the most prestigious academic centers. And we see that on a geographic basis across the country. Similarly we're also seeing uptake, secondarily in more community, large hospital settings that has sophisticated oncology, and also in some instances move surgeons in their practice. I'd also comment that as we look very carefully at the launch, I reported today on 15 million ex-factory sales, I mentioned that it is demand driven. This is not a product with a lot of inventory building and what we are seeing is that each month we're showing progress in terms of demand for a Libtayo. So early days we're pleased. The payor and access coverage as I mentioned went quickly and was very well managed by our team, so we feel very good about the launch of Libtayo. We're working very hard on it.
Leonard Schleifer: Everybody has their own metrics turns for how launch is going. But the one that I use is when oncologist calls us up and tell us that he had a gentleman who had had a continue squamous cell carcinoma and exhausted all possible treatments including multiple rounds of surgery, maximum radiation therapy, other types of targeted and chemotherapy. And was in the midst of discussion and headed for hospice because the tumor had invaded from the skin deep into his jaw and then to the base of his skull. He wasn't able to eat let alone smile. Heading for hospice to the days after the drug was approved this oncologist had heard about drug and a podcast convinced the patient to try it. And six weeks later, the patient was home for the holidays with a big smile on his face. Those are the source of the anecdote that tell us that this launch is making a difference and will go pretty well. Next question?
Mark Hudson: Operator next question please?
Operator: Our next question comes from Carter Gould from UBS. Please go ahead.
Carter Gould: Good morning. Congrats on the quarter. Question I guess for George or Len. On the bispecific -- on your CD20xCD3, just wanted to kind of get your latest thoughts on those think and specifically if you've nail down the go forward business with those pivotal studies, we recognize you're probably not going to give answers on this call, but just if you've nail those down internally and/or you're still waiting on some of the higher-dose data? Thank you.
Leonard Schleifer: Well, I think as we've indicated and as we've shown in our presentations in follicular lymphoma, the results are so impressive. We certainly think we're in the right dose range. And with the DLBCL, we are now getting the sort of activities that are starting to approach, one might be seeing, with CAR-T-type therapies and so forth. So we certainly think we're in the right sort of dose range. And as we said, we anticipate being able to start pivotal studies in both of those settings this year.
Mark Hudson: Operator, next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Geoff Meacham: Good morning, guys. Thanks a lot for the question. I appreciate it. Bigger picture question. So Libtayo opens up a new therapy area for you guys. But I want to ask about the broader I/O strategy. If rational combos are the main basis, how much of an emphasis does Regeneron place on novel MOAs are targeted, versus evaluating targets, let's say, pharma or others have explored? I'm just trying get a sense for differentiation in the oncology strategy. Thanks.
George Yancopoulos: Well, I think that it's a mix of course. But as you can see from our whole new class of bispecifics the CD28s, we I think are leading a whole new approach that will allow for an entirely new group of combination opportunities. And particularly as we tried to explain, the opportunity to now activate immune responses and activate the ability of checkpoint inhibitors like the PD-1s to actually help in cancers that historically have not been viewed as immune responsive, which is, as you know, the vast majority of them. So we believe and I think a lot of other people now believe that we have one of the most innovative and leading-edge approaches to combination opportunities and that certainly having Libtayo as our foundation, approach is only going to help these novel approaches trying to extend the benefit to many more patients in need.
Leonard Schleifer: And I would add to that Geoff the -- having the multiple approaches such as an approved PD-1 CD20xCD3, the costims that George mentioned and all the others, even some that others may have, under one umbrella one program I think is very powerful and efficient way to be able to move forward.
Mark Hudson: Operator, next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Cory Kasimov: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask you about Dupixent and on the asthma side of things. Curious how you're thinking about kind of future biologic penetration in both the moderate and severe asthma patients kind of sub-populations with the entrance of Dupi and other biologics. I mean, today, it's obviously been pretty modest for other biologics, even in the severe setting. So I'm curious how you see that changing over time. Thanks.
Marion McCourt: So our label, Cory, as you know, includes both moderate and severe patients. It's not unusual that early in a launch we'll probably tend to get some of the type of patients. As I mentioned, we skew a little bit more towards biologic-naive patients, then switches of -- at this point, that have heard discussions of both and see evidence and the data of both. But on – I think we'll have to give it a little time, so I can give you a more robust answer on patient types and uptake of the launch. But certainly, we think the product profile that I've reviewed. In summary, the efficacy, the safety, the ease-of-use and the interest of the two major prescribing audiences of allergists and pulmonologists suggest that we have an important indication and a significant opportunity ahead.
Leonard Schleifer: I think as Marion had mentioned maybe in her prepared remarks, but if not, just to reemphasize, a lot of factors of the allergists had a great experience with DUPI in atopic dermatitis and they might make up the fraction of prescribers. Not necessarily because they are treating patients with comorbid conditions although they can and that's in the label and they very well might. But the fact that they've had experience in another highly allergic disease has been so positive I think that that's having a nice halo effect for us, particularly amongst the allergists.
George Yancopoulos: And just like EYLEA has an opportunity really paradigm shifting in terms of having the opportunity to really change the practice of how you treat high risk diabetic retinopathy patient. I think Dupixent in asthma in particular, but in all of its settings has a real opportunity paradigm shifting, because I think there's increasing appreciation that all of these so-called allergic or atopic disease are really systemic conditions where the body's immune system has gone awry and gone in the wrong direction. And the data is starting to build up that Dupixent is really addressing this systemic probation of the immune system. And as we accumulate more and more data more and more clinical studies and more and more indications this may become increasingly clear and increase the opportunity. This is really a paradigm shifting where you can really change the course of an immune system and how it's gone wrong: by correcting and correcting it in all of its manifestations, not just in one tissue and one organ which is how historically medical community treats diseases. So I think in the long term, Dupixent really has an opportunity a very paradigm shifting in this space as well.
Mark Hudson: Operator, next question please?
Operator: Our next question comes from Adnan Butt from Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.
Adnan Butt: Thanks for the question. Maybe one detail. At this stage, are you able to break out that Dupixent asthma and atopic dermatitis and then the NBRx number Marion that you gave out, is that only for atopic dermatitis? Or is that a combined asthma number?
Marion McCourt: So the numbers that I gave you in NBRx those were combined numbers. And of course, you know the timing of the asthma launch for obviously covering the last couple of months of the year. I don't have specifics for you at this time of NBRx broken out by indication. But as we move further into the launch window and have additional experience, we will probably be able to get some additional insights on what the splits are starting to look like.
Mark Hudson: Operator, we'll take one more question.
Operator: And our last question comes from Robyn Karnauskas from Citi. Please go ahead.
Robyn Karnauskas: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I really appreciate it. So moving to see big picture on the Dupixent, it sounds like people are pretty comfortable there. Can you -- and I get a lot of questions actually of food allergies because its becoming a bigger deal globally and in the United States. What are these trials going to look like? And how do you -- how does this market tend to evolve, because this could be something that could have maybe a quicker uptake versus say asthma. Can you just give us some sense about market that's going to be the next place that you go after EYLEA?
Marion McCourt: Well, I don't know about the market opportunity. For us, it always starts with the science. And I think that if you look at the science and is relating to what I was just talking about before and how all these allergic conditions seem to reflect the systemic probation of the immune system. And interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 seems to be the central drivers of the immune deviations that's leading to this incredible uptake in allergic disease in general and food allergies in particular. And based on our pre-clinical studies and actually a lot of other science as well, these two interleukins could be the central drivers in the whole process. And we believe that there is a possibility that we could be making fundamental difference in the many patients who are suffering from food allergies. And we of course are midst of important study collaborators at immune to explore this. We think that the data from our grass allergy study will also very relevant because desensitization approaches whether they are for food allergies or for aero allergens in some ways depend on the same sort of mechanisms. And we believe Dupixent is right centrally key in those and we'll see what the data shows, because we have these ongoing studies and depending on the data, and if it seems to hold true to the science, it could be important opportunity for so many patients who are suffering for these problems.
Leonard Schleifer: So obviously from our point of view, from the market opportunity we always like to focus on the most severe patients, which is why George mentioned go after or perhaps peanut allergy first or maybe later you go after people who are children who have highly food allergies, having difficulty driving, we certainly are all aware of anecdotes of people on Dupixent who tell us they were allergic to this and they've been taking it for their atopic dermatitis and now they're not. Obviously, that could be wishful thinking, but it's a sort of thing that we want to study. But I do agree you are correct. In the severe up polyallergic – poly-food allergic individual the uptake there could be quite strong. So that's going to become an increasing focus as we get through these initial trials that George referred to grass and peanut, but plenty more to come.
Mark Hudson: Great. Operator, this concludes today's call. Thank you everyone for joining. Again, Bob Landry, Jay Markowitz, and the IR team is here to answer any further questions. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. And you may now disconnect.

With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Thank you. Manisha does such a fabulous job at Investor Relations, we should at least get her name right. It's Manisha Narasimhan. Good morning to everyone who has joined the call. In the third quarter, Regeneron delivered record financial results, an important pipeline progress. EYLEA sales continue to grow. For the first time, U.S. EYLEA net quarterly sales surpassed $1 billion. Also, for the first time, third quarter worldwide Dupixent sales exceeded $0.25 billion. And Dupixent was recently approved for asthma, its second major indication. Additionally, we launched Libtayo, our first approved immuno-oncology therapy. For EYLEA, we significantly strengthened the franchise through a recently expanded label for less frequent dosing and the potential for a new indication in diabetic retinopathy. And we expect to advance a high-dose formulation of aflibercept into the clinic in the first half of next year. Libtayo, our first commercial entry into the exciting and fast-evolving area of immuno-oncology, is the foundation upon which we intend to build with multiple additional agents and approaches in many different cancer settings. We have described Dupixent as a pipeline and a product, and it is living up to that potential. Compared to other approved biologics for asthma, Dupixent has a differentiated profile and label. The recent asthma approval, together with the ongoing robust launch in atopic dermatitis, positive Phase 3 results in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, and positive Phase 2 results in eosinophilic esophagitis, validate the scientific hypothesis that the IL-4/IL-13 pathway is responsible for a spectrum of allergic or Type 2 diseases. You'll hear more from Marion about the launch of Dupixent in asthma and atopic dermatitis, and George will update you on our clinical programs. We have continued to make steady progress with our other commercialized products. From Praluent, our LDL cholesterol-lowering PCSK9 antibody, we anticipate that the U.S. treatment guidelines for lipid lowering will be updated shortly. We hope the updated guidelines will facilitate greater access and support increased use of the PCSK9 class. Although it gets drowned out in the debate about drug prices, the fact remains that cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death in the United States, and high LDL cholesterol is a major cause of cardiovascular disease. Our early pipeline continues to progress. At the beginning of the year, we set a goal of advancing four to six new molecules into clinical development. I'm happy to report that to-date, we have already advanced four new molecules into clinical development. These include a bispecific antibody for ovarian cancer, a new antibody for pain, a leptin receptor agonist, and an antibody to CTLA4. We also expect to advance into the clinic by year-end, a BCMA CD3 bispecific antibody for multiple myeloma. We now have seven approved drugs and our clinical pipeline has 20 product candidates spanning a range of therapeutic areas. All of these molecules were discovered by our scientists. With that, I will now turn the call over to George.
George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Thanks, Len, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin with EYLEA. In August, our supplemental Biological (sic) [Biologics License] (06:00) Application or sBLA was approved for EYLEA dosed every 12 weeks after one year of effective therapy in wet age-related macular degeneration or wet AMD. EYLEA is now the only anti-VEGF drug for the treatment of wet AMD that offers the flexibility to optimally treat patients, regardless of whether they require fixed-interval dosing of 4, 8 or 12 weeks. In September, the FDA accepted our sBLA for EYLEA in diabetic retinopathy with an action date in May 2019. This sBLA was based on the data from the Phase 3 PANORAMA study, which investigated the use of EYLEA in patients with mildly severe to severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy without diabetic macular edema. Positive six-month top line results from PANORAMA were announced in March 2018. Just a couple of weeks ago, we announced positive data from the one-year time point from this same study. On the primary endpoint at one year after initial monthly dosing period, followed by every 8- or every 16-week treatment, 80% and 65% of patients, respectively, experienced a two-step or greater improvement from baseline on the diabetic retinopathy severity scale compared to only 15% of patients receiving sham injections. The results were highly statistically significant, with the p-value less than 0.0001. Regarding the two key secondary endpoints which achieved statistical significance based on the pre-specified hierarchical analysis, compared to sham injection, treatment with EYLEA reduced vision-threatening complications by 82% to 85%, and the development of center-involved diabetic macular edema by 68% to 74%. Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in working age adults in the United States. What is perhaps underappreciated is the rate at which non-symptomatic patients can develop serious complications that threaten their vision. Strikingly, within the first year of PANORAMA, more than one-third of previously asymptomatic diabetic retinopathy patients who were treated with EYLEA went on to develop vision threatening complications or diabetic macular edema. EYLEA markedly reduced these complications and reversed the anatomic severity of the disease. These results underscore the potential value of earlier intervention in diabetic retinopathy. In addition to data from our PANORAMA study, the government-funded Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network is conducting its own Phase 3 study of EYLEA in diabetic retinopathy. This study known as Protocol W is ongoing. Turning to the competitive landscape. In our view, there isn't any product in the near-term that can have a substantially different safety and efficacy profile compared to EYLEA. EYLEA is approved in a number of retinal diseases, and has demonstrated safety and efficacy with over 20 million doses administered worldwide. It doesn't appear that any potential near-term entrants can provide substantially different dosing flexibility, duration or visual gains than are already achievable with EYLEA. Nevertheless, we believe that higher dose formulations of aflibercept might provide additional or longer-lasting benefit, and thus, we are advancing this program into clinical development in 2019. I'd now like to turn to Dupixent, our antibody that blocks the interleukin-4, interleukin-13 pathway that we are investigating in multiple allergic diseases. Just a couple of weeks ago, Dupixent was approved by the FDA for its second major indication: asthma in adults and in adolescents. Dupixent is approved for two important types of patients with uncontrolled asthma: Those with moderate-to-severe disease with an eosinophilic phenotype and those who require oral corticosteroids to manage their disease. With Dupixent, the newest biologic approved for the treatment of asthma, we have demonstrated an unprecedented profile. As noted in our label, in our pivotal studies of patients with moderate-to-severe eosinophilic asthma, we reduced severe exacerbations by up to 67% compared to placebo, and increased FEV1, a measure of lung function critical in asthma, by 29% to 33% compared to 14% to 16% from placebo. In addition, Dupixent is the only biological approved for oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma regardless of the eosinophilic phenotype, and the only asthma biological that offers patients self-administration. The U.S. launch in asthma is under way, as you will hear from Marion. Our regulatory application for asthma is currently under review by European regulators. We expect a decision in the second quarter of 2019. In terms of ongoing clinical development of Dupixent in asthma, we are currently enrolling patients between ages of 6 and 11 years, and are planning a separate Phase 3 study in patients aged six months to five years. In October, we announced that in two Phase 3 studies of Dupixent in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, Dupixent significantly reduced nasal polyp size, nasal congestion severity, and need for systemic corticosteroid and/or surgery. Patients with inadequate control of disease struggle with pain, nasal discharge, the inability to smell and difficulty breathing. The current standard of care, which includes the use of oral and internasal corticosteroids often, along with surgery, is often inadequate. These are the first pivotal trial results in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps showing that interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 are key drivers of this disease. Of note, more than three-quarters of patients in these trials also suffer from other Type 2 inflammatory conditions, including asthma, allergic rhinitis, and NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease. In a pre-specified group of patients with co-morbid asthma, Dupixent significantly improved lung function asthma control, providing the first evidence that Dupixent can treat inflammation from the upper to the lower airway in the same patient. Detailed results for the nasal polyp size will be presented in a future of medical conference. We intend to make a regulatory submission to the FDA in this indication in the first quarter of 2019. Dupixent has now demonstrated late-stage safety and efficacy in three allergic or atopic or Type 2 inflammatory diseases: atopic dermatitis, asthma, and now, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis. As we have observed in our studies, patient with one such condition often suffer from allergic diseases as well – other allergic diseases. We are committed to extending Dupixent's approval into younger age groups and geographies, and broadening it to additional Type 2 allergic indications. In atopic dermatitis, we recently reported positive data for our Phase 3 study of Dupixent in adolescents with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. These results were the basis of a regulatory submission in the U.S. for patients between the ages of 12 and 17 years. This morning, we announced that the FDA has accepted for prior review, the sBLA for Dupixent in adolescent patients 12 to 17 years of age with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, whose disease was inadequately controlled with topical therapies or for whom topical treatment was medically inadvisable. Currently, there are no FDA-approved systemic biologic medicines to treat adolescents with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. The target date for the FDA decision is March 11, 2019. We're also currently conducting studies in younger patients between the ages of six months and five years, as well as in patients between the ages of 6 and 11 years. In terms of other diseases, we initiated our Phase 2/3 study for dupilumab in adults and adolescents with eosinophilic esophagitis. We also recently started our Phase 2 study of dupilumab in peanut allergy. This program is being conducted in collaboration with Aimmune Therapeutics. A Phase 2 study of dupilumab for grass allergy is currently underway and a Phase 2/3 study in COPD is being planned. We view our interleukin-33 program as a complement to Dupixent. The Regeneron Genetics Center, in collaboration with Geisinger Health System and the U. K. Biobank, has confirmed and extended observations linking the interleukin-33 pathway to both COPD and asthma. We are studying our interleukin-33 antibody both as monotherapy, as well as in combination with Dupixent and asthma, where we have three trials in progress, and in COPD where we have one. We plan by year-end to initiate two Phase 2 studies in atopic dermatitis. One will be anti-IL-33 monotherapy, and the other will combine anti-IL-33 with Dupixent. I would now like to switch to the very exciting field of immuno-oncology, which continues to be an area of focus for us and where we have recently made important strides. At the end of September, Libtayo, the brand name of cemiplimab-rwlc, became not only the first PD-1 antibody approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or CSCC, but the first treatment of any kind ever approved for this cancer. The response rate for this very high unmet need cancer setting were among the highest ever reported for a PD-1 treatment in a solid tumor. Outside the United States, a regulatory application for Libtayo is being reviewed by the European Medicines Agency with the decision expected in the first half of 2019. There are currently no EMA-approved treatments for advanced cutaneous cell carcinoma. As we have stated before, we consider non-small cell lung cancer being an important potential indication for Libtayo. Our Phase 3 program in non-small cell lung cancer is enrolling as planned. Based on our review of emerging data in this evolving field, and as we had indicated on our last quarterly call, we have doubled the size of our trial comparing Libtayo monotherapy to chemotherapy in PD-L1 high patients from 300 patients to approximately 700 patients. We are also conducting Phase 3 studies of Libtayo in second-line non-small cell lung cancer and in combination with chemotherapy with an anti-CTLA-4 antibody in first line. While these things are being conducted with the commercially available CTLA-4 antibody, I am pleased to report that our own CTLA-4 antibody is now in clinical development. Turning now to our bispecific antibody platform, the leading program here is our fully owned CD20xCD3 antibody. Next month at the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology or ASH, we will be presenting additional data in B-cell malignancies. Our second bispecific antibody to enter the clinic targets MUC16 and CD3 for ovarian cancer. By year-end, we expect our BCMAxCD3 bispecific antibody to enter clinical development for the treatment of multiple myeloma. We have also announced that we will be progressing an entirely new class of bispecifics into the clinic starting in the first half of 2019. Continuing on the theme of immuno-oncology, in the third quarter, we entered into a collaboration with bluebird bio to discover, develop, and commercialize new CAR-T and other cell therapies for cancer. This collaboration represents a great example of two companies with synergistic technologies working together to try to make a significant advancement in the field. Moving on, our late-stage pipeline has made progress and I would like to focus on a few programs. In the third quarter, we announced positive topline efficacy data for fasinumab, our Nerve Growth Factor or NGF antibody in patients with chronic pain from osteoarthritis of the knee or hip. The study met both co-primary endpoints and all key secondary endpoints at week 16, showing that we can achieve efficacy with low doses that mitigate treatment associated arthropathies at least during the study period. We have three Phase 3 studies with fasinumab ongoing in osteoarthritis, including our long-term safety study. As most of you know, pain represents an area of high unmet need. To that end, we have recently advanced another molecule for pain into clinical development, a full human antibody to the GFR alpha3 neurotrophic factor receptor. Our clinical programs in cardiovascular metabolism are moving ahead. We are enrolling Phase 3 studies of Praluent in adults with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, in addition to pediatric studies in heterozygous and homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. We recently received regulatory approval for Praluent for the treatment of patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia undergoing apheresis. And finally, the FDA has accepted for review, an sBLA for Praluent as a potential treatment to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events with the target action date of April 28, 2019. Evinacumab, our ANGPTL3 antibody, is in a Phase 3 clinical development study in homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, where it's received Orphan and Breakthrough designations. We are also enrolling patients in a Phase 2 study of evinacumab in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and refractory hypercholesterolemia, and another Phase 2 study in severe hypertriglyceridemia. In terms of our other clinical programs in December, at the Annual ASH Meeting, we will also be presenting additional data from our wholly-owned C5 antibody program. We expect to initiate a Phase 2 study of the subcutaneous-administered molecule in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria or PNH in the first half of 2019. Another exciting molecule in our pipeline is our Activin-A antibody, where we currently have a potentially pivotal Phase 2 study ongoing in a rare disease called fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva. Finally, I would just like to highlight, within the next three months, our Regeneron Genetics Center expects to hit the 500,000 mark of human sequence, a milestone few, if any, centers have ever achieved. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Marion.
Marion McCourt - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. I would like to start with EYLEA, where global net sales in the third quarter were $1.68 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year. U.S. net sales of EYLEA were $1.02 billion, a 7% year-over-year increase. This increase was driven by overall market growth in both wet AMD and DME, physician preference and the aging population, as well as the increase in the prevalence of diabetes. Based on net sales, EYLEA currently holds about 70% of the overall branded U.S. and anti-VEGF markets. In an effort to educate consumers and raise brand awareness and interest, we recently launched the pilot EYLEA DDC campaign for approved indications in select markets. Beyond the approved indications of wet AMD, DME, retinal vein occlusion, and diabetic retinopathy with DME, we see potential opportunity for EYLEA in diabetic retinopathy. As you just heard from George, we recently reported positive data in this indication and expect a regulatory decision in the U.S. in May of next year. Following this potential approval, we plan to initiate a focused campaign to drive adoption in this large untapped indication. Additionally, in August, we announced that the FDA-approved an sBLA for EYLEA for a modified every 12-week dosing schedule for wet AMD after one year of effective treatment. This makes EYLEA the only approved anti-VEGF drug for wet AMD with 4-, 8- and 12-week dosing specifically referenced in its label. I'd like to spend a moment discussing our prefilled syringe for EYLEA. As previously announced, we received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA. We remain confident that we will be able to satisfy the agency's request, which included the completion of a usability study evaluating a single injection in approximately 30 patients. We plan to make a regulatory submission in the first half of 2019. Our launch timelines for the prefilled syringe have not changed, and we continue to be on track for an expected 2019 launch. Turning now to Dupixent, global net sales in the third quarter of 2018, as reported by our collaborator Sanofi, were $263 million, including $220 million in U.S. Let me start with Dupixent in atopic dermatitis. Underlying U.S. demand for Dupixent remains strong with total prescriptions or TRx up approximately 17% quarter-over-quarter sequentially. Prescriber depth and breadth continues to improve with now over 12,300 healthcare providers having prescribed Dupixent to over 60,000 patients. Despite the strength of this launch, the vast majority of patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis have not been treated with Dupixent. Educating patients about Dupixent as a potential new treatment is an important area of focus. To this end, we recently launched a national branded television campaign and are encouraged by the early results. Outside the U.S., the ongoing launch in Dupixent in atopic dermatitis is progressing well. As George announced, the sBLA for Dupixent in adolescents with atopic dermatitis has been filed and granted Priority Review by the FDA with an action date in March 2019. If approved, this will allow the benefits of Dupixent to be extended to patients as young as 12 years of age. We estimate that the number of adolescent patients is about half that of the adult atopic dermatitis population. In addition, we have also submitted an application for a 200-milligram autoinjector for Dupixent. Turning now to asthma, which is the most recently approved indication for Dupixent. As you heard from George, we believe Dupixent is a highly differentiated biologic for the treatment of asthma. The launch is underway and feedback from physicians has been positive. We've only been in the market for a couple of weeks now, so it is too early to provide any detailed launch metrics. We estimate there are approximately 775,000 to 900,000 adult and adolescent patients in the U.S. with moderate-to-severe asthma that have uncontrolled persistent symptoms that despite standard-of-care therapy may be suitable for treatment with a biologic therapy. Currently, only about 11% of these patients are treated with a biologic. One of the key considerations for physicians treating asthma patients is to limit or avoid the use of oral steroids to control the disease. We estimate that the oral corticosteroid-dependent population represents approximately 25% to 30% of the approximate 775,000 to 900,000 patients with uncontrolled persistent asthma eligible for a biologic. Dupixent is a non-steroid treatment option for these patients. With that in mind, we are optimistic about the asthma launch with the goal of making Dupixent the preferred first-line biologic for indicated patients with moderate-to-severe asthma. Early efforts to engage both allergists and pulmonologists are well underway, and the reception has been positive. Many allergists are already familiar with Dupixent in atopic dermatitis, and these doctors are also treating patients with asthma. We're actively working at educating and creating awareness of Dupixent's differentiated profile with pulmonologists. We look forward to providing further updates on the launch in the months ahead. I'd now like to turn to Libtayo, our PD-1 antibody. On September 28, the FDA approved Libtayo for the treatment of patients with metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or locally advanced CSCC, who are not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation. We continue to expect a decision by the European Medicines Agency in the first half of 2019. The launch of Libtayo is a major milestone and the first step in our goal of establishing Regeneron as a major player in the immuno-oncology space. Upon FDA-approval, the oncology sales force quickly mobilized to make Libtayo the standard of care for CSCC by engaging medical oncologists and MO surgeons (26:50), targeting centers specializing in skin cancers. So far, feedback from medical community has been positive. On October 24, Libtayo was included in the updated National Comprehensive Cancer Network, NCCN, Guidelines for CSCC. Libtayo received a 2A evidence rating, the only systemic therapy with an NCCN rating in CSCC. From a payor standpoint, we've been successful in establishing broad access and reimbursement coverage so patients in need can get access to the treatment quickly. Recall that CSCC is the most common form of skin cancer and is responsible for an estimated 4,000 to 8,000 deaths each year in the U.S. It currently accounts for approximately 20% of all skin cancers in the U.S., with the number of newly diagnosed cases expected to rise annually. We look forward to providing further update on the launch at a later time. Switching to Praluent, global net sales in the third quarter recorded by Sanofi were $80 million, representing a 62% increase compared with the third quarter of 2017. We have submitted data from the cardiovascular OUTCOMES study to regulatory agencies in the U.S. and the EU, and anticipate decisions in the second half of 2019. We are also expecting that the lipid-lowering treatment guidelines in the U.S. will be updated shortly. These updated guidelines may facilitate greater access and support increased use of the PCSK9 inhibitor class. We're continuing payor engagement and remain the exclusive PCSK9 inhibitor on the Express Scripts National Commercial (sic) [Preferred] (28:32) Formulary. Based on net sales, our market share in the U.S. has grown significantly since the addition to the [ph] ESI formulary (28:39), up to 40% in the third quarter with the number of prescriptions continuing to increase steadily. Moving to Kevzara, global net sales as recorded by Sanofi were $25 million in the third quarter as demand improved. Within the IL-6 subcutaneous class, Kevzara now has 42% of dispensed NBRx share and 20% share of TRx. I'll now turn the call over to Bob.
Robert E. Landry - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Thanks, Marion, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report both solid top line results and strong operational performance for the third quarter of 2018. We are encouraged by EYLEA and Dupixent sales growth, progress across our portfolio, and improvements on our operating leverage as reflected in the reduction of our full year 2018 expense and tax guidance line items. For the third quarter of 2018, we earned $5.87 per diluted share on non-GAAP net income of $675 million. These results represent a 47% and 44% year-over-year increase in our non-GAAP diluted EPS and net income, respectively. Total revenue grew 11% year-over-year to $1.66 billion driven by performance of U.S. EYLEA, revenue increases for both the Sanofi and Bayer collaborations, and growth within other revenue. EYLEA net product sales in the United States grew 7% to $1.02 billion compared to $953 million in the third quarter of 2017. U.S. EYLEA distributor inventory decreased in the quarter as compared to the second quarter of 2018, yet remained within our normal one- to two-week targeted range. As disclosed in our last earnings call, commencing in the second week of June, we increased the existing EYLEA discount that we offered to physician practices regardless of volume. As a result, there was a slight degradation in EYLEA's gross-to-net percentage in the third quarter of 2018 compared to both the third quarter of 2017 and first half of 2018. Effective October 1, 2018, we started shipping and recording U.S. net sales of Libtayo. As a reminder, for Libtayo in the U.S., we are the commercial lead and will record product sales. Sanofi has exercised its option to co-promote Libtayo in the U.S. Ex U.S., EYLEA net product sales recorded by our collaborator Bayer were $655 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018, representing a 20% operational and 16% reported increase on a year-over-year basis. Total Bayer collaboration revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2018, grew 12% year-over-year to $264 million, of which $243 million was derived from the share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. The $243 million, which represents year-over-year growth of 18%, compares favorably to the $205 million realized for the three months ended September 30, 2017. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $256 million for the third quarter of 2018 compared to $245 million for the third quarter of 2017. The year-over-year revenue increase was driven by three factors. First, we realized a $59 million decrease in our share of losses in connection with the commercialization of Dupixent, Praluent and Kevzara; second, higher Sanofi R&D reimbursement revenue associated with our increased investment in immuno-oncology; and third, higher Sanofi commercialization reimbursement revenue associated with increased investment in commercialized products. Offsetting these three factors is the 2017 expiration of the Sanofi Antibody Discovery and Preclinical Development Agreement, under which we recorded $38 million of revenue in the third quarter of 2017 compared to no revenue this quarter. In the third quarter of 2018, we recognized a loss of $39 million in connection with the commercialization of products from the Antibody License and Collaboration Agreement with Sanofi, which compares favorably to a loss of $98 million in the third quarter of 2017, and a loss of $69 million in the second quarter of 2018. The lower share of loss versus the third quarter of 2017 was primarily attributed to higher global net sales of Dupixent and Praluent, and continued cost containment for Praluent, partly offset by an increase in Dupixent commercialization expenses. Despite incurring necessary launch expenses for new indications in new markets, from a financial standpoint, the Alliance had its best performing quarter. While we experienced improved operating leverage in the third quarter of 2018, we expect the Alliance's financial results to remain variable for the next few quarters as we continue to incur launch expenses for new indications in new markets. Compared to the third quarter of 2018, we are expecting a higher Alliance loss in the fourth quarter of 2018, in connection with the commercialization of these antibodies. Before turning to expenses, I want to briefly comment on our third quarter 2018 other revenue. In the third quarter of 2018, other revenue was $117 million versus $62 million in the third quarter of 2017. This increase was primarily driven by the recognition of a higher amount of deferred revenue from Teva and Mitsubishi Tanabe, including amounts related to the recognition of a portion of the $60 million and $20 million development milestones achieved from Teva and Mitsubishi Tanabe, respectively, in the third quarter of 2018. Other revenues also increased from the recognition of revenue related to our agreement with Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, to develop, test, and manufacture an antibody therapy for the treatment of Ebola virus infection. As a reminder, you can find a summary of the components of other revenue in the MD&A section of the 10-Q. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $497 million for the third quarter of 2018 as compared to $460 million for the third quarter of 2017. The increase in non-GAAP R&D expense was the result of an increase in Libtayo clinical cost and higher R&D, head count and facility-related costs, partly offset by a decrease in Dupixent development cost. Our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as the total non-GAAP R&D expense less R&D reimbursements from our collaborators, was $311 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018, compared to $227 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017. As highlighted earlier, $38 million of this increase is attributable to the expiration of the Sanofi Antibody Discovery and Preclinical Agreement at the end of 2017. The remaining increases were driven by our share of higher immuno-oncology clinical costs and R&D activities associated with the growing number of wholly owned programs. Our press release includes the information required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense. We are lowering and tightening our full year 2018 guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense to be in the range of $1.19 billion to $1.225 billion from our previous guidance of $1.21 billion to $1.26 billion. Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $326 million for the third quarter of 2018 as compared to $259 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017. The higher SG&A expenses in the third quarter of 2018 were primarily due to an increase in contributions to independent not-for-profit patient assistance organizations and higher launch expenses for Libtayo and Dupixent in adult and adolescent asthma. We are lowering and tightening our full year 2018 non-GAAP SG&A expense to be $1.33 billion to $1.37 billion from $1.34 billion to $1.39 billion. Based on this revised guidance, we expect a higher SG&A spend level in the fourth quarter of 2018. This higher spend is driven by EYLEA expenses, including DTC; and Dupixent expenses, including DTC and patient support programs. Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses, a line item found within Sanofi collaboration revenue, was $107 million for the third quarter of 2018. We are lowering and tightening our full year 2018 guidance for reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses to $430 million to $455 million from $455 million to $485 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, non-GAAP cost of goods sold declined principally due to better cost absorption at our Limerick, Ireland commercial manufacturing facility. Cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing increased due to higher sales volumes of both EYLEA outside the U.S. and Sanofi collaboration antibodies, as well as the recognition of manufacturing costs associated with our agreement with BARDA. These increases were partially offset by lower validation costs at our Limerick facility. Turning now to taxes. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2018 was 6.5% compared to 31.3% for the third quarter of 2017, driven primarily by the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as well as one-time tax benefits associated with tax planning in connection with this Act. Our tax rate continues to benefit from the Federal tax credit for research activities, stock-based compensation, and income earned in foreign jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the U.S. The third quarter of 2018 also included a GAAP income tax benefit of $11.9 million that was an adjustment to the provisional amount recorded as of December 31, 2017, for the U. S. Tax Reform Act, which was related to the remeasurement of the company's U.S. net deferred tax assets. As we await additional regulatory guidance and continue to assess the full impact of the new tax law, including some one-time items, we now expect our full year 2018 effective tax rate to be in the range of 11% to 13% from our previous guidance of 13% to 16%. While our effective tax rate guidance has been lower for 2018, we expect that over the next few years, our effective tax rate will be in the mid- to high-teens. Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet. Regeneron ended the third quarter of 2018 with cash and marketable securities of $4.1 billion, and generated an excess of $1.1 billion of free cash flow from the nine months ended September 30, 2018. We calculate free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures for the three months ended September 30, 2018, were $106 million, in total, $298 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. We are lowering and tightening our full year 2018 capital expenditure guidance to $360 million to $390 million from our prior range of $410 million to $450 million. On the BD front, as George mentioned, we entered into a collaboration with bluebird bio. In connection with the execution of the collaboration agreement, we also agreed to purchase 420,000 shares of bluebird common stock for $100 million. As part of the agreement, $37 million, the amount paid in excess of the fair market value of the shares purchased, will be credited against our funding obligation for collaboration research. Before I hand the call back to Manisha to commence Q&A, I also wanted to highlight an exciting announcement Regeneron made in September regarding a new agreement with the State of New York to support economic development in the capital region. Over the next seven years, Regeneron has committed to invest $800 million to expand facilities and create 1,500 new full-time jobs in New York State. This expansion will be supported by $140 million in economic development incentives from New York State. With that, I would like to turn the call back to Manisha.
Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Thank you, Bob. John, that concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question is from Geoff Meacham from Barclays.
Unknown Speaker: Hi. This is Greg Harrison (41:15) on for Geoff. Thanks for taking the question. Can you talk us through the trends you're seeing recently with payor access for Dupixent? Have asthma patients been able to get access? And how is this compared with the launch in atopic dermatitis?
Marion McCourt - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: So, certainly, it's early days, Greg (41:36), in the launch for asthma. But I can certainly report that with Dupixent for the new asthma indication, we are making steady progress and very pleased with initial dialogue with payors. But I'll just remind everyone that this is only our third week in market with the asthma launch. Then, as a comment, you alluded to atopic dermatitis and payor coverage. Certainly, we see the majority of the market with adequate coverage. And, of course, that reflects in the uptake we're seeing with Dupixent performance.
Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Operator, next question please?
Operator: Our next question is from Carter Gould from UBS.
Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, Len, given all the commentary coming out of the White House around Part B proposals and HHS, just wanted to get to your latest thoughts on sort of that messaging, anything that you guys can do to either mitigate that front on either on the – yeah, I'll it there.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Yeah. Hi. Thanks for your question, Carter. Obviously, it's tough to know what's going to actually become policy given a lot of these announcements were pre-election. I do think the administration is serious about trying to do something with drug pricing. But whether or not they will be able to get in a demonstration pricing which covers a large fraction of the country starting in the year 2020 with international reference pricing, I think that's a wide, big, open – big question mark at this time.
Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question is from Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan.
Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I'm curious how you're looking at the market opportunity for Dupixent in the moderate eosinophilic asthma population when considering the low biologic penetration you referred to for severe asthmatics to-date. So, I guess, given those historic dynamics, do you think you'll be able to penetrate much of the moderate patients in the first year or so of the product's launch or should we really be focused on severe? Thanks.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: I'm going to let Marion answer that question after I just make one brief comment. The market has yet to see a self-administered product. And it is – penetration is expected to be exceedingly low for the moderate population when you have to get to the doctor's office in an infusion or hang around there for half a day, et cetera, et cetera. Marion?
Marion McCourt - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Yes. So, I'd add to that, that it's not unusual that physicians, and in this case, it's pulmonologists and allergists, will often use a product, Dupixent, in this case, for asthma on some of their tougher patients first. I'll share that anecdotally, the reports we're getting have been very, very positive. So, over time, most definitely, I think we'll have success not only with severe, but also the moderate patients. And I think that continuum will evolve over market experience. But they're really compelling reasons why, and that relates to the clinical profile of Dupixent in asthma, its overall efficacy, not only in exacerbations, lung function, OCS reduction and quality of life, but then also the broad category of patients that we achieved in our label; moderate-to-severe patients, of course, EOs greater than 150, OCS-dependent regardless of phenotype or EOs. As Len mentioned, another element that we're hearing that is just so important is that we are the only asthma biologic to offer both at-home self-administration and when physicians want to, they can always start a patient in the office to help educate and train them. But this is a really important factor in the ability to have broader use. And then the other item I'd add is that, of course, with Dupixent, we're not launching a new product, we're launching a new indication. So, allergists who already had experience with Dupixent, and we already have shown an established safety profile. So, we're really excited about the launch. It is very, very early days. I look forward to giving you reports in the future.
George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: And this is George. I just want to emphasize about the clinical profile that Marion brought up, which is that, particularly for moderate patients, they still can have pretty substantial reductions in their lung functions. When you're talking about a biological that may be the first biological really can have clinically meaningful impact on lung function, that can really make a difference in patients' lives. And that is something that has a really potential to essentially have a real impact on patients' lives. And together with its safety profile, I think there's a lot of rationale for penetrating into the moderate population.
Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: John, next question, please.
Operator: Our next question is from Chris Raymond from Piper Jaffray.
Christopher J. Raymond - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hey, thanks. Just a question on the Dupixent peanut allergy study or work that you're doing with Aimmune. Can you maybe talk a little bit in detail about the objectives of this work, maybe the strategy even? I think you've talked about being able to potentially improve on Aimmune's experience in desensitizing kids during the up-dosing period. But maybe just frame for us, what is – there's obviously a lot of opportunity in food allergy, not just peanut allergy. What does success look like from this initial trial? And where do you think that could take you in terms of sort of penetrating that other market, that bigger market? Thanks.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Just to get into the science for a second, I think that everybody has to understand that the reason you have allergies is you have a certain kind of immunoglobulin known as immunoglobulin E that is bound to the surface of mast cells and basophils. And once it interacts with allergen, it clusters on the surface of these cells, resulting in degranulation, release of histamine, and other allergic mediators. That's the fundamental basis of allergy. For those of you who don't know, interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 are the IgE switch factors. When you try desensitization therapy, the whole goal of that therapy fundamentally is to reprogram the immune system and make the immune system make good antibody or immunoglobulin G, as in George, instead of immunoglobulin E as in Ellen. So – and when you are trying desensitization, you don't really have a natural way of actually impacting whether the cells that are involved in the response go to IgG or IgE. IL-4 blockade and IL-13 blockade are the fundamental drivers. So, in any setting of desensitization, giving Dupixent should do or drive exactly the kind of reprogram that you want that historically has been very difficult to achieve. And in animal studies, the results are pretty much black and white. So, we believe that in almost any setting of desensitization, whether it be peanut, grass, whether it be with any approach, the whole goal is to stop making IgE and to start making IgG. That is exactly what Dupixent can do. So, what we hope success in that study is faster ability to tolerate higher doses of the peanut during the whole desensitization, decrease the number of patients who have allergy-mediated side effects, mostly GI side effects that limit their ability to take or stay on the treatment. All of these will be indicators that Dupixent is doing exactly what we think it should be doing, which is driving more IgG and preventing the body from making the IgE, and thus, reprogram the body away from allergy. And this is just the beginning. If it works in peanut, it has a signal here, it should be applicable to essentially every form of desensitization available by whatever modality.
Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Operator, next question, please?
Operator: Our next question is from Geoffrey Porges from Leerink.
Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC: Thank you very much for taking the question. Just to follow-up on Dupixent a little bit. Could you just address the question of the adolescent indication and what your expectations are there? And you mentioned the population, but would you expect adoption to be faster or slower there? And then just back to the asthma launch. Could you comment on whether you think this is going to be actively managed by payors, whether there'll be step edits and rebates involved, or do you think that you're largely going to sort of be able to price more or less at the same price as you have in AD and have unrestricted access? Thanks.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Geoff, before Marion answers, we invite you to come by. We might have a antiviral antibody we can give you there.
Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC: I'd appreciate that. (51:04)
Marion McCourt - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: So, Geoff, addressing your comments first on Dupixent uptake in adolescence, well, as mentioned, we very much look forward to the indication and helping this group of patients with moderate-to-severe disease, and the agony that goes with that for both them and their families. We would anticipate that the uptake should be similar to potentially a bit faster than what we saw in adult atopic dermatitis, and I think it's for two reasons. I want to be a little conservative in saying similar, but the reason why I think realistically, it might be a little bit faster for these patients is that physicians now have experience with Dupixent. And the product is becoming well known, depth of prescribing is increasing. And for that reason, coupled with the fact that this is an alarming disease for adolescents, we believe it's very important that we get the word out quickly, and there's great excitement and enthusiasm in the market for this indication, for this group of patients who are truly suffering. Your second question related to asthma and payor uptake, it's very early days. This is our third week of launch, so things are going well. There's been great receptivity to the clinical profile of the product. But I think I'd rather come back and give more detail on payor specificity as we have more time in market.
Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC: Great. Thanks very much.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: I just wanted to add to the pediatric side of this, is that next setting (52:37) steroids, whether they're absorbed from lathering lots of it on or with systemic bursts (52:45) of treatment in adolescents during their growth spurts is a big deal. So, I think that's another reason why doctors might want to move to early adoption.
Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Next question please?
Operator: Our next question is from Matthew Luchini from BMO Capital.
Matthew Luchini - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi, great. Thanks for taking the question. Just on Dupixent, we've had the DTC campaign ongoing now for a little while. I was wondering if you could give us an update or your latest view on the patient mix that's currently receiving the drug for atopic dermatitis, as well as perhaps your view on current persistence or refill rates. That's something that I don't think was mentioned in the earlier remarks. Thank you.
Marion McCourt - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Sure. So, let me take persistence and refill rates first. So the persistency that we've commented on in the past at the 12-month point being approximately 80% continues. So, we see strong persistency with Dupixent. Similarly, on the – first script refill is an important factor and we still see that at over 90%. So, these are indicators that when patients go on Dupixent therapy for atopic dermatitis, they want to stay on therapy because their lives are better. The second piece you mentioned is a little bit on the DTC, I believe, was part of the question, and also, the types of patients. So, similar to the comment I made before, it's not unusual for physicians to start with their most severe patients. But clearly now, we're getting penetration not only with severe, but also moderate patients. And we really thought it was part of our responsibility to – for this disease and for patients who potentially previously had given up because therapies were not really helping them at all, we thought that this product was absolutely ideal for an on-air branded campaign. We're still only in months of that branded Dupixent TV campaign. It was perceived, as some would recall, by a disease awareness campaign, and we thought that was the right order to do things. We've been in national broadcast mode with the Dupixent TV campaign now since about the August timeframe. So, we're several months in. The signs we see so far are encouraging.
Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Next question, please?
Operator: Our next question is from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.
Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Know you are unlikely to give EYLEA guidance for 2019, but maybe you could just talk about the puts and takes heading into next year. It looks like we're on track for another double-digit year of branded growth here. So, just wondering if we think that, that should continue heading into 2019. And then you mentioned this higher dose formulation of EYLEA. Maybe what have you learned here that drove this decision? And what would actually be required to bring that to market? Thanks.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: So maybe George can take the higher dose, and then we can comment about the market.
George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Well, in terms of a higher dose, I guess the point is that we remain impressed with the fact that EYLEA has stood up with so much competition, and that no one has really been able to come up, seemingly, with a fundamentally different profile in terms of the benefit, effects on vision or duration of treatment. And so, we thought that it was time, especially because we've been working on this in the labs for a while, to see whether just giving a higher dose of EYLEA can actually take EYLEA past what is now, we think, the gold standard in the field, and see if we could either improve the benefit and/or extend the duration of the interval. And so we're poised, we've been working on this for a while, and we're going to be putting it in the clinic this year.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Next year, 2019.
George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Sorry. 2019. Yeah.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Right. So – and then...
George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: I'm already operating in 2019.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: In terms of the market growth, we see nothing that will change the underlying demographics for the increase in diabetes and the increase in AMD continuing to grow the market somewhere in the mid to high or low-double-digit growth over time. Those demographics do not seem to be letting up at all. Obviously, where we fit in there, based on competition, what have you, we'll have to see how all that plays out. But I echo what George says, we haven't seen anything that's disruptive. We certainly haven't seen a drug – even the most touted drug by the sponsor, RTH (57:47), it seems to me they have forgotten that the retina specialists are actually some of the smartest guys out there as physicians. And they can do math and they can multiply 75% times about 50% and come up with a lot lower number than 75%. So, it seems to me that EYLEA has a really good profile. In addition, what we saw in the diabetic retinopathy studies was, we think, quite remarkable. I think it was startling to many, how frequent it was that people untreated with asymptomatic diabetic retinopathy given placebo, just watch for year, and when a large fraction of them, about a-third, actually develop vision-threatening complications. And this can be dramatically prevented and reduced, not only improve the diabetic retinopathy, but prevent the progression of the diabetic retinopathy. And we think that, that's a big deal. It's going to take some reeducation out there of both patients and physicians, but we think that's a fundamental advance. Remember that diabetes and diabetic eye disease is one of the leading still leading causes of blindness in adults.
Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Operator, we have time for one last question, please.
Operator: And our last question is from Ying Huang from Bank of America.
Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. I have one for NGF. In the recently released Phase 3 top line, you saw the placebo adjusted rate of – adjudicated arthropathy at about 2%. And then we saw the Pfizer fasinumab at ACR showed less than 1.5% incidence of RPOA. Just wondering whether you think that this kind of safety is acceptable for the FDA and for the treating physicians, and what's the gating factor for the long-term safety in your Phase 3 trial? And then next, if you could give us a little bit more color on the collaboration with bluebird, exactly what kind of target and what kind of style of (59:51) therapy you're focusing on. Thank you.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Thanks, Ying. Let me just comment on the fasinumab and then maybe George can comment on the bluebird or add to fasinumab. But I have to say that I think we know that in any drug dosing – any drug development program, getting the dose right is really, really important. And that becomes super important when you have a very steep dose response curve for side effects. And we think that our approach has been to really try and get that dose right. And we're hopeful that the very long dose that we got that is still able to produce what's basically so far at least best-in-class efficacy results – and notwithstanding, of course, study comparisons and all that – but really good efficacy results thus far, but perhaps, as George said in his prepared remarks, mitigating the safety. In terms of safety, I don't think it's just going to be the adjudicated arthropathies, which – that probably would be an acceptable level. But I also think there's a question of whether or not this treatment will be to more or less joint replacements. There's some evidence, I believe you've seen in the other development program, certainly in ours, of high doses that you would see more joint replacements. And that probably would not be acceptable. Our program is very carefully monitored by an independent VSMB (01:01:28), which has met recently, and advised us to continue development at these low doses, where we've demonstrated the efficacy. So, we hope that we've got the dose right. Being first here may not be nearly as important as being right because there's not as much room for error in this program as there might be in others. George can talk about bluebird.
George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Yeah, just to add to that. As you know, we're continuing our long-term safety study with NGF. And as Len said, I mean, the most important data is to see what the benefit will be compared to adverse events with, we believe at this point, since we seem to have mitigated against at least the arthropathies, the total joint replacements numbers are going to be very important certainly with the competitors' program that is a concern, and we'll have to see whether our dose gets around that. In terms of bluebird, I think for us, this is a very exacting collaboration. Clearly, they've demonstrated and they've developed their technologies and abilities to develop these CAR-T therapies. What we bring to the table is we bring new targets and new reagents, whether they be antibodies or T-cell receptor-related reagents that can target new targets that can be put into and made into chimeric antigen receptors by bluebird to be put into their cells and used via their therapeutic approach. So, we're very excited about putting together our ability to bring new targets and new ways to make these chimeric antigen receptors together with their ability to take those forward and deliver them to patients. And we think this is a real synergistic collaboration between two companies with very complementary capabilities, and we're hoping to be able to change the future there.

Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Thanks, Manisha, and good morning to everyone who has joined us on today's call and webcast. Regeneron delivered a strong second quarter, as measured both by R&D progress, as well as our financial results, reflecting our commitment to discovering important new drugs and translating those discoveries into successful commercial products. Our pipeline now has 19 drugs or drug candidates in development, with particularly good progress in allergic diseases and cancer. George will update you on our R&D efforts and highlight some notable progress across our pipeline. Our commercial efforts are focused on market leading EYLEA, the ongoing launches of Dupixent, Kevzara, and Praluent, and our ongoing launch preparations for cemiplimab, our PD-1 inhibitor in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Marion will update you on our progress. Operationally, we had a record performance on both the top and bottom line. Bob will review these results. So now I'd like to turn the call over to George.
George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Thanks, Len, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by updating you on the status of EYLEA. Our regulatory submission for EYLEA dose every 12 weeks in neurovascular age-related macular degeneration, or wet AMD, is currently under FDA review with PDUFA date of August 11. Yesterday, Bayer, which commercializes EYLEA outside the United States, announced that the European Commission has approved a new treatment approach enabling early extension of the injection interval for patients with wet AMD. The new approach is based on the results from the ALTAIR study, in which after 52 weeks 57% of patients had their next regularly scheduled EYLEA injection at an interval of 12 weeks or more, with many patients achieving interval of 16 weeks, the maximum interval allowed in the study. Study participants gained an average of 9 letters, including 50% of patients who gained 10 or more letters of vision at week 52. These results were largely maintained during the second year of the study. These data have not been submitted for review to the FDA. We would also like to report some recent success with higher dose formulations of aflibercept in preclinical studies, which we hope to advance into the clinic in 2019. Turning now to our immunology and inflammation programs. Dupixent, our interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 blocker, is approved for atopic dermatitis and is under investigation for other allergic diseases, also known as atopic or Type 2 inflammatory diseases, including asthma, nasal polyps, eosinophilic esophagitis, as well as food and inhaled allergies. Dupixent is approved for the treatment of adults with atopic dermatitis and later this year we expect a supplemental biologics license application for SBLA for adolescents with atopic dermatitis, based on the positive top line data we announced in May. These data will be presented in more detail at a medical conference next month. Dupixent is also under regulatory review for asthma in adults and adolescents. In addition, we are conducting pediatric studies in both atopic dermatitis and asthma. Later this year, we are expecting pivotal results from our Phase 3 studies in nasal polyps and we will be initiating our Phase 3 program in eosinophilic esophagitis, as well as earlier clinical programs in both peanut allergy and grass allergy. The emerging Dupixent clinical data continues to support our hypothesis that interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 are the central drivers of allergic disease. Our interleukin-33 program complements Dupixent and has potential both as monotherapy and in combination with Dupixent. Interleukin-33 may be an important target in certain inflammatory diseases and is supported by evidence from work done at our Regeneron Genetics Center. We are currently investigating this molecule in asthma and atopic dermatitis. Now I'll turn to immuno-oncology, which continues to be an area of enormous focus for us. Our BLA for cemiplimab in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is currently under regulatory review and the PDUFA date is in October. If approved, this will be the third PD-1 antibody to gain regulatory approval and the first in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, where we have observed response rates that have been among the highest reported with a PD-1 antibody for a solid tumor. Regulatory application for cemiplimab in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma are also under review outside the United States. Non-small cell lung cancer is an important development opportunity for cemiplimab. Despite many efforts in the field, there is currently only one PD-1 antibody approved in first-line non-small cell lung cancer, and less than half the patients respond. We are pursuing a broad development strategy in lung cancer that encompasses patients with both low and high levels of PD-L1. Beyond first-line non-small cell lung cancer, we also have ongoing studies in other solid tumors, including second-line non-small cell lung cancer, second-line cervical cancer, and basal cell carcinoma. Based on our review of recent data from competitor PD-1s in non-small cell lung cancer, we plan on increasing the size of our ongoing monotherapy Phase 3 study and expect it to readout in 2020. We're also reviewing any implications that these developments may have on our larger lung cancer program. We recognize how quickly the field of immuno-oncology is evolving and are committed to being at the leading edge. Despite all the advances in the treatment of cancer, many patients still remain without effective treatment options. In addition to use as monotherapy, we expect cemiplimab to be the foundation upon which we build combination therapies to address a variety of tumor types. To that end, we have two additional checkpoint inhibitors, LAG3 and CTLA-4, in clinical development. We're also exploring our checkpoint inhibitors in collaborative combinations with vaccines and self-therapy approaches. Our proprietary bi-specific antibody platform is another key component of our immuno-oncology strategy. We are investigating our bi-specific antibodies as single agents in combinations with each other and in combination with our checkpoint inhibitors. Having a broad set of tools within immuno-oncology enables us to choose the best ones for each particular disease. Our lead bi-specific program is a wholly owned CD20xCD3 molecule, which has validated the concept and given us confidence in the platform as a whole. We remain very encouraged by the strong response rates that we have observed to-date in both indolent and aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and expect to advance this program into registrational studies in 2019. Additional studies and data from this program will be presented at a medical conference later this year. We are also advancing additional bi-specific candidates into clinical development. Our MUC16xCD3 bi-specific for ovarian cancer has entered clinical development and our BCMAxCD3 bi-specific for multiple myeloma will enter the clinic later this year. These bi-specifics will be studied both as monotherapy and in combination with cemiplimab. Early next year, we expect to advance into clinical development an entirely new class of bi-specific antibodies, which we will study in combination with the CD3 class of bi-specifics, as well as with cemiplimab. Turning now to fasinumab, our Nerve Growth Factor antibody for pain. We are continuing patient enrollment in the Phase 3 osteoarthritis program. Following an evaluation by an independent Data Monitoring Committee, we are moving forward with only the lower dose-regimens in this program. We anticipate sharing top line efficacy results from our first Phase 3 osteoarthritis study later this quarter. Now I'd like to provide a brief update on three of our wholly-owned earlier stage programs. Let me begin with our C5 antibody. Our goal is to provide patients with a convenient, self-administered, subcutaneous dosing option that doesn't require a high volume delivery device, and we have made significant progress toward this goal. In our Phase 1 study based on both pharmacodynamics and ex vivo pharmacodynamic assays of subcutaneous dosing regimen achieved the blood levels that we believe will be sufficient to prevent hemolysis in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, or PNH. We expect to report the full data in an upcoming medical conference and plan to initiate Phase 2 studies for PNH in early 2019. Another exciting early-stage molecule is our antibody to Activin-A, which we are investigating in the rare and devastating disease called fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva. We are pleased that enrollment in our potentially pivotal study is proceeding according to plan. We're also studying our Activin-A antibody in combination with our myostatin antibody in the setting of muscle atrophy and wasting, where in early studies we demonstrated an approximately 8% increase in muscle mass. We plan to initiate by year-end the first of multiple Phase 2 studies to ascertain whether this increase in muscle mass translates into functional and/or metabolic benefits. We currently have 19 product candidates that are in various stages of clinical development. Each of these was discovered by us in our laboratories in Tarrytown, New York. I'm pleased to say that we remain on track for the goals that we laid out at the beginning of the year to advance four to six new product candidates into the clinic in 2018. Just in the first half of the year alone, we have advanced three new molecules into clinical development. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marion.
Marion McCourt - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Thank you, George, and good morning everyone. I'd like to start with EYLEA, where global net sales in the second quarter were $1.66 billion, an increase of 13% year-over-year. In the U.S., EYLEA continues to be the market-leading branded anti-VEGF for retinal diseases. In the second quarter, U.S. EYLEA net sales were $992 million, which represents 8% growth year-over-year. Based on net sales, EYLEA currently has approximately 70% of the overall branded U.S. anti-VEGF market. We're committed to maintaining our market leadership position with EYLEA and we've identified meaningful growth opportunities. While EYLEA is well penetrated in wet AMD, there remains a large opportunity in diabetic eye disease. Less than 20% of patients diagnosed with clinically significant diabetic macular edema currently receive anti-VEGF therapy, and many others with diabetic macular edema are not even diagnosed. Approximately 25% of current EYLEA U.S. business is attributed to use in patients with diabetic macular edema. Additionally, we expect the market to grow in wet AMD, because of the aging population, and in diabetic retinal diseases, due to the substantial increase in diabetes prevalence. We'd like to ensure that ever eligible patient with diabetic retinal disease or wet AMD is treated with optimal therapy, which, in the vast majority of cases, is anti-VEGF therapy. To that end, in the coming weeks, we will be launching an initial branded television campaign for EYLEA in DME in multiple U.S. test markets. Another important potential growth driver for EYLEA is through gaining approval in additional retinal diseases and expanding the label. We have submitted an sBLA for EYLEA in diabetic retinopathy population. It's estimated that there are approximately 3.5 million people in the U.S. who are diagnosed with diabetic retinopathy without DME. Of these, approximately 1 million patients have the greatest disease burden and are at risk for vision-threatening complications. Earlier this year we reported positive top line data from the Phase 3 PANORAMA study of EYLEA in diabetic retinopathy and we expect to report top line 52-week data later this year. Our regulatory submission for EYLEA dosed every 12 weeks is currently under FDA review. As George mentioned, earlier this week European regulators approved EYLEA for an extended dosing regimen in wet AMD. We have also recently submitted an sBLA for EYLEA in a pre-filled syringe with potential launch in 2019. Turning now to Dupixent, global net sales in the second quarter of 2018, as reported by our collaborator Sanofi, were $209 million. In the U.S., net sales in the second quarter were $181 million. Approximately 50,000 patients have been prescribed Dupixent since launch in the U.S. Underlying U.S. demand for Dupixent is strong, with total prescriptions up approximately 27% sequentially from the last quarter. New patient starts, another indicator of demand, and average weekly NBRx in the second quarter were approximately 550 new patients, excluding the holiday week. Overall patient refill and persistence rates remain high, especially in comparison to other biologics. Dupixent prescribers remain highly satisfied frequently referring to Dupixent as a drug that is transformational to the lives of their patients and their treatment practices. In the U.S., over 11,000 healthcare providers have prescribed Dupixent through the second quarter, with depth of prescribing continuing to increase. Consumer education and activation is an important component of the Dupixent launch. We've been encouraged by the impact of our unbranded disease state awareness campaign and plan to roll out a branded Dupixent television campaign in the coming weeks. Outside the U.S., the launch of Dupixent in atopic dermatitis is underway in multiple major markets. During the second quarter Dupixent was approved and launched in Japan, with additional launches anticipated in other countries over the remainder of 2018 and thereafter. Beyond adult atopic dermatitis, we look forward to the FDA's decision on Dupixent for moderate to severe asthma in adults and adolescents, with a PDUFA date of October 20. Based on our clinical data, we believe that Dupixent offers a differentiated profile among biologics for asthma, with a substantial decrease in exacerbation rate, and consistent and clinically meaningful improvement in lung function. There remains significant unmet need in uncontrolled asthma, which accounts for an estimated 20% of diagnosed asthma patients. Currently, there are approximately 900,000 patients in the U.S. who are treated for uncontrolled moderate to severe asthma, who would be considered appropriate biologic therapy candidates. However, fewer than 10% of these patients are currently treated with a biologic. In addition, we also anticipate meaningful opportunities for Dupixent in adolescent and pediatric atopic dermatitis, pediatric asthma, nasal polyps, and eosinophilic esophagitis, which are all at late-stage development. Global net sales in the second quarter for Praluent, as recorded by Sanofi, were $74 million, representing increase of 61% compared to the second quarter of 2017. Earlier this year, we reported positive data from the ODYSSEY cardiovascular outcome study and have made a regulatory submission in both the U.S. and Europe. Over time, as outcomes data are potentially included in the label and, as guidelines are anticipated to change, we expect commercial uptake to be positively impacted. We continue to engage in discussions with payers to simplify utilization management criteria and to improve access for patients in return for flexible pricing. In the second quarter, we announced that we would lower the net price of Praluent in exchange for straightforward physician prescribing and more affordable patient access. We're pleased that Praluent was chosen as the exclusive PCSK9 inhibitor on the Express Scripts national formulary. The agreement took effect on July 1, so it is too early for us to assess the impact. This is a competitive space with many decisions yet to be made. We continue to engage with other payers and remain committed to minimizing barriers related to access and affordability for patients. Moving to Kevzara, global net sales, as recorded by Sanofi, were $24 million in the second quarter as demand improved. Within the IL-6 subcutaneous class, Kevzara now has approximately 26% of dispensed NBRx share and 10% share of TRx launch-to-date. Recently Kevzara was launched in a pre-filled pen and is now the only biologic RA therapy in the U.S. that is available in a button-free pen. The Kevzara pre-filled pen is uniquely activated by pressing the pen against the skin. Data have shown that pens are preferred over syringes by RA patients taking chronic subcutaneous injections. We continue to make strides in growing the IL-6 class through improved understanding of mechanism of action. Along with its differentiated clinical profile, Kevzara is positioned to be the preferred biologic for those patients who are inadequate responders or intolerant to TNF antibodies. We continue to improve market access with an estimated 92% of commercial lives having coverage. I'd now like to turn to cemiplimab, our PD-1 antibody. We're preparing for an anticipated approval and launch of cemiplimab in advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma later this year. If approved, this will be the third PD-1 antibody to market, but the first for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Our PDUFA date is in October 2018 and we expect a decision by the European Medicines Agency in the first half of 2019. In the U.S., our specialized field based oncology team is trained and prepared for launch. Commercial supplier is ready to ship immediately following approval. As a reminder, cemiplimab is a collaboration product with Sanofi, where in the U.S. we will take the commercial lead and record sales. Now I'll turn the call over to Bob.
Robert E. Landry - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Thanks, Marion, and good morning, everyone. As Len referenced at the start of this call, Regeneron had strong top and bottom line financial results. Today I'll discuss the details of our second quarter 2018 financial results, as well as highlight change to our full year 2018 guidance line items. For the second quarter of 2018, we earned $5.45 per diluted share on non-GAAP net income of $624 million. These results represent a 31% and 28% year-over-year increase in our non-GAAP diluted EPS and net income, respectively. Total revenues grew 9% year-over-year to $1.61 billion. Continued drivers of this growth are performance of EYLEA, both in the U.S., as well as ex-U.S., and a decrease in the loss in connection with the commercialization of antibodies resulting from higher Dupixent sales, which was partially offset by no longer having a contribution from Sanofi in connection with the Discovery and Preclinical Development Agreement that ended in December 2017. EYLEA net product sales in the United States grew 8% to $992 million compared to $919 million in the second quarter of 2017. U.S. EYLEA distributor inventory experienced a modest decrease in the quarter as compared to the first quarter of 2018, yet remained within our normal one- to two-week targeted range. U.S. EYLEA's gross to net percentage remained relatively constant compared to both the second quarter of 2017 and first quarter of 2018. In the second week of June 2018, we increased the existing EYLEA discount offered to physician practices, regardless of volume. Ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales, which are recorded by our collaborator Bayer, were $666 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, representing an 18% operational and 23% reported increase on a year-over-year basis. We remain encouraged by continued ex-U.S. EYLEA growth. Through the first six months of 2018, ex-U.S. EYLEA net sales increased 26% on a reported basis versus the comparable period in 2017. Total Bayer collaboration revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2018 grew 25% year-over-year to $263 million, of which $246 million was derived from the share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. The $264 million, which represents year-over-year growth of 29%, compares favorably against the $191 million realized for the three months ended June 30, 2017. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $238 million for the second quarter of 2018 compared with $222 million for the second quarter of 2017. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue line item primarily consists of reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred R&D expenses, reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred commercialization-related expenses, and the recognition of deferred revenue from the immuno-oncology upfront payments, partly offset by our share of losses in connection with the commercialization of antibodies. The year-over-year increase in Sanofi as of the second quarter 2018 included a $53 million decrease in our share of losses in connection with the commercialization of Dupixent, Praluent, and Kevzara, and higher Sanofi R&D reimbursement revenue associated with our increased investment in immuno-oncology. Offsetting these revenue increases is the 2017 expiration of the Discovery and Preclinical Development Agreement, under which we recorded $44 million of revenue in the second quarter of 2017 compared to no revenue this quarter. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2018 we realized $29 million less reimbursement of Regeneron research and development expenses under the Antibody License and Collaboration Agreement from decreased reimbursement levels for Dupixent versus second quarter 2017. In the second quarter 2018, we recognized a loss of $69 million in connection with the commercialization of antibodies compared to a loss of $122 million in the second quarter of 2017. As I briefly touched on earlier, the lower share of loss was primarily attributed to higher global net sales of Dupixent, Kevzara, and Praluent, and lower commercialization expenses for Praluent, partly offset by an increase in both Dupixent and Kevzara commercialization expenses. I want to make a few comments regarding our share of losses associated with the commercialization of the alliance products. Sanofi and Regeneron have ongoing worldwide product launches for Dupixent, Kevzara, and Praluent. We are pleased that the alliance is beginning to realize profits in certain markets and indications, such as with Dupixent for atopic dermatitis in the U.S. However, we are still incurring necessary launch expenses for new indications in new markets, and these expenses continue to weigh on the alliance's profitability. In the first half of 2018, the alliance incurred significant expenses related to the expected U.S. asthma launch in addition to other ex-U.S. launch and prelaunch spend across the alliance portfolio. For the second half of 2018, the collaboration is expecting to launch in approximately 30 new markets across the alliance portfolio, as well as incur prelaunch expenses for additional markets and indications expected to launch in 2019 and beyond. We and Sanofi are working diligently to ensure we have the appropriate level of investment to support these opportunities. As the sales of our alliance products continue to grow, we expect to improve the collaboration's profitability. Turning now to expenses, non-GAAP R&D expenses were $470 million for the second quarter of 2018 as compared to $440 million for the second quarter of 2017. The increase in non-GAAP R&D expense was the result of continued late-stage clinical developments for cemiplimab and fasinumab programs, and higher R&D head count and facility-related costs, partially offset by a decrease in Dupixent development costs and the discontinuation of certain development programs. Our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as the total GAAP R&D expense less R&D reimbursements from our collaborators, was $286 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $196 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017. Almost half of this year-over-year increase is attributable to the expiration of the Sanofi Antibody Discovery and Preclinical Agreement at the end of 2017. The remaining increases were primarily driven by higher research and development activities for partnered and wholly owned programs. Our press release includes the information required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense. Primarily due to previously announced modifications to our ongoing NGF program, we are lowering and tightening our full year 2018 guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense to be in the range of $1.21 billion to $1.26 billion from our previous guidance of $1.23 billion to $1.31 billion. Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $324 million for the second quarter of 2018, as compared to $262 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017. The higher SG&A expenses in the second quarter of 2018 were primarily due to an increase in commercialization-related expenses for EYLEA and prelaunch expenses for cemiplimab and Dupixent in adult and adolescent asthma. Given year-to-date activity and projected second half 2018 spend, we are tightening full year 2018 non-GAAP SG&A expense to be $1.34 billion to $1.39 billion from $1.325 billion to $1.395 billion. Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses, a line item found within Sanofi collaboration revenue, was $106 million for the second quarter of 2018. We are tightening our full year 2018 guidance for reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses to be $455 million to $485 million from $450 million to $485 million. Before turning to taxes, in the second quarter of 2018 we realized $34 million of other income within the other income and expense line item. This was partly driven by the recognition of unrealized gains on equity securities due to the adoption of ASU 2016-01 in 2018. This is compared to having reported $24 million of other expense in the second quarter of 2017, which was primarily attributable to the loss on extinguishment of debt that we realized related to last year's Tarrytown lease transaction. Please see our 10-Q for more details on the year-over-year change. With regard to taxes, our effective tax rate in the second quarter 2018 was 16% compared to 26% for the second quarter 2017, driven primarily by the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which lowered the U.S. corporate tax rate. The rate was also impacted by improved results from our international operations as compared to the second quarter of 2017. As we continue to assess the full impact of the new tax law, including some onetime items, we now expect our full year 2018 effective tax rate to be in the range of 13% to 16% from our previous guidance of 15% to 18%. While our effective tax rate guidance has been lowered for 2018, we do expect that over the next few years our effective tax rate will be in the mid to high teens. Given the recent passage of the new tax law, we are still awaiting regulatory or other guidance that could impact our future effective tax rate. Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet, Regeneron ended the second quarter of 2018 with cash and marketable securities of $3.7 billion and generated in excess of $800 million of free cash flow for the six months ended June 30, 2018. We calculate free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures for the three months ended June 30, 2018 were $112 million and totaled $191 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018. We are tightening and lowering our full year 2018 capital expenditure guidance to $410 million to $450 million from our prior range of $420 million to $480 million. With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Manisha.
Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Thank you, Bob. Sylvia, this concludes the end of our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the call for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Robyn Karnauskas from Citi.
Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just had a question, given that data's coming up soon in pain and OA, maybe you could help us understand a little bit you're just – you have the low dose. What would be clinically meaningful data? And the OA market's very complex, so maybe help us understand some of the market stats around where this drug might be used within this population. Thanks.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Thanks, Robyn. It's Len. I think what we've said about this program all along is that we would anticipate, based on the data we have and Compellor (00:32:32) program, that the efficacy that's been demonstrated is good efficacy and would, on efficacy considerations alone, be a useful addition to the therapeutic armamentarium in osteoarthritis, especially as a non-opiate pain, new pain class. So we're anticipating that the Phase 3 data we have should show some efficacy, but, obviously, we have to see it. The safety, of course, the long-term safety, which won't be answered from this study, because this study is not our long-term safety, is something that we can only wait for the data. As you know, we lowered the dose to a dose that the independent committee felt was appropriate to continue. So we're pleased with that, and our Compellor (00:33:32) program is continuing. But it's all going to have to wait till we really have long-term data to know just exactly the promise of this program. So I think it remains a high-risk, high-reward program. George, I don't know if you want to add anything.
George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: No, I think you've covered it all.
Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Sylvia, next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Raymond from Piper Jaffray.
Christopher J. Raymond - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hey. Thanks. So Roche has talked about their Lucentis pre-filled syringe as sort of a key component of driving market share gains and I think as they put it, sort of across all lines of therapy. So I understand you guys filed an sBLA for a similar device last quarter, I think, for EYLEA, but you're probably talking about a 2019 launch. So just maybe talk about the competitive dynamic, I guess, between now and then. And, first of all, is it your view that this is a big differentiator for Roche, as they're saying? And are there any countermeasures you can employ between now and then? Thanks.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Yeah, I think that we have not seen this as a big shift in market share. Maybe Marion wants to go into depth on that.
Marion McCourt - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Sure, happy to. In fact, in the fairly comprehensive survey data we use of physician prescribing, it would suggest that we're continuing to see share growth with EYLEA opposite Lucentis. And certainly over the lifecycle of the brand, as EYLEA has grown, we've taken equal share, about 20 market share points, both from LUCENTIS and from Avastin. So while we do think having a pre-filled syringe available – and, as I mentioned in my comments, that will be later in 2019 potentially – we believe having that extension, that line extension and that delivery system will be helpful to physicians. We don't see it as in any way a negative to our current profile in marketplace as we're competing, and certainly the performance we're showing, the share growth we're showing, and the preference, clearly, in physicians prescribing for wet AMD with EYLEA is important as it is in DME.
Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe I want to ask one on the PD-1 program in non-small cell lung cancer. Can you talk about the rationale behind the increase in enrollment? Is it driven by powering increase? Is it driven by assumption of the comparator arm, or whatever you've learned from the Merck progress (36:18)? And then also the availability of KEYTRUDA in certain markets, would that affect your enrollment in this program or not? Thank you.
George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Yeah, I think you did a good job answering your own question. Certainly, the original smaller study, the positive study with the PD-1 antibody in first-line non-small cell, the data looked more robust than the second study. Clearly, the agent is very active, but the relative effect compared to control was not quite as robust in the second study. And so we adjusted, based on our power calculations and based on those results, the size of our study. So it was basically entirely as you described. And certainly, of course, we take into account what's available, where, and what the standard of care is in different territories in terms of where we carry out our studies and how we enroll them. So, yeah, that's about it.
Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Next question comes from Geoffrey Porges from Leerink.
George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Are you on mute?
Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Geoff, we can't hear you.
Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC: Hi, there. Sorry about that. Congratulations on the results. A couple of financial questions for Bob. Bob, could you just confirm what free cash flow was in Q2? I think you gave us number the first half of the year. And then, what's driving the change compared to Q1? But more importantly, as we look to the commercialization of cemiplimab, are you going to have a second collaboration losses line that you report? And related to that, as your financial reporting gets more and more complicated, is there anything you think that you can do to simplify it so that investors really understand the value and what the outlook is? Because we're getting more and more of these collaborations and more and more costs and sort of puts and takes in each of those lines and the variance in terms of consensus expectations is all over the place. So have you thought about any way in which you can simplify things? Appreciate it.
Robert E. Landry - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Yeah, Geoff, I'll take the last question first. As you know, just kind of giving the dialogue we've had, I mean, Len is constantly challenging me and my team to, obviously, make these things interpretable in which the true value of the company comes out by looking at financial statements. There's no doubt it's complicated. We do our best, inclusive of documents we post at the JPMorgan meeting in January, with regards to getting into detail with regards to the modeling and we will continue to do that and continue to take your concerns under consideration with regards to that. On your first question, with regards to cash flow, there is a pretty big difference between Q1 and Q2. I think you meant Q1 2018 versus Q2 2018. We had no tax payments in the first quarter of 2018 and we did in the quarter two of 2018, which is why we had $800 million in total, roughly $500 million, $300 million split, something along that line. With regards to cemiplimab, we are still under discussions with regards to exactly how we're going to show that, Geoff, and we'll put more out at that time at a later date. Thanks.
Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Next question, operator.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley.
Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. If I could ask maybe a question on the C5 inhibitor that you talked about. Can you just talk about when you talk about blood level sufficient, are you comparing this to Soliris or ALXN 1210? And what's your view on sort of how the market's going to develop and what you think is the appropriate bar to look at as you develop this molecule? Thanks.
George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Yeah, well, we're talking about our evaluation based on our assays of our molecules compared to what's known in the public domain, as well as using our own pharmacodynamic assays and measures of how well we're doing at inhibiting complement. So it's integrating all of that data. What we see that's important out there is to provide patients with a convenient home self-administered subcutaneous regimen that makes their life a lot easier and that keeps their disease in better control with less breakthrough. So we're trying to make their lives easier and better, while delivering better disease control. That's our goal.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: So just to be very clear, in case if people aren't familiar with what George was saying. We not only measure our blood levels to determine whether we achieve what we wanted. We take the blood out of patients and do an ex vivo assay to see whether that blood can suppress in a standard assay for complement activation, and we achieve the blood level that fully suppresses that. Of course, that's not quite the same thing as doing a disease, but we expect and hope it will be a good predictor.
Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Josh Schimmer from Evercore ISI.
Josh Schimmer - Evercore ISI: Thanks for taking the questions. Two quick ones. First, it looks like the commercial JV with Sanofi may have been trending towards declining loss, but based on the commentary and the guidance, is it correct that you expect that trend to reverse temporarily towards greater losses in the second half of 2018? If so, when do you expect it to return to kind of improving the losses and that will eventually become profitable? And then quickly on the C5 antibody, what do you anticipate the dosing frequency will be for the SubQ injection? Thanks.
Robert E. Landry - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Josh, I'll take the first question. And we're not going to give guidance with regards to when we think the collaboration is going to turn profitable. And, yes, directionally in the second quarter to your point, it is trending in the right direction. Again, my comments that were made with regards to second half spend, we are going to be entering a very crowded and very competitive asthma class, and we need to ensure, given the strength of our antibody, that we have enough support, that Marion has enough support with the Sanofi alliance behind us to ensure that it is a very, very successful launch and we come out of the gates very strong right away. And again, we're not going to give, in terms of quarterly, our profitability guidance on that note.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: So as far as the dosing (00:43:12), typically one likes to think that the minimum acceptable interval, although, obviously, there are insulin and others and way more than that, would be a weekly dosing. And that's what we're able to achieve in the first study. Whether we can go longer than that, we'll just have to see as we get more into this. But right now, our comments reflect a weekly subcutaneous dosing regimen that we intend to move forward.
Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Carter Gould from UBS.
Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, for Len and George, you mentioned your higher dose aflibercept and moving forward that, how fast do you think that could potentially get on the market? And any indication from your initial work, what do you think you can get the treatment interval out to? Thank you.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Yeah, I think it's a little bit too early to go into that, Carter. Obviously, we have a tremendous amount of experience doing these types of studies, both in the preclinical and the clinical. We've worked diligently to come up with a higher dose formulation and we think that that is something that would extend the half-life. It's a competitive field, so we probably don't want to comment much more about that.
Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Our following question comes from Phil Nadeau from Cowen and Company.
Phil Nadeau - Cowen and Company, LLC: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the progress. A question on Dupixent reimbursement, can you talk about any trends, notable trends that you saw in Dupixent reimbursement in atopic dermatitis in Q2? Was there anything that eased, that allowed the new prescriptions to grow so significantly? And then as you prepare for the launch of Dupixent in asthma, what are you doing to ensure access to patients as that launches? Thanks.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: So before Marion addresses the access issue, I just want to say what we continue to hear and we maybe didn't mention enough is that the feedback from patients continues to be really, really satisfying, and makes us – sort of reminds us why all of us are doing what we're doing. People who are miserable with this disease have felt and told us that it was life changing for them. And so, as I've said on previous calls, it is nice that the data that you saw and we saw in our clinical trials seems to be translating very well in the real world where patients are experiencing on an individual basis the kind of benefit that the data that we achieved in the controlled setting would have predicted. So that is very nice. And both the doctors and the patients are extremely satisfied and, as I said before, thank goodness, we've also seen no new side effects to concern people. So the tolerability out in the real world is also very good. So, from my perspective, I would guess that is probably the biggest thing that's driving the continued use and growth and, of course, there is blocking and tackling that Marion can address if she likes.
Marion McCourt - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Sure, happy to. And to give a little bit more specificity on the access for Dupixent in atopic dermatitis, among commercial payers today, we have coverage with over 90% for – over 90% of covered lives. But then if we get a little bit more specific, and to give you the numbers, the percentage is about 65% of commercial lives have access to Dupixent following only one or two topical medication. So we've made significant progress and we did make some meaningful progress as well in the second quarter picking up another one of the major insurance companies. So I think we feel really good about that progress. But I would also say that what – to Len's point, what is really driving the demand we're seeing, such as this 27% increase in TRxs that I referenced in the quarter-on-quarter comparison, and of course the number was 25% in the quarter-on-quarter comparison in the first quarter, this type of demand is coming because of the tremendous results that physicians are seeing in prescribing. Their toughest cases now moving into additionally not only their severe, but starting to move into their more moderate cases, and the tremendous value that patients are seeing. As for asthma, we very much look forward to the launch. We certainly at the appropriate time will engage in payer discussions and, of course, I think some of the differentiating characteristics are really important to keep in mind. The clinical profile that George referenced, and also in my comments, differentiated by our profile as it relates to the impact we're seeing with Dupixent in moderate to severe asthma, a reduction in exacerbations, and also the consistency that we see in lung function is really, really important. A second differentiating characteristic I've mentioned is that patients will be able to administer product self or at home, and that also is a distinguishing feature that is important. So we look forward to launch. We're ready and we certainly will engage with payers at the right time.
Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan.
Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. A follow-up on Dupixent. So out of the 50,000 or so patients that have been treated with the product in the commercial setting thus far, do you have a good sense of the proportion of those that have overlapping allergic disease co-morbidities? And maybe even more specifically in terms of asthma? I'm curious how common this is. Thanks.
George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Yeah. I don't think we have the real world data, but we know from our controlled studies – now, I'll say our controlled studies are a collection of the moderate to severe atopic dermatitis patient and, as Marion just told you, the doctors tend to provide their more serious patients or put their more serious patients on first. So what's been happening in the real world, you might think might be patients who actually have more disease and more co-morbidities. But in our controlled studies of the moderate to severe population on the order of 30% to 40% had co-morbid asthma, and 60% to 70% had at least one other co-morbid allergic condition. So, obviously, among the atopic dermatitis population, the moderate to severe, there is a very substantial amount of co-morbidity with other allergic conditions.
Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Barclays.
Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, guys. Want to ask you on Praluent. Post ODYSSEY and post a price cut in some populations, how would you characterize access today versus 12 months ago? And then, what do you think is the tipping point for the class overall, just to expand into a broader population? Thanks.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Thanks for the question, Geoff. I think the answer is that access is definitely improving, in the sense that the artificial barriers that are out there, these complicated questions, requirements for documentation, et cetera, et cetera, are slowly being removed. I think we saw that with Express Script, where they went to a short physician at a station. I think others will be moving to it. But the tipping point, I actually think, may come with sort of practice guidelines coming from a variety of sources where it will be, I expect that people will – practice guidelines will demand that patients who can't get their LDL down to an appropriate level when they have cardiovascular disease with the existing therapies, it will be standard practice, not optional, to go to a PCSK9 inhibitor. That probably will be the tipping point, but we'll see. Thanks.
Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Following question is from Matthew Luchini from BMO Capital.
Matthew Luchini - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. You touched on this a little bit in the answer to one of the last questions, but I was curious if you could provide a bit more color on the types of patients that are receiving Dupixent in terms of disease severity and how you think expansion into more moderate patients is going to evolve over the next 3, 6, 12 months. Thank you.
Marion McCourt - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: So I think that it's not unusual that physicians in their first experience will try some of their very, very toughest patients. So that would have been in the earlier launch phase. As we now see the improvement in performance, as evidenced by numbers of physicians who are prescribing, depth of prescribing TRxs and the NRX numbers that I shared, we now know that physicians and also nurse practitioners, PAs who use Dupixent, are already starting to move from severe into their more moderate patients as they evolve into a broader experience. It's hard to give you exact numbers on that. That I don't have. But we are seeing evidence through discussions and through prescribing depth. Having said that, if we were in times back thinking that we probably have roughly 300,000 to 400,000 potential patients who would have moderate to severe disease in the U.S., we really are only at a relatively small percentage of touching patients. So we have an awful lot more work to do and a lot more potential for Dupixent in atopic dermatitis.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Yeah. I think that our DTC that you referenced earlier, Marion, in your remarks should help. At least we're anticipating that that should help achieve that.
Marion McCourt - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Yes. Thank you, Len, for the mention there. And then just to be clear, because we covered a lot, we are going to be launching a Dupixent on-air TV campaign nationally shortly. We've got great response to the disease state awareness campaign, as evidenced by many, many touches to our website, and patients coming for additional information and even physicians mentioning that they were seeing patients, because they had been engaged by the disease state awareness. We do think it's the right time to evolve into the branded campaign and very much look forward to having that on-air so that patients are educated, and we support efforts to get them the care they need.
Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Our following question comes from Brian Skorney from Baird.
Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for fitting me in with a couple quick questions on the pipeline. On the BCMA bi-specific antibody, just given the subpar results we've seen so far with the ADC BCMA antibody compared to the CAR-BCMA, I mean, just what do you think about the bi-specific pathway could make it more competitive with CAR? And I just wanted to get your thoughts on the role of IL-33 in COPD versus IL-4, IL-13. Would a signal for REGN3500 make COPD a potential target for Dupixent, or is there just a much better bio plausibility around IL-33 for COPD? Thanks.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: George?
George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Yeah, well, certainly I think there's quite a bit of data, not only from us, but from others, but certainly pre-clinically. There is no question that the activity in animal models of the bi-specific compared to an ADC is two entirely different classes. And we certainly also compare them pre-clinically versus CAR-T approaches. And certainly, the bi-specific much more closely approaches CAR-T type of activities. So we are very excited about our BCMA bi-specific in terms of it now, very soon we're going to start hopefully seeing how it's going to be performing in patients. And, as I mentioned, we also have coming up combination approaches with additional classes of bi-specifics that will also be very relevant to the BCMA program, as well as a way to potentially finer tune or amplify its activity in terms of what we see there. So we're very excited about that program. In terms of IL-33 and dupilumab for COPD, I think that there is a lot of questions in the field right now about how to pursue some of the biologics in the COPD setting and exactly what the implications are in terms of the biology, some of the genetics, what they call the so-called overlap syndrome. There's a substantial number of patients with COPD that have asthma overlap, and so there's a lot of questions there. And right now, we're really thinking about all this in terms of figuring out exactly what we're going to be doing also with COPD
Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Our following question comes from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.
Jason Jakoby - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. This is Jason Jakoby on for Terrence. Just another one on dupi. So with the adolescent expansion for atopic derm next year, can you just help us think about the potential patient numbers in the U.S. for this population versus the adult numbers, where I think you've said it's like 300,000? Thanks.
Marion McCourt - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Yeah, this is Marion. We actually have not yet given specificity on the size of the adolescent patient population. We very much look forward to (00:57:20) potential launch in this area and certainly would be very happy in the future to provide more insight there.
Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Our following question comes from Adnan Butt from Guggenheim Securities.
Adnan Butt - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Hey. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe one on EYLEA, Len and George, some channel checks indicate that memories of the inflammation episode with EYLEA still linger a bit. So is that resolved? Has that EYLEA inflammation rate now normalized back to clinical data? And then, Len, you have talked about the potential differences on safety. Do you think inflammation is something that could be different for EYLEA versus new agents?
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Yeah, so as far as the increase in intraocular inflammation, there's no doubt that there was a spike. To the best that we could do looking at every variable, it seemed to trace to several batches of syringes. But, of course, in the absence of doing a controlled trial, one can't be certain. But what we can say is that the background rate typically is about one to two cases of inflammations per 10,000 injections. The marketplace notices when you get to 5 per 10,000 or 10 per 10,000, they notice it quite a lot. And I can tell you that we spiked up above the one to two, and we don't think we quite got to 10. But we certainly are now back to the baseline of one to two, and we monitor this very carefully. Not to break our arms patting ourselves on the back. I think that we handled that very transparently with all the various retinal associations and ophthalmologic groups. We shared the data directly with the key opinion leaders and anybody who wanted to see it. Marion's team was out there. We got lots of positive feedback. I'm sure we lost some customers during that, but I think that we're winning them back, because of our transparency and the fact that we've got the rate down. Now, in terms of new agents, yes, inflammation could be a differentiating factor. I think I've seen rates in some of the newer types of agents that are up to 15 per 100, 150 per 1,000, 1,500 per 10,000. Remember, we're talking about in the outside – in the world as we monitor, we're looking at rates of one to two per 10,000. So, yes, if those rates don't come down dramatically, I don't think that we would be overly concerned about the competitive nature. I just want to say that, to emphasize that, we look very carefully at the competition. We don't see anything coming along that is going to be highly differentiated from the data we've seen from our molecule. And remember, we have recently gotten, as George highlighted, an approval in Europe based on a study that the FDA hasn't seen yet, but the ALTAIR study, where we got a label that allowed for extension of dosing, through a treat and extend dosing regimen in the first year, where 57% of the people were able to get at the end of a year to an intended regimen of 12 weeks or more, and still gaining an average of about 9 letters and many patients achieving an interval of four months. So I think EYLEA has incredible profile and we don't see anything coming along that disrupts that profile. And we certainly don't see anything that can have the broad number of indications for a very long time that we have in our emphasis on diabetes.
George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: I do think it is worth emphasizing, your question, the point that you raised, about how the eye is such a sensitive readout for inflammation. And, obviously, having the experience, the wealth of experience that we have and understanding of this, and also our ability to track these things and so forth, yeah, I think it's really important. I think that if a physician is treating a patient, they have to take into account the risks and the experience and the confidence that they would have in any particular agent.
Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: All right. Operator, that concludes our call for today. I know there were a couple in the queue. Please send us an e-mail. We're available for follow-up calls.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Once our call concludes, Bob Landry and the IR team will be available to answer further questions. With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Thank you, Manisha. Good morning to everyone who has joined us on today's call and webcast. In my prepared remarks, I will focus on Regeneron's high level strategy. George will provide details on how our R&D prowess enables and supports that strategy. Marion will update you on the status of our commercialization efforts which will drive the realization of our strategy. And Bob will recap our financial results. Let me begin with EYLEA. EYLEA has been a very successful product both in terms of how much value it brings to patients with vision threatening retinal diseases, as well as how many value it brings to our business. Since approval in late 2011, EYLEA has taken over as the market leading FDA approved anti-VEGF agent for retinal diseases. More than 15 million doses of EYLEA have been administered globally since launch. During the first quarter of 2018, global net sales of EYLEA were $1.6 billion. Clearly, at the moment, EYLEA is our most important product and naturally many of our shareholders have questions about the sustainability of the EYLEA franchise over the near and long term. We believe that while competition is expected in the anti-VEGF space around late 2019, the therapeutic profile of EYLEA sets a very high bar and there were no products in late-stage development to our knowledge that are likely to have substantially differentiated product profile from EYLEA. In addition, we see significant opportunities for growth based upon the aging of the population as well as the unfortunate but dramatic increase in the prevalence of diabetes. While EYLEA is well-penetrated in wet age-related macular degeneration, there remains a large untapped opportunity in diabetic eye disease. That is why we are focused on expanding our indications in diabetic retinal diseases. Currently, EYLEA is indicated for the treatment of diabetic macular edema where we have the market leading branded anti-VEGF supported by the NIH-sponsored Protocol T study. Many diabetic patients can also suffer from eye disease without having diabetic macular edema and much of this results from a condition called diabetic retinopathy without macular edema. Some of these patients are at high risk of suffering from catastrophic vision threatening complications. Later this year we plan to submit an sBLA for approval in diabetic retinopathy without DME based upon the striking initial results that were observed with EYLEA in the PANORAMA study at six months. We also look forward to longer-term results from the PANORAMA study where we will be evaluating the ability of EYLEA to prevent vision threatening complications. But the success of EYLEA creates a challenge for Regeneron to diversify its revenue and profit base. I am pleased to say that we can now see the strategy we put in place many years ago starting to bear fruit. Our strategy was and continues to be to invest heavily in our internal research capabilities rather than look externally for new products. Though we do strategically combine our research capabilities with partners, such as Intellia, Alnylam and others, to collaboratively create new product opportunities. So where do we stand? From a broad perspective, our strategy is working. We have six approved FDA medicines and 17 different product candidates in clinical development, all arising from our internal discovery efforts. But in terms of the specific near-term evidence of success from this strategy, I would like to highlight two areas, allergic diseases and immuno-oncology. Our efforts to tackle allergic diseases began decades ago and resulted in Dupixent, a true pipeline in a product. Dupixent is currently approved for adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, and the launch in the United States is going quite well. We and our collaborator Sanofi are in the midst of launching Dupixent for atopic dermatitis in the rest of the world, which represents another very significant opportunity. Moreover, we're in the process of completing trials that would support the expansion of Dupixent into adolescent and pediatric patients with atopic dermatitis, which once again is another substantial opportunity. But atopic dermatitis may be just the tip of the allergic iceberg, because we are seeing strong clinical evidence that Dupixent is active in a number of different allergic or so called Type 2 disease, we believe there was a remarkably broad and deep pipeline within Dupixent itself. And we, along with our collaborator Sanofi, have committed the resources necessary to fully execute our development plan for Dupixent. We anticipate regulatory approval in asthma later this year and have Phase 3 trials under way in adolescent and pediatric patients with atopic dermatitis, pediatric patients with asthma, as well as adults with nasal polyps. Top line data from the Phase 3 nasal polyps study and the adolescent atopic dermatitis study are expected later this year. In addition, in the second half of this year, we plan to begin pivotal studies in COPD, another very large opportunity. We will also initiate a late-stage program in eosinophilic esophagitis and a Phase 2 program in peanut and grass allergies later this year. Finally, we will be studying the potential of combining our IL-33 antibody with Dupixent in several of these allergic or Type 2 indications. In our view, the potential for the Dupixent pipeline is analogous to what happened when it was realized that the anti-TNFs were not just drugs for rheumatoid arthritis, but drugs for many different diseases involving overactivity of Type 1 immunity. We believe that the evidence thus far is compelling that Dupixent is not just a drug for atopic dermatitis, but has the potential to address multiple other allergic or Type 2 diseases. In short, we think that Dupixent may be able to bend the arc of allergic disease. Now, let's turn to another pillar of our diversification strategy, and that is the area of immuno-oncology. Let me be clear, our goal is to become a major player in this space, and we believe that we have the science, tools, technologies and most importantly the product candidates to compete and win. Immuno-oncology has transformed the treatment of cancer and is turning out to be one of the largest commercial opportunities in the history of the biopharmaceutical industry. For example, the sales of anti-PD-1 antibodies across a number of cancers are currently at a $12 billion global annual run rate and still growing, driven in large part by use in non-small cell lung cancer. Our strategy in this important therapeutic area is proving to be spot-on in terms of the selection of molecular targets, engineering of complex drug candidates and the selection of the right initial disease states for development. In terms of targets, we chose PD-1 over PD-L1 and that turns out to be the right choice in our opinion based upon the available data. Moreover, we leveraged our VelocImmune technology to select an excellent antibody and our clinical group selected a previously overlooked cancer, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or CSCC. Cemiplimab, our PD-1 antibody, has produced breakthrough data in CSCC, and we are awaiting FDA action for this important indication. The response rates we have seen are amongst the highest reported for a solid tumor and served as the basis for our breakthrough designation by the FDA. While CSCC is a significant opportunity by itself, non-small cell lung cancer is the largest indication where we are currently studying cemiplimab. Our positive early data from a small cohort of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer supports our decision to aggressively move forward in multiple settings of this disease. These data will be presented at the upcoming annual ASCO conference. Our first-line lung cancer study comparing cemiplimab monotherapy to chemotherapy is on track to complete enrollment around the end of this year or early next year. We expect cemiplimab to be the foundation of our immuno-oncology efforts for years to come. Another component of our immuno-oncology strategy is our bispecific platform. We are combining our biological and technical capabilities to build molecules that combine tumor targeting and effective functions. Our CD20xCD3 bispecific antibody, entirely owned by Regeneron, is now making excellent progress in the clinic. You will hear more about this from George and at an upcoming medical meeting. Other bispecifics include MUC16xCD3 and BCMAxCD3, both of which we anticipate advancing into the clinic this year. Additional CD3 bispecifics are moving towards the clinic. And over the course of this year, we will be giving you information about a new class of bispecific antibodies. Much like Dupixent, we believe that cemiplimab has the potential to be a pipeline within a molecule, and we believe our bispecific platform is able to produce a steady stream of new drug candidates as well. Perhaps, most importantly, we see strong potential for combination treatments involving our PD-1 antibody and our bispecifics. So to recap, we believe EYLEA has meaningful additional opportunity for continued growth. Our diversification strategy is clearly on track to deliver the full potential of the Dupixent pipeline and our immuno-oncology franchises, which position us well to continue commercial success, and we will continue to aggressively move the rest of our deep pipeline along as well. With that, let me turn the call over to George.
George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Thank you, Len, and a good morning to everyone. The first quarter of 2018 has been very busy and productive from an R&D perspective, and I will provide some of the key highlights. Beginning with EYLEA, we reported positive data from the Phase 3 PANORAMA study in diabetic retinopathy. In this study, at 24 weeks, 58% of patients receiving EYLEA experienced a two-step or greater improvement from baseline on the Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scale, compared to 6% of patients receiving sham injection, with a p-value of less than 0.0001. No new safety signals were observed. Importantly, this was the first time that any therapy demonstrated the ability to reverse disease progression in a study specifically designed to evaluate patients with moderately severe to severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy without diabetic macular edema. We will continue to evaluate these patients for longer durations to determine whether EYLEA treatment can prevent progression to neovascular vision-threatening complications and also to diabetic macular edema. We expect to make a regulatory submission in the United States later this year. In March, at the Annual Meeting of the American College of Cardiology, we reported positive data from the 18,000 patient cardiovascular outcome study of Praluent, which compared Praluent to maximally-tolerated statins. These data showed that Praluent significantly reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events or MACE in these high risk patients and was associated with a lower rate of all-cause death. Safety was consistent with previous trials and no new safety issues were observed. In a pre-specified analysis, the patients with baseline LDL cholesterol levels at or above 100 milligrams per deciliter, experienced a more pronounced benefit from Praluent, reducing their risk of MACE by 24% and their risk of death from coronary heart disease by 28%. In additional post-hoc analyses of this pre-specified group, Praluent was associated with a 29% lower risk of death from any cause. These results are consistent with the recently published meta-analysis in the Journal of the American Medical Association that showed an association between more intensive LDL cholesterol lowering and a greater reduction in the risk of total and cardiovascular mortality in patients whose baseline LDL cholesterol was greater than 100 mgs per deciliter. We expect a regulatory submission to the FDA based on these data around the middle of the year. Len has shared our enthusiasm for the Dupixent pipeline. Our regulatory submission for Dupixent for the treatment of uncontrolled asthma in adults and adolescents is currently under review by the FDA with a PDUFA date in October. Detailed results from the Phase 3 QUEST and VENTURE asthma studies will be presented at the upcoming meeting of the American Thoracic Society. Our Phase 3 study of asthma in the pediatric setting is currently under way. We also have three ongoing Phase 3 studies of Dupixent in adolescent and pediatric atopic dermatitis. The first of these, in adolescents between the ages of 12 and 17 years old is fully enrolled and we expect to report top line data shortly. Two pediatric studies, one in children aged 6 to 11 years old and the second in children aged 6 months to 5 years old, are currently enrolling. Based on the scientific pathway, we believe that dupilumab could be used in a variety of additional allergic or so-called Type 2 immune conditions. We expect to report top line data from two Phase 3 studies of dupilumab in nasal polyps later this year. We plan to initiate, later this year, a study in patients with co-morbid conditions as well as our Phase 3 programs of dupilumab in COPD and in eosinophilic esophagitis. We also plan to launch Phase 2 studies of dupilumab in peanut and grass allergies in 2018. Let me remind you that the human genetic findings from our Regeneron Genetics Center, together with our preclinical studies, support the hypothesis that blocking interleukin 33 might have additional benefits for some patients being treated with dupilumab in some of these diseases. A Phase 2 study in asthma of Regeneron 3500, our fully human interleukin 33 antibody, with and without dupilumab, is enrolling patients. We plan to initiate in the second half of this year Phase 2 studies of IL-33 and atopic dermatitis and COPD. As you also heard from Len, one of the most important areas of our focus is the exciting field of immuno-oncology where we have multiple approaches towards harnessing the immune system to fight cancer. Founded on opportunities provided by our PD-1 antibody and by our emerging portfolio of bispecific antibodies. Let me remind you that despite the excitement surrounding the PD-1 pathway, there have also been some sobering realizations. Early on, many thought that the PD-1 pathway blockade would be commoditized with a prevailing view that there would be many equivalent agents approved. As it now stands, many believe that antibodies against PD-1 are differentiated and more active than those against the PD-1 – PD-L1 ligand. Moreover, out of the two approved PD-1 antibodies, only one has been approved as monotherapy in first line non-small-cell lung cancer. Finally, the PD-1 pathway has not demonstrated profound activity in many of the most prevalent cancer settings including breast cancer, prostate, colorectal, pancreatic and others. And even in settings like lung cancer where the drug is active, most of the patients still do not respond. Obviously, there is much room to provide much more benefit to many more patients in need. Later this year, with the PDUFA date in October, we anticipate having the third FDA approved PD-1 antibody, cemiplimab, which would be the first approval in our comprehensive immuno-oncology development program. In addition to monotherapy opportunities with cemiplimab, we believe cemiplimab will be the bedrock upon which we plan to build additional combination therapies. We have reported positive data for cemiplimab in metastatic and locally-advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, where we observed an overall response rate of around 47%, which is among the highest response rates seen in any solid malignancy to-date with a PD-1 antibody. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma will be the first indication for which we anticipate the approval of cemiplimab. At the upcoming Annual ASCO Meeting, we look forward to sharing with you additional data in patients with unresectable metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. We will also be presenting the activity and durability from our pivotal Phase 2 cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma study. Importantly, we're also conducting studies in additional tumor types, including first and second line non-small cell lung cancer and cervical cancer. As Len mentioned, first line non-small cell lung cancer is one of the most exciting opportunities for PD-1 blockade, but only one agent has demonstrated convincing monotherapy activity in this setting. Our program includes three key trials, which, if successful, could position cemiplimab as a major competitor in this space. The first study is cemiplimab monotherapy versus chemotherapy in patients who expressed PD-L1 of 50% or greater. This study is ongoing and we expect enrollment to be completed later this year or early next year. The second trial of cemiplimab in combination with chemotherapy with or without ipilimumab versus chemotherapy alone in patients with PD-L1 expression of 50% or lower. This study is currently enrolling. Cemiplimab, in combination with ipilimumab with or without chemotherapy in patients with 50% or greater PD-L1 expression, this study would also include a pembrolizumab comparator arm. We plan to initiate this study around midyear. Turning to our bispecific antibody platform, which provides monotherapy opportunities, as well as opportunities to combine with cemiplimab. Our lead molecule of CD20xCD3 bispecific continues to progress in the clinic. We would like to remind you that this is a wholly-owned molecule. This molecule could compete in indications, where CD20 antibodies, such as rituximab, are no longer efficacious, as well as where CD20 antibodies are currently the standard of care. As we reported at ASH last November, at doses of 5 milligrams or greater, we observed 50% response rates and almost 80% disease control rates in heavily-pretreated rituximab refractory patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma without any dose-limiting toxicities. And thus, we were reporting that we were continuing to dose escalate our CD20xCD3 bispecific. At higher doses, we are now seeing encouraging signs of increased activities without any dose-limiting toxicities and we have not yet reached a maximally-tolerated dose. We look forward to sharing more data at upcoming medical conference in the second half of this year. We believe our bispecific platform has the potential to deliver additional clinical candidates, including two, which are expected to enter the clinic later this year, our MUC16xCD3 and our BCMAxCD3 bispecifics. We are also advancing a new class of bispecific antibodies and hope to share more with you about this new class of bispecifics later this year. Turning now to fasinumab, our NGF antibody for pain. An independent data monitoring committee evaluated the ongoing safety and efficacy of the clinical trials and recommended that the higher-dose regimens be discontinued based on their risk benefit assessment and that the program continue with the lower dose regimens. We are modifying the studies accordingly. We anticipate sharing top line results from the ongoing Phase 3 study later this year. In the interest of time, I will not talk about many of the remaining programs in our pipeline. Addressing diseases ranging from an ultra-rare condition, such as fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva to highly-prevalent conditions involving muscle wasting and metabolic disorders. Please refer to our Form 10-Q, which is a description of all of our clinical programs. I will now turn the call over to Marion.
Marion McCourt - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be on the call today. This is my first earnings call with Regeneron and it is a privilege to be part of this wonderful team. I'd like to start with EYLEA, where global net sales in the first quarter were $1.6 billion. EYLEA continues to be the market-leading branded anti-VEGF for retinal diseases in the United States. In the U.S., EYLEA net sales were $984 million, which represented about 70% of the overall branded market. Our dollar share of the branded market increased slightly year-over-year. Based on a survey we conducted in the first quarter, we estimate that currently about 70% of U.S. EYLEA net sales come from wet AMD and about 25% from DME, with the balance coming from other smaller indications. With the aging of our population and the dramatic increase in the prevalence of diabetes, we expect significant future market growth. Looking ahead, we see two major opportunities to grow the EYLEA franchise. The first is through additional indications such as diabetic retinopathy where we recently reported positive Phase 3 data from the PANORAMA study and expect to make a regulatory submission later this year. If approved in diabetic retinopathy, we expect that EYLEA could be used in the full spectrum of patients with diabetic eye diseases. Secondly, diabetic eye diseases are dramatically underdiagnosed and undertreated and even when treated, it is frequently with suboptimal therapy. This is true both for patients suffering from diabetic macular edema as well as from diabetic retinopathy. We expect that our increased provider and patient outreach in education could result in more patients with DME being diagnosed and receiving therapy in the near term and similarly impacts diabetic retinopathy following potential approval in this indication. There are also many ongoing efforts, both from academia and the industry, to develop approaches to identify these patients before they go on to suffer catastrophic vision loss. A further opportunity to strengthen the EYLEA value proposition is through dosing flexibility. EYLEA is currently approved for use on a monthly and every 8-week basis and we have submitted an application to the FDA for every 12-week dosing in patients with wet AMD with a PDUFA, FDA PDUFA date in August 2018. We recognize that each patient requires a tailored treatment regimen and therefore, if this every 12-week label addition is approved, EYLEA will be the only approved drug in wet AMD to have the flexibility to optimally treat patients, regardless of whether they require fixed interval dosing of 4, 8, or 12 weeks. We remind you that our Phase 3 wet AMD studies patients were extended to the 12-week dosing interval only after they successfully met treatment goals and more frequent dosing intervals. Turning now to Dupixent, global net sales in the first quarter of 2018 as recorded by our collaborator Sanofi were $131 million with U.S. net sales of $117 million. Underlying demand continues to be strong with total prescriptions, as well as the number of patients on treatment, up approximately 25% sequentially from the last quarter. Over 500 new patients were added each week during the quarter. Moreover, we consistently see high persistence rates with over 90% of patients getting their first refill and over the course of the first year, approximately 83% of patients who started Dupixent remained on therapy. Over 10,000 health care providers have prescribed Dupixent through the first quarter and we're beginning to advance depth of prescribing among users with the nearly half of these HCPs having prescribed Dupixent to three or more patients. Dupixent prescribers are highly satisfied, frequently referred to Dupixent as a drug that has been transformational to the lives of their patients and their treatment practice. We have recently commenced airing a national disease state awareness TV advertisement in order to increase awareness of atopic dermatitis and to encourage appropriate patients to seek further treatment. We also plan to (27:16) on air direct-to-consumer campaign in the second half of the year. We have high expectations for Dupixent and are optimistic about continued growth in the U.S. market in adult atopic dermatitis in multiple planned launches throughout the world in this indication. In addition, we also anticipate meaningful opportunities for Dupixent in adolescent and pediatric atopic dermatitis, in adult and pediatric asthma and in other indications such as nasal polyps and eosinophilic esophagitis. U.S. Dupixent net sales in the first quarter were impacted by trade inventory movements, and to a lesser extent, high patient assistance program costs which are typical in the beginning of the year for specialty care products. We believe that a much better metric for assessing the launch and product potential at this point is to look at the total growth of prescriptions and the increase in new patients added, both of which were increased by 25% sequentially quarter-over-quarter and the high persistence rates. As you heard from both Len and George, we've completed a regulatory submission for Dupixent in the asthma indication with our anticipated FDA PDUFA date in October 2018. We, along with our collaborator, Sanofi, are preparing for an anticipated launch in this indication later this year. Turning to Praluent, global net sales in the first quarter as reported by our collaborator, Sanofi, were $60 million. We're very pleased with the positive data from the cardiovascular outcome study. We've continued to work with payers to implement our new commercial strategy and just earlier this week, we announced a payer agreement in which Praluent was selected as the exclusive PCSK9 inhibitor on the Express Scripts National Preferred Formulary. Regeneron and Sanofi have agreed to significantly reduce the net price of Praluent in return for straightforward access for appropriate patients and easing out-of-pocket costs. We continue to engage productively with several other payers. We plan to make a submission to regulatory authorities by midyear based on the cardiovascular outcomes data. Global net sales of Kevzara as recorded by our collaborator Sanofi were $12 million in the first quarter. Kevzara is our IL-6R antibody for rheumatoid arthritis. Although the RA market is crowded it represents significant opportunity and we believe that Kevzara has a well differentiated product profile. Most notably, the improvement in radiographic disease progression. We have been working with payers to secure improved access for Kevzara. Simultaneously, we continue to work on driving the breadth and depth of prescribing across all health care providers. In immuno-oncology, our team is moving full speed ahead and preparing for the potential U.S. and EU approvals of our PD-1 antibody cemiplimab as the first treatment for advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma or CSCC. This week we announced that the FDA accepted for priority review, our Biologics License Application for cemiplimab in CSCC with a PDUFA date in October 2018. A regulatory application in this indication has also been accepted by the European Medicines Agency and we expect a decision in the first half of 2019. In the U.S. we have hired and are training an experienced and specialized field-based team to ensure that we are ready to launch immediately following approval. Cemiplimab is a collaboration product with Sanofi where in the U.S. will be taking commercial lead and report sales. In just three short years we've gone from initiating our first immuno-oncology clinical study to potentially having our first immuno-oncology treatment approved. Ultimately our efforts to advance cemiplimab as quickly as possible come down to the significant unmet need facing patients with advanced CSCC and our commitment to giving them an effective treatment option. CSCC is the second most common skin cancer worldwide. It's estimated that about 750,000 patients are diagnosed annually in the U.S. The vast majority of these patients, somewhere between 96% and 98% are cured by surgery. Even so this leaves thousands of patients with unmet need. While estimates vary, they suggest that between 4,000 to 8,000 patients die annually. Today, there are no FDA or EMEA approved treatments for advanced CSCC, and these patients currently face a hard and long treatment journey. We look forward to sharing updated data from both our Phase 1 and Phase 2 CSCC clinical studies this June at ASCO. Among the accepted abstracts are a first look at our proof of concept data for Cemiplimab in non-small cell lung cancer and a trial in progress poster for our anti-LAG-3 candidate Regeneron 3767, which is being studied as both a monotherapy and in combination with cemiplimab. And with that I turn the call to Bob.
Robert E. Landry - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Thanks, Marion, and good morning, everyone. During today's call I'll discuss our first quarter 2018 financial performance and provide updates to our full year 2018 guidance line items. Regeneron's first quarter 2018 EPS of $4.67 per diluted share on non-GAAP net income of $537 million has established a solid start for the year. These results represent a 60% and 59% year-over-year increase in our non-GAAP diluted EPS and net income, respectively. As a reminder, Regeneron's first quarter 2018 non-GAAP net income excludes non-cash share-based compensation expense and beginning in this quarter the changes in fair value of equity investments recognized in accordance with the company's recent adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-01. A full reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP earnings is set forth in our earnings release, which can be found on our website. Total revenues grew 15% year-over-year to $1.51 billion, driven by continuing strength in our flagship EYLEA franchise and higher contribution from commercialization of Dupixent. Partially offset by a lower revenue contribution from Sanofi in connection with the Discovery and Preclinical Development Agreement that ended on December 31, 2017. EYLEA net product sales in the United States grew 15% to $984 million compared with $854 million net sales in the first quarter of 2017. U.S. EYLEA distributor inventory experienced a modest increase as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, yet remained within our normal one to two-week targeted range. Additionally, U.S. EYLEA's gross to net percentage increased compared to first quarter 2017 due to slightly higher rebate provisions for government and commercial programs. Ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales, which are recorded by our collaborator Bayer, were $624 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, representing an 18% operational and 29% reported increase on a year-over-year basis. In the first quarter of 2018, Regeneron recognized $232 million from our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. compared to $175 million in the first quarter of 2017. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $248 million in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $194 million in the first quarter of 2017. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $189 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared with $210 million for the first quarter of 2017. The Sanofi collaboration revenue line item primarily consists of reimbursement of Regeneron incurred R&D expenses, reimbursement of Regeneron incurred commercialization related expenses and the recognition of deferred revenue from the immuno-oncology up-front payments, partly offset by our share of losses in connection with the commercialization of antibodies. A significant driver of the year-over-year decrease in Sanofi collaboration revenue was the 2017 expiration of the Discovery and Preclinical Development Agreement. We recorded $48 million of revenue in the first quarter of 2017 related to reimbursements of our R&D expenses from this agreement as compared to no revenue this quarter. Offsetting this revenue decrease was higher Sanofi R&D reimbursement revenue associated with our increased investment in immuno-oncology and a decrease in our share of losses in connection with the commercialization of Dupixent, Praluent and Kevzara, which were a $75 million loss in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to a loss of $108 million in the first quarter of 2017. The lower share of loss was primarily attributable to Dupixent's first quarter 2018 sales in comparison to no sales in the first quarter of 2017, given the late March 2017 U.S. launch. Global sales of Dupixent, Praluent and Kevzara, as recorded by our collaborator, Sanofi, for the first quarter of 2018, were Dupixent, $131 million; Praluent, $60 million; and Kevzara, $12 million. The split of U.S. and rest of world net sales for these collaboration products is set out in our press release. In the first quarter of 2018, other revenue was $86 million versus $56 million during the first quarter of 2017. This increase was primarily due to reimbursements from our collaborator, Teva, for the continued development of fasinumab, our NGF antibody and the recognition of deferred revenue associated with this program from Teva and Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma. As a reminder, you can find a summary of the components of other revenue in the MD&A section of our 10-Q. Turning now to expenses, non-GAAP R&D expenses were $458 million for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $434 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase in non-GAAP R&D expense was the result of the continued late stage clinical development for cemiplimab and fasinumab programs, offset by lower clinical manufacturing costs. Our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as the total non-GAAP R&D expense less R&D reimbursements from our collaborators, was $278 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $188 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. This increase was primarily driven by the expiration of the Discovery and Preclinical Development Agreement at the end of 2017, resulting in lower reimbursements received from Sanofi during the first quarter of 2018, offset by higher reimbursements received from our collaborators for cemiplimab and fasinumab. Our press release includes the information required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense. We are tightening our full year 2018 guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense to be $1.23 billion to $1.31 billion from our previous guidance of $1.23 billion to $1.33 billion. Next, non-GAAP SG&A expense was $296 million for the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $243 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. As noted in our February 28 earnings call, we originally guided the higher SG&A this year compared to 2017 due to the ongoing launches in Dupixent and Kevzara, an increase in EYLEA commercialization expense with an increased focus on diabetic eye disease, as well as commercialization expenses for the anticipated 2018 U.S. approvals for cemiplimab in CSCC and dupilumab for asthma. Although we still expect higher non-GAAP SG&A in comparison to full year 2017 for the reasons explained above due to lower first quarter 2018 G&A in Praluent commercial expenses and lower forecasted SG&A spend in the second half of the year, Regeneron is tightening and lowering our full year 2018 non-GAAP SG&A expense to be $1.325 billion to $1.395 billion from our previous guidance range of $1.35 billion to $1.45 billion. Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization related expenses, a line item found within Sanofi collaboration revenue was $87 million for the first quarter of 2018. We are tightening our full year 2018 guidance for reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization related expenses to be $450 million to $485 million from our previous guidance of $450 million to $500 million. Turning now to taxes, our effective tax rate in the first quarter 2018 was 18% compared to 42% for the first quarter 2017. The difference was primarily driven by the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which lowered the U.S. corporate tax rate as well as improved results from our international operations as compared to the first quarter of 2017. As we continue to assess the full impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and await additional regulatory guidance, we now expect our full year 2018 effective tax rate to be 15% to 18% versus our previous guidance of 15% to 19%. Our first quarter 2018 effective tax rate was lower than the new U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to the new foreign-derived intangible income deduction and the federal tax credit for research activities. Over the next few years, we would expect Regeneron's effective tax rate to stay consistent with 2018 guidance in the mid-to-high teens. Future regulatory guidance under the Tax Cut and Jobs Act invariability of deductions for stock-based compensation could impact our future effective tax rate. Now to cash flow and the balance sheet, Regeneron ended the quarter of 2018 with cash and marketable securities of $3.4 billion and generated free cash flow in excess of $500 million. Our capital expenditures for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $79 million. As a result of first quarter spend levels and a revised full year forecast, we are tightening our full year 2018 capital expenditure guidance to be $420 million to $480 million from our prior range of $420 million to $500 million. Significant 2018 capital projects include the expansion of our manufacturing facilities in Rensselaer, New York and Limerick, Ireland, as well as continued renovations and expansion of our laboratory space within our Tarrytown, New York facilities. With that, I would now like to turn the call back to Manisha.
Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Thank you, Bob. Operator, this concludes the prepared remarks portion of our call today. We would now like to open the call for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. And first, we have Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So maybe Len and George, since you elaborated even more about the PD-1 plans. Given the recent data from Merck's KEYTRUDA and Bristol's OPDIVO in first line non-small cell lung cancer. How do you think your molecule would behave? Is it because you're designing the molecule in such a way that it's going to be more potent even than both? Or are you trying to explore a better combination strategy for PD-1? And then a quick one on fasinumab, can you just elaborate a little more what causes the high dose to be dropped? Is it also the same side effects we see which is osteonecrosis. Thank you.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: George, go ahead.
George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Yeah. Yeah. This is George. Thanks for the question. I think that as we try to line up, it is really pretty sobering that despite all the excitement and advances with PD-1 and PDL-1s in right now the most important setting and indication where they seem to be active in terms of the number of patients which is first line lung cancer. As we all know the data from the PD-1s has been quite disappointing. And even with OPDIVO, if you actually look at the data, it by far fails to meet the bar of KEYTRUDA. So right now, unbelievably enough, there is only one, in our opinion, clear leader in the first line lung cancer space, and what we try to explain is that we've designed a series of studies which will test whether our molecule is in that class, is in the class of KEYTRUDA. We do believe, as you said, that we have a great technology that has succeeded in the past in delivering some of the first and best-in-class molecules, this VelocImmune technology. And on top of that, as we've already described, we have this very impressive and comforting data in the squamous cell carcinoma indication which has some of the best data ever described in solid tumor settings for a PD-1 agent. So these combined to give us a lot of hope that our first-line cancer studies are going to deliver on the order of KEYTRUDA -like data which would make us basically a real major competitor in this space. So we are very excited about the opportunity and we're very hopeful that the molecule in the studies will come through. In terms of your second question about fasinumab, as you already pointed out, there's a – this is a high-risk, high-reward program as we've described in the past. It's pretty well-demonstrated that the molecule has activity, but it also has certain side effects. It's not osteonecrosis, it's more defined as rapid progression of the osteoarthritis in some patients. And this is something that obviously has been seen with this class and with our molecule before. And so what the independent data monitoring committee did was they obviously took an analysis to look at the benefit and the risk that is the therapeutic benefit compared to their analysis of the risk coming from these rapidly progressive osteoarthritis events and they decided that we should terminate the upper two doses and continue with the two lower doses. And so we are planning to modify the studies consistent with their recommendations.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: I just wanted to add, Ying, that I think George said it and I said it, but it's worth saying again is that the potential for combinations with our PD-1 based upon bispecifics that you're aware of as well as a new class of bispecifics that we'll talk to you about later this year in our proprietary models is pretty exciting for us. So it's not only the monotherapy, although clearly the monotherapy is a huge opportunity as evidenced by the $12 billion run rate, the majority of which is a single immune-oncology agent with or without chemotherapy in lung cancer.
George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Right. And when we use the term monotherapy, which is sort of – we're almost bundling monotherapy and traditional therapies like chemotherapy because as we described, many of our studies are in combination with existing therapies, and as Len said, we also have these new combination approaches that we're excited about.
Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Next we have Carter Gould from UBS.
Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Obviously a lot of focus on Dupixent after your partner reported last week. Can you maybe just give a little more detail on the commercial dynamics you're seeing, namely persistence on therapy. And I guess for Marion, how we should be thinking about IMS data as being predictive of the trends you're seeing in the market landscape. Thank you.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Right. I'll let Marion answer that question. But I – we don't get as bogged down as you do in trying to predict the exact quarter sales. We're looking at the metrics as Marion said, is how is the launch going. And I'll let Marion reinforce her earlier comments.
Marion McCourt - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Sure. So let me take, Carter, the persistence question first. And as I mentioned in two pieces, both very, very encouraging signs on persistence. First is that we see patients 90% of the time get refills after their first script. So that was one metric that I gave. The second one I gave was looking over a longer period of time of persistence and that was over the course of time since launch, patients on therapy over that duration at 83%. So two metrics, both quite encouraging. I think the other comment is you're talking about some of the other data metrics that we would say is that what we're seeing in terms of demand and performance on the product is including the NBRx profile is very consistent with our long-term growth projections for Dupixent. So, we're on pace, as I mentioned with the NBRx number or new patient scripts on a weekly basis at about 500 per week through the quarter. That's 2,000 new patients a month getting their prescriptions filled for Dupixent. And we see that as a very strong growth signal. Certainly we're going to work to continue to advance performance but we see that demand going very well at this stage.
Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Operator, next...
George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: And we should just reinforce that once you try to look across other agents at what the persistent rates are over the course of the year, these numbers are really quite impressive and speak to the need and how satisfied patients are with the treatment.
Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Next question, please.
Operator: We have Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.
Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe as we think about your immuno-oncology strategy, when might we see some initial combo data? And really, is the big push here on the bispecifics or are you looking at other approaches as well? And then the second part of that is you guys have had a somewhat disruptive approach to pricing of your drugs. Is that how we should think about cemiplimab as well? Thanks.
George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Well, maybe George will take the first part and Len will take the second part. But – so this is George. Yeah. We're obviously very excited about this sort of dual opportunity of cemiplimab and of our bispecifics, both individually and in combination. But as you also just pointed out, with cemiplimab we have just with that a sort of dual approach of combining with a series of more traditional agents as I described, traditional chemo therapeutic agents, other checkpoint inhibitors including others and our own, as well as things, for example, that we're collaborating with other people such as certain types of vaccines and so forth. So that's one whole set of combination opportunities with cemiplimab. We have the bispecifics, which by themselves can be used individually or with existing therapies, but also combinations with the cemiplimab. And we, I think, have already announced that we have already started dosing patients with our first bispecific and PD-1 in combination and we hope that we'll be seeing data and be reporting on that as well. But the very exciting aspect of this for us is every one of our bispecifics can be evaluated individually but also we believe in combination with cemiplimab and other checkpoint inhibitors as well as with other agents and as well as with this new class of bispecifics that Len mentioned we will be disclosing over the course of the year.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: And in terms of price, Terrence, obviously and if you're thinking about trying to model our opportunity both in CSCC and how we'll compete elsewhere, first of all, I might just say in CSCC you have to think about the fact that there's a reasonable sized patient population, although it's hard to know because there hasn't been an approved treatment for advanced disease, and also you should go back and look at our data. We can remind you later, that we have very long duration of therapy and many patients still on drug as of our last update. So that plays. In terms of the actual price, we like to price towards value. These are, I think, high value molecules to patients and we'll let you know what we come out with when we do.
Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Operator, next question, please.
Operator: We have Geoffrey Porges from Leerink Partners.
Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC: Thanks very much and, Len, the question is, could you address some of what are now shibboleths (52:22) Regeneron? Things like no long-term guidance, no buybacks or dividends, no price increases, no product acquisitions. Given the fact that the company has lost more than 40% of its value over the last year, are you and the board reconsidering any of these sacred cows?
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: So let's take them one by one. I'm not sure I've got to write them down. You said product acquisitions, what else did you say, Geoff?
Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC: Price increases, buybacks or dividends, long-term guidance.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Slow down, slow down. I can't write that fast. Price increases, buybacks, go ahead.
Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC: Buybacks or dividends, long-term guidance.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Guidance. Okay. So let's take the easy ones. We have 6 approved drugs and 17 in the clinic. We have what I think of as one of the most prolific R&D engines in the industry. And we are not nearly as desperate as other companies are to fill up gaps in the pipeline, so it would be sort of senseless for us to compete in the market where people are dramatically over-paying and we have a tremendous pipeline of our own. But it doesn't mean we don't want to work with other companies. You're going to hear more opportunities for us to leverage the capabilities that we do with what other companies can do in some very exciting spaces we're working on. But in terms of just going out and buying a Phase 3 molecule that treats Parkinson's disease by some small molecule mechanism, that would just make no sense for us.
George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: And I think as Len mentioned, Intellia and Alnylam are very interesting examples, where we are, as Len said, leveraging our internal research capabilities with something that somebody else brings to the table, which we believe is very synergistic.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: In terms of guidance, we try and give guidance where the knowledge is asymmetric. But we don't think, Geoff, to be frank, it's our job to try and guess things that we don't have any more information about than you guys have, and we also don't want to spend a lot of our internal team's intellectual horsepower trying to guess what a given number of patients will be. That's kind of why you guys are overpaid. You are supposed to make those guesses. So we don't have – Bob gives a lot of guidance on things that you don't have information about and there was a ton of it in there. But to give you product guidance and make guesses, I don't know. We don't want to get in that game, because that's not what really the game that the board is in or the company. In terms of price increases, this is not an environment where you can take price increases easily. We have felt that growing by price increases is not our strategy. We'd rather grow by fundamental increase in the penetration or diversity of patients that can be on our approved drugs or bring new drugs to market, taking small price increases consistent with inflation or medical inflation is perfectly reasonable. But we don't want to be participating in the undoing of the industry, where there's so much emanate (55:37) towards us, and there's so much potential for bad government action, egregious price increases are not a strategy we think are worth the points. In terms of capital allocation, I can assure you that the financial team and the board looks at this on a regular basis. We're well aware of all the data. We're data-driven. We know what you can do with dividends, with buybacks, with acquisitions, with bolt-on acquisitions, with internal discovery, with partner discovery, keep money in the bank. We've got them all, and we study them all, and I think we'll tell you about them as our strategy does or does not evolve. I think that covers your list, Geoff.
Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Next question please, operator.
Operator: We have Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley.
Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, if I could just ask a couple of the underlying trends on EYLEA for the quarter, you talked about DME growth again. I mean, can you just describe how you see that market growing and is that market's growing faster or slower than the AMD market still? And then, just talk a little bit about – I mean, in past first quarters, you've seen some underlying dynamics either from patients finding it harder to get to the doctor, or things like that due to weather, maybe you could just describe if there were any of those issues in the quarter. Thanks.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: It's always hard to know. We had a good quarter with EYLEA despite the fact that there was some transient concern about intraocular inflammation, which based on our monitoring now, has returned to background levels, and we don't seem to have had any significant impact on the business there, which we're pleased with. The product grew year-over-year. I don't think we've really yet made the big push in diabetes, because we have a good approval for DME, and patients do kind of get to the doctor, although there are a lot that don't. But we're looking to get the broader indication for diabetic retinopathy, and then in constant with that have a much bigger push to get patients to the doctor hopefully to have their diabetic eye disease treated. We do see – so we haven't seen a big growth yet in diabetes, but we still see it. I should emphasize that while I said that AMD is well-penetrated, it's still growing by demographics. We're seeing an overall growth in the AMD market, because more and more people are living longer and so there are more and more people getting age-related macular degeneration. Okay.
Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Operator, next question please.
Operator: We have Phil Nadeau from Cowen and Company.
Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe to follow up on those questions, two longer-term questions on EYLEA. The first on non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. In theory, it's a large market, although our consultants said it may be hard to get anti-VEGF adoption there. So can you talk about your plans to change the standard of care, in particular in a patient population within that larger group that would be most susceptible to anti-VEGF therapy? And then, second, on the competition you alluded to in your prepared remarks, we did see some new data from brolucizumab this week. Could you give us your perspectives on that data? Thanks.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Yeah, so in the diabetic retinopathy, the needle mover from the people we talk to will be not simply or only the important thing of improving the diabetic retinopathy, but to prevent the onset of vision threatening diabetic retinopathy, the vision threatening complications, the sight threatening. And we're going to be able to look at those data from a PANORAMA study later this year. But I do think that this is like any other market, I mean, if you go back, I remember our Chairman, Roy Vagelos, told me that when he launched the first statin, the cardiologists told him, well, there's no real need for a statin, we can control all that with diet and exercise and that was the prevailing view. So there is work that you have to do to change the practice of medicine based on data. It doesn't happen overnight. It takes really strong data, a really strong commercial effort. We're really excited how Marion has integrated so quickly into the organization and she's taken that on as something that's really important to us. So we're looking forward, over the years to come, to have success in that area. There was a recent approval by the FDA by a small company of a untethered device. That is a device that could diagnose diabetic retinopathy and whether or not you should urgently see a retinal specialist merely by – that could sit in a drug store, it could sit in your general practice office, it could sit in your ophthalmologist, it could sit with the optometrist. And it's been approved, it doesn't need a doctor to administer. You just take a non-dilated picture of the retina. And so – and they've found sort of striking data, which the FDA approved the drug on. And I think more to come about how underdiagnosed this condition is when you have a powerful and broad screening. And there were a lot of other efforts just to do the exact same thing in terms of machine learning or, as you call it, artificial intelligence. So we think that when you have a treatment and we have the broad label then you can start to push at the front end of the people who could really benefit and I think there's a lot of them. In terms of the RTH data, didn't see very much new there. What I heard about was that I think it was in the mid-80s percentile of those people who went on to the 12-week data, could stay on the 12-week data. But at the end of the day, you can slice this data up any which way you want. You're still getting about 50-odd-percent of people who can go to every 12-weeks. And based on – and they haven't identified people because if you look carefully, the people who don't succeed at 12-weeks are the ones that lost, I think, a significant amount of vision was one of the criteria. So I think we have to see how all that plays out, what the label really looks like, and certainly, we wish them luck because we do – because I know they're listening to what I say, so good luck to them. But I also would say that if something comes along that can help patients, that's okay with us. EYLEA is a high bar and people should be chasing that, we hope, for years to come. George wanted to add one thing.
George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Yeah, I wanted to expand on one thing that Len said. And, Phil, you referred to the fact that in some ways doctors are perhaps a little cautious about treating patients with diabetic retinopathy and they have views on that. I think one key aspect of the studies that we're undertaking right now, sort of like what we did with Praluent, is to define the patients who are at the highest risk of vision threatening complications. So you might imagine that everybody, patients and doctors, would be much more interested in using a very effective preventative therapy if they knew they had a very, very high risk of having a catastrophic event that could cost them their vision. So part of the aspect of our studies is not only to show that we're effective at preventing these events, but identifying the segment of the population that is at highest need for needing such a therapy because they're at such a high risk.
Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Operator, next question please.
Operator: Next we have Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan.
Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to ask about how we should be thinking with regards to the reimbursement landscape with PCSK9s going forward. Should we expect more exclusive contracts with payers similar to the one announced with ESI? And maybe more broadly along those lines, are you getting the sense of how payers are thinking about the best way to define a high-risk patient population that would benefit most from Praluent? Thanks
George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: This is obviously a highly competitive space. There's another PCSK9 inhibitor out there, obviously. So we can't sort of peel back too much, but we are excited about the fact that there is a possibility to improve the access. Make it easy for patients to get the prescription that the doctor writes, that it will be approved and make it so the patients can afford it. We also, the third pillar of all that which I don't want to get lost, is we want to make sure that there's some – a profit left for the innovators on both sides, so that we don't wind up racing to a place where there's no profit. So it's a delicate compelling marketplace. That's about all we with can say out there but we're working hard to get access and affordability.
Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Operator, next question please. And also in the interest of time this will be our last question. But we will be available to answer questions following this call so please send me an e-mail and we'll set some time up for a follow-up call.
Operator: We have Geoff Meacham from Barclays.
Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys.
Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Hello?
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Hello? We didn't hear you. Great last question.
Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Geoff, we lost you.
Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Operator...
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Well, let me ask the question for Geoff. That was a great quarter, Len. Thanks very much for all that and it's fairly self-explanatory. All right. I think that wraps its up.
Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Operator, that concludes our call today.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.

Once our call concludes, Bob Landry and the IR team will be available to answer further questions. With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Thank you, Manisha, and good morning to everyone who has joined us on the call and webcast today. 2017 was a strong and significant year for Regeneron with important progress on clinical, commercial and regulatory fronts and solid financial results. We received regulatory approval for two important new drugs: Dupixent, an IL-4, IL-13 inhibitor for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis; and Kevzara, an IL-6 receptor antibody for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Both of these drugs have been approved in the U.S., Europe and Japan, with launches under way in several countries. Our innovation engine continues to be productive. We currently have 15 product candidates in clinical development and expect to advance four to six new product candidates into the clinic this year. Our commercial pipeline and regulatory progress give us confidence that we are well positioned for sustainable, long-term growth. Importantly, two of our product candidates, dupilumab for allergic diseases and cemiplimab for cancer, each represent a single molecule with the potential for significant opportunities across multiple diseases and are truly pipelines within a product. Turning now to EYLEA, I would like to address the demographic trends that continue to favor EYLEA, the opportunities in diabetic eye diseases which tend to be underdiagnosed and undertreated, an issue we plan to address, and our thoughts on some of the recent competitive developments. EYLEA has been in the market now for over six years in the United States and despite no price increase since launch, it has continued to deliver impressive growth. EYLEA net sales grew 11% year-over-year in the U.S. and 19% year-over-year outside the U.S. Much of the recent growth in the U.S. was driven by demographic trends with an aging population, as well as an overall increase in the prevalence of diabetes. These demographic trends are expected to continue in the coming years, providing an opportunity for continued growth. Focusing on diabetic eye diseases, currently the majority of patients with diabetic eye disease are underdiagnosed and undertreated, and even when they are treated, they may not be receiving optimal anti-VEGF therapy, which in several studies has been shown to be superior to laser therapy. Patients with diabetes are at risk for losing vision, because of diseased blood vessels in the eye. Vascular leak leads to retinal swelling and vision loss, or what is known as diabetic macular edema, a major indication where EYLEA is currently approved. Based upon physician survey data, approximately between 25% and 30% of our total EYLEA net sales in the United States come from DME. It is estimated that only 8% of patients diagnosed with DME receive treatment with an anti-VEGF agent representing an important growth opportunity for EYLEA. The efficacy of EYLEA in DME has been proven over years in multiple studies including those performed by independent groups. As a reminder, data from the NIH-sponsored comparative effectiveness Protocol T have demonstrated at the end of one year when the primary endpoint was assessed, EYLEA treatment resulted in significantly greater gains in visual acuity compared to both Lucentis and Avastin, particularly in those who had vision worse than 20/40. Diabetic retinopathy without diabetic macular edema, an indication we are investigating EYLEA in Phase 3, is another important and attractive opportunity. About 3.5 million people in the United States are diagnosed with diabetic retinopathy without diabetic macular edema. Of these, about 1 million patients have either proliferative diabetic retinopathy or severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. And it is these patients who have the greatest unmet need and are at high risk for profound vision loss. The majority of patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy are currently being treated with pan-retinal photocoagulation or laser therapy. In the CLARITY study in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy published in The Lancet, EYLEA resulted in superior visual outcomes compared to laser treatment. We anticipate in the first half of the year, top line data from our Phase 3 study of EYLEA in diabetic retinopathy, followed by a potential regulatory submission later this year. In addition, the DRCR.net is also conducting an independent Phase 3 study of EYLEA in the diabetic retinopathy indication. In addition to well established efficacy and safety, another important aspect for physicians and patients is to have flexible dosing regimen that includes monthly dosing for those patients who may benefit from more frequent dosing as well as having the flexibility to have a longer interval between doses. EYLEA provides this important flexibility for physicians and patients and is approved for monthly as well as every other month dosing. In addition, we have submitted an sBLA for every three-month dosing in wet AMD and expect an FDA decision in August. As a reminder, in our Phase 3 studies, we demonstrated that about 50% of patients could be dosed every 12 weeks. We also continue to advance our preclinical research on extended release and gene therapy approaches. We are focused on continuing to maintain our leadership position with EYLEA in the retinal space. Like you, we are well aware of emerging potential competitors for EYLEA. We will continue to execute on our long-term strategy, which includes growing the overall market, specifically in diabetic eye diseases, expanding the treatment interval options in the label and gaining approval in additional indications. We do not expect any new entrants until about the latter half of 2019. And even if approved, the first potential competitor will be limited initially to the wet AMD indication. EYLEA has set a very high bar by demonstrating efficacy and safety across a spectrum of retinal diseases, both in company-sponsored as well as independently-conducted studies. The retinal community has deep experience with EYLEA with about 8 million injections given in the United States alone since launch. There has been significant concern and debate as to whether long-term treatment with anti-VEGF agents can maintain early vision gains. For example, in a five-year follow-up of the NIH-sponsored CATT study comparing Lucentis and Avastin, early visual gains obtained with anti-VEGF agents were not maintained over the long term. And in fact, visual acuity reported at year five was below baseline levels prior to treatment and patients had lost on average over three letters compared to their original baseline, and 20% of patients had regressed to become legally blind. Some have raised theoretical concerns that chronic VEGF inhibition in the eye might result in deleterious effects such as geographic atrophy. But in contrast to the observation with intraocular Lucentis and Avastin in CATT and the theoretical concerns about chronic VEGF inhibition, we have shown that chronic regular treatment with EYLEA results in visual gains that were maintained through four years of follow-up. At the upcoming angiogenesis meeting at the Bascom Palmer Institute (sic) [Bascom Palmer Eye Institute], real-world data on visual acuity outcomes following treatment with intravitreal anti-VEGF agents will address the issue of whether underdosing is contributing to poorer visual outcomes over the long term. As a reminder, a variety of retinal diseases are treated by the same specialists, who can choose which buy-and-bill products they want to use in their practice. We believe the extensive data, combined with real-world experience, broad label and treatment flexibility offered by EYLEA will make it an attractive treatment option for years to come. It will be quite a while before any emerging competitor can come close to matching the breadth of approved indications and the depth of long-term experience offered by EYLEA. Two potential competitor programs you may have been hearing about are a bispecific Ang2 and VEGF antibody and a single-chain antibody fragment VEGF inhibitor, and many of our investors have asked for our thoughts on the competitive threats they pose. Both of these are studying higher molar concentrations of their drugs compared to the currently approved anti-VEGF drugs, with the primary goal of increasing visual acuity and/or extending the interval between injections. For example, the doses being investigated with the bispecific RG7716 are between two to seven times the molar concentration of the Lucentis comparator in the trial. The single-chain antibody fragment, brolucizumab, also known as RTH258, studied doses that were up to 12 times the molar concentration of EYLEA. Despite this twelvefold increase in molar dose in both Phase 3 studies, the high dose of brolucizumab did not demonstrate superiority to EYLEA in terms of visual acuity, nor did it consistently extend the dosage interval to 12 weeks in all patients as almost half the patients failed quarterly treatments and had to be returned to more frequent dosing. Brolucizumab demonstrated statistical non-inferiority to EYLEA on vision in both studies. It was, however, slightly numerically albeit not statistically inferior to EYLEA on vision in both studies. There is a known potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events following the intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors as stated in our label as well as the Lucentis label. The Lucentis label additionally states that fatal events occurred more frequently in patients with diabetic macular edema and diabetic retinopathy at baseline who were treated with monthly Lucentis. Therefore, given the high molar doses studied by both potential competitors, it will be important to see the assessment by regulatory authorities regarding the balance of safety and efficacy that these new agents might provide, particularly in the elderly and in diabetics before we are able to evaluate the extent of competitive risk to EYLEA. Turning to Dupixent, our drug for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, it continues to gain momentum in the ongoing launch. Global fourth quarter net sales of Dupixent were $139 million, representing a 56% increase compared to the third quarter of 2017. Apart from a dip in the early part of the year due to the holidays and required reauthorizations at the beginning of the year, we are continuing to see a strong weekly number of approximately 500 new-to-brand scripts as tracked by the NBRx number. The prescriber number has increased to over 8,500 and the first renewal rate remains high at above 90%. The feedback from physicians and patients continues to be positive about the efficacy and safety of the product although we are hearing some frustrations about the processes that payers have put in place in order to get the prescription approved, even where formulary decisions have been made. We and our collaborator, Sanofi, are working to ensure that eligible patients have fair access to this important breakthrough medication. Our market research indicates that some health care providers are prescribing Dupixent to their most severe patients, which suggests there is significant continued growth potential. We continue to work on raising patient awareness and on educating patients and health care providers about new treatment options as well as working on improving access. The launch of Dupixent outside the United States is under way with the drug now approved in several European countries and in Japan. The emerging clinical data with dupilumab strengthened our belief that the IL-4/13 pathway is a key driver of several allergic or type 2 diseases. We have recently submitted a supplemental BLA for dupilumab in the uncontrolled asthma setting and expect a regulatory decision in the second half of this year. George will provide you with an update on the ongoing development programs with dupilumab in several indications. We, along our collaborator, Sanofi, have recently increased our financial commitment to these programs in an effort to accelerate and expand the dupilumab and IL-33 antibody programs. Bob will address the details of the financial agreement. The launch of Kevzara for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is under way in the United States as well as in countries outside the U.S. On the access front in the U.S., we have payer contracts that took effect at the beginning of the year with some offering favorable positioning and market access for Kevzara. Outside the U.S., the drug continues to receive favorable reimbursement reviews and country-specific launches are under way. Turning now to Praluent, we will be presenting data from the 18,000 patient ODYSSEY cardiovascular outcomes study on March 10 at the meeting of the American College of Cardiology. To be clear, the study has not yet been unblinded. We believe that the PCSK9 inhibitor class holds tremendous promise despite the slow initial uptake, and we look forward to providing you with additional information after the outcomes data become available. 2018 will be an important year for Regeneron with several significant events anticipated, including two new potential approvals, dupilumab in asthma and cemiplimab, our PD-1 antibody in advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, which will mark our entry into the exciting and rapidly evolving field of immuno-oncology. We anticipate completion of the cemiplimab BLA submission in the first quarter and are preparing for the launch. While our initial indication will be advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, additional studies are either under way or planned in several other indications, including first and second line non-small cell lung cancer and cervical cancer. As recently announced, we along with our collaborator, Sanofi, have increased our investment in immuno-oncology with the aim of advancing and accelerating these important programs. On the corporate front, we have recruited a new head of commercial who will be joining us later in the quarter. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to George.
George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Thank you, Len, and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us today. As Len mentioned, 2018 is shaping up to be a very busy and important year for Regeneron. I'd like to begin with Dupixent in atopic dermatitis where the drug is currently approved for use in adult patients. However, there is an unmet need in pediatric atopic dermatitis patients where the current treatment options are limited. We are conducting three Phase 3 studies in atopic dermatitis in children between the ages of 6 months and 17 years. The first of these in children between the ages of 12 and 17 years is fully enrolled, and we expect to report data by midyear and submit a supplemental BLA in the United States in the second half of the year. In asthma, we have reported positive data from three separate pivotal studies of dupilumab with profound benefits on the two major endpoints of exacerbations and improvement in lung function as measured by FEV1. These improvements were observed in the overall population and were even more pronounced in the patient population with a more allergic phenotype as defined by biomarkers such as eosinophils corresponding to approximately half of the patients in these studies. One of our pivotal studies was conducted in a severe patient population that was dependent on oral steroids. In this severe population, patients treated with dupilumab saw significant reduction in their exacerbations as well as improvements in their lung function. These findings were even more striking since more than half the patients in this study were able to completely eliminate their use of oral steroids. We, along with our collaborator, Sanofi, have submitted a supplemental BMA (sic) [BLA] (18:53) in the asthma indication and look forward to a regulatory decision in the second half of the year. A Phase 3 study of dupilumab in pediatric asthma patients between the ages of 6 and 11 years is ongoing. We have compelling Phase 2 data for the use of dupilumab in other allergic indications as well, including nasal polyps and eosinophilic esophagitis, and have scientific rationale to believe that dupilumab could be used in several additional indications including food and inhaled allergies. Two Phase 3 studies of dupilumab in nasal polyps are now fully enrolled, and we expect top line data at the end of the year. Our positive Phase 2 data in eosinophilic esophagitis was believed to result from unidentified food allergies, bolsters our belief that dupilumab has the potential to be used in food allergies themselves. This was further supported by our preclinical models which have shown that dupilumab accelerates and improves desensitization to food allergens. Our first study in people with food allergy will be with peanuts and conducted in collaboration with Aimmune Therapeutics. We expect to initiate this Phase 2 study in the second half of the year. We also expect to initiate a Phase 2 study of dupilumab for desensitization of patients with allergies to airborne allergens later this year. One of the most exciting opportunities and benefits that dupilumab can provide to patients is that it may be able to simultaneously address multiple manifestations of allergic disease in the same patient. As has been widely appreciated previously, and as confirmed in many of our own studies, patients suffering from one allergic disease often suffer from another. For example, in our atopic dermatitis program, about 40% of the patients had asthma and up to 50% of the patients had allergic rhinitis. In initial attempts to explore such opportunities in allergic patients, we recently reported in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology that dupilumab significantly improved allergic rhinitis associated nasal symptoms in patients with uncontrolled persistent asthma. Regeneron 3500, our antibody to the interleukin 33 ligand, is an exciting program that we believe has the potential both on its own as well as in combination with dupilumab to bring benefit to patients. Research performed by our Regeneron Genetic Center team has provided genetic validation for interleukin 33 as a strong target. For example, there are common gain-of-function variants in interleukin 33 that increase the risk of asthma, while loss-of-function mutations conversely decrease the risk. Preclinical data that we have generated has shown that IL-33 could work in a manner that is complementary to dupilumab. We're currently planning studies of this IL-33 antibody in asthma, COPD and atopic dermatitis. I'd like to turn now to immuno-oncology, which continues to be one of the most exciting areas of development for us and where we have adopted a multipronged approach encompassing checkpoint inhibitors such as cemiplimab, our PD-1 antibody, bispecific antibodies as well as other modalities. Having multiple approaches available under one roof will give us the flexibility and nimbleness to explore the use of combination therapies. We view cemiplimab as the foundational therapy upon which we will build additional combinations in a thoughtful and logical manner. Our recent positive study with cemiplimab in patients with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, most of whom had failed surgery and multiple lines of prior therapies, demonstrated an impressive response rate of 46%, which is among the highest observed to-date with a PD-1 targeting agent in solid tumors. Importantly, a majority of the responses were durable. The safety profile observed has been generally consistent with this class. Based on these data, we expect to complete our regulatory submission to the FDA by the end of the first quarter, with the European Union submission expected in the first half. Cemiplimab has been granted breakthrough designation status by the FDA for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Because of the intense activity in the PD-1/PD-L1 space with over 1,000 ongoing clinical studies, many were surprised that we were able to identify an important unmet medical need setting that yielded such robust demonstration of activity and which has provided us with a fast-to-market opportunity. To be clear, we view cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma as a significant and important opportunity on its own. However, and just as importantly, this cancer setting allowed us to obtain a foothold into the arena of immuno-oncology and we hope will establish cemiplimab as a foundation for our future combination approaches. We're also making significant progress with cemiplimab in our other indications such as first and second line non-small cell lung cancer, and several other settings where we either have ongoing or planned studies. We're exploring the use of cemiplimab both as monotherapy and also in combination with other molecules such as our own additional checkpoint inhibitors, immunomodulator such as CD38 and multiple vaccine approaches, and perhaps most interestingly, in combination with molecules coming from our bispecific platform. Speaking of our bispecific technology, we think it can offer opportunities related to those seen with cell-based therapies such as the CAR T approaches. We believe if our bispecifics can approach the level of activities seen with the CAR Ts, their ease of production and administration, which is more akin to that of traditional biologics, might provide a major advance for patients. Our lead program here, a CD20/CD3 bispecific continues to advance in the clinic. After careful dose escalation process to mitigate the side effects of cytokine release syndrome, we have recently reported dosing levels that have achieved 50% response rates without any dose limiting toxicities. And we continue dose escalation. We are encouraged by the activity that we are observing at these higher dose levels and look forward to reporting these data as they mature at a future meeting. We expect to move two additional CD3 bispecific candidates into the clinic this year, a bispecific antibody to MUC16 and another to BCMA. Fasinumab, our Phase 3 NGF antibody program for pain continues to advance in the clinic with Phase 3 studies, in osteoarthritis and chronic lower back pain. We don't have time to discuss all of our early stage programs or the additional candidates that we plan to advance into clinical development this year. However, one early stage program that I would like to highlight is the combination of our activin A and GDF8 antibodies. Regeneron scientists made the discovery that activin A might be as, if not more, important than GDF8, also known as myostatin, for controlling muscle mass in primates. Consistent with this, we recently announced that a combination of our activin A and GDF8 antibodies resulted in dose dependent increases in muscle volume of up to 8% after a single dose in normal healthy volunteers with an acceptable safety profile. We're expecting to commence follow-up clinical studies of this combination. As a reminder, we're also studying our activin A antibody alone as monotherapy in the ultra-orphan disease, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva or FOP. Lastly, I want to take a moment to comment on our recently announced consortium of biopharma companies to help fund the study of (26:30) 500,000 individuals in the United Kingdom Biobank. The Regeneron Genetics Center expects to carry out and complete this work by the end of next year, providing a near-term treasure trove of genetic insights, coupled with clinical imaging and other rich genotype data which is available in the UK Biobank. Importantly, these results will be made available publicly, providing the first such big data research resource that all researchers worldwide will have access to. Many believe that this will serve as a great accelerant for both academic and biopharma research. We think it makes a great statement that so many from the biopharma community have stepped forward to help co-fund this effort including, AbbVie, Alnylam, AstraZeneca, Biogen and Pfizer. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob Landry.
Robert E. Landry - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. Regeneron posted strong fourth quarter 2017 financial results. We finished the year with continued sequential growth within our global EYLEA franchise, positive momentum with our U.S. Dupixent launch, the execution of several business development transactions and expanded funding for cemiplimab and dupilumab under our Sanofi collaboration. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we earned $5.23 per diluted share from non-GAAP net income of $607 million. For the full year 2017, we earned $16.32 per diluted share from non-GAAP net income of $1.9 billion. This represents a year-over-year increase in non-GAAP diluted EPS and net income of 72% for the fourth quarter, and a year-over-year increase of 44% in non-GAAP diluted EPS and net income for the full year of 2017. Regeneron's fourth quarter 2017 non-GAAP net income excludes non-cash share-based compensation expense, the $25 million upfront payment made in connection with our agreement with Decibel Therapeutics, the income tax effect of non-GAAP reconciling items, and a onetime provisional charge related to enactment of the Tax Cuts and Job Act (sic) [Tax Cuts and Jobs Act], a full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is set forth in our earnings release which can be found on our website. Total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $1.58 billion and $5.87 billion for the full year 2017, which represented year-over-year growth of 29% for the three months ended December 31, 2017, and 21% for the full year of 2017. EYLEA net product sales in the United States were $975 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $3.7 billion for the full year of 2017, compared to $858 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $3.32 billion for the full year of 2016, which represents an increase of 14% and 11% respectively. U.S. EYLEA distributor inventory experienced a slight increase as compared to the third quarter of 2017, yet remained within our normal one- to two-week targeted range. Ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales, which are recorded by our collaborator, Bayer, were $637 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, representing a 28% increase over the fourth quarter of 2016 on a reported basis and 23% on a constant currency basis. For the full year of 2017, global EYLEA net product sales were nearly $6 billion. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Regeneron recognized $231 million from our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the United States and $802 million for the full year of 2017. Total Bayer collaboration revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $297 million and $938 million for the full year of 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company reported that the results from two Phase 2 studies of EYLEA, in combination with nesvacumab, an antibody to ANG2 did not provide sufficient differentiation to warrant Phase 3 development. Consequently, Bayer collaboration revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 includes $37 million of revenue related to the acceleration of the recognition of deferred revenue from the upfront payment previously received from Bayer. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $200 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $877 million for the full year of 2017. The Sanofi collaboration revenue line item primarily consists of reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred R&D expenses, reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred commercialization-related expenses, and the recognition of deferred revenue from the antibody and immuno-oncology upfront payments, partly offset by our share of losses in connection with the commercialization of antibodies. Global sales of Dupixent, Praluent and Kevzara, as recorded by our collaborator, Sanofi, for the fourth quarter of 2017 were: Dupixent, $139 million; Praluent, $63 million; and Kevzara, $9 million. For both Dupixent and Kevzara, the sales were almost exclusively U.S.-based. Despite higher Dupixent and Praluent sales in the fourth quarter of 2017, our share of losses in connection with commercialization of Dupixent, Praluent and Kevzara was $114 million, compared to a loss of $126 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. As a reminder, we anticipated a higher Alliance loss in connection with the commercialization of antibodies in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus the third quarter as the Alliance's profitability was negatively impacted this quarter by increased global launches to support Kevzara and Dupixent. Regeneron's share of losses in connection with the commercialization of antibodies for the full year 2017 was $443 million as compared to losses of $459 million for the full year 2016. The fourth quarter 2017 Sanofi collaboration revenue did benefit from an acceleration of the recognition of deferred revenue in connection with the termination of the Antibody Discovery Agreement on December 31, 2017. However, as mentioned during last quarter's call, the $130 million of 2017 annual funding from Sanofi under the Antibody Discovery Agreement was fully utilized during the first nine months of 2017, which attributed to the lower reimbursement of Regeneron R&D expenses realized this quarter as compared to the first three quarters of 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2017, other revenue was $107 million versus $52 million during the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase was primarily due to the reimbursements from our collaborator, Teva, for the development of fasinumab along with a $35 million fasinumab development milestone the company earned and recognized into revenue. For further details you can find a summary of the full year components of other revenue in the MD&A section of our 10-K, which will be filed later today. Turning now to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses was $444 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $1.78 billion for the full year of 2017. Our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as the total non-GAAP R&D expense less R&D reimbursements from our collaborators, was $265 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, and $877 million for the full year 2017. Our press release includes all the information that is required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense. For 2018, we'd like to reaffirm our previously provided guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to be in the range of $1.23 billion to $1.33 billion. Next, non-GAAP SG&A expense was $348 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $1.11 billion for the full year 2017. As noted, on our November 2017 earnings call, we realized a higher SG&A spend level in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to the first three quarters of 2017, primarily due to incremental spend on our two recently launched products, Dupixent and Kevzara, an increase in commercialization related expenses associated with EYLEA as well as prelaunch expenses for the anticipated 2018 U.S. approvals for cemiplimab in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and dupilumab for asthma. The increased 2017 fourth quarter spend was also influenced by the acceleration of discretionary expenses to secure tax deductions in 2017. We reaffirm our previous guidance for non-GAAP SG&A expense in 2018 to be in the range of $1.35 billion and $1.45 billion. The increase in our forecasted 2018 non-GAAP SG&A expense is primarily driven by increased commercial support for Dupixent, both atopic dermatitis and potential asthma indication, EYLEA with an increased focus on diabetic eye disease, Praluent which incorporates increased spending post ODYSSEY OUTCOMES results and cemiplimab. Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization related expenses, a line item found within Sanofi collaboration revenue, was $118 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $369 million for the full year of 2017. We reaffirm our full year 2018 guidance for Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization related expenses in 2018 to be in the range of $450 million and $500 million. Non-GAAP cost of goods sold and non-GAAP cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing increased for the fourth quarter 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to drug substance manufacturing costs associated with the sales of Dupixent and increases in Limerick's manufacturing start-up costs which were anticipated. We are pleased to report that in December 2017, our facility in Limerick underwent a successful FDA preapproval inspection, resulting in a license to manufacture Praluent for the U.S. market. Turning now to taxes. Our effective tax rate was 69% and 42% for the fourth quarter and full year 2017, respectively, as compared to approximately 26% and 33% for the fourth quarter and full year 2016. The effective tax rate for both the fourth quarter and full year 2017 was negatively impacted by the provisional charge related to the remeasurement of the company's U.S. net deferred tax assets upon the December 2017 enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, partly offset by the tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation. Excluding the impact of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, our effective tax rate would have been 10% and 27% for the fourth quarter and full year 2017. For the full year 2018, we are reaffirming our guidance for our effective tax rate to be in the range of 15% to 19% which includes the estimated impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. As discussed at the JPMorgan conference last month, the 2018 benefit that we expect to realize from U.S. corporate tax reform is being reinvested into the business by increasing our investment in research and development and additional expansion of our U.S. facilities to support future growth. This has been incorporated into our 2018 guidance. From a cash flow and balance sheet perspective, we ended the fourth quarter of 2017 with cash and marketable securities of $2.9 billion and generated full year free cash flow in excess of $1 billion. Our capital expenditures for the full year 2017 were $273 million. As we enter 2018, we are reaffirming our previous capital expenditure guidance of between $420 million and $500 million. Our principal driver of increased capital expenditures in 2018 is for the expansion of a portion of our facilities at our Rensselaer, New York manufacturing location as well as expenditures for our Limerick manufacturing facilities, and continued expansion and renovation of our laboratory space within our Tarrytown, New York facilities. Finally, as announced in early January, Regeneron and Sanofi agreed to accelerate and expand the investment for the clinical development of cemiplimab to a minimum of $1.64 billion, an increase of nearly $1 billion over the budget set forth in the original immuno-oncology licensing collaboration agreement and to allocate additional funds to certain activities relating to the development of dupilumab and Regeneron 3500, our IL-33 antibody. As part of the agreement, the company agreed to grant a limited waiver of the lockup in the amended and restated Investor Agreement so that Sanofi may sell up to an aggregate of 1.4 million shares of Regeneron common stock through the end of 2020, representing approximately 6% of the shares of Regeneron common stock Sanofi currently owns. If we do not elect to repurchase such shares from Sanofi, Sanofi may sell the applicable number of shares subject to certain daily and quarterly limits in one or more open market transactions. With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Manisha.
Manisha Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Thank you, Bob. Jason, that concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. And our first question comes from Alethia Young from Credit Suisse.
Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to talk a little bit more about immuno-oncology. It seems like it's kind of under-appreciated when we talk to investors, but can you talk a little bit more about your PD-1 strategy and your bispecific strategy? How does it all fit together, and maybe just a little bit more color on what you're doing in BCMA? Thanks.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: George?
George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Sure. We're very excited obviously about our PD-1 program and that, as we noted, I think we surprised a lot of people by finding an important indication, which was very responsive to our antibody and where we're hoping to get a rapid approval. And as we've said, we think this setting is actually a pretty important one, perhaps on par with that of melanoma and with substantial growth opportunity. But as we also said, we think that not only is it an important indication in and of itself, but it serves as a foundation to have our PD-1 antibody serve as a foundation for combination approaches going forward. We have a series of additional combination opportunities, some of which we've already initiated, whether it'd be with things like a variety of vaccines, in many cases that we're partnering with, or with additional checkpoint inhibitors that we've developed internally. But perhaps we're most excited about our bispecifics. As we've noted, our first bispecific is finally getting to dosing levels that are showing pretty substantial efficacy in our early trials. And we think if our bispecifics start approaching, which we think they're beginning to, the sort of type of responses that people are reporting with CAR Ts, they could really represent a very, very important opportunity. And the thing that's also exciting about it is, our strategy includes both combining our bispecifics with our PD-1 as well as our bispecifics with each other. We have a number of bispecifics that at least, in our preclinical model, look like they can be additive, if not synergistic in their responses. And because these are all coming from our laboratories and we have the abilities to study them preclinically as well as the ability to expedite studying them clinically, we think this offers an enormous opportunity for us to really try these combinations and look for advances that they can actually provide together. So, for us, it's a very exciting opportunity. We think we already have our foothold, as we said, and we hope in the near future to be establishing, not only our first bispecific but a series of additional bispecifics as we said where we will be putting at least two in the clinic this year and a whole series of them shortly thereafter. So we think it's an exciting time, and it's a lot of opportunity.
Manisha Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Next, we have Geoffrey Porges from Leerink Partners.
Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC: Thanks very much, and I appreciate the question. A financial one and an R&D one quickly. Bob, on the SG&A, it stepped up significantly and you highlighted that, and it looks as though it's going to be annualizing in 2018 as much the same rate as Q4. Could you talk about what the drivers are there? Have you sort of stood up your sales forces yet for both asthma and for the PD-1? And is there any sense that you might be able to redeploy some of your commercial expense away from Praluent over towards Dupixent, some of those other opportunities perhaps tighten up on that SG&A ratio? And then, quickly, just George, could you tell us what sort of dosing you expect to be likely for your bispecifics that you've learnt more about the characteristics of the first one?
Robert E. Landry - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Sure, Geoff. I'll answer the first one. And probably something that we haven't given a ton of color about, but with regards to kind of our fourth quarter SG&A spend, we always kind of get this annual seasonal EYLEA increase as we have to kind of reauthorize the insurance coverage and the reverification processes that have again. Obviously, the docs like this, so when the EYLEA patients come in the early January, the insurance is already in place and this is not a kind of a whole new start for them. So we do incur a decent amount of incremental spend that you don't necessarily see during the first three quarters in 2017 in the fourth quarter. And again, we did something similar in 2016. Again, as we incurred in the fourth quarter of 2017, we are picking up spend for Kevzara and Dupixent. Again, after controlling Praluent for the first three quarters, we did additionally have an increase in Praluent fourth quarter spend. And as I alluded to, we did accelerate, Geoff, some 2017, in particular, G&A expenses into the fourth quarter. That probably ideally would have been a January incurrence. So, again, that's creating a little bit of the bump that you're seeing when you compare to the first three quarters of 2017. As we get into 2018, again, we're putting a lot of money with regards to Dupixent in atopic dermatitis. We also have a lot of money laid out with regards to the launch of ASTHMA, which as you know, is going to be a very, very competitive field. And again, we continue on with Kevzara and we're assuming positive ODYSSEY OUTCOMES results on Praluent and we're putting the necessary dollars behind that.
George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Okay. And, Geoff, this is George. Just regarding to your question about the bispecifics, I think that a couple of very important things that we learned, and I think these are some of the reasons why this is such an attractive class and in particular may offer some advantages over some of these cellular therapy approaches, where a lot of the major concern is controlling the cytokine release storm and other adverse events in which the cells might be attacking the host. Most importantly, we've learned that we can actually gradually up the dose in time in an individual patient. So we can start with a lower dose, gradually remove the target, and so we don't get an immediate blast of cytokine release storm. And then we continue to dose up. And we've now gotten up what we reported recently at ASH, our doses between 5 milligrams to 8 milligrams in terms of efficacy, where we reported these efficacy numbers of about 50% response rates and we also reported there that we had gotten to 12 milligram as a dose and we reported the safety profile there, but now we've even gone further beyond that dose. These are still relatively low doses compared to standard biologics, but we've certainly seen that it seems like it really dramatically ups the efficacy range when you get to these levels. But I think a huge advantage here is understanding that you can gradually increase the dose and this way you really ameliorate the onset of these adverse events and you can keep them under control and then get up to the higher doses. And then, of course, another major advantage is, if need be, you can back off the dose if you actually have to. But as a class now, I think that we understand the doses that we have to get to for efficacy, but also how to gradually get to those doses in an individual patient so that they can be well-tolerated.
Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC: Great. Thanks very much.
Manisha Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Next question, please.
George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: (47:58) I had a question for Geoff, by the way. I remember you said, oh, if in our muscle program we produce 5% to 10% increases in muscle mass, you'd get pretty excited. So what do you think about that?
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: He has no time to answer. Right now, he's already shut out of the line. Next question.
Operator: Thank you. And next we have Chris Raymond from Piper Jaffray.
Christopher J. Raymond - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thanks. Had a question on fasinumab and also Kevzara, if you don't mind. So just on fasinumab, just looking at the long-term safety study in way of the knee (48:32), I think, which looks to be reading out this year. I wonder if you could maybe put some brackets around the sort of margin of error on the safety side in terms of what you think will be acceptable in light of the need for obviously non-opioid alternatives. And then also on Kevzara, I think it's fairly clear now that offering a lower cost is not necessarily an important thing for payers and PBMs, especially in the immunology space and in fact may even hurt you. Just wondering if you can talk about what can be done now with Kevzara to inflect that revenue curve upward. Thanks.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Right. So maybe George will comment on the NGF and, this is Len, I'll take the Kevzara question.
George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Right. As you said, the story with NGF we think is one where there's an enormous opportunity balanced by a significant risk. I think a lot of people are aware of the risk about this issue of potentially accelerating arthritis in some patients and the question is the degree of tolerance of this acceleration. And remind you, one of the theories for this acceleration may simply be that when you cause pain relief, people over-use their joints but still the mechanism is not that well understood. In terms of the benefit/risk profile and understanding what could be tolerated, we can't answer that exactly, but we think that what we're using as a sort of barometer is that these patients are already late stage patients, who are in many cases candidates for total joint replacements. So I think that that's a good way to sort of gate the adverse events and how they're impacting. If overall, you're not causing an increase in the total number of joints that are adversely affected to the point where you need to get a total joint replacement and, if anything, if maybe you're preventing such events, while in some patients you're causing this acceleration, I think that would be considered a favorable benefit/risk profile if overall in the vast population you're relieving pain. So if you're relieving pain in the large percentage of the population and you're not contributing or, if anything, you're preventing total joint replacements, I think that would be viewed as a profound positive.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: As to the Kevzara question, we refuse to believe that a drug with the strong profile that Kevzara has and the favorable pricing that we have offered cannot make sense in an environment where cost of medicines is a major concern. We applaud the actions of CVS, who gave us – who recognized that and gave us a good position on the formulary. We would be very disappointed and we'll be very vocal if it can't be that a drug with such good properties and such favorable pricing can't make strong headway. So we've got our work cut out. Our new head of commercial is up to the challenge and so we will report back to you as we go.
Manisha Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Next we have Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. First one maybe on ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study since it's going to read out soon. Your competitor Repatha did not show any benefit in cardiovascular mortality. So how important do you think it will be for your drug Praluent to show that benefit? And then secondly, can you talk about life-cycle management strategy for EYLEA now that it seems Ang2 is not going to be going forward into Phase 3? Thank you.
George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Sure. So just to cover ODYSSEY, I don't think that it's worth, Ying, speculating too much on what this result or what that result might be since we don't know the results, but we'll know the results by the March 10 ACC event. So I think we'll all look at the events together basically and we'll be able to judge then. About EYLEA.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: In terms of EYLEA, let me just say that I think we've tried to highlight a couple of things. People ask us a lot about competition. I think it takes a lot to compete in this space. You need a drug that can be given as safely and effectively. You need a drug that can be given as frequently as monthly because patients who turn out that every other month is not enough, doctors desperately want to be able to give them monthly and you need to have that in the label so you can get reimbursed for that higher dosing. You need a drug that has evidence of the long-term maintenance of vision, which has been a question in this field, and you need a drug that has all the indications covered. The new entrants have yet to start or are only about to start Phase 3 trials. The RTH258 is just about to start or maybe just getting under way in terms of a DME and so they'll be coming to market sometime we believe in 2019 based on their disclosures which would come to market without, as far as we can tell, a monthly label so you can't use it monthly and without a DME label since they haven't even started their Phase 3 trials. And, of course, when we developed EYLEA we struck a very careful balance which is what we tried to emphasize between safety and efficacy. When you give these anti-VEGF agents in the eye, they go into the systemic circulation. In fact, the very doctor who presented the RTH258 data was the one who was most critical that he didn't want to give our drug to his grandmother because of some subset and the risk of some systemic thromboembolic event. When you now start to give 6 to 12 times the molar dose into the eye, it's hard to ignore the fact that safety, particularly for example in diabetics, which hasn't been evaluated yet, and the careful safety evaluation that the agency will give that's going to be an important part of this whole formula. So I don't think that the – the demise of EYLEA I think has been greatly exaggerated as the saying goes. But in terms of following on, we too struggle when you've got to the heart of a disease which is excess VEGF causing leakiness of blood vessels, and you can block VEGF so exquisitely, you're not going to get too much down the road by adding other agents. We looked at Ang2. Others looked at PDGF. We looked at it. We didn't see a difference. It would not surprise us if the bispecific from Roche showed some nice activity because they're testing against 0.3 milligrams of Lucentis at a strong multiple of that dose. In terms of our own efforts, we've got as we mentioned preclinical work ongoing in formulation to give you longer-term delivery of EYLEA as well as gene therapy. But at the end of the day, we all got to this field got to the heart of this disease pretty quickly, and that's why it's been hard for anybody to surpass these very powerful anti-VEGF agents. George, you want to add to that a little?
George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Yes. I just want to build on that just a little bit. We have been working very hard for a very, very long time, more than 20 years now, to build on the benefit that EYLEA provides. And obviously, it's been hard because the bar has been set so high with EYLEA, and I think Len referred to the data. Just imagine that. I mean, with brolucizumab, they gave 12 times the molar dose of EYLEA, and they could not demonstrate any advantages vis-à-vis their primary endpoint visual acuity. In fact, as Len mentioned, they were numerically inferior in both studies. And they couldn't also extend substantially on the interval meaning that almost half their patients failed their quarterly interval. So that allows them to maybe allow to have about 50% of the people or so on quarterly dosing, which is just like EYLEA. So EYLEA has such a high bar, and the only way that so far people are trying to address it is by giving much, much higher molar doses and these molar doses are not really achieving demonstrable, at least in terms of visual acuity or in terms of interval, any advantages. And I think it just shows the bar has been set very high, and I think the flip side is the safety concern. And when you have something that you have such a long track record with safety, and with also long-term demonstration of ability to maintain the visual gains. That's something else that Len referred to. There's no other agents which have been shown in long-term studies to actually maintain the initial vision gains. That's a very, very high bar, and when Len refers to treating relatives or parents, I think that right now EYLEA would certainly for me be the drug of choice based on the safety and efficacy profile to be treating anybody that I care about.
Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you.
Manisha Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Operator, we have time for one last question. I know there are many people in the queue, who we're not going to be able to get to on the call, but please send me an e-mail and we'll follow up with you after the call.
Operator: We have Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan.
Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys, and thanks for the question. I actually had two of them regarding Dupixent. First, I'm wondering if you could talk more about the payer process for Dupixent that's led to some of the frustration you mentioned in your prepared remarks. Curious what's maybe new or different there. Is it unforeseen step that it's prior auth or something else and kind of how you see this dynamic evolving over the course of the year? And then the second part of the Dupi question is asking just about the relative breakdown of atopic dermatitis patients between adults, adolescents and pediatrics. I know you just started the ped Phase 3, but how much of an interim boost might that adolescent patient population represent given that you'll have Phase 3 data there in 28 (59:05). And is this also a population where you still see a lot of the comorbidities that are so common in pediatric patients? Thanks a lot.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Thanks, Cory, for the questions. On the second one, we don't have a quantitative answer for you at this time in terms of what we might see the uptake in pediatrics or adolescents, but we do know there are a lot, a lot of patients there. But until we get the label and et cetera, et cetera, and able to promote it, we really can't give you too much of a feel. In terms of the frustrations we mentioned, the process that Sanofi and Regeneron have undertaken has actually gone very well. Remember we had very rapid coverage from CVS and Express Scripts, almost first day coverage there, literally. And we have continued to grow. In summary 80%, 85% of the plans have made some sort of a decision already on coverage. So we're doing well on that. The frustration I was referring to was that we still hear that, unfortunately and regrettably, and we hope to shine a light on that – perhaps we should start a hashtag, #deniedRx. But people, despite being on the right side of the need, the appropriate patients, failed all the right agents and then some, the paperwork has gotten frustrating because I think payers are concerned about the size of this class. And in some cases, they're using their standard tricks. We're going to have to figure out ways to fight back. If somebody wants to tweet about Rx, #deniedRx, it would be okay with me. We'd love to collect some of these stories and hear about how the paperwork has been – or the denials have been unfair. We're not suggesting there's a new problem out there that's unique to Dupixent. This is an industry-wide problem that the payers are making it tougher. Praluent is a very good example. Payers are making it very tough for doctors to fill out the forms. We've made some progress now and some of the payers certainly are acting responsibly. It's not a monolith out there. And we want to get as many people on the drug who should be on the drug, and make that process as easy as we can. Thanks, Cory.
George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Well, we should just add that just to remind you, you said we were early in our program with the pediatric atopic dermatitis. One of our Phase 3 studies is fully enrolled and for the 12 to 17 age group, we hope to submit a supplemental BLA by the end of this year. So we're hoping that that opportunity is, in terms of benefiting the younger patients, is going to be pretty forthcoming.
Manisha Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Operator, that concludes our call for today. And as I mentioned, we'll be available in our office for follow-up questions.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.

Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Thank you, Manisha, and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us on the call and webcast today. In my remarks, I'd like to focus on to EYLEA and Dupixent, which are two important near-term drivers of our business, and also cover some of our late-stage pipeline progress. EYLEA is a very important franchise to Regeneron and has continued to perform strongly in the third quarter, with 12% year-over-year growth in the U.S. and 20% year-over-year growth outside the United States. We are committed to maintaining our leadership in retinal diseases. Today, I want to talk specifically about our long-term strategy to drive EYLEA growth. Our EYLEA sales are primarily derived from two large and distinct vision-threatening retinal diseases, age-related macular degeneration, also known as a wet AMD, and diabetic macular edema or DME. Wet AMD represents approximately 70% of our U.S. EYLEA net sales and continues to grow as the population ages. There are approximately 1 million patients with wet AMD in the United States, and about 60% of them receive anti-VEGF therapy. Our goal in wet AMD is to ensure that patients are optimally treated to achieve the best visual outcomes, and as importantly, maintain these vision gains over the long term, using regular treatment in accordance with the label indication. Our DME business represents approximately 25% of our U.S. EYLEA net sales and has been growing steadily. We expect it to be an important driver of future growth. EYLEA is currently the branded anti-VEGF market leader in diabetic macular edema. This position was strengthened by data from Protocol T, which was an NIH-sponsored comparative effectiveness study in which diabetic macular edema – and demonstrated that EYLEA treatment resulted in significantly greater gains in visual acuity than both Lucentis and Avastin treatments as well as significantly greater control of the edema itself. The current treatment rates in diabetic eye diseases remain low. In DME, the majority of patients are either untreated or receive laser therapy, which in our pivotal trials were shown to be substantially inferior to treatment with EYLEA. From a market penetration perspective, it's estimated that only about 10% of patients with DME in the United States are currently treated with an anti-VEGF agent. Thus, DME represents a significant growth opportunity for EYLEA. From a competitive perspective, we are not aware of any near-term late-stage competitive threats on the horizon in DME. It is important to remember that DME represents only a part of the overall diabetic eye disease opportunity for anti-VEGF therapy, which includes both proliferative and non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy without diabetic macular edema. Recent data from a third-party study comparing EYLEA with pan-retinal laser photocoagulation in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy demonstrated that with EYLEA, the resulted improvement in visual outcomes – EYLEA resulted in improved visuals outcomes at the end of one year. These data from the CLARITY study were published in The Lancet in May of this year. George will review these important results in greater detail. As a reminder, EYLEA is approved in diabetic retinopathy for patients with DME. It's estimated that there are approximately 500,000 patients in the United States with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, and the vast majority are currently treated with laser therapy because of the perceived medical urgency. Data from the CLARITY study could potentially support the use of EYLEA in this setting. In the U.S., there are approximately 1.8 million patients with vision threatening diabetic retinopathy, including DME, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, and severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Currently, fewer than 30% of these patients are treated with an anti-VEGF agent, representing a substantial potential market opportunity for EYLEA in diabetic eye diseases. We have completed enrollment on our Phase 3 PANORAMA study of EYLEA compared to sham therapy in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy without DME, and expect top line data in the first half of 2018. George will review the strong data available that bode well for the PANORAMA study. We are actively pursuing the indication of diabetic retinopathy and plan to submit a supplemental BLA in the second half of 2018 for this indication based on the PANORAMA study should it be positive. In addition to our PANORAMA study, the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network is conducting a government-sponsored Phase 3 study of EYLEA, known as Protocol W, in diabetic retinopathy. Let's turn now to Dupixent. The launch in atopic dermatitis is underway and progressing very well. Right from the early stages of the launch and continuing to the present, we have had a steady stream of about 500 prescriptions filled weekly for patients who are new to the brand. Our patient and physician satisfaction rates are high, with over 90% of patients refilling their Dupixent prescription. We have completed our Phase 3 program of dupilumab in asthma. And we and Sanofi are working toward a planned supplemental BLA submission to the FDA by the end of this year. We recognize it will be a very competitive area and are confident that the efficacy and safety profile of dupilumab will place it in a very strong position if approved in asthma. The dupilumab pivotal asthma program was the first with a biologic to enroll a broad population of uncontrolled asthma patients and demonstrate large and significant reductions in exacerbations and clinically significant improvements in lung function. In terms of our broad strategy, we believe that dupilumab has the potential to improve the lives of patients with other allergic diseases because it targets a common central driver of Type 2 inflammation. In addition to atopic dermatitis in asthma, we have completed enrollment in two Phase 3 studies in nasal polyps and recently reported Phase 2 data in eosinophilic esophagitis, a disease with no FDA-approved treatment. We believe this broad activity across these multiple allergic diseases is unique among the biologic therapies. George will update you further on dupilumab data and clinical progress, and Bob Terifay will update you on our commercial activities. With regard to our PCSK9 antibody Praluent, we believe that there is substantial opportunity yet to be realized. We await data from our ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study in the first quarter of next year. And we continue to work on access, which is slowly starting to improve for this class of therapy. We are pleased with the recent Appellate Court decision in our ongoing litigation concerning Praluent, which vacated the injunction and referred the case back for retrial in the District Court. The Appellate Court ruled that the law requires a written description of the invention, in this case the antibodies, not the antigen or epitope they bind to. Moreover, they instructed the District Court to admit important new evidence that was improperly excluded from the first trial. Finally, our immuno-oncology program with cemiplimab, our PD-1 antibody, continues to advance. We are moving forward with the first planned regulatory submission in advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, a difficult to treat skin cancer, as well as expanding the development program in first and second-line lung cancer, basal cell carcinoma, and cervical cancer, in addition to studies in combination with other antibodies and bispecifics. Our pipeline continues to be robust, with 16 product candidates in clinical development, all of which were discovered in our own labs and serve as a testament to the fact that our innovation engine continues to be exceedingly strong and productive. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to George.
George D. Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Thank you, Len, and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us on the call. As Len mentioned, EYLEA continues to be a leader in the retinal disease space, with a number of important near-term opportunities. First, we expect to have our supplemental BLA for every 12-week dosing of EYLEA in wet AMD filed by the end of this year. Echoing Len's thoughts, let me also update you on the potential opportunity for EYLEA in diabetic eye disease. In our original pivotal studies in DME, we demonstrated superiority of EYLEA to laser in terms of visual acuity and other outcomes. In the government-sponsored Protocol T study, EYLEA was demonstrated to be superior in terms of visual acuity to the other commonly used anti-VEGF agents at the one-year primary endpoint. In these studies, in addition to these endpoints, EYLEA demonstrated a two or more step improvement in the diabetic retinopathy severity score, or DRSS, suggesting activity in both proliferative and non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Consistent with this, as Len mentioned, positive data from the third-party CLARITY study in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy were recently published in The Lancet. The medical urgency in this setting is reflected by the fact that the vast majority of proliferative patients are currently treated with pan-retinal photocoagulation laser therapy, or PRP, which has been the standard of care in this indication for almost four decades. CLARITY compared EYLEA to PRP and showed that patients treated with EYLEA gained approximately four letters in visual acuity compared to patients treated with laser. This was the first time that an anti-VEGF agent has demonstrated superiority to laser treatment in patients with diabetic retinopathy without macular edema. According to this published study, compared to PRP, EYLEA lowered the rate of new or increasing vitreous hemorrhage by about 50% and decreased the occurrence of macular edema at 52 weeks by approximately 60%. In addition, an improvement in retinopathy from proliferative to non-proliferative was observed in 64% of patients treated with EYLEA compared to 34% patients treated with a PRP. There were no new safety concerns observed with EYLEA in this study. Inflammation was more frequent in patients who received EYLEA, with 8% of patients reporting inflammation compared to 3% of patients who received PRP. New or increasing vitreous hemorrhage was more frequent in the PRP group, with 18% of patients reporting this event compared to 9% in the EYLEA group. PANORAMA, our Phase 3 study of EYLEA in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy without diabetic macular edema exploring every 8 and 16-week dosing, is fully enrolled. We expect to report data in the first half of 2018, and if positive expect to make a regulatory submission. A separate Phase 3 study in this indication, Protocol W, which is being conducted by the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network, or the DRCR, continues to enroll patients. This study will explore every 16-week dosing of EYLEA, which is the only anti-VEGF treatment being investigated in this study. Finally, on EYLEA, I want to remind you that we expect to have the top line data from our Phase 2 combination studies of EYLEA and nesvacumab, our antibody to Ang2, later this quarter. While we have not seen the data, we have been pretty clear about the high bar that EYLEA monotherapy sets for any potential combination studies. In our view, the results from the Ang2 combination studies are not central to the eye disease strategy that we have just outlined. Turning now to dupilumab, our IL-4/IL-13 blocker that is currently approved for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adult patients whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies and when those therapies are not advisable, we recently reported positive Phase 3 results from two studies of dupilumab in patients with uncontrolled asthma, LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST and LIBERTY ASTHMA VENTURE. These two studies, in addition to our first pivotal study, enrolled a broad population of uncontrolled asthma patients and demonstrated reductions in exacerbations or asthma attacks and improvements in lung function as measured by FEV1. The VENTURE study, which enrolled patients who required chronic systemic corticosteroids for asthma control, showed that dupilumab could profoundly reduce systemic corticosteroid dependence, with half the patients eliminating this dependence entirely. Despite the reduction in systemic corticosteroid usage, dupilumab-treated patients still had prominent increases in lung function and fewer exacerbations compared to the control group. Based on these data, dupilumab offers the potential for an important treatment alternative to systemic corticosteroids for these most serious of asthma patients. Beyond the profound benefit in terms of exacerbations, I would like to emphasize the importance of dupilumab's demonstrated ability to improve lung function in asthma patients. Since currently approved biologics do not consistently improve lung functions and were approved based on their ability to reduce exacerbations, this has resulted in a focus away from lung function in asthma. However, one of the most serious day-to-day issues that patients with uncontrolled asthma suffer from and which dramatically impacts their lives is their inability to breathe normally. For example, the patients in our pivotal studies only retained an average of 50% to 60% of the predicted SAB1 at baseline, despite treatment with steroids and long-acting beta agonists. Moreover, only a fraction of this lung function could be reversed with high doses of short-acting bronchodilators. Therefore, we believe our finding that dupilumab improved lung function in all of our clinical trials in addition to reducing exacerbations is an important potential benefit to patients if approved in this setting. Results from the QUEST and VENTURE studies along with data from our previously reported and published pivotal Phase 2b study will support the regulatory submission that we and Sanofi expect to make to the FDA by the end of this year. As a reminder, the recently reported QUEST and VENTURE studies included adolescent patients between the ages of 12 and 17 years. We are also currently conducting a Phase 3 study in pediatric patients between the ages of 6 and 11 years. Work on the development of dupilumab in other Type 2 diseases such as nasal polyposis and eosinophilic esophagitis is ongoing. Following positive results in Phase 2, I'm pleased to report that both Phase 3 studies in patients with nasal polyposis are now fully enrolled. Turning to eosinophilic esophagitis, or EOE, a chronic Type 2 immune-mediated disease that is strongly associated with food allergies, EOE is characterized by pain and difficulty swallowing and the possibility of food impaction, which are consequences of pathological structural changes in the esophagus. There are currently no approved therapies in the U.S. for the treatment of EOE. All corticosteroids are used off-label but with limited long-term efficacy and safety data to support their use. At the recent World Congress of Gastroenterology, we presented additional data from our positive Phase 2 study. These data show that dupilumab significantly improved swallowing in addition to esophageal eosinophil counts, endoscopic features, histology, and esophageal distensibility in adults with active EOE compared with placebo. This safety profile seen in the study was consistent with that observed in the other studies of dupilumab. Dupilumab has been granted Orphan Drug designation in this indication, and Phase 3 studies are being planned. I'd like to now turn to atopic dermatitis, an indication where Dupixent is approved both in the United States and in Europe. In September, we presented positive data from CAFE, a Phase 3 study of Dupixent in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis who are inadequately controlled with or intolerant of cyclosporine, which is approved in certain countries outside the United States. This study demonstrated that in these difficult to treat patients, Dupixent in combination with topical steroids significantly improved measures of overall disease severity and patient-reported quality of life measures, with a mean improvement of 80% in the Eczema Area Severity score, or the EASI score. No new adverse events were reported in this study. We also continue to work on expanding development in moderate to severe pediatric atopic dermatitis patients. Turning to immuno-oncology, which is another area of growing excitement for us, I'd like to begin with cemiplimab, our foundational PD-1 antibody. Our lead indication is advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or CSCC, for which we have been granted Breakthrough designation by the FDA. We expect to report interim data later this year and to make a regulatory submission to the FDA in the first quarter of 2018. Our PD-1 program has continued to expand. We recently initiated a Phase 3 program of cemiplimab monotherapy in first-line non-small-cell lung cancer. This 300-patient study, which is being conducted outside the United States, will enroll patients who express greater than 50% PD-L1 and will compare cemiplimab to standard-of-care platinum doublet. The primary endpoint of this study is progression-free survival. We are planning additional studies, including combinational studies, in non-small-cell lung cancer as well as clinical trials in second-line non-small-cell lung cancer. I remind you that with all the recent failures in this space, there is only one approved PD-1 or PD-L1 agent in the first-line non-small lung cancer setting. We also recently initiated a Phase 3 study in second-line cervical cancer. With our ongoing potentially pivotal study in basal cell carcinoma, this brings us to four potentially pivotal programs with our PD-1 antibody. We also have exploratory studies ongoing in melanoma and head and neck cancer, and we're also conducting and planning studies with cemiplimab in combination with our antibody to LAG-3 in a variety of indications, as well as a number of other combination approaches with cemiplimab, including with our bispecifics. Turning now to these bispecifics, we will be presenting further positive data from our CD20/CD3 program both as monotherapy and in combination with cemiplimab in B-cell malignancies at the December meeting of the American Society of Hematology, or ASH. As a reminder, the CD20/CD3 program has been granted Orphan Drug designation for diffuse large cell B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL. We are also conducting a combination study of our CD20/CD3 bispecific with cemiplimab in CD20-positive malignancies. We plan to put additional bispecifics into clinical trials over the next several years. Fasinumab, our NFG antibody, continues to advance in the clinic. We are currently enrolling patients in a Phase 3 study in osteoarthritis pain, where we are investigating fasinumab compared to naproxen. We also plan to initiate a second study of fasinumab in osteoarthritis pain. I'll turn now to our mid and earlier-stage pipeline. Nesvacumab is our antibody to ANGPTL-3 for the treatment of severe forms of hyperlipidemia. We are planning Phase 3 studies in homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, or homozygous FH, and Phase 2 studies in severe hypertriglyceridemia and in heterozygous hypercholesterolemia, or HeFH. We plan to initiate by year end the Phase 2 study of Regeneron 2477, our Activin A antibody, in the ultra-rare disease of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, or FOP. We are also exploring the use of our Activin A antibody in combination with trevogrumab, our GDF8 antibody, in muscle and metabolic disorders. Another exciting early-stage program is Regeneron 3500, our antibody to the interleukin 33 ligand, which is in the clinic and we plan to investigate for asthma, COPD, and other indications as both a monotherapy and in combination with dupilumab. With that overview, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Terifay.
Robert J. Terifay - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. EYLEA, or aflibercept, continues to be the market-leading product among FDA-approved anti-VEGF agents for all of its approved indications in the United States. U.S. EYLEA sales grew 12% year over year in the third quarter of 2017 in a market that grew by about 11%. Ex-U.S. sales grew by 20% year over year in a market that grew 13%. As was summarized by Len and George, we look forward to the potential of expanding the use of EYLEA in diabetic eye diseases, which we feel is a substantial potential opportunity. Turning now to the recent launch of Dupixent or dupilumab in the United States for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, global sales for Dupixent in the third quarter were $89 million. This number almost entirely represents sales in the United States, since Dupixent only recently received regulatory approval in Europe at the end of September. We're pleased with the way the U.S. launch is tracking across a number of important metrics, and the commercial organizations are focused on delivering a successful launch. Let me begin with the physician perspective. As of last week, over 7,000 healthcare providers had written prescriptions for Dupixent for adult patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. The prescription trajectory, as measured by total prescriptions, has remained strong and is trending ahead of comparable biologic launches in dermatology. In terms of new patient starts, as assessed by new-to-brand prescriptions, we've seen on average approximately 750 new patients prescribed Dupixent each week and approximately 500 new patients starting therapy each week since the early part of the launch. Importantly, of the patients who have started on Dupixent, over 90% renewed their prescription, suggesting a high degree of patient and physician satisfaction. On the market access side, we're happy to report that about 80% of commercial lives are now covered by health plans that have a published Dupixent policy. Of these patients, almost half have prior authorization to label, or in other words, they can receive Dupixent by stepping through only topical therapy without requiring prior systemic therapy or a severity requirement. In addition to coverage with Express Scripts and CVS, Dupixent is also on formulary at Optum, Aetna, Anthem, and United. In the coming weeks, we'll be launching unbranded direct-to-consumer television advertising to increase awareness of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Outside of the United States, Dupixent has received regulatory approval in Europe, and we're preparing for launch in Germany. It's estimated that the addressable European patient population of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis patients is between 150,000 and 200,000 patients. A regulatory submission for Dupixent has been made in Japan, with a decision expected in the first quarter of 2018. In addition to the ongoing launch in atopic dermatitis, we're also preparing to launch dupilumab in asthma. As mentioned earlier, we are on track to file a supplemental BLA submission to the FDA by the end of this year. Additionally, we and Sanofi plan to file a European regulatory submission in adult and adolescent patients in the first quarter of 2018. Turning now to Kevzara, or sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, net global sales for the third quarter were $3 million. It's still very early given that Kevzara was approved and launched in the United States towards the end of May and reimbursement decisions for RA biologics take some time. Initial feedback from physicians has been positive, and we're working on building market access. We're happy to report that just recently CVS Health announced that effective January 1, 2018, Kevzara will be designated as the preferred IL-6 receptor antibody on their national formulary. We've received EMA approval for Kevzara, with launches in Germany and the Netherlands underway. Now let's discuss Praluent, or alirocumab. Net sales in the third quarter were $49 million worldwide, with the U.S. accounting for $32 million of the total. While we continue to be disappointed with the uptake of the PCSK9 inhibitor class, we're encouraged by ongoing discussions with payers with respect to improvement in utilization management criteria and documentation requirements. Recently, CVS Health announced that effective January 1, 2018, it would provide co-preferred access to Praluent through its CVS Caremark commercial formularies, which cover approximately 25 million lives. We remain optimistic about the long-term potential for this class. The anticipated cardiovascular outcomes data for Praluent in early 2018 could have an impact on demand. We remain committed to our efforts to improve Praluent access and bring this important product to more patients who can benefit. As George mentioned, cemiplimab, our PD-1 inhibitor program in immuno-oncology, is advancing, with a regulatory submission in CSCC anticipated in the first quarter of 2018. We will co-promote cemiplimab in the United States with Sanofi Genzyme. As a reminder, we will distribute and book U.S. sales. With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Landry.
Robert E. Landry - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Regeneron posted strong third quarter 2017 financial results. These positive results were driven by continued growth in our global EYLEA franchise, a strong U.S. Dupixent launch, and a significant contribution of revenue from both our Sanofi and Bayer collaborations. During today's call I'll discuss each of these matters in addition to highlighting changes to our full year 2017 guidance line items. In the third quarter of 2017, we earned $3.99 per diluted share from non-GAAP net income of $470 million. This represents a year-over-year increase in non-GAAP diluted EPS and net income of 27% and 29% respectively. Regeneron's third quarter 2017 non-GAAP net income excludes non-cash share-based compensation expense, including the income tax effect. A full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is set forth in our earnings release, which can be found on our website. Total revenues in the third quarter of 2017 were $1.5 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 23% compared to the third quarter of 2016. Net product sales were $957 million in the third quarter of 2017 compared to $857 million in the third quarter of 2016, which represents year-over-year growth of approximately 12%. EYLEA net product sales in the United States were $953 million in the third quarter of 2017 compared to $854 million in the third quarter of 2016, which represents an increase of 12%. For the nine months ended September 30, 2017, EYLEA net product sales in the United States were $2.73 billion versus $2.47 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of 11%. We are reaffirming our estimated full year 2017 U.S. EYLEA net product sales growth guidance of approximately 10% over 2016. As a reminder, this is the last quarter where we will be providing U.S. EYLEA net sales guidance. Similar to the previous two quarters of 2017, EYLEA experienced another decrease in U.S. distributor inventory levels, albeit slight, during the third quarter, with distributor levels continuing to remain within our normal one to two-week targeted range. Ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales, which are recorded by our collaborator Bayer, were $564 million in the third quarter of 2017 as compared to $471 in the third quarter of 2016, representing a 20% increase on a reported basis. On an operational or constant currency basis, sales increased approximately 19%. For the nine months ended September 30, 2017, ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales were $1.59 billion versus $1.38 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of 16% on a reported basis and 18% on an operational basis. In the third quarter of 2017, Regeneron recognized $205 million from our shared net profits from EYLEA sales outside the United States. Total Bayer collaboration revenue for the third quarter of 2017 was $237 million. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $245 million for the third quarter of 2017. The Sanofi collaboration revenue line item primarily consists of reimbursement of Regeneron incurred R&D expenses, reimbursement of Regeneron incurred commercialization related expenses, and the recognition of deferred revenue from the antibody and immuno-oncology upfront payments, partly offset by our share of losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies. In the third quarter of 2017, our share of losses in connection with the commercialization of Dupixent, Praluent, and Kevzara was $98 million compared to a loss of $122 million in the second quarter 2017 and a loss of $112 million in the third quarter of 2016. The decrease in our share of losses was primarily based upon the profit contribution from increased third quarter Dupixent sales and lower alliance commercial expenses for Praluent, offset by a modest increase in our alliance commercial expenses for Dupixent and Kevzara. Global sales of Dupixent, Praluent, and Kevzara as recorded by our collaborator Sanofi for the third quarter of 2017 were Dupixent $89 million, Praluent $49 million, and Kevzara $3 million. For both Dupixent and Kevzara, the sales were almost exclusively U.S.-based. As stated by our collaborator Sanofi on their earnings call last week, Dupixent third quarter 2017 net sales included modest wholesaler inventory stocking, not unexpected, and the $89 million sales figure is a true representation of the underlying demand. While we are encouraged with the reduction in our share of alliance losses on the antibody collaboration in the third quarter of 2017, I want to continue to highlight that the alliance's profitability will continue to be negatively impacted by increased global launch expenses to support Kevzara and Dupixent. As a result, we are expecting a higher alliance loss in connection with commercialization of antibodies in the fourth quarter of 2017 than what was realized in the third quarter of 2017. The third quarter 2017 Sanofi collaboration revenue also benefited from an acceleration of the recognition of deferred revenue in connection with the termination of the antibody discovery agreement on December 31, 2017. The $130 million of 2017 annual funding from Sanofi under the antibody discovery agreement was fully utilized during the first nine months of 2017. Due to this utilization, we expect Sanofi's reimbursement of Regeneron research and development expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 to be lower than any of the three previous quarters. In the third quarter of 2017, other revenue was $62 million versus $27 million during the third quarter of 2016. This increase was primarily due to the reimbursements from our collaborator Teva for the development of fasinumab. For further details, you can find a summary of the components of other revenue in the MD&A section of our 10-Q. Turning now to expenses, non-GAAP R&D expenses were $460 million for the third quarter of 2017. Our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as the total non-GAAP R&D expense less R&D reimbursement from our collaborators, was $227 million in the third quarter of 2017. Our press release includes all the information that is required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense. We are lowering and tightening our full year 2017 guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to be in the range of $885 million to $915 million from our previous guidance of $925 million to $965 million. Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $259 million for the third quarter of 2017 and represents a slight decrease from the previous quarter. Given our nine-month actual results and forecasted fourth quarter spend, we are tightening and lowering our full year 2017 guidance of non-GAAP SG&A to $1.07 billion to $1.1 billion from our previous guidance range of $1.12 billion to $1.16 billion. Based on this revised guidance, you will see that we are forecasting a higher SG&A spend level for the fourth quarter of 2017 resulting from the delayed timing of third quarter spend. In addition, as I previously mentioned, we are expecting higher fourth quarter incremental global spend on our two recently FDA and EMA-approved launches, Dupixent and Kevzara, as well as prelaunch expenses for the anticipated 2018 U.S. approvals for cemiplimab in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and the dupilumab asthma indication. Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses, a line item found within Sanofi collaboration revenue, was $90 million for the third quarter of 2017. We are tightening and lowering our full year 2017 guidance of Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses to $350 million to $375 million from our previous guidance range of $370 million to $400 million. Non-GAAP cost of goods sold and cost of collaboration in contract manufacturing increased for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, principally due to an increase in startup costs and validation activities for our Limerick commercial manufacturing facility. Turning now to taxes, our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2017 was 31% as compared to 28% for the third quarter of 2016. For the full year 2017, we are tightening and lowering guidance for our effective tax rate to be in the range of 26% to 29% from the previous range of 27% to 31%. The updated guidance reflects higher actual and forecasted tax deductions from stock options. As stated on previous earning calls, there will be volatility in our effective tax rate on a quarter-to-quarter basis since the tax benefit of stock-based compensation is included based on actual exercises in the quarter. We expect to experience this volatility in the fourth quarter of 2017, as the majority of our options are issued in December, and typically a large number of options vest and are exercised in the fourth quarter. As a result, we expect our fourth quarter 2017 effective tax rate to be significantly below both the third quarter and full year 2017 tax rates. From a cash flow and balance sheet perspective, we ended the third quarter of 2017 with cash and marketable securities of $2.7 billion. Our capital expenditures for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 were $60 million and $165 million respectively. We are tightening our full year 2017 capital expenditures guidance to be in the range of $265 million to $285 million from our previously provided range of $250 million to $285 million. With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Manisha.
Manisha Narasimhan, Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Thank you, Bob. Paulette, we'd now like to open the call for Q&A. In the interest of time, we request that you limit yourself to one question. We will be available in the office after the call for follow-up questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Chris Raymond from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Christopher Raymond - Piper Jaffray Companies: Hey, thanks for taking the question, just a question on the Dupixent prescriber base, if you don't mind. I just noticed in previous communications you guys had talked about an initial target base I think of 7,000 derms with previous biologic experience. I think I heard today Bob talk about having 7,000 doctors write a script for the drug. So maybe can you just talk about that mix? Is that current 7,000 base, is that the initial target, or were there others that you maybe didn't expect? And maybe talk about the road in front of you here in terms of getting other docs to prescribe the drug. Thanks.
Robert J. Terifay - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: So, Chris, you're correct. Our original target audience were physicians who have written a biologic for psoriasis in the past, and that was slightly over 7,000 patients. What we have found when we've gone out to the dermatologist offices is there are other dermatologists in those offices who take an interest in atopic dermatitis patients and have started to use the product. For the future, what we anticipate is that we will see other prescribers as patients become aware through our direct-to-consumer campaign on the severity of the condition and the need to seek out a dermatologist, and that there could be an increased urgency to treat over time.
Manisha Narasimhan, Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges from Leerink. Please go ahead.
Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC: Thank you very much and thanks for all the color on the call. A number of things, but perhaps we could talk. You suggested your product lifecycle management strategy for EYLEA alluded to on the call. But is there anything you could talk about first with respect to the pre-filled syringe offering for EYLEA? And then secondly, do you have anything in mind that you could do with Dupixent, given how important it's going to be to the company to reduce the dosing frequency with the product in some new formulation or preparation? Thanks.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Right. Thanks, Geoff. So I probably don't want to get into Dupixent given the competitive aspect of that space, but we continue to look at all sorts of different ways to create value. We can assure you of that. In terms of EYLEA and the pre-filled syringe, we had two issues. Genentech was ahead of us with the pre-filled syringe, and now they're fully launched. But I think as you saw in Bob's report, our market share was steady, and so that has not really created a problem for us. Nevertheless, we're still moving forward with ours, and I think we expect to have a filing perhaps sometime in the first half of next year or so. It's a complicated business, the pre-filled syringe, because of the sterilization requirements when you're dealing with eye diseases that took Genentech, I don't know, quite a long time to get there, and we hope to be not too far behind them.
Manisha Narasimhan, Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question and congrats on the quarter. I have another question on Dupixent. Right now, Sanofi commented that most of the patients on Dupixent are the severe patients with atopic dermatitis. When do you think this drug can penetrate into the moderate patient segment? And then also, are you planning to increase investment in Praluent, now that the court gave you a favorable ruling, or do you have to wait until you have the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES?
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Bob?
Robert J. Terifay - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: So with regards to Dupixent, Sanofi was correct. What we're seeing is that physicians are initiating Dupixent therapy in the patients with severe atopic dermatitis. Now what is encouraging is that the patients are responding. So even in those very, very severe patients, we're getting a good response. We do anticipate that physicians will become more and more comfortable with using a biologic for a condition they have not used one for before, which is atopic dermatitis, and that we should see expansion into moderate AD over the next several months. That should also be helped by our direct-to-consumer campaign. With regards to investment in Praluent, I think we've been very prudent this year. We have managed our investment, focused in on where we can best get business, which is primarily on education, and will continue to be modest on our spend until we get the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES data and we move forward with the court case.
Manisha Narasimhan, Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas from Citi. Please go ahead.
Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, guys. Thank you. So I just wanted to ask a little bit about the top line (46:20). I thought you guys did a great job articulating the EYLEA business and how it can grow. For just the next leg of growth, maybe talk a little bit about how you envision your checkpoint drug being a next leg of growth and what has to happen for that to succeed. Thanks.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Robyn, I didn't. I'm not sure I heard the question. Were you asking about the immuno-oncology program? Is that what your question was about?
Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Policy program (46:47), how do you see that being a next leg of growth? And what has to happen and how do you see that playing out over the next few years? How do you see that shaping up?
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Okay, George may have some comments on it. But I think the most important thing that he pointed out to me in some of his remarks is that despite all the effort, despite everybody viewing this as an incredibly crowded space, there's only one anti-PD-1 or PDL-1 that's been approved in front-line/first-line lung cancer. And that is the biggest opportunity of all, which we are now busy enrolling a study in that indication in the greater than 50%. Beyond that, of course, combinations and George mentioned LAG-3 and bispecifics, and I think we have some pretty encouraging bispecific data coming up at the next meeting.
George D. Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: It's just worth noting, obviously, it's going to be a long-term growth opportunity over we think a long period of time. By adding additional opportunities to it and combining things, we think we have one of the strongest portfolio of combination opportunities that we've already started studying in the clinic, and more will follow. But even the very first indication should not be underestimated. If you look at the cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, there's enormous need there. And the actual – it is actually – the number of cases is huge, and it's been largely ignored because the vast, vast majority of them can be treated surgically. But because there's something on the order of 1 million or 2 million cases, and even though something like over greater than 95% are treated surgically, that still leaves an opportunity of unresectable or metastatic disease, which is on the order of magnitude of melanoma. And like I said, I think it was largely ignored by the community because of the perspective that though it was one of the, if not the most common cancers afflicting patients, the vast, vast majority are treated successfully with these Mohs type surgeries and so forth. So the important thing to recognize is, even that first opportunity, there's a lot of need there. There's a lot of patients who are failures or cannot be treated with surgery. And that opportunity is on the order of magnitude of melanoma, which as we know was a huge growth driver for the two original PD-1 agents.
Manisha Narasimhan, Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, thanks for taking the question. I guess I was hoping you could talk a little bit about PANORAMA and just talk to us about – you obviously outlined the size the markets for wet AMD and DME. How do you view diabetic retinopathy relative to the size of those other markets, and how do you see that being a growth driver for EYLEA, if you were to have a successful study? Thanks.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: I'm going to let George talk about PANORAMA and why we have a reasonably high degree of confidence in that study in just a second. I just want to say, in terms of the market opportunity, the lowest hanging fruit obviously is the proliferative diabetic retinopathy because people recognize that as really vision threatening, and most people get some sort of the laser that's been going on for decades, as we mentioned. So it's hard to know exactly how many people are there, but that represents a pretty big opportunity. And with this CLARITY study that was published in The Lancet, where you not only saw better visual acuity outcome in the year, you saw less hemorrhages. You saw less macular edema, less of the complications that you're so worried about, which is why you want to treat proliferative diabetic retinopathy. But beyond that, even the treatment of severe diabetic retinopathy, which is non-proliferative, is really in its infancy. There isn't quite the same perceived urgency there. But I think if we can show that we can reverse that, I think that's going to maybe change people's view on whether or not people should get treated or should they wait, which is the current thing, wait for them to get the complications. Perhaps it is better to treat it early, and now George can comment a little bit about on the study itself and why...
George D. Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: I think Len made all the important points, and let me just echo. The most important point is that where the need right now in diabetic retinopathy is perceived as the most urgent is in proliferative eye disease, there are roughly 0.5 million such patients in the United States. And 80% or 400,000 of them receive ablative laser therapy, the most serious of laser therapies. And now with the CLARITY data, one has a head-to-head comparison showing by every measure, from visual acuity to, just as importantly, halving the risk of developing vitreal hemorrhages, reducing by almost two-thirds the risk of developing macular edema, this is something that I think patients deserve to have access to and deserve to get in this setting, because without ablating their retinas, they can have better vision and better outcomes and avoid catastrophic events like vitreal hemorrhages. I think that the 2 million or so people who have diabetic retinopathy that's considered a little less urgent, I think that this could be an important advance for those patients as well, and already, all the existing data suggest that. But I think that there will be probably slower uptake. It will be a longer haul to change the practice of medicine there, where many of those patients are treated with a wait-and-see attitude because they haven't had a drug like EYLEA thus far. But I really do think in proliferative eye disease, 500,000 patients, those patients deserve to get a therapy that's been shown in a head-to-head study to be so substantially beneficial, not only in terms of visual acuity, but in terms of preventing catastrophic outcomes, which is why they're treated so urgently with ablative therapy.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: And just the last point on that, Robyn, is that the competitive environment is less acute there obviously because the near-term competition hasn't begun any diabetic macular edema studies. And by the way, in our DME studies, we looked at the same endpoint for the patients with diabetic retinopathy in our PANORAMA study because our DME studies were in patients with diabetic retinopathy, but we were treating their DME. Their diabetic retinopathy improved just the way we hope and expect that it will improve in PANORAMA, which is what the FDA just asked us to do, is to do a study in patients without the DME component. And that's why we have some, I would say, reasonably high confidence in that study.
Manisha Narasimhan, Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Paulette, next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my question. I was curious. For asthma, how important do you think baseline eosinophil counts will be when thinking about which patients to prescribe Dupixent in the real world? Thanks.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Let's just review what the facts are. If you look at our data, and you can't make these cross-study comparisons and take them overly seriously. But if you look at our data, we enrolled a very broad population, but the drug works better the higher your eosinophil count is. And if you look in our highest eosinophilic count, you saw, I would argue, some of the best data that's been presented with any of the biologics, including a robust very significant effect on exacerbations as well as the effect on lung function. But we also were able to enroll a very broad population in all three of our studies, so we would hope and argue that it doesn't really matter. If you're worried about treating the eosinophilic type, which has more exacerbations and may represent the more urgent need, we think our drug will offer a terrific opportunity, especially with the differentiating factors that we talked about around pulmonary function. And if you happen to have another allergic disease, and these things do run in packs and happened to also have severe atopic dermatitis or moderate to severe, you'd get two treatments for the cost of one. But of course, we also think about that across the broad spectrum. Ours is the first biologic to be studied across that consistently in all of our trials. So no matter how you look at our data, we like it. We and Sanofi are very pleased with the data.
George D. Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Maybe just to put it into a little bit of context, as Len said, we did three pivotal studies. And in the overall population, as Len said, it's hard to compare across studies, but I don't think anybody would argue that in the overall population, even in the worst of the three studies in terms of the numbers, they look quite comparable to the high eosinophilic groups for either approved biologics or for near-term biologics that are coming down there. And obviously, we also have even better data in the high eosinophilic patients. And as Len said, I think the most important differentiator also has to be, not only do we have comparable results to what others have in the high O's in the overall population, but we have these lung function results. And I think that this has been just, as we tried to communicate during our prepared remarks, this has been somewhere where the field has been going away from, only because biologics to date have not been doing such a good job. If you remember the way Xolair got approved, up until that point, lung function was the standard for approval. But because Xolair had no effect on lung function, they switched the focus to these exacerbations, which obviously are very important and so forth. But if you know anybody with asthma, you know that the thing that they suffer from and they worry about on a day-to-day basis is the shortness of breath that they can suffer from with a little bit of exercise or some other trigger that they might be suffering from. And I think it's really important to recognize that the results on lung function are really impressive, not only on the overall population, but even more impressive in the high eosinophilic population. So once again, I think if anybody honestly looks at the data and looks at the effects, not only in the overall population, not only on exacerbation, but also on lung function, you would think that this is the treatment that patients deserve to be given to benefit their condition, and not only in the high eosinophilic patients but the overall population.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: I also think that you can't ignore mechanism here. There's been a lot of claims that people are getting to the fundamental mechanisms of allergic disease, and it's hard to say that you're at the fundamental mechanism of allergic disease if in one allergic disease it works and in another allergic disease it doesn't work. And it's hard to say you're getting into the fundamental basis of the allergic disease if you're only affecting part of the disease like exacerbations and not affecting lung function. It's hard to say you're getting at the fundamental part of the disease if in eosinophilic esophagitis you can lower your eosinophils but you can't improve the symptoms of the actual inflammation that's going on in the esophagus. So I think that a lot of this goes back to the choices that were made a long time ago in what is the right fundamental way to interfere with this Type 2 allergic inflammation.
George D. Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: And I just want to add to that. Len brings up a really good point, which is that part of our clinical development plan is actually to do studies where we show that in the same patients, we will be able to benefit multiple allergic conditions. And that is I think something that, if you know people who are suffering from any one of these severe allergic conditions, whether it's atopic dermatitis, for example, or severe asthma, they generally are suffering from other allergic conditions as well. And wouldn't it be wonderful if there was a drug that was a central driver of all of allergic disease that could benefit essentially all of the allergic manifestations in a single patient. So that is part of our clinical development plan going forward, that we are going to be doing studies to actually be able to show that, hopefully. And we don't think there's any other current biologics out there that even have the opportunity to consider the possibility of doing those studies.
Manisha Narasimhan, Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Paulette, we have time for one last question.
Operator: Okay, and our last question comes from Josh Schimmer from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Joshua Schimmer - Evercore ISI: Thanks for taking the question, just one on the IL-33 antibody. Can you elaborate on its positioning, what it brings to the table in addition to or instead of Dupixent? And is this a general area that you expect to further build the pipeline? Thanks.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: I think that's a great question. Thanks for bringing it up. Obviously, we didn't have enough time to really go into everything. But this is a really exciting target for us for many reasons, one of which is a lot of the biology that our group did to understand it. But just as much is that this is a recent success for our Regeneron Genetics Center, these large-scale sequencing efforts that we've undertaken to try to see how genetic variation is associated with disease. And IL-33 is one of the exciting premier targets that has been in our minds identified and validated by the genetics, not only in this disease but in some other allergic diseases. So we've actually seen genetic evidence that if you have gain of function mutations in IL-33, it increases the chances of having some of these disease loss of function mutations are protective, and that gets us a lot of confidence. We've always been driven by genetics, but in this case, it's using the latest large-scale genetics approaches to actually identify and validate targets that gives us this confidence to move this forward so rapidly. And the thing that's very exciting to us is this is an area where we already feel we have made this advance and have this foundational treatment in dupilumab. And wouldn't it be great now if we could improve the benefit in some patients by combining it with the IL-33. And once again, we're considering doing this in multiple allergic conditions because the genetic support that this can be the case, not only in asthma, but in COPD and maybe atopic dermatitis and other settings as well.
George D. Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Right. Josh, let's just close on one point that I think maybe we didn't even emphasize enough is that the other thing that's really important about dupilumab is we really do have an extensive clinical development profile from the safety point of view, and that's building every day in the commercial point of view. And going forward in this field, Dupixent has now set an extremely high bar I believe, not just on the efficacy side but on the safety side. In the rheumatoid arthritis field, people, because biologics came with a cost, are willing to accept that cost because they had great efficacy. We've got really what I think is terrific efficacy but also almost unprecedented safety that we've seen thus far in our clinical trials. We really haven't seen the kinds of immune dysfunction problems that you see when you block other angles of the immune system.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: And just to add to that, again, I think this is the future. It's the future of medicine and it's the future of drug development. The genetics that we have that support our targets, for example, IL-33, not only are supporting that blocking IL-33 function or loss of function mutants in IL-33 can be protective, but they're also comforting us in terms of the safety profile going in. So genetics are really offering an opportunity to get insights before you ever do studies in humans into the future potential benefit, but also the safety profile, which is another reason why we're very excited about the IL-33.
Joshua Schimmer - Evercore ISI: Okay.
Manisha Narasimhan, Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Paulette, that concludes our call today.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. And you may now disconnect.

Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Thank you, Manisha. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call and webcast today. It has been an incredibly productive first half of the year for Regeneron with the launch of two important new medicines and we are looking forward to continued progress in the second half of the year. EYLEA, a flagship anti-VEGF drug for the treatment of a variety of retinal diseases, delivered strong results in both the U.S. and ex-U.S. markets. In the U.S., we experienced an 11% year-over-year growth in net sales during the quarter. We are proud that U.S. EYLEA net sales have grown steadily since the launch in 2011 without ever having taken any price increases. This growth has been driven by new patients and new indications. The launch of Dupixent, our breakthrough IL-4/IL-13 inhibitor for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, is underway. Though it is still early, we are happy to report that the launch continues to progress extremely well, and most important, we have been very pleased with the positive reception that Dupixent has received from patients and physicians, along with the progress we have made with payers. In terms of the pace of the launch, we have seen a steady flow of both prescriptions written for new patients, as well as prescriptions filled for new patients, without any evidence of a bolus effect. We know from patients that atopic dermatitis can have a terrible impact on their lives, so we are glad that we are hearing positive anecdotes about how patients are responding to Dupixent in a manner consistent with the effect we saw in our clinical trials program. The teams at Regeneron and Sanofi have been working together to improve patient and physician awareness, and ensure that those eligible for Dupixent are able to receive the drug. Bob Terifay will provide detailed metrics about this exciting launch. We're encouraged by the clinical progress that we are making with dupilumab in indications beyond atopic dermatitis. The most advanced of these is asthma, where we expect top-line Phase 3 data from a second pivotal trial later this quarter, with a potential U.S. regulatory submission in the fourth quarter of this year. George will address the asthma indication in greater detail. In May, we received approval for and launched Kevzara, our IL-6 receptor antibody for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in the United States. Kevzara marks the sixth FDA approved drug for Regeneron. We are proud that these six approved drugs, along with our pipeline of 17 product candidates, have all been discovered by the scientists at Regeneron. As you all know, it is rare for any biopharmaceutical company to bring a single drug all the way from discovery to commercialization. To have done it six times is a tribute to our people and their efforts. Regeneron discovered drugs had over $1.5 billion in global net sales in the second quarter of 2017. Turning now to Praluent. We are awaiting the opinion of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit following the oral arguments that occurred in early June. We continue to believe that the law, in fact, support our position. Our 18,000-patient cardiovascular outcome study is ongoing and we expect to report data from this study in early 2018. We and our collaborator, Sanofi, are committed to optimizing the potential benefit that this important drug can bring to patients. Our immuno-oncology programs continue to advance. At the June annual ASCO meeting, we presented positive clinical data from our PD-1 antibody program in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. George will provide additional details on these, as well as the progress we are making with our other immuno-oncology programs. We are preparing for a busy second half with multiple important data readouts and continued pipeline progress. You will hear more about that – some of these programs from George. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to George.
George D. Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Thank you, Len, and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us today. We believe Regeneron is a very different type of company, in that it was founded by and is led by physicians and scientists dedicated to a science-first approach to bringing new medicines that can make important difference in patients' lives. This commitment, supported by a talented and longstanding team of scientists and strategic investments in internal technology development, has today produced what many believe is one of the best pipelines in the industry. And as Len mentioned, all of our approved and investigational therapies were discovered in our own labs by our own people. I will provide a general update on our R&D progress today and highlight two Phase 3 programs, for which we expect to have data readouts in the second half of this year. These are dupilumab in asthma and REGN2810, our PD-1 antibody in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. I'd like to begin with one of our most exciting late-stage program, Dupixent, also known as dupilumab, our interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 blocker, which was approved in March by the FDA for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adult patients whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or when these therapies are not advisable. In addition to the FDA approval, we have recently granted a positive opinion by the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy. We expect to receive EU approval in the third quarter of 2017. In the pediatric atopic dermatitis setting, we are currently enrolling a Phase 3 study of dupilumab in patients 12 to 17 years of age. In the second half of the year, we expect to initiate two additional studies in the younger atopic dermatitis patients; the first in children between the ages of 6 and 11, and the second in children between the ages of six months and five years. We believe that dupilumab has potential to benefit a variety of allergic or atopic conditions. And we are investigating the use of dupilumab in several of these, including asthma, eosinophilic esophagitis, and nasal polyps. Today, I'd like to focus on the potential opportunity in our most advanced indication, asthma, where we expect top-line data later this quarter from our pivotal Phase 3 study LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST. Data from our previously reported positive Phase 2 study are considered pivotal and will support our regular submission, which we anticipate in the fourth quarter of 2017. The Phase 3 LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST study enrolled approximately 1,800 adult and adolescent patients with persistent uncontrolled asthma. In this study, patients will randomize to one of two dupilumab arms, 200 milligrams every other week or 300 milligrams every other week, or placebo; patients who are on background therapy of medium to high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus a second-controller medication, such as a long-acting beta-agonist or a leukotriene receptor antagonist. The study has two primary endpoints, the annualized rate of asthma attacks or exacerbations over the 52-week treatment period and the absolute change from baseline in FEV1 at week 12, a measure of lung function, both of which will be assessed in the overall patient population. I'd like to remind you of data from our previously reported positive Phase 2b study, which was conducted in a patient population similar to the one we are studying in Phase 3. This Phase 2b study randomized 769 patients with moderate-to-severe asthma, who were uncontrolled despite treatment with inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-agonist. The results from this study demonstrate that dupilumab administered at 200-milligram every other week or 300-milligram every other week, in combination with standard-of-care therapy, demonstrated a significant 12% to 15% improvement in FEV1 at week 12 over the standard-of-care alone, as well as there is a significant 64% to 75% reduction in exacerbations over standard-of-care alone. Importantly, these positive response were seen in both the patient population with high blood eosinophils, believed to be a marker of the allergic disease patients, as well as the overall study population. The most common adverse event in the study was injection site reaction, which was more frequent in dupilumab dose group at 13% to 25% compared to 12% in the placebo group. The incidence of infections was balanced across treatment groups, as was the incidence of serious adverse events. We believe that if the Phase 3 LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST data demonstrate efficacy both in terms of reduction in exacerbations and an improvement in lung function in all comers, including the subset of patients with high eosinophil count, as well as the subset of patients with low eosinophil counts, it would be an important differentiating factor. No approved biologic has demonstrated robust improvement in lung function, as well as profound reduction in exacerbations, in the overall asthma population, including both these important subsets of patients. In addition to the LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST study, we're also conducting another Phase 3 study, LIBERTY ASTHMA VENTURE, which is designed to determine the efficacy and safety of dupilumab, while reducing the use of oral corticosteroid in patients with severe oral steroid dependent asthma. Top-line results from this study will be reported by the end of 2017 and are anticipated to be part of our regulatory commission. We are also investigating the use of dupilumab in younger patients with asthma, with an ongoing Phase 3 study in children ages 6 to 11 years old. Turning now to other potential and important indications where we are investigating dupilumab. We currently have two Phase 3 studies ongoing in patients with nasal polyps. We're also planning a Phase 3 study in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis, following recent positive results from a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study. These results will be presented in detail at an upcoming medical conference. We're also planning studies of dupilumab in patients with food allergies. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control, or the CDC, allergic diseases are the sixth leading cause of chronic illness in the United States and have reached epidemic proportion. There is a tremendous amount of scientific debate on the drivers behind this increased incidence and prevalence. Our collective data from the dupilumab clinical studies suggest that deviation of the immune system triggered by over-activity of the IL-4/IL-13 axis may be the key driver of many, if not most, allergic conditions. So-called allergic patients with an overactive IL-4/IL-13 pathway often suffer from more than one manifestation at a given time. For example, patients with asthma or atopic dermatitis often also suffer from severe respiratory or food allergies, and the combination of multiple allergic conditions can be quite devastating for an allergic individual. The possibility that a single biologic may simultaneously help many of these related allergic conditions would be very exciting and important to many patients. Just as important, it would be ideal if such a correction of allergic disease could occur without inducing concurrent immunosuppression. All our studies to-date indicate that unlike many other biologics that target the immune system which often produces immunosuppression and side-effects such as infections, dupilumab does not appear to be an immunosuppressant. Rather dupilumab appears to be an immunomodulatory agent that blocks the pathologic overactivity of IL-4/IL-13 driven allergic responses. I would now like to talk about another important area of research for us at Regeneron, and that is the field of immuno-oncology. Despite all the early successes and excitement in the field, cancer remains a challenging area, and there have been a recent string of disappointments with several development programs. Just last week, another highly anticipated trial exploiting a PD-L1 antibody alone and in combination with the CTLA-4 antibody yielded disappointing data. These developments underscore that the field is still in the very early stages of fully understanding how to exploit and optimize the power of immuno-oncology. In contrast to some of the recent disappointing results elsewhere, recent developments with our PD-1 antibody have been positive. The ASCO conference in June this year was an exciting time for us. We presented important data with REGN2810, our PD-1 antibody, in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or CSCC, which is the second most common skin cancer after basal cell carcinoma and the second deadliest skin cancer after melanoma. It is estimated that there are approximately 4,000 to 8,000 deaths annually in the United States from CSCC. For patients with advanced CSCC, there are limited treatment options and no standard of care. The data that we presented at the ASCO conference were the pooled results from two expansion arms in metastatic or inoperable locally or regionally advanced CSCC from 26 patients in our 392-patient Phase 1 trial. These CSCC data demonstrated that treatment with REGN2810 led to an overall response rate of 46%, including two complete responses according to investigator's assessment and a disease control rate of 69%. The median progression-free and overall survival were not reached at the data cutoff date, with a median follow-up of 6.9 months. The adverse event profile was generally consistent with agents in this class. Based on these encouraging results, we are conducting larger efforts in metastatic and locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Recent discussions with the FDA indicate that if these data are robust, they could form the basis of a regulatory submission in the first quarter of 2018. Work on developing REGN2810 in other indications continues, where we are currently enrolling a Phase 3 study in our non-small cell lung cancer indication, a Phase 2 study in basal cell carcinoma and additional earlier studies in other indications as well. We're also exploring the use of our PD-1 antibody in combination with novel vaccines in oncolytic viruses. Our second checkpoint inhibitor, REGN3767, an antibody LAG-3, is currently enrolling patients in two studies; one in monotherapy and one in combination with our PD-1 antibody. Additionally, our bispecific CD20/CD3 antibody, REGN1979, is also being studied in the clinic as both a monotherapy and in combination with our PD-1 antibody. In the second quarter, we were granted orphan drug designation from the FDA for REGN1979 for the treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL. Our EYLEA business continues to be strong and we remain committed to maintaining our leadership position. Part of this commitment is to help educate the community on the importance of regular dosing with anti-VEGF therapies. Real world evidence indicates that many patients receiving anti-VEGF therapies are not being optimally treated, resulting in more widespread vision loss than is necessary. This decreases patients' quality of life and results in substantial cost to society, particularly when leading to blindness and disability. There has even been a bias that chronic sustained VEGF inhibition may account for the inability of most patients to maintain their vision over the long-term. Our long-term data with the VIEW extension study, which followed wet AMD patients treated for approximately four years using EYLEA in a standardized and fixed regimen, show that for the first time the initial gain seen with any anti-VEGF agent can be largely maintained for the long-term. This was the first time that such data have been demonstrated with any anti-VEGF agent. This is in contrast to long-term studies with other anti-VEGF agents using flexible dosing regimens, such as the CATT study, which resulted in loss of the early visual acuity gains that were achieved with monthly dosing. Taken together with additional real-world data, this suggests that under-treatment with anti-VEGF agent is a serious disservice to patients and a major public health issue. We believe the overall data in this felid indicate that the treatment goal of anti-VEGF therapy should be chronic, sustained, and potent VEGF inhibition. Many elderly people are needlessly losing vision and going blind. We are committed to doing a better job to address this issue. In the second half of this year, we expect to report top line data from two Phase 2 studies; one in wet age-related macular degeneration, or wet AMD, and another in diabetic macular edema, or DME, of EYLEA in combination with nesvacumab, an antibody to angiopoietin 2. The primary endpoint in these studies will be assessed at 36 weeks, and we expect top-line results from these studies in the fourth quarter of 2017. These results will help us understand with a combination of EYLEA with an antibody to angiopoietin 2 can improve upon the already high bar that has been set by EYLEA. PANORAMA, our Phase 3 study of EYLEA in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy without diabetic macular edema continues to enroll patients. The primary endpoints of this study will be assessed at week 24 and at week 52. A separate Phase 3 study in this indication, PROTOCOL-W, which is being conducted by the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network, or the DRCR, continues to enroll patients. This study will explore every 16 week dosing of EYLEA, which is the only anti-VEGF treatment being investigated in this study. We plan to submit our supplemental BLA for EYLEA dosed every 12 weeks by the end of the year. Moving on to Praluent, our PCSK9 inhibitor antibody for lowering LDL cholesterol, we expect in the first quarter of 2018 top-line data from the ongoing 18,000-patient ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study. If these results are positive and recognized in formal treatment guidelines, we believe this would allow for greater uptake of drugs in this important class. In addition to our efforts with Praluent in cardiovascular disease, we are also developing evinacumab, our antibody to angiopoietin-like 3, for the treatment of Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia, or Homozygous FH, in severe forms of hyperlipidemia. Following positive data from a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study in patients with Homozygous FH, we plan to advance evinacumab into a Phase 3 trial in Homozygous FH. Additional studies in hypertriglyceridemia and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia are also being planned. As a reminder, evinacumab has been granted both orphan drug as well as breakthrough destination by the FDA for the treatment of Homozygous FH. In May of this year, we published data in the New England Journal of Medicine showing that people with inactivating mutations of angiopoietin-like 3 have an approximately 40% reduced risk of coronary artery disease and significantly lower levels of key blood lipids, including triglycerides and LDL cholesterol. We were able to identify these mutations through our genetics efforts at the Regeneron Genetics Center. Furthermore, we published Phase 2 clinical data that demonstrate that blocking angiopoietin-like 3 with evinacumab in patients with Homozygous FH who are in lipid-lowering therapies resulted in an additional 49% reduction from baseline in LDL cholesterol at week four. A reduction in other key lipid parameters, including Lp(a) and triglycerides, was also observed. Kevzara, or sarilumab, our interleukin-6 receptor antibody for rheumatoid arthritis, has received regulatory approval in Canada, the United States, and the EU. In terms of clinical development for sarilumab, we are currently enrolling patients in a Phase 2 study in Polyarticular-course Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis, or pJIA. We are also advancing our Phase 3 program for fasinumab, our Nerve Growth Factor antibody for pain, where we dosed the first patient in our Phase 3 efficacy study in osteoarthritis pain. We remain on track to initiate a Phase 3 efficacy study in chronic lower back pain in the second half and we continue to enroll our long-term safety study. In the second half of the year, we expect to report top-line data from our Phase 3 program with REGN2222, also known as suptavumab, a wholly-owned antibody that we are investigating for prophylaxis of respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. RSV infections represent a substantial burden and is estimated that over 20% of infants under the age of six months require medical attention for RSV annually. This study explores two dosing regimens; suptavumab administered either once or twice during RSV season in preterm infants. Development in other parts of our early-stage pipeline continue to advance and I would like to highlight a few of the programs. Our Activin A antibody, REGN2477, is in clinical development for the treatment of the rare disease Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva, or FOP. In the second quarter of 2017, we received Fast Track designation from the FDA and we anticipate initiating a Phase 2 clinical study in the second half of 2017. We're also studying our Activin A antibody in combination with our GDF8 antibody in settings where there may be benefit to promoting muscle growth. REGN3500, our interleukin-33 antibody, is in Phase 1 clinical studies in patients with asthma and REGN3918, our wholly-owned C5 antibody, has now entered clinical development. Before I conclude, I want to say a few words about the ending of our Antibody Discovery Agreement with Sanofi, which Bob Landry will discuss in more detail. Praluent, Dupixent, Kevzara, REGN2810 are our anti-PD-1 antibody. REGN3500, our anti-IL-33 antibody, and REGN3767, our anti-LAG-3 antibody, were all discovered and initially developed under this Antibody Discovery Agreement. Praluent, Dupixent, Kevzara, and REGN3500 will continue to be developed and commercialized, as applicable, with Sanofi under the Antibody License and Collaboration Agreement. REGN2810 and REGN3767 will continue to be developed with Sanofi under the immuno-oncology collaboration. We believe that our collaboration with Sanofi is one of the most productive arrangements in the history of the biotechnology industry and we look forward to continued collaborative efforts with Sanofi in the future. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob Terifay.
Robert J. Terifay - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. EYLEA continues to be the market leading product among FDA approved anti-VEGF agents for all that's approved indications in the United States, with a 73% market share in terms of dollars in the second quarter of 2017 compared to 69% market share in the second quarter of 2016. In the second quarter of 2017, U.S. net sales of EYLEA, or aflibercept, were $919million versus $831 million in the second quarter of 2016, which represents growth of 11% year-over-year. Ex-U.S. net sales of EYLEA in the second quarter of 2017 were $542 million compared to $486 million in the second quarter of 2016, which represents growth of 12% on a reported basis. For the second – six months ended June 30, 2017, U.S. EYLEA net sales grew 10% year-over-year compared to the first half of 2016. The overall branded anti-VEGF market in the U.S. grew by 7.4% in the first half of 2017 compared to the first half of 2016. These numbers indicate that EYLEA growth is driven by overall growth in the market, as well as an increase in market share. As George noted, we're preparing for the submission this year of data to the FDA from the second year of our Phase 3 wet AMD studies, which shows that approximately 50% of patients were able to be treated with every 12-week dosing. We are also continuing to enroll patients in a Phase 3 study, a non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Turning now to the recent launch of Dupixent, or dupilumab, in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. As reported by our collaborator, Sanofi, global net sales for Dupixent in the second quarter were $29 million. These sales largely reflect end-user demand in the United States, with negligible contribution from inventory build. We are pleased with the way the launch is tracking and the prescriptions are trending ahead above a recently launched biologics in dermatology. As of last week, over 5,000 healthcare professionals had prescribed Dupixent, with over 13,000 prescriptions written. Over the past two months approximately 750 new patients per week have received a prescription for Dupixent from the healthcare provider. During the past two months, approximately 500 patients per week, who are new to the brand, have had prescriptions filled. On the market access front, things are progressing well. As we previously communicated, the two largest pharmacy benefits managers, Express Scripts and CVS, provided immediate coverage from launch with utilization management criteria that are consistent with the Dupixent label. We continue to work with payers to try and ensure that all appropriate patients are able to access Dupixent and expect to have broad market access by the end of the year. Outside of the United States, Dupixent has received the positive CHMP recommendation in July of this year, with the launch expected in Europe later this year. Turning now to Kevzara, or sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Net global sales to the end of the second quarter were $1 million. It is still very early days, given that Kevzara was approved and launched in the United States towards the end of May. The initial feedback from physicians has been positive and we are working on building market access. We have received EMEA approval of Kevzara in the EU, with the launch beginning in August. Turning now to Praluent, or alirocumab. As reported by Sanofi, net sales in the second quarter were $46 million worldwide, with the U.S. accounting for $33 million of the total. While we continue to be disappointed by the uptake of the PCSK9 inhibitor class, we are encouraged by ongoing discussions with payers with respect to improvement in utilization management criteria. Earlier this week, CVS announced that it would provide co-preferred access to Praluent through its CVS Caremark commercial formularies, which cover approximately 25 million lives. We remain optimistic about the long-term potential for this class. The potential resolution of our patent dispute with Amgen and anticipated cardiovascular outcomes data for Praluent in early 2018 could have an impact on demand. We remain committed to our efforts to improve Praluent access and bring this important product to more patients who can benefit. We're also proceeding with our potential regulatory filings and commercialization planning for Dupixent in asthma and REGN2810, our PD-1 inhibitor, in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Landry.
Robert E. Landry - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Regeneron posted strong second quarter 2017 financial results driven from the continued strength of our global EYLEA franchise. We're particularly pleased with achieving these results during a period where, together with our collaborator Sanofi, we have launched in the U.S. and are preparing to launch ex-U.S. two significant products, Dupixent and Kevzara. During today's call, I will discuss our financial results and highlight changes to our full year 2017 guidance line items. In the second quarter of 2017, we earned $4.17 per diluted share from non-GAAP net income of $487 million. This represents a year-over-year increase in both non-GAAP diluted EPS and net income of 48%. Regeneron's second quarter 2017 non-GAAP net income excludes non-cash share-based compensation expense and the loss on extinguishment of debt, and includes the income tax effect of non-GAAP reconciling items. A full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is set forth in our earnings release, which can be found on our website. Total revenues in the second quarter of 2017 were $1.47 billion, which represented year-over-year growth of 21% over the second quarter of 2016. Net product sales were $924 million in the second quarter of 2017 compared to $834 million in the second quarter of 2016. EYLEA net product sales in the United States were $919 million in the second quarter of 2017 compared to $831 million in the second quarter of 2016, which represents an increase of 11%. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, EYLEA net product sales in the United States were $1.77 billion versus $1.61 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2016, an increase of 10%. We are raising our estimated full year 2017 U.S. EYLEA net product sales growth guidance to approximately 10% over 2016. Similar to the first quarter of 2017, EYLEA experienced another modest decrease in U.S. distributor inventory levels during the second quarter and remained within our normal one to two week targeted range. Ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales, which are recorded by our collaborator Bayer, were $542 million in the second quarter of 2017 as compared to $486 million in the second quarter of 2016, representing a 12% increase on a reported basis. On an operational or constant currency basis, sales increased approximately 16%. In the second quarter of 2017, Regeneron recognized $191 million from our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the United States. Total Bayer collaboration revenue for the second quarter of 2017 was $210 million. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $222 million for the second quarter of 2017. The Sanofi collaboration revenue line item primarily consists of reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred R&D expenses, reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred commercialization-related expenses, and our share of profits or losses in connection with the commercialization of antibodies. In the second quarter of 2017, our share of losses in connection with the commercialization of Praluent, Dupixent, and Kevzara was $122 million. This can be found in Table 4 of our earnings release. This loss includes our share of increased spending related to the ongoing Dupixent and Kevzara launches in the United States, as well as preparations related to launching Dupixent and Kevzara in other territories. We continue to proactively manage our marketing and selling expenditures in the global commercialization of Praluent with our collaborator Sanofi. Netted within these losses were the global sales of Praluent, Dupixent, and Kevzara, as recorded by our collaborator Sanofi. For the second quarter of 2017, global net sales were Praluent $46 million, Dupixent $29 million, and Kevzara $1 million. Dupixent net sales in the second quarter largely reflect end-user demand and negligible contribution from inventory build. There were no material Dupixent sales outside the U.S. Before I move on from the Sanofi antibody collaboration line, I'd like to inform you that the Antibody Discovery Agreement will be ending in accordance with its terms without any extension on December 31, 2017. The Antibody License and Collaboration Agreement, the Immuno-Oncology Discovery and Development Agreement, and the Immuno-Oncology License and Collaboration Agreement are not impacted by the expiration of the Antibody Discovery Agreement. The $130 million of 2017 annual funding from Sanofi under the Antibody Discovery Agreement is expected to be fully utilized by the end of the third quarter of 2017. In the second quarter of 2017, other revenue was $114 million versus $23 million as of the second quarter of 2016. This increase was primarily due to the achievement of milestones in connection with our collaboration agreements related to the development of fasinumab with both Teva and Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma. In the second quarter 2017, we recognized a $25 million substantive milestone from Teva and a $30 million substantive milestone from Mitsubishi. For further details, you can find a summary of the components of other revenue in the MD&A section of our 10-Q. Turning now to expenses, non-GAAP R&D expenses were $440 million for the second quarter of 2017. Our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as the total non-GAAP R&D expense less R&D reimbursements from our collaborators, was $196 million in the second quarter of 2017. Our press release includes all the information that is required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense. We are lowering and tightening our full-year 2017 guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to be in the range of $925 million to $965 million from our previous guidance of $950 million to $1.025 billion. Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $262 million for the second quarter of 2017. We are tightening and lowering our full year 2017 guidance of non-GAAP SG&A to $1.12 billion to $1.16 billion from our previous guidance range of $1.14 billion to $1.2 billion. Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses, a line item found within Sanofi collaboration revenue, was $87 million for the second quarter of 2017. We are tightening and lowering our full year 2017 guidance of Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses to $370 million to $400 million from our previous guidance range of $385 million to $425 million. One last operating expense I'd like to review is our cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing. As a reminder, this line item primarily reflects the cost incurred to manufacture commercial supplies for our collaborators. The increase to $61 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 versus $28 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was primarily driven by higher than historical manufacturing losses. Before I conclude my prepared remarks with a review of taxes and our liquidity position, I do want to highlight an out-of-period adjustment to reflect a correction in our accounting for the lease of the Tarrytown, New York facility that was recorded in the second quarter of 2017. The adjustment resulted in the recognition of a $30 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the March 3, 2017 lease transaction and a corresponding decrease to property, plant, and equipment. These adjustments consisted entirely of non-cash adjustments, and therefore had no impact on our previously reported amounts in the statement of cash flows. Further details can be found in our most recent 10-Q that was filed earlier this morning. This loss on debt extinguishment has not been included within our non-GAAP results. Turning now to taxes. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2017 was approximately 26% as compared to approximately 33% for the second quarter of 2016. For the full year 2017, we are tightening and lowering guidance for our effective tax rate to be in the range of 27% to 31% from the previous range of 32% to 38%. This updated guidance reflects higher actual and forecasted tax deductions from stock option exercises, given the recent increase in our stock price, as well as lower forecasted losses in foreign jurisdictions. As stated on previous calls, there will be volatility in our effective tax rate on a quarter-to-quarter basis, since the tax benefits of stock-based compensation is included based on actual exercises in a quarter. From a cash flow and balance sheet perspective, we ended the second quarter of 2017 with cash and marketable securities of $2.3 billion, a level consistent with March 31, 2017. Despite strong quarter 2017 operational results, our cash flow from operations in the second quarter was adversely impacted due to three factors. Higher inventory levels to support our two recent launches, plus more EYLEA inventory to support increased demand; higher Sanofi, Bayer, and trade accounts receivable; and higher cash tax payments. The tax payments included the final payment related to the Sanofi immuno-oncology collaboration upfront that we received in 2015. Our capital expenditures for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2017 were $55 million and $105 million, respectively. We are lowering and tightening our full year 2017 capital expenditure guidance to be in the range of $250 million to $285 million from our previously provided range of $300 million to $350 million. With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Manisha.
Manisha Narasimhan, Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Thank you, Bob. Jason, we'd now like to open the call for Q&A. In the interest of time, we request that you limit yourself to one question. We will be available in the office after the call for follow-up questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey. Good morning. Congrats on strong quarter and thanks for the question. I want to ask about EYLEA. It sounds like your competitor, Lucentis, in the U.S. is experiencing actually quarter-over-quarter sequential decline in the sales in 2Q. So I was wondering what contributed to the strength in EYLEA and also what has changed since you guided single-digit growth in the beginning of the year. And then quickly on Dupixent, any reason why we should see a strong inflection of additional patients add every week, instead of just steady NRx every week? Thank you.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Bob, do you want to handle the EYLEA question?
Robert J. Terifay - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Yeah. EYLEA, as we pointed out earlier, has grown due to a growing in the market, which is partially related to the demographics in the marketplace, and also has grown in terms of market share. We believe some of that growth in market share is related to the positive data we've seen with EYLEA in diabetic macular edema. And in terms of a decline in Lucentis, there is multiple factors that could contribute to it, including any discounting they're doing, which relates to gross-to-net differences. With regards to Dupixent, we have payers coming onboard on a regular basis. As I said, we expect broad market access by the end of the year. Patient claims are still making their way through the pipeline in many cases, so we do expect more perceptions being dispensed. And we continue to educate on disease awareness to let patients, who've been disenfranchised from the system, get back into their physicians and benefit from the product.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Yeah, Ying, let me just amplify a little bit on the Dupixent question there. Remember, the first question that we all were interested in, would there be a bolus, would there be a large number of patients who would get a prescription very soon after launch, and then the number of prescriptions written go down dramatically. We did not see that. We've seen a very steady number of prescriptions written, as we indicated, somewhere – over the last couple of months it's been very steady on a weekly basis. The way that number could – so we are very pleased that there's no bolus. Obviously, this is what the system, if you will, can churn out right now. How could that grow? We can see in – I'm just talking about on the written prescription side, not the filled side, that that could go – obviously, if we see an increase in the number of prescribers, which takes time, but we are starting to see that, or whether or not the prescribers start to write prescriptions for patients who are not just more severe patients. We're seeing from what we can tell and hear that, as you would expect with the launch of a new class of drug, that patients who have been prescribed the drug, typically are the most severe of the patients. So those are ways that the number could up, but first stop in this was to make sure there wasn't just a bolus and it was all going down, which we can now say at least over the first period of this launch, that's not the case. Next question...
Manisha Narasimhan, Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Operator, next question please.
Robert J. Terifay - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Len, I think it is important to mention that now as these patients are coming back to their physician, we're hearing many of these patients are having very, very positive results in terms of reduced lesions and improved itch, and that is really contributing to patient satisfaction.
George D. Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Yeah, I just wanted – this is George. I want to point out a couple things. Despite the mechanics of the healthcare system and reimbursement and rebates and all this, I'd like to think that physicians and patients are still driven quite a bit by how the drugs are actually performing and making a difference in their lives. So I'd like to think that one of the reasons that EYLEA is growing in market share is because of the recognition by physicians and patients of what a difference it's making in their experiences. And I think as Bob points out, we hope to see that the same will continue to be true as we're seeing from the early reports on Dupixent. And I think another very important thing to realize about Dupixent is also the long view. As I noticed in my remarks, we are developing this for a very large number of allergic indications. The data right now, the early data and including pivotal study data is all very promising, so long-term growth in dupilumab is going to be by the recognition that it may be an important drug for many different allergic conditions, starting with asthma and going onward, and moreover that in a single-patient, hopefully, we'll be able to show in convincing way that in single patient it will able to simultaneously benefit multiple of their allergic conditions. And so we think that if the medicine is doing and bringing the sort of benefit that we think it's doing to the patients that that recognition will drive, of course, use because of the benefit it provides.
Manisha Narasimhan, Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Operator, next question please.
Operator: We have Chris Raymond from Raymond James.
Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey. Thanks. I've got a question on the pipeline. So, Len, I heard you say in a recent meeting – I heard you highlight REGN2810, your PD-1, when you were asked to talk about which pipeline program excites you the most. So I think we know the clinical plan that you guys have outlined is unique. You guys have seized on what looks like a pretty novel and quick path to market. But maybe if you could talk about the biology of the molecule that makes you think that sort of head-to-head this should be better maybe than other more advanced PD-1s. Just maybe talk about what drives you to highlight that molecule as the most exciting pipeline drug.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Yeah. I'm going to let George field with that question, but before I turn it over to him, I just wanted to point out that this is tough business. And if you look at each of our programs and what's been going on around us, it's been quite remarkable. If you just think about it, in the PD-1 space, which George will get into in a bit more, we've seen failures of PD-L1 to deliver survival benefits where PD-1 agents have. We've seen a failure of a PD-1 agent where another PD-1 agent was successful. In the PCSK9 space, we've seen the failure of one agent to get to market because of issues in, from what I understand, immunogenicity. In the IL-4/IL-13 space, we've seen people historically have failed with even going after the right target and people having failed by going after the wrong target, such as going after IL-13, and maybe people not getting even optimal results going after IL-5. If you think about EYLEA, we've seen lot of explanations about why people shouldn't be able to get long-term benefit in it. The savior for this was going to be PDGF. An anti-VEGF therapy was banned. You've heard George, I think, put out a very convincing case that that's just not the case and the PDGF has fallen by the wayside. Just yesterday in the IL-6 space, you've seen a group of people who chose IL-6 ligand instead of the IL-6 receptor, and that didn't seem to go so well, at least based on the vote of the advisory panel. So I just want to say that there is a lot that goes on and maybe the guy who makes all these choices for us and seems to have gone pretty good in the batting average can comment on the PD-1 space. George?
George D. Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Yeah. I was going to actually bring up a lot of the same examples as Len just did. In terms of pointing out how really difficult this business is, how it really is so challenging, and it's really such a industry of failure, because the bar is rightfully set so high. I mean, we want to be bringing forward important, effective, and safe medicines to patients, and that, frankly, is probably the single hardest thing that we as a society actually do in terms of discovering and developing products. And while I was reading my comments, I have to say I was shocked and stunned at how productive our people have been over so many years to produce so many product candidates and, as Len said, I'm a big track record guy. Over and over again, we've made the right decisions about which targets, about picking and selecting the right – out of many candidates, the right candidates to bring forward. And over and over again, we more likely than not have been proven right. And I think that this is something that is incredibly vastly underappreciated in this industry, how much of a role institutional knowledge plays and having a senior experienced leadership team that has the capability to over and over again make these decisions and pull on their collective memories to help make these sort of decisions. And if you go anywhere else and you look how long the people who are making these decisions have been around at that particular place, and it's just a couple of years. Here, our senior management team at all levels – I'm not just talking about me and Len and the other most senior people, but we have in general people 15, 20 years who have been leading various efforts and we have enormous collective memory and institutional memory here. And it's only with that then you can have that sort of track record that can lead to the discovery of dozens and dozens of product candidates and be moving them forward, and in more cases than not be making the right decisions and making your bets. And whether it's picking PD-1 as opposed to PD-L1 and picking the right PD-1 antibody or picking IL-6 receptor versus IL-6 and picking the right IL-6 receptor antibody, or picking the right antibody for PCSK9 or picking the right target in the field of allergy, which nobody else happened to have picked in the entire world. This all comes from incredible internal genius and institutional memory that is very rare and, as I said, represents one of the hardest things we do as a society. The track record in the rest of the world is overwhelmingly one of failure. And, no, not everything we do will work, not anything we do will succeed. We have an amazing track record because of this institutional memory and the genius that we have here.
Manisha Narasimhan, Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Operator, next question, please.
Operator: We have Geoff Porges from Leerink Partners.
Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC: Thanks very much. I just wanted to follow up on the questions about Dupixent, particularly the launch. You mentioned that 13,000 patients have been prescribed Dupixent. But could you tell us how many of those have converted to filled prescriptions? And then secondly, Bob, could you give us a sense of what – of the patients that have had one filled prescription, what proportion of them are filling a second and ideally a third prescription, i.e., what's the treatment persistence after patients have started on Dupixent? Thanks very much. Just want to try and clarify how this is going.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Well, Geoff, this is Len. I mean, I think that Bob can comment if he has the number on how many patients we think have actually converted. There is obviously a lag. I think the interesting metric for us is that the number of new prescriptions written over the last several months, each week has been in the steady range of around 750 new patients per week, and there's been a steady new patients to the brand, as judged by IMS-type data, of over 500. So, that gives you a little bit of an idea. That's, obviously, not the same – it's not the 750 that got the prescription this week are the ones that are getting the prescription filled. But that gives you an idea of where the launch is sort of – how it's at least been behaving on a weekly basis for the last several months. Bob, do we have an idea of how many patients are actually on product at this time?
Robert J. Terifay - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: I think it's fair to say that most patients have received one or two prescriptions based upon the timing of the launch. So to talk about adherence, it's too early to get into the specifics of that.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Okay.
Manisha Narasimhan, Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Operator, next question, please.
Operator: We have Alethia Young from Credit Suisse.
Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the quarter. I guess just one on the complement program, when might we be in the position to get some of the early data and how are you kind of thinking about dosing in that program or is maybe that's something you're going to find out in the Phase 1? Thanks.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Yeah, it's a little bit early to tell you much about that, but we – of course, we'll try and get all the information we can out of that Phase 1 program. When we have it, we'll make it available. Next question.
Manisha Narasimhan, Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Operator, next question.
Operator: We have Robyn Karnauskas from Citigroup.
Robyn Karnauskas, Ph.D. - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So just a question on the asthma study. So I know you mentioned that patient populations are different, but are there – or similar, but are there any differences between the Phase 2b and the Phase 3 that you think are notable? And I think you're stratifying patients by use of eosinophil counts. What happens if you are only successful in high eosinophils but not among the low eosinophil counts? Thanks.
George D. Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Yeah, I think that, as I described in my comments, the populations are actually very similar. Obviously, when you have such a successful study, you do your best to reproduce it with the least number of modifications and changes. I mean, our first study was rather standard. It wasn't that we did anything so special, other than that we studied both the all-comer population, and then we looked in both the high and the low Eo subset. We designed our study to look in the all-comer population, but we also designed to look in the high Eo population. If our data is limited to the high Eos, it would be a little less differentiating perhaps than we think it might be compared to other agents that are out there in development right now. But as you know, the real excitement is if it's positive in the all-comer population, nobody else has data that shows that a biologic can really affect the all-comer population.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Okay. I think we have time for just one more question today.
Operator: We have Carter Gould from UBS.
Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. For Bob, I guess, thanks for all the color. I guess, I recognize it's early in the launch, but generally speaking, for those plans that have opened up access, how satisfied are you with step edit, prior authorization criteria in place? And for those that have yet to open up access, can you characterize how those conservations are going? Is it really just sort of inertia from the plans focused on rebates or step edits versus them sort of just taking a dug-in stance? Thank you.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: So just very quickly in the interest of time, we can say about a third of the places where decisions have been made, they've been made according to the label and we're very pleased. About another third, just roughly speaking, have made decisions which is slightly more restrictive. They might have – require topical calcineurin inhibitor as opposed to just a topical corticosteroid. A few of those required systematic steroids. And there's still another 35-or-so percent that we're working on, which some of them have automatic blocks and some it just takes time, but we hope to, as we said, get broad access towards the – by the end of the year. Sanofi and Regeneron are working very hard at this, and I think I would have to characterize this based on other metrics we looked at other launches that's going very well in this modern era. Okay.
Manisha Narasimhan, Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: All right. I know many of you were in queue and didn't get a chance to ask your questions. Just send us an e-mail and we'll make sure to follow-up with you. Jason?
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: All right, operator. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.

Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Thanks, Manisha. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call and webcast today. The first quarter of 2017 was an eventful and significant quarter. Dupixent, our breakthrough drug for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adults, received regulatory approval in the United States and the launch is underway. This marked the first of two anticipated FDA approvals in 2017, the second being for sarilumab, also now known as Kevzara, where we have been granted an FDA action or PDUFA date of May 22. Before we get into the details of our quarterly performance, I want to take a moment to remind everyone of two important priorities at Regeneron. At the core, we have always been a company that is driven by science, and committed to bringing important new drugs to patients in need. These priorities are directly responsible for the robust pipeline that we have today, with five FDA approved drugs and 16 product candidates in various stages of clinical development, all of which have come out of Regeneron labs. George will provide more details on pipeline progress. As we advance as a company, the commercial aspects of our business is growing in importance as well. This year, we and our collaborator, Sanofi, are laser-focused on ensuring that the ongoing Dupixent launch is successful. While it is too early for us to provide you with sales updates, I am pleased to share with you that about five weeks into the launch of Dupixent, things are continuing to go well. We are pleased with the interest and reception from both patients and physicians. Just last week you heard from our partner, Sanofi, that about four weeks into the launch, more than 2,500 prescriptions for new patients for Dupixent had been written. I'm happy to inform you to-date that over 3,500 new prescriptions have been written for Dupixent, which translates into over 900 prescriptions written in the past week. We are also pleased with the reaction from the payers on our responsible approach to pricing to date. We continue to work hard to ensure that eligible patients have access to the drug, and we are pleased with the coverage and utilization management criteria that have been put in place thus far. Bob Terifay will provide additional details. While atopic dermatitis in adults is our first indication, we are also investigating the use of Dupixent in several other indications and age groups, ranging from what we think could be a near term opportunity in asthma to other indications such as nasal polyps and eosinophilic esophagitis. Just today, we reported our Phase 2 proof-of-concept study in eosinophilic esophagitis was positive. If we can get approvals for these additional indications, we expect to be in launch mode with Dupixent for many years to come. Maintaining our leadership position with EYLEA as the market-leading branded anti-VEGF drug continues to be a key focus. With our first regulatory approval in wet age-related macular degeneration or wet AMD, the EYLEA business was initially more concentrated towards the elderly, the majority of whom are Medicare patients. But with subsequent approvals in indications such as diabetic macular edema or DME and diabetic retinopathy in DME and retinal vein occlusion, we have diversified to patient groups where there is less reliance on Medicare. We continue to support the ongoing launch of Praluent, our PCSK9 inhibitor antibody, for lowering LDL cholesterol. We expect our 18,000-patient cardiovascular outcome study to be completed towards the end of the year with data in early 2018. On the U.S. patent litigation, we and our collaborator, Sanofi, have been granted an oral argument date of June 6, 2017 at the Court Of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Based on this timing, we could get a decision on the appeal before the end of the year. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to George.
George D. Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Thank you, Len, and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us today. On the call today, I would like to focus on our ongoing clinical development program for dupilumab, review some important data on the long-term use of EYLEA, share some updates on our immuno-oncology program, as well as the progress of the rest of our pipeline. I'd like to begin with the approval of Dupixent, our IL-4/IL-13 blocker for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adult patients whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or when those therapies are not advisable. This approval is the culmination of a scientific quest that has been decades in the making. While Bob Terifay will address the ongoing launch of Dupixent in greater detail, I would like to focus on the progress that we are making in the clinic with dupilumab in various other indications. Asthma is an important late-stage opportunity where we are investigating in the use of dupilumab. Despite the recent approval of drugs from the IL-5 inhibitor class in what has been characterized as the allergic patient population, we believe there is an unmet medical need for these patients for a drug that can markedly improve lung function, as well as provide further protection against exacerbations. In addition, there is a need for drugs that will show efficacy in a wider patient population across all allergic classifications. Based on results from our Phase 2B pivotal study in asthma, where we showed robust improvements in both lung function as measured by FEV1 and reductions in exacerbations, in all patients regardless of their allergic classification, we believe that dupilumab has the potential, if approved, to fill these needs. Our second pivotal study in the adult asthma indication, the LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST study in patients with uncontrolled persistent asthma is fully enrolled and we continue to expect top line data later this year. We believe these data have the potential to confirm the broad efficacy we observed in the first pivotal study. If these data are positive, we expect to complete a regulatory submission in the United States in the fourth quarter of this year. We also recently started enrolling patients in the Phase 3 study of dupilumab in pediatric asthma patients between the ages of 6 and 11 years in the second quarter of 2017. We're also evaluating dupilumab in pediatric atopic dermatitis, where there is a high unmet need, and we were again granted breakthrough status by the FDA. Positive data from the open label Phase 2A trial in patients 6 to 17 years old with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis were recently presented at the American Academy of Dermatology Conference in March. The safety and efficacy data from this trial were very encouraging. We have initiated a Phase 3 study of dupilumab in adolescents between the ages of 12 to 17. We expect to initiate in the second quarter of 2017 a second Phase 3 trial in pediatric patients between the ages of 6 and 11 years. We're also investigating dupilumab in a third clinical setting, which is the treatment of patients with nasal polyps. Following up on earlier positive data from our Phase 2 study in this population, we now have two separate Phase 3 studies that are currently enrolling patients. As Len mentioned, we recently obtained positive results in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study of dupilumab in a fourth important clinical setting, which is in patients with active moderate to severe eosinophilic esophagitis, a chronic inflammation of the esophagus and one of the major causes of dysphasia or difficulty in swallowing. In this Phase 2 study, we observed clinically meaningful efficacy for dupilumab, as well as profound histologic and endoscopic improvement, together with a safety profile consistent with our previous clinical experience. Detailed data from this study will be presented in an upcoming medical conference. While eosinophilic esophagitis can be debilitating in adults, it is especially concerning in the pediatric population, where it can be a cause of failure to thrive, and this could potentially be an area of future clinical investigation for dupilumab. It is believed that eosinophilic esophagitis can be a manifestation of food allergies, further supporting the rationale of exploring the efficacy of dupilumab in patients suffering from severe specific food allergies. In the second half of 2017, we intend to initiate a Phase 2 study of dupilumab in patients with specific food allergy. The positive data for dupilumab across the four allergic or atopic conditions we have investigated to date – that is atopic dermatitis, asthma, nasal polyps, and now eosinophilic esophagitis – is consistent with our long-standing hypothesis that these allergic conditions reflect the same fundamental disease process triggered by overactivity of the IL-4/IL-13 axis. This unifying hypothesis suggests that the differences between these conditions largely reflects how overactivity of IL-4/IL-13 pathway manifests differently in different tissues. For example, overactivity of IL-4 and IL-13 in the skin triggers atopic dermatitis. In the lower airway, it results in asthma. In the upper GI tract, it results in eosinophilic esophagitis. Unfortunately for many patients, IL-4/IL-13-driven allergies can manifest in multiple sites at the same time. Since dupilumab inhibits the key driver of this pathway in all these settings, we believe that it can represent a mechanism-based approach to treat the root cause of these allergic conditions rather than each individual indication on a separate basis. This represents a fundamentally new way to think of, group and treat diseases previously and otherwise thought of as disparate and requiring distinct therapies – that is mechanism-based treatment directed not by a disease organ-specific manifestations, but by the disease's fundamental cause and mechanism. We're also encouraged by the safety profile that we have observed thus far for dupilumab in these settings. I'd like to remind you that the current regulatory framework does not allow for a mechanism-based approach to treatment, but rather an indication-based approach. We are very interested in discussing this type of mechanism-based approach for treating allergic or atopic disease with the regulatory authorities while we continue to pursue more conventional approval strategies. Turning now to Kevzara, our IL-6 receptor antibody for rheumatoid arthritis. As Len mentioned, we anticipate a regulatory decision in the United States, where we've been granted an FDA action date of May 22. In April of 2017, the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use or CHMP adopted a positive opinion for Kevzara for the treatment of moderate to severe RA in adults. We expect a potential approval in Europe for Kevzara in the second quarter of 2017. We have also made regulatory submissions for Kevzara in Japan. Beyond RA, we are currently enrolling patients in the Phase 2 clinical study of sarilumab for the treatment of polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis. We're also considering investigating the use of sarilumab in other indications. Turning to our other late-stage programs, I'd like to begin with EYLEA. As Len mentioned, we are committed to maintaining our leadership position in bringing important advances to patients with retinal diseases. To that end, we are conducting two Phase 2 studies of EYLEA in combination with nesvacumab, our antibody to Ang2, one in diabetic macular edema or DME and another in neovascular age-related macular degeneration or wet AMD. Both studies are fully enrolled, and we will evaluate efficacy and safety at 36 weeks, which we expect in the second half of this year. In addition, we are also investing in EYLEA as a monotherapy in a Phase 3 study in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy without diabetic macular edema. This study, called PANORAMA, continues to enroll patients. I'd like to spend a few moments focusing on findings from the long-term follow-up of our Phase 3 VIEW 1 study of EYLEA in patients with wet AMD, which were recently published in Ophthalmology Retina. As background, existing long-term data with other anti-VEGF agents, most notably from the government-sponsored CATT study, have shown that early visual gains obtained with anti-VEGF agents were not maintained over time. In fact, by the fifth year, patient had lost, on average, over three letters compared to their original baseline. Over 20% of patients have progressed to become legally blind by year five. It had been postulated that this loss of vision is due to inexorable progression of the disease process itself over time, even in the face of anti-VEGF treatment. Others had raised the theory that the anti-VEGF agents themselves contribute to geographic atrophy over time and thus to the subsequent vision loss. In marked contrast to the CATT study, long-term follow-up data from the VIEW 1 study, where patients who were treated with fixed interval EYLEA dosing and received EYLEA on average every 12 weeks in year 2 and every 8 weeks in year 3 and 4 showed that the vision gains observed at the end of the first year were on average largely maintained at 4 years. These long-term results provide the first evidence that long-term treatment with anti-VEGF agents can maintain vision gains in patients with wet AMD. We think these are very important findings for the field. This data support our longstanding view that regular fixed interval dosing regimens result in substantially better visual outcomes compared to PRN or treat-and-extend dosing regimens, which over time result in suboptimal visual acuity benefits and even in substantial visual loss. We think this is probably true regardless of the anti-VEGF agent being utilized. Although we saw that more than 50% – about 50% of the patients in the second year exploratory treatment phase of our long-term trial received fixed corollary treatment and maintained their vision we are more comfortable that the every two-months regimen is likely to maintain vision over the long term based on larger and long-term experience. With regards to convenience-based regimens such as PRN and treat-and-extend approaches, we think they are lacking in convincing and long-term evidence for their ability to maintain vision over the long-term. With regards to this point, we think that doctors should be strongly cautioning their patients that choosing convenience-based dosing has a high risk of causing permanent vision loss for their patients We think it is important that retinal specialists and public health officials begin to recognize the potential public health crisis that may be resulting from irregular dosing regimens that do not follow the FDA-recommended usage guidelines and that the loss of vision that these protocols may be causing may be needlessly occurring in thousands of patients, leaving many irrevocably legally blind. Moving on to Praluent, our PCSK9 inhibitor antibody for lowering LDL cholesterol. We are pleased to announce that Praluent was recently approved in a 300-milligram once monthly dosing regimen. We expect to report top line data from the 18,000 patient ODYSSEY Outcomes study in the first quarter of 2018. Positive outcome data reported with PCSK9 inhibitors further supports the hypothesis that lowering LDL cholesterol with the PCSK9 inhibitor can reduce cardiovascular risk. We look forward to sharing data from our study in early 2018. In addition to our efforts with Praluent and cardiovascular disease, we are also developing evinacumab, our antibody to Angptl-3 for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or homozygous FH. In March of 2017, we announced that the FDA granted evinacumab Breakthrough Designation Status. Just a few weeks ago, we presented a positive data from a Phase 2 proof of concept study of evinacumab in patients with homozygous FH. This data showed that patients who normally don't respond well to statins or to PCSK9 experienced an average reduction of 50% in their LDL cholesterol following two subcutaneous injections of evinacumab with an acceptable safety profile. Our immuno-oncology portfolio continues to progress. Our potentially pivotal study of Regeneron 2810, our PD-1 antibody, continues to enroll patients in the cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma study. We look forward to presenting data from our expansion on in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma patients from our Phase 1 trial at an all-abstract session at the American Society of Clinical Oncology, or ASCO, in June. We also expect to initiate clinical studies in non-small cell lung cancer and basal cell carcinoma in 2017. Our second checkpoint inhibitor, REGN3767, an antibody to LAG-3 is also currently in clinical development where we are studying it both in the mono-therapy setting and in combination with our PD1 antibody. As a reminder, we expect additional IO targets to enter development over the next several years. Additionally, our bispecific CD20xCD3 antibody is also currently being studied in the clinic, as well as in mono-therapy and in combination with our PD-1 antibody. Determining the optimal dosage level with these therapies that are activating the immune system is very important as witnessed by some of the toxicities demonstrated in other drug classes such as the CAR-Ts. While the process has been slow, we believe we are nearing dose selection. Also in late-stage development is suptavumab, also known as REGN2222, which is an antibody in development for respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. Our Phase 3 study has finished enrolling patients, and we expect to report top line data from this study in the second half of the year. We're also advancing our Phase 2 program for fasinumab, our nerve growth factor antibody for pain. Development in other parts of our early-stage pipeline continues to advance. REGN2477, our Activin A antibody is in clinical development for the treatment of the rare disease Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva, or FOP. We expect to begin a Phase 2 trial in this indication in the second half of 2017. We are also studying REGN2477 in combination with trevogrumab, our antibody to GFD8, in a Phase 1 trial which is fully enrolled. Finally, we also initiated Phase 1 multiple ascending dose trial in asthma with REGN3500, our antibody interleukin-33 for inflammatory diseases, in the first quarter of 2017. I think it's important to remind you that all of these programs and all the antibodies in our pipeline are entirely developed and discovered in-house. Before I turn the call over to Bob, I want to take a moment to share my excitement about the first group of Regeneron Science Talent Search winners who were announced in March. Our sponsorship of this storied high school science competition underscores our commitment to fostering the next generation of scientific leaders. After meeting these promising high school students, we feel encouraged that our future is in good hands. With that, let me turn the call over to Bob Terifay.
Robert J. Terifay - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. First quarter 2017 U.S. net sales of EYLEA or aflibercept were $854 million versus $781 million in the first quarter of 2016. This represents growth of 9% year-over-year. Ex-U.S. net sales of EYLEA were $484 million compared to $419 million in the first quarter of 2016. This represents growth of 16% year-over-year. EYLEA is approved in approximately 100 countries for the treatment of wet AMD and DME. EYLEA continues to be the market-leading product among FDA-approved anti-VEGF agents for all of its approved indications in the United States. U.S. EYLEA net sales in the first quarter were impacted by a slight decrease in distributor or inventory as well as an increase in the gross-to-net margin, which Bob Landry will discuss in more detail. Based on a qualitative market research survey we conducted in the first quarter, EYLEA market share remained consistent at approximately 66% of the FDA-approved anti-VEGF market. Also based on this survey, FDA approved anti-VEGF therapies account for approximately 56% of the overall anti-VEGF market. In term of treatment regimens, as George noted, the variable interval dosing regimens that are often used in the treatment of retinal diseases with the anti-VEGF agents can contribute to inadequate vision improvements and we believe are not optimal for long-term maintenance of visual acuity. We are focused on educating retinal physicians and their patients on the benefits of using dosing regimens supported by evidence-based medicine and approved by the FDA. The recent approval and launch of Dupixent or dupilumab in the United States is the beginning of a new chapter for Regeneron. Dupixent was approved for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis at the end of March. As Len mentioned, the drug is commercially available to patients. Our field force is engaged with and educating the 7,000 or so targeted dermatologists, allergists and immunologists in the United States. The targeted patient population consists of roughly 300,000 patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis who have the greatest need. These are the patients who've exhausted all approved therapies and that failed or are unable to tolerate unapproved use of immunosuppressants. Though it's quite early in the launch, we are pleased with what we have seen so far and I'd like to share with you some of the details of the ongoing launch. Firstly, we believe that the importance of good market access cannot be underestimated. To that end, we were very thoughtful about pricing Dupixent following multiple discussions with key stakeholders. Our goal for access is that utilization management criteria reflect good medical practice, which means that Dupixent should be prescribed by specialists such as dermatologists, allergists and immunologists to patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, who have not responded to maximum topical cortical steroids. We do not believe that requiring patients to take potentially toxic off-label systemic immunosuppressants is appropriate now that Dupixent is approved and available. Two of the largest pharmacy benefits managers or PBMs have provided coverage right from the beginning. Coverage at these two PBMs account for approximately 25% of lives in commercial plans in the United States. We've been actively engaged with additional payers, and based on these conversations, we believe, are well-positioned to receive broad coverage by the end of the year. We hope that these decisions will come early since eligible patients have been waiting for a long time for a new treatment for this debilitating disease. To-date, we estimate that over 1,800 physicians across all 50 states have already written a Dupixent prescription. There have been over 3,500 prescriptions for new patients written for Dupixent as of today. I would like to remind you that this number only represents the prescriptions written by physicians. It is not a reflection of the number of prescriptions that have been dispensed. Writing the prescriptions starts the coverage approval process. We estimate that the coverage decision should take several weeks, so it's too early for us to predict how many of these prescriptions will ultimately be approved for insurance coverage and dispensed. However, the early signs are encouraging, and we look forward to updating you during the second quarter. Outside of the United States, to remind everyone, in the fourth quarter 2016, we filed a Marketing Authorization Application or MAA for Dupixent and hope to have European approval by year end. Turning now to Kevzara or sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. We've been granted an FDA action date of May 22nd. We'll be co-promoting Kevzara in the United States. Our sales force is on board and is preparing for the anticipated launch. In Europe, Kevzara has received a positive opinion from the CHMP and our collaborator, Sanofi Genzyme, is gearing up for a potential launch in Europe later this year as well. Turning now to Praluent or alirocumab. As reported by Sanofi, net sales in the first quarter were $36 million worldwide with the U.S. accounting for $25 million of the total. I would like to note that there was an impact in the marketplace from the injunction ruling against us in the first quarter of 2017, which was eventually stayed pending appeal. We are pleased to announce the Praluent was recently approved in a 300-milligram once monthly dosing regimen. We continue to be disappointed by the uptake of the PCSK9 inhibitor class, but remain optimistic given the recent positive Outcomes data for this class and our own Outcomes data are expected in early 2018, which if positive could have an impact on demand. We remain committed to our efforts to improve Praluent access and bring this important product to more patients who can benefit. With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Landry.
Robert E. Landry - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. During today's call, I'll discuss our first quarter 2017 financial performance and highlight changes to a few of our full-year 2017 guidance line items. In the first quarter of 2017, we earned $2.92 per diluted share from non-GAAP net income of $337 million. This represents a year-over-year increase in non-GAAP diluted EPS and net income of 22% and 23%, respectively. I'd like to remind everyone that these growth numbers are based upon revised first quarter 2016 non-GAAP net income and EPS results relating to the company's adaption of Accounting Standard Update 2016-09 in the second quarter of 2016. This accounting standard requires companies to recognize excess tax benefits in connection with employee exercises of stock options in the income statement. You can access these revised numbers and further information in our Form 10-Q filed earlier this morning. Regeneron's first quarter 2016 and 2017 non-GAAP net income excludes non-cash share-based compensation expense and includes the income tax effect of non-GAAP reconciling items. A full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is set forth in our earnings release. Total revenues in the first quarter of 2017 were $1.3 billion, which represented year-over-year growth of 10% over the first quarter of 2016. Net product sale were $858 million in the first quarter of 2017, compared to $784 million in the first quarter of 2016. EYLEA net product sales in the United States were $854 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $781 million in the first quarter of 2016, which represents an increase of 9%. For the full year 2017, we reaffirm our U.S. EYLEA net sales guidance of year-over-year single-digit percentage growth. During the first quarter of 2017, EYLEA experienced a slight drawdown in U.S. distributor inventory levels yet remained within our normal one- to two-week targeted range. Additionally, we experienced an increase in our EYLEA gross to net percentage as a result of two factors. First, earlier this year, we started offering a discount to all offices regardless of volume for competitive reasons. And, second, there's been a small increase in the number of Medicaid patients being treated with EYLEA. Ex U.S. EYLEA net product sales, which are recorded by our collaborator Bayer, were $484 million in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to $419 million in the first quarter of 2016, representing a 16% increase on a reported basis. On an operational basis or constant currency basis, sales increased approximately 19%. In the first quarter of 2017, Regeneron recognized $175 million from our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the United States. Total Bayer collaboration revenue for the first quarter of 2017 was $194 million. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $210 million for the first quarter of 2017. The Sanofi collaboration revenue line item primarily consists of reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred R&D expenses, reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred commercialization-related expenses, and our share of profits or losses in connection with the commercialization of antibodies. In the first quarter 2017, our share of losses in connection with the commercialization of Praluent, Dupixent, and Kevzara was $108 million. This can be found in Table 4 of our earnings release. This loss represents increased spending related to the Dupixent and Kevzara launches, while we continue to proactively monitor and manage our investment in the global commercialization of Praluent. Netted within these losses were the global sales of Praluent as recognized by our partner Sanofi, which for the first quarter of 2017 were $36 million. The U.S. net sales of Praluent in the first quarter 2017 were clearly impacted from the news regarding the January 5, 2017, issuance of the permanent injunction prohibiting the commercialization of Praluent in the United States, which was subsequently stayed pending appeal. In the first quarter of 2017, other revenue increased significantly as compared to the first quarter of 2016. This increase was primarily due to reimbursements of research and development costs in connection with our collaboration agreement with Teva, which was entered into in September 2016. You can find a summary of the components of other revenue in the MD&A section of our 10-Q. Turning now to expenses, non-GAAP R&D expenses were $434 million for the first quarter of 2017. Our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as the total non-GAAP R&D expense less R&D reimbursements from our collaborators, was $189 million in the first quarter of 2017. Our press release includes all the information that is required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense. For 2017, we'd like to reiterate our previously provided guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to be in the range of $950 million to $1.025 billion. Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $243 million for the first quarter of 2017. We are tightening and lowering our full-year 2017 guidance for non-GAAP SG&A to $1.14 billion to $1.2 billion from our previous guidance range of $1.175 billion to $1.25 billion. Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses, a line item found within Sanofi collaboration revenue, was $74 million for the first quarter of 2017. We are lowering and tightening our full year 2017 guidance of Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses to be in the range of $385 million to $425 million, from $400 million to $450 million. Before shifting to taxes, I would also like to note that operating cost related to our Limerick manufacturing facility that have not been capitalized were recognized in cost of goods sold and, therefore, had a negative impact on our first quarter 2017 gross margin as compared to the third and fourth quarters of 2016. Turning now to taxes. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter 2017 was approximately 42% as compared to approximately 45% for the first quarter of 2016, which as stated earlier has been revised for the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-09. For the full year 2017, we continue to guide our effective tax rate to be in the range of 32% to 38%. This guidance includes an estimate of the full year tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation. As stated on previous calls, there will be volatility in our effective tax rate quarter to quarter since the tax benefits of stock-based compensation can only be included based on actual exercises in the quarter. We expect the majority of our stock-based compensation tax benefits to be recognized in the latter part of the year as we have a large number of stock options that vest or expire in the fourth quarter. From a cash flow and balance sheet perspective, we ended the first quarter of 2017 with cash and marketable securities of $2.3 billion. Our capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2017 were $50 million. We are tightening and lowering our full year 2017 capital expenditure guidance to be in the range of $300 million to $350 million from our previous guidance range of $375 million to $425 million. We note that this represents a significantly lower capital spend than the previous two years as we are nearing completion of a few major capital projects including our drug substance manufacturing facility in Limerick, Ireland. Also, we finalized the refinancing related to our Tarrytown headquarters in March 2017. Further details can be found on our website in the 8-K filed in association with this transaction or in our most recent 10-Q that was filed earlier this morning. With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Manisha.
Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Thank you, Bob. Sylvia, we'd now like to open the line for Q&A. In the interest of time, we'd like to request that you limit yourself to one question. We will be available in the office after the call for a follow-up Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Geoff Porges from Leerink Partners.
Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC: Thanks very much for taking the question and congratulations on all the progress. And Len, don't take this the wrong way, but congratulations on the cash flow and filing the Q account. I wanted to ask, George, just a few questions – related questions on the pipeline. Looking through the Q this morning, there's no mention of your C5 antibody nor of your CD3 biospecific. Could you jus comment on the status of those programs? And then, on the ODYSSEY Outcomes study, given the timing that you've provided to us, can you give us a sense of what you estimate the median duration of exposure will be in the study and what effect that might have on the likely effect size given the offset of the lower dosing that you may have with some patients?
George D. Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Yeah. A lot of questions in there. First, we did actually comment on the CD20 by CD3 biospecific that it's moving along, that basically we've spent a lot of time because as obviously, you've all noticed that there have been concerns with similar types of agents, as well as the CAR-T approaches in terms of really getting the right dose and avoiding very dangerous toxicity. So, we've been very careful about dose selection in that program, and we're hoping very close to be – to the point where we can initiate larger trials. In terms of our C5 antibody, I don't know how much we've said publicly about it, but I guess we've said that we will be in the clinic with it this year and I'm sorry I didn't make any references. That was just an oversight on my part. In terms of our Outcomes study, I have to say there are so many differences between our design and the four-year design that I think it's almost impossible to try to model it and figure out are the results going to be substantially different. I think that the four-year data pretty strongly show that its results are very consistent with the sort of benefits that, when obtained in terms of cardiovascular outcomes with the proportional LDL lowering, and that's pretty much exactly what we hope to show, that we're pretty much on the same sort of curve as the statins and now the first results that are coming out of the PCSK9 class.
Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Our following question comes from Chris Raymond from Raymond James.
Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey. Thanks. Question on Dupixent. So, according to some of our market checks, it looks like the breakdown among patients by age is that roughly half are adults, you've got maybe 20% adolescents, but then there's another maybe sort of 33% or 34% that are treated by docs today that are under 12. I know you guys have talked about the clinical path for kids 6 to 12 but, at least according to our data anyway, derms today have a sizable patient load under 6, and there's probably many more who haven't made their way to a derm. So, can you maybe talk about the potential to get at that market of kids under 6? Like, for example, some of our data says that maybe as much as 12% or so of patient load are actually even under 2. So, what's the setup, I guess, there for treating kids younger? Thanks.
George D. Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Yeah. You are absolutely right that a lot of these allergic diseases, it's not only atopic dermatitis, but eosinophilic esophagitis and so forth and so on, unfortunately, afflict the very young. There's a very deliberate process that we work with with regulatory authorities to progress to the youngest in our population because we all feel that we have to be very careful, and we're working very closely with the FDA to follow along those guidelines to be able to bring this treatment down the line to the youngest of patients who really need it. But as you said, there is a very important unmet need in these populations for all sorts of allergic diseases.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: One thing, just to amplify what George said, is that the FDA clearly recognizes it. They had an advisory group, and they in fact pushed us to start on younger populations even sooner than one might normally in the development program. So, I think we get it. The agency gets it. They've granted us I think breakthrough status for – I can't remember which age group, maybe – Manisha, do you remember?
Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: 12 to 17.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: 12 to 17. So, I mean, I think everybody gets it, and we've got good early data, and as George said, we're sort of doing this logically, and trying to move to where that need is. Of course, the chronocity of treatment from a commercial point of view, once you make it to adulthood and you have the disease, we should be clear that this is – we don't view this as treating an episodic disease. These people have disease chronically and will need chronic treatment, which may be different than children who can possibly outgrow this.
Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: So, should we see a trial then start maybe for kids under six at some point? I guess that's the key question.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Yes. You will see us moving towards younger age groups steadily.
Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you.
Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Next question, please?
Operator: Our following question comes from Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the launch of Dupixent. I have one question on EYLEA. It seems that you reported pretty strong numbers for EYLEA sales in the U.S. and Roche reported strong numbers for Lucentis. So does that mean the market is growing at a higher rate this year or are the branded medicines taking share from off-label Avastin? And then, maybe for George, a quick question on you PD-1 trial for non-small cell lung cancer. Given there's a debate around PD-L1 levels, I was wondering if you can comment how do you plan to design that trial in terms of stratification of PD-L1 expression levels? And do you see any differentiation from your PD-1 and the other marketed bio drugs? Thank you.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Okay. So let's take that – Ying, thanks – in two parts. First, Bob can address what he thinks the market size is overall for anti-VEGF therapy, and what the branded versus non-branded split is. And then George can deal with your question on lung cancer and PD-1.
Robert J. Terifay - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: I think it's – as we mentioned, the overall branded anti-VEGF market year-over-year grew by 9%, which is consistent with what we saw in our growth. So, you can assume that both products had approximately 9% growth. We did mention that in terms of what portion of the market is the branded market, it's approximately 65%. So...
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Which hasn't really changed...
Robert J. Terifay - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: ... hasn't changed.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: ...so the market itself seems to be growing, although our figures showed a slight inventory drawdown, and we don't know well-enough what happened with Lucentis and whether there was some destocking at the end of last quarter, and then restocking with their new formulation or not. So, to get more granularity on that, Ying, you'll have to pester Roche. George?
George D. Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Yeah. About PD-1 and PD-L1 levels and so forth, I don't think there is actually that much of a controversy. I think that all the data shows that in most cases a higher PDL expression correlates with better responses. The controversy I think that you're referring to has to do with the fact that the first line lung study from Merck with KEYTRUDA was very impressively positive whereas the very similar population studied with the BMS drug was not. And this did not really seem to be dependent on the PDL levels. People are really working hard to understand why the Bristol drug showed very disappointing results in that study. Our goal is to show that our drug is very effective in the various lung cancer indications and we're designing, we hope and we believe robust studies to demonstrate that. And we are, I believe, going to be announcing that we're going to be – when we initiate these studies in the very, very near future.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Good. Next question.
Operator: Our following question comes from Ronny Gal from Bernstein.
Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Question for Bob, could you contrast for us a little bit the cost of launching Praluent versus Kevzara and Dupixent? Essentially, when you think about the magnitude of cost to launch those two drugs, how do they differ? And second, if we think about the international operations of Praluent, roughly when should we expect them to breakeven? Essentially, what revenue do you need internationally to breakeven on that product?
Robert J. Terifay - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: I'll talk in generalities. I'm not going to get into any specifics on the financials, but what I can say is there is a major difference between Dupixent and Praluent in terms of the targeted audiences. Praluent is competing in the hypercholesterolemia market. That is a condition that's primarily treated by primary care physicians, but also was treated by a large group of cardiologists and lipidologists. So, in terms of the effort on Praluent, one has to go broad to be able to get to the large physician audience. In terms of Dupixent, as we mentioned in the United States, we're targeting about 7,000 specialists. So, the effort is more limited in terms of who you have to call on and what types of support you have to give to those patients. In terms of ex U.S., it's premature to talk about breakeven.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: And just to reiterate what Bob said, I think if you do the math, we've hit about – in the neighborhood of about 25% of the doctors we targeted have actually written a prescription, which is really pretty good at this stage of the launch. Next question?
Operator: Our following question comes from Carter Gould from UBS.
Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC: Good morning, guys. Congrats on all the progress with Dupixent. I got one for George or Len on Regeneron 2222. The PR mentioned enrollment was 1,200 but I think you've been targeting 1,500-plus patients. Does this impact your (48:41) for the primary endpoint or change how we should be thinking about the likelihood of hitting on one-time-a-season dosing? And I guess if anyone wanted to comment on the competitiveness of this program given Sanofi's distributor (48:52) program and subsequent decision to partner with MedImmune, that would be appreciated as well. Thank you.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: I'll comment on the latter, and George can comment on the former. The decisions that people make aren't always the best ones, and we love our partnership with Sanofi, but remember they are the ones that turned back EYLEA. So we'll see them in the marketplace. And we think we have a very good entry, and we love the friendly competition with really good partners. George can get more into the specifics.
George D. Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Well, as you know, the power of the study is more dependent on events rather than numbers of patients that actually enrolled. We feel, though, there's always concerns, we feel that we're adequately powered, and we're hoping that the study will meet its expectations.
Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Our following question comes from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.
Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe – George, I was intrigued by your comments on the long-term EYLEA VIEW data and the importance of adhering to the approved dosing interval. Do you think that proposition would also apply to Novartis' RTH, recognizing we don't have the Phase 3 data yet? But as you think what they're trying to accomplish with their drug, maybe help us think about the importance of longer-term data? Thank you.
George D. Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Yeah. I think it will be a very long time before one has the long-term data with a new agent to be able to say whether or not it could possibly not only cause initial visual gains but maintain them, which is, I think, more important over the four- and five-year time intervals. Right now, we have the only such study that shows that, and the only such data. I think that the field has been going in the wrong direction focusing on convenience, okay, as opposed to focusing on vision. We all know, we all cherish our vision. There's nothing more important than maintaining our vision, and we think that there's been an over-focus on convenience as opposed to on bringing back – these drugs have the ability to give back vision, and we have now shown that there's at least one drug with one regimen or an assorted regimen that has the ability to maintain this over the long term. And I think that we all have to focus on that and less on trying to save an injection or two per year, which is at most what all of these non-medicine-based approaches have been doing. I think this is really important for the field, and we hope, as Bob says, that doctors can be educated about this and stop experimenting on their patients and instead follow the FDA guidelines.
Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alethia Young from Credit Suisse.
Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the progress over the quarter. I just had one on EoE. Can you talk maybe about the potential market size and thoughts on endpoints? I know there's been some conversions in public domains around the FDA discussing endpoints. Thanks.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: So, in terms of market size, this is very difficult to ascertain. We know that the market size quote-unquote is "increasing." What we don't know whether that's because there's more patients being diagnosed or it's just tracking the general increase in allergic diseases. So we remind you that there's a strong set of evidence to indicate that eosinophilic esophagitis can be a manifestation of food allergy. And so, as an allergy, we're seeing lots of these increase. The actual numbers, we just don't feel we have a good handle on the number of patients. If Bob wants to give a shot at it, that would be great. In terms of endpoints, we saw clear results, as George mentioned, both on the patient-reported outcomes as well as the hard anatomic. In some cases in the past, for example, in ulcer disease or erosive esophagitis, FDA has used endpoints such as healing, actually, by endoscopy measured. We have not had the conversation yet with the agency about these data. They're very new to us, so we will do that and then sort of let you know what it's going to take from an approval perspective. Bob, you have...
Robert J. Terifay - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Yeah. Well, I think Len really nailed the situation with EoE. It is a disease that has generally been underdiagnosed. The current estimate in the U.S. among adults is somewhere between 100,000 and 200,000, but the true instance could be higher based upon underdiagnosis.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Okay.
Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan.
Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask on Dupi as well and kind of how you're thinking about the dynamics of a bolus of severe atopic dermatitis patients for Dupixent as we see these early trends and think about the launch going forward. 1,000 scripts written per week is obviously quite an encouraging number but, one, obviously, we can't expect to go on forever. So, how much pent-up demand do you see out there now that you're in the field? Thanks.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Yes. So, that's a very, also a very difficult question to get a hard answer on. When you talk to some doctors, they'll tell you, well, they had a list of patients that they were going to bring in. When you talk to other doctors, they'll tell you that they're not – the patients are just sort of showing up and they're incident patients which they are constantly seeing in their practice and that patients are aware of the product and want to discuss it with their doctors. How long this goes on? Well, I don't know, and we don't have enough information to see what the trends are. Have we peaked because of a bolus? Are we increasing still? Are we decreasing? Really too early to tell you. We do know that we're focusing on in the 100,000 to 200,000-patient range who are the most difficult to treat. I think with any new drug class, some of it is also going to be dependent upon the doctors' reaction. The great data that I think we have in our label encourages doctors to try the product. But it will take individual experience and successes with individual patients for them to continue to use it. And so far, we even have heard some early anecdotes on that line as well. So, bottom line is we just don't have enough information to guide you, we'd like to know ourselves. And I think anybody's guess at this point is as good as anybody else.
Robert J. Terifay - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: I think Len makes an important point. There are patients in need of this important therapy and our job beyond this initial bolus is really to educate physicians and patients on the fact that there is now something that could help these patients.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: We do want to reach out and we'll reach out appropriately to patients directly because we believe, as Bob was just suggesting, that there are patients who have dropped out of the medical system because they've been to so many different doctors with so many different regimens and nothing has helped them that making them aware that there is something new is an important part of our effort. Next question.
Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Operator. In the essence of time, we have one last question. After that, we will be in our office to take additional follow-up questions and our apologies to those who are in queue and who didn't get a chance to ask their questions.
Operator: Our next question comes from Hartaj Singh from Oppenheimer.
Hartaj Singh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Hi. Thank you. Thanks for letting me take the – I have a question. We just noticed actually slightly different take on just on your operating expenditures you've managed your P&L very well this quarter. It looks like, on just a straight run rate into the end of the year, you would actually come below your guidance and with just 110 million shares outstanding, that's not trivial. Just any thoughts on the progression of operating expenditures and how you're thinking of managing it with the Kevzara launch and all the other activities? Thank you.
Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Yeah. No. Thanks for the question. You're right in terms of the guidance that we've set for the full year and where we are for the first quarter. As you can imagine, we do obviously spend a lot of time and effort in terms of forecasting where we're going to come out on a by-quarter basis, and the quarters are not always consistent. We are going to be in kind of full bloom in the second quarter when we get hopefully our PDUFA approval with Kevzara, and we'll have our full strength out there in the marketplace. And again, we do expect higher expenditures with regards to SG&A and with unreimbursed R&D in the second half of 2017.
Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Thank you, operator. That concludes our call today.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2016 Q4  (2017-02-09 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Q4 2016 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Nicole, and I’ll be your operator for today’s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Dr. Michael Aberman. Dr. Aberman, you may begin.
Michael Aberman: Thank you, and good morning, everybody. I hope you are all staying safe if you are on the East Coast. Welcome to the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals fourth quarter and full year 2016 conference call. An archive of this webcast will be available on our website under Events and Presentations for 30 days. Joining me on the call today are: Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; Dr. George Yancopoulos, Founding Scientist, President and Chief Scientific Officer; Bob Terifay, Executive Vice President, Commercial; and Bob Landry, Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A. I would also like to remind you that remarks made on this call include forward-looking statements about Regeneron. Such statements may include, but are not limited to, those related to Regeneron and its products, product candidate and businesses, sales and expense forecasts, financial forecasts, development programs, collaborations, finances, regulatory matters, coverage and reimbursement matters, intellectual property, litigation matters and competition. Each forward-looking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected in such statements. A more complete description of these and other material risks can be found in Regeneron’s filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission or SEC including its Form 10-Q for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was filed with the SEC later today. Regeneron does not undertake any obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. In addition, please note that GAAP and non-GAAP measures will be discussed on today’s call. Information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP are available in our financial results press release, which can be accessed on our website at www.regeneron.com. Once our call concludes, Bob Landry and the IR team will be available to answer further questions. With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.
Leonard Schleifer: Thank you, Michael. Very good morning to everyone, and I echo Michael’s sentiment here on the East Coast. I hope you are all safe from the storm. 2016 was an important and eventful year for Regeneron and one where we achieved significant progress on the commercial, research and development fronts. We currently have eight late stage Phase III programs and a total of 16 product candidates in clinical development. Our science driven approach has remained unchanged. As we look at 2017, we remain confident that we are well-positioned to reap the benefits of our long-standing scientific endeavors. We expect to new major drug approvals in the United States this year. First, we are anticipating regulatory action in the United States at the end of March for dupilumab, or Dupixent, our breakthrough IL-4, IL-13 blocker for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. We believe that, if approved, Dupixent will change the way doctors are able to treat their moderate to severe atopic dermatitis patients. Secondly, we expect regulatory action by the FDA for sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. We are happy to report that just last week sarilumab, now also known by its brand name Kevzara, was approved by Health Canada. Strong preclinical data as well as our positive findings from our studies in atopic dermatitis, asthma and nasal polyps indicate that IL-4 and IL-13 signaling is a key pathway driving many allergic conditions and diseases. You will hear further details from George about our dupilumab development program. We are keenly focused on ensuring that the anticipated Dupixent launch in the atopic dermatitis indication is a success by all metrics. I personally in addition to the teams at Regeneron and Sanofi have engaged in fruitful discussions with payers, and we remain optimistic that Dupixent, the breakthrough product, will receive good formulary coverage when approved for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. We will also be working rapidly to advance dupilumab in asthma. And if the readout from the ongoing Phase III study is positive, we anticipate making a U.S. regulatory submission in the fourth quarter of this year. Combined with our other ongoing and planned studies of dupilumab in allergic diseases, we believe that this product candidate has the potential to gain approval in multiple allergic disorders. EYLEA remains an important product for the company, and we continue to defend and extend the franchise by focusing on new indications like nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy and combination studies with Ang2. Bob Terifay will discuss this further on the call. For the full year 2017, we expect U.S. EYLEA net sales year-over-year percentage growth to be in the single digits. As we further diversify our product related revenues stream, we do not plan to provide EYLEA product sales guidance after 2017. Turning to Praluent. This has been a terrific week for patients with high LDL cholesterol. First, the LDL hypothesis was validated for PCSK9 inhibitors with positive outcomes data reported by a competitor. We look forward to completing our own outcome study towards the end of this year. Second, just yesterday evening, we were granted our request for a stay of the injunction pending the appeal. Praluent will continue to be available to patients in the United States, meaning that patients and doctors will continue to be able to choose the best PCSK9 inhibitor for their needs, including the use of a low 75 milligram option which only Praluent provides. We remain committed to ensuring that patients who can benefit from Praluent will continue to have access to this innovative therapy. As for the ongoing litigation, we strongly believe that the controlling law and facts support our position that Amgen's asserted patent claims are invalid and we look forward to pursuing our appeal over the coming months. Finally, before I turn this over to George, I want to note that we have started to recognize students in our first-year as sponsors of the 75-year-old Science Talent Search, the most prestigious high-school talent competition. As many of you know, this program was previously sponsored by Intel and before that by Westinghouse. Over the last few weeks, we were excited to recognize our first group of 300 Regeneron Science Talent Search Scholars and 40 finalists. We believe programs like this are essential to ensuring a strong science talent pipeline for generations to come. With that, I’d like to turn the call over to George.
George Yancopoulos: Thank you, Len, and a very good morning to everyone who was joined us today. I’d like to begin with Dupixent, our IL-4, IL-13 blocker. I share Len’s excitement about this molecule and its potential use, not only in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, but also in various other allergic conditions. As Len mentioned, Dupixent is on track towards the end of March for an expected regulatory approval in the United States for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adults. You will hear more about our ongoing launch preparations from Bob Terifay. In the fourth order of 2016, the marketing authorization application for Dupixent in this indication was accepted for review by the European Medicines Agency or the EMA. Dupixent has received breakthrough designation in both the adult and pediatric atopic dermatitis application. In the latter, we expect to initiate a Phase III study in adolescent patients between ages of 12 and 17 in the first quarter and in the second quarter another Phase III study in younger patients between the ages of six and 11. Scientific evidence indicates that the IL-4/13 pathway is essential not just in atopic dermatitis but also in a wide spectrum of allergic diseases. With that hypothesis we're exploring the use of dupilumab in multiple allergic conditions. Let me begin with asthma, positive data from our previously reported first pivotal study of dupilumab in persistent uncontrolled asthma, which has also been published in the New England Journal of Medicine, demonstrated that in all patients, regardless of their allergic classification, treatment with dupilumab resulted in improvement in both lung function as measured in FEV1 and exacerbations. In the overall population patients treated with the 300 milligram every other week dose had a 15% improvement over placebo in the FEV1 measure and a 75 % reduction in exacerbations. The most common adverse event associated with treatment in this study was injection site reaction. In our opinion efficacy in all comers rather than only in those with allergic classifications could be an important differentiating feature of the product profile, particularly in a competitive indications such as asthma. As a reminder, the approved biologics in asthma are indicated only for patients with allergic classification. Our large second pivotal study LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST, a Phase 3 study in adults and adolescent patients with uncontrolled persistent asthma is fully enrolled. We expect to report topline data later this year with a regulatory submission to follow in the fourth quarter. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2017, we expect to initiate a Phase 3 study of uncontrolled persistent asthma in pediatric patients between the ages of 6 and 11. Following quickly behind the atopic dermatitis and asthma indications are additional indications for dupilumab. These include nasal polyps where we're currently enrolling patients in two separate Phase 3 studies. The next indication is eosinophilic esophagitis where we expect to report in the first half of 2017 topline data from our Phase 2 study. We continue to explore the role of dupilumab in new indications and plan to initiative a Phase 2 study of dupilumab in food allergies in the second half of 2017. We are pleased with the advances in our late stage pipeline. Just last week's sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody now known as Kevzara, was approved by Health Canada for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Kevzara is fill-and-finish at Sanofi's facility in Le Trait, France. As we’ve mentioned before, this facility is being inspected this quarter and subject to a successful completion of the inspection we plan to resubmit the BLA for sarilumab to the FDA in the first quarter with an expected two-month review cycle. Our Phase 3 NGF antibody program with fasinumab is also advancing and we along with our collaborator, Teva, look forward to initiating additional Phase III studies in both osteoarthritis pain as well as the chronic lower back indication. REGN2222, our program for respiratory syncytial virus is also moving ahead. We expect the ongoing study to be completed by the end of the year. Moving now to EYLEA. We are conducting two Phase III studies in EYLEA in combination with nesvacumab, our antibody to Ang2. Both these studies, one each in wet AMD and in DME, are fully enrolled. The efficacy and safety data from both these studies will be analyzed at 36 weeks. While there is greater preclinical support for Ang2 compared to our PDGF program, which we are no longer pursuing as we’ve mentioned before, EYLEA sets a very high bar for efficacy in these disease indications. We look forward to seeing the data from our Phase II studies with Ang2 in the second half of this year. PANORAMA, our Phase III study of EYLEA in patients with nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy without diabetic macro edema, continues to enroll patients. Turning now to Praluent, our PCSK9 antibody for lowering LDL cholesterol. The ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial, our 18,000-patient cardiovascular outcome study of Praluent, is ongoing. This is an event-driven study, and we expect it to be completed by the end of 2017. We expect that positive outcomes data will increase the uptake of PCSK9 antibodies in appropriate patients. We are pleased with the progress that we’re making with our immuno-oncology portfolio. REGN2810, our PD-1 antibody, continues to advance, and we are currently enrolling patients in a potentially pivotal study in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. In addition, we also plan to initiate in the first of the year a clinical study in basal cell carcinoma. Beyond terminal cancers, we plan to initiate in the first half of the year a clinical study for our PD-1 antibody in non-small cell lung cancer. Our second checkpoint inhibitor, REGN3767, an antibody to LAG3, has also entered the clinic. We will be studying it both as monotherapy as well as in combination with our PD-1 antibody. Let me also update you on progress of our bispecific platform. Our lead program, CD20 by CD3 antibody, is currently in the clinic both as monotherapy and also in combination with our PD-1 antibody. We believe we now have a dosing schedule for the CD20 by CD3 bispecific antibody and look forward to expanding the number of patients treated with that dosing regimen. Lastly, I am happy to report that REGN2477, our Activin A antibody for the treatment of the rare disease fibrodysplasia ossificans progressive, or FOP, is completing a Phase I study in healthy volunteers. And there we expect to begin a Phase II trial in FOP patients later this year. We also recently initiated a combination Phase I trial in healthy volunteers of Regeneron 2477 with TREVOGRUMAB, our antibody of GDF8 for skeletal muscle diseases. Before I turn over to Bob Terifay, want to add my congratulations to the 300 Regeneron scholars and 40 Regeneron finalists in the Science Talent Search, but also add congratulations to every high school student who did a science project and applied. These are scientific leaders of the future, who we hope are going to change and save our world. With that, let me turn the call over to Bob Terifay.
Robert Terifay: Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. Fourth quarter U.S. EYLEA or aflibercept net sales grew 15% year-over-year. Net U.S. EYLEA sales in the fourth quarter were $858 million and full-year 2016 sales were $3.32 billion. Net ex-U.S. EYLEA sales in the fourth quarter were $496 million, which represents 20% growth year-over-year unadjusted for currency fluctuations. Net ex-U.S. EYLEA full-year 2016 sales were $1.87 billion. In 2016, global net sales of EYLEA exceeded $5 billion. EYLEA is the market leading product among FDA-approved anti-VEGF agents for all of its approved indications in the United States. EYLEA will continue to be a major revenue driver for Regeneron over the years to come. Our quarter-over-quarter EYLEA sales growth has slowed, reflecting normal market dynamics for a more mature product that has been on the market for over five years with no price increase since launch. We continue to focus our promotional efforts and the clinical efficacy and safety of EYLEA and our development efforts on potential new indications and new combinations. The next potential driver for EYLEA growth could be an indication for non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy which is currently in Phase III development. Our fixed combination program for EYLEA and nesvacumab, our angiopoietin 2 inhibitor is currently in Phase II clinical development. Turning now to Praluent, or alirocumab, as reported by Sanofi, net sales in the fourth quarter were $41 million worldwide, with the U.S. accounting for $33 million of the total. Full year net sales were $116 million with the U.S. accounting for $94 million. We are pleased that the Federal Court has suspended the injunction on Praluent sales, marketing and manufacturing. Therefore, we will continue our efforts to grow Praluent sales and alleviate reimbursement roadblocks. Remember, Praluent is the only PCSK9 inhibitor that offers a low-dose option. Most of our sales are for the low dose 75 milligram dosage form. Outside of the United States, Praluent has proved in 45 countries. Reimbursement decisions by individual country, region and institutional pricing and reimbursement authorities are gradually evolving. We are currently preparing for the potential approval and launch of Dupixent or dupilumab with an FDA PDUFA date of March 29, 2017. Sanofi Genzyme and Regeneron have fully hired and trained our field teams. At launch, our field teams will call on 4,500 dermatologists and 1,200 allergist, who currently comprise biologic therapies. These are the physicians who will most likely be comfortable with prescribing a biologic for atopic dermatitis. We estimate that approximately 300,000 atopic dermatitis patients have exhausted all approved therapies and have failed or are unable to tolerate unapproved use of immunosuppressant therapies. We have been working with payers to ensure that these patients have access to treatment. As Len mentioned, our discussions with payers are proceeding well and we're optimistic that we can work productively to ensure that patients get appropriate and rapid access to this breakthrough product after approval. In anticipation of early demand, we have established a reimbursement access services and patient support center, which will be ready to help patients from day one of launch. Our pre-commercialization efforts have been focused on educating physicians, patients and payers on the unmet medical need in moderate-to-severe uncontrolled atopic dermatitis. It’s devastating impact on patients’ lives and the role of chronic underlying systemic inflammation as etiology. This unbranded education has been provided at major medical meetings through digital media and through print media. Our launch materials and programs are preliminarily prepared pending approval and receipt of our final label. We filed a regulatory application for Dupixent in the EU in the fourth quarter of 2016. Pending a favorable inspection in the first quarter of 2017 of Sanafi’s fill-and-finish facility in Le Trait, France, we intend to quickly re-file our Kevzara or sarilumab BLA with the FDA with the potential approval in the second quarter of 2017. Sanofi Genzyme and Regeneron have hired and trained our filed teams who will call on over 6000 rheumatologists responsible for the vast majority of biologics prescriptions for rheumatoid arthritis. As with Dupixent, we have also been working with payers to ensure that patients have access to Kevzara and we have established a reimbursement access services and patient support center pending regulatory approval. Our pre-commercialization efforts have been focused on demonstrating the central role of interleukin-6 in rheumatoid arthritis to rheumatologists. Our preparation for a potential launch is in place pending approval and final labeling. Kevzara achieved its first approval in Canada earlier in 2017. The European marketing authorization application, or MAA, for Kevzara is currently under review by the EMA with a potential decision on the application expected in mid-2017. With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Landry.
Robert Landry: Thanks, Bob, and good morning to everyone. Overall, we delivered solid fourth quarter financial results. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we earned $3.04 per diluted share from non-GAAP net income of $343 million. For the full year 2016, we earned $11.32 per diluted share from non-GAAP net income of $1.32 billion. This represents a year-over-year increase in non-GAAP diluted EPS and net income of 36% and 37%, respectively, for the fourth quarter and a year-over-year increase in non-GAAP diluted EPS and net income of 39% and 40%, respectively, for the full-year 2016. Regeneron’s fourth quarter and full year 2016 non-GAAP net income primarily excludes non-cash share-based compensation expense and includes the income tax effect of non-GAAP reconciling items. A full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is set forth in our earnings release. All of the financial guidance mentioned on this call today and in our fourth quarter 2016 earnings release issued earlier this morning assumes that Praluent will remain on the market throughout 2017. Total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2016 were $1.23 billion and $4.86 billion for the full year 2016, which represented year-over-year growth of 12% for the three months and 18% for the full year. Net product sales were $863 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $3.34 billion for the full year 2016 compared to $750 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and $2.69 billion for the full year of 2015. EYLEA net product sales in the United States were $858 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $3.32 billion for the full year of 2016 compared to $746 million in the fourth order of 2015 and $2.68 billion for the full year of 2015, which represented an increase of 15% and 24%, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2016, EYLEA experienced a small increase in U.S. distributor inventory levels as compared to the third quarter 2016, yet remained within our normal one- to two-week targeted range. Additionally, we experienced a slight increase in our EYLEA gross to net percentage as a result of an increase in the proportion of Medicaid patients treated with EYLEA. Ex-U.S. EYLEA sales were 496 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to $413 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, representing a 20% increase on a reported basis. Ex-U.S. EYLEA sales for the full-year 2016 were $1.87 billion compared to $1.41 billion for 2015 representing a 33% increase on a reported basis. Sales growth on an operational or constant currency basis were consistent with our reported sales growth. In the fourth quarter of 2016, Regeneron recognized $165 million from our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the United States and $649 million for the full year of 2016. Total Bayer collaboration revenue for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $181 million and $744 million for the full year of 2016. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $131 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 and $659 million for the full-year of 2016. The Sanofi collaboration revenue line item primarily consists of reimbursement of Regeneron incurred R&D expenses, reimbursement of Regeneron incurred commercialization related expenses and our share of profits or losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies. In the fourth quarter of 2016, our share of losses in connection with the commercialization of Praluent and pre-commercial activities and cost in connection with Kevzara and Dupixent was under $126 million and was a loss of $459 million for the full-year 2016. This can be found in table four of our earnings release. Netted within these losses were the global sales of Praluent for the fourth quarter of 2016, as recognized by our partner Sanofi of $41 million and $116 million for the full-year 2016. Turning now to expenses, non-GAAP R&D expenses were $404 million for the fourth quarter 2016 and $1.64 billion for the full-year. Our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense which is calculated as the total non-GAAP R&D expenses less R&D reimbursements from our collaborators was $240 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and $882 million for the full-year of 2016. Our press release includes all the information that is required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expenses. I’d like to note that our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&S expenses came in below our 2016 guidance due to less spending than forecasted in our sarilumab and dupilumab programs and lower operating expenses than forecasted in our Rensselaer manufacturing facility. For 2017, we’d like to reiterate our previously provided guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to be in the range of $950 million to $1.025 billion. Next, non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $252 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 and $947 million for the full-year of 2016. Non-GAAP SG&A came in below 2016 guidance largely due to lower than expected fourth quarter spending on Praluent as well as the delayed Kevzara launch. We continue to expect non-GAAP SG&A expense in 2017 to be in the range of $1.175 billion and $1.250 billion. The increase in our forecasted 2017 non-GAAP SG&A expense is primarily driven by the anticipated launches of Kevzara and Dupixent as well as an increase in commercialization related expenses for EYLEA. Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization related expenses, a line item found within Sanofi collaboration revenue, was $97 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 and $322 million for the full year of 2016. We expect Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization related expenses in 2017 to be in the range of $400 million and $450 million. Turning now to taxes, our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and full-year 2016 was approximately 26% and 33% respectively as compared to approximately 32% and 48% for the fourth quarter and full-year 2015. As a reminder, due to the adoption of accounting standards update 2016-09 the utilization of excess tax benefits in connection with employee exercises as stock options is now reflected in our effective tax rate. These deductions as well as a change in geographic mix of earnings, were the primarily drivers of the reduction in our effective tax rate in 2016 as compared to 2015. For the full-year of 2017, we are guiding our effective tax rate to be in the range of 32% to 38%. From a cash flow and balance sheet perspective, we ended the fourth quarter of 2016 with cash and marketable securities of $1.9 billion. Our capital expenditures for the full-year of 2016 were $512 million. As we enter 2017 we expect our capital expenditure levels to be lower than the previous two years as is reflected in our 2017 guidance of between $375 million and $450 million. The principal driver of these forecasted lower capital expenditures is decrease spending on the renovation of our Limerick manufacturing facility. Other 2017 capital expenditures include the expansion of our laboratory space within our Tarrytown New York facilities and expanding and renovating a portion of our manufacturing facilities at our Rensselaer, New York facility. As highlighted in our third-quarter 2016 conference call, we did take the opportunity in the fourth quarter of 2016 to repurchase for $401 million all of our remaining outstanding warrants that we issued in 2011 in connection with our convertible debt. Additionally, our remaining outstanding convertible senior notes were settled on October 1, 2016. In total, our full year 2016 cash flow statement reflects the use of funds of $656 million in connection with the reduction of outstanding warrants and repayment of the convertible senior notes, which will not recur in 2017. Additionally, in December of 2016, we entered into a purchase agreement with affiliates of BioMed Realty to purchase the properties located at our headquarters in Tarrytown, New York, for $720 million. We intend to finance this acquisition with new lease financing where we plan to assign some or all of our rights under the purchase agreement, including the right to take titles to the facility to an affiliate of Bank of America who will become the legal owner and lessor of the facility. Directly thereafter, we expect to lease the facility from the lessor for five years with rental payments that are expected to be lower than those under our existing headquarters’ lease and immediately accretive to Regeneron upon signing the lease At the end of those five years, Regeneron will have a few options, including extending the lease terms, purchasing the facility at a predetermined amount or selling the facility to a third party on behalf of the lessor. This transaction is estimated to provide an average after-tax annual cash savings of $21 million during our five-year lease term, and we expect to close this transaction in the first quarter of 2017. The contemplated lease financing will not constitute indebtedness for the purposes of our unsecured revolving credit facility and, therefore, does not adversely impact our ability to borrow under the credit facility. With that, I’d like to turn the call back to Michael.
Michael Aberman: Thanks, Bob. Operator, we can now open the call for Q&A. But I’d like to remind everybody to please limit yourselves to a single question to allow time for others to ask their questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We are standing by for questions. And our first question comes from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open, Terence.
Terence Flynn: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just on the Ang2 Phase II trials, if you can remind us there if those are blinded or open label and then what’s the rationale to wait for the 36-week data instead of reporting the 12-week primary endpoint data? Thanks.
Leonard Schleifer: Well, it’s a blinded trial. It’s a single injection either with EYLEA alone or in various combination arms, and we believe that the 36-week data is going to provide us the best opportunity to really evaluate the value of adding angiopoietin-2 to EYLEA. And that’s how we’ve designed the study.
George Yancopoulos: I should add that primary endpoint is 36 weeks…
Terence Flynn: All right.
Michael Aberman: Next question.
Operator: And our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges from Leerink Partners. Your line is open.
Geoff Porges: Thank you very much. So, Len, you mentioned the weather in New York and I wanted to make sure that there wasn't any snow going on in this conference call, so I have to ask you about the guidance for EYLEA. So, you're really guiding to a significant slowdown in 2017, even compared to your growth trajectory in Q4, could you talk a little bit about the puts and takes in that guidance, particularly whether you're assuming any changes in reimbursement for Medicare Part B? And secondly, what is it that you're seeing in terms of the penetration, particularly in the DME that suggests that the product’s reaching maturity now? Thanks.
Leonard Schleifer: Thanks, Geoff. No slow at all. Let me just address the question -- your question and generally about our guidance here. First of all, I remind you that this will be the last year that we do individual product guidance. I'm not a big fan of being in the forecasting business, we’re in the drug discovery, development and optimization business and forecasting is always somewhat tenuous. A lot of people have been concerned about how we get to the guidance and why is the range single digits which can be rather broad. You have to remember, we are a science-driven company and when you look at all of the errors in the estimates of things that can go into it such as market share, anything that could happen in government policy, negotiations, our ability to hold off any growth of Avastin, any market forces that require increase gross to net. When you put all of these puts and takes, if you will, it does become somewhat of a blizzard which obscures the landscape and it's very difficult to feel comfortable that we can make -- give you precision that you would like when there are too many estimates in there that when -- that you could -- when you put them all together, the precision is just not there. So it is the fifth year of this products. We've grown rather substantial and we do think there’s growth also to still be had with new indications, and also, obviously, growth outside United States with Bayer. But as the year goes on we'll see how this all plays out.
Michael Aberman: Next question.
Operator: And our next question comes from Ronny Gal from Bernstein. Your line is open.
Ronny Gal: Good morning. I’m going to ask one alternate in case you cannot answer the first one. So, the first one is, in case you have the opinion from the court about the preliminary injunction, can you just give us a bit of color about this particularly what was the appellate court's opinion about the likelihood of success on the merits. Now if you haven’t got the opinion yet, I would ask you about the Praluent trajectory and market share for 2017. Obviously, some of your clients will be a bit worried about the potential final outcome, should we expect you guys to begin to lose a little bit of share against Repatha in that market?
Leonard Schleifer: Let me deal with the opinion, the legal opinion, I think that’s what you are asking related to the injunction. By the way it was not a preliminary injunction, it was a permanent injunction, which is what you get at the end after a jury trial. A preliminary injunction is something you might get before a jury trial which was not sought in this case. We read the opinion which is available online I think you can probably find it linked to our press release, and what the court said is that as is typical in all cases when they are determining whether to upset, if you will or put a hold on an injunction that a lower court issued, that they consider four factors, and these factors, the first factor relates to the question of whether you've made a strong showing of a likeliness to win on the underlying appeal; and the second factor has to do with whether or not you will suffer irreparable harm if you don’t get this stay during the appeal. And third factor has to do with how this affects the other party and the fourth factor has to do with how it affects the public. From the way that we look at the actual opinion, the court said that the first two of the factors are the most critical and that is whether Regeneron and Sanofi have made a strong showing of a likelihood of success in the merits and whether or not we would be irreparably harmed. And they said, based on the submissions and the papers that they felt that we met that standard and we were entitled to an injunction to be stayed. So, I think that’s all we know at this point. Now, we are moving forward on a somewhat accelerated basis. The briefing -- our opening brief on the underlying appeal that the judges were talking about when they said whether we made a strong showing of our winning on the success, that’s what they are talking about. We're going to now go, try and win on the success on the merits. I hope that answers your question.
Michael Aberman: Next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore. Your line is open.
Mark Schoenebaum: Hey, guys. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Thanks to Michael, Manisha and Len for all your help while I was out helping out the team. I really appreciate it. And, Len, it’s great to hear your voice. I thought I’d ask a big-picture question. hopefully, I can get Len fired up here. President Trump was quoted -- it was his press secretary, I think, a couple days ago, when he mentioned that he was clearly in favor of the government directly negotiating drug prices with drug manufacturers. I’d love to hear your thoughts on this. Do you believe it? What does it mean for the sector if it were implemented? What do you think -- what kind of impact would it have on drug prices if indeed it were implemented? And, more broadly, what do you actually think is going to happen with all of this drug pricing stuff? Thanks a lot, Len.
Leonard Schleifer: You’re welcome, Mark. Nice to hear your voice as well. Look, I don’t have a particularly unique pipeline into what the president is thinking here. We take him at his word for what he said that he thinks that the U.S. is paying too much and is not negotiating. I think, as he gets deeper into the policies, I think, he is going to find that in fact that we do negotiate prices for Medicare drugs. We just do it with individual Medicare carriers rather than one negotiator. I think that my own perspective on this is that what’s going to happen here is a little bit more of a nuanced dialogue that says that the public is going to recognize and I think the president recognizes that this is a very, very hard business. Innovating and discovering new drugs that can really change people’s lives either how long they live or what the quality of their life is -- is something that’s extremely hard to do. On the other hand, it doesn’t do us any good to do all that if we can’t get these drugs to people who can actually afford them. Where I actually think that, there will be some consensus in Congress, which is this is going to take Congressional action, I believe, I think, there will be some consensus in trying to deal with how much of the payments individuals are making for drugs. The co-pays or coinsurances are really what I think most problematic for the people. And that I think that people are beginning to recognize that the skin in the game that the government wanted for a lot of this has gone a little too far making it hard for people, literally to get the drugs. And I think some relief there will be forthcoming. But at the end of the day, the attention probably will be and it's just my guess is, on somehow setting standards that breakthrough drugs ought to be rewarded and price increases that are not -- that are unrelated are uncoupled from innovation, will be pushed back on. Anyway, at the end of the day, we're going to have to figure out how to protect incentives through innovation. And in -- not matter what we think coming back now to Regeneron, I think Regeneron is extremely well-positioned because I think the winners and losers in our space will be those that are really viewed as the true innovators. If you can come up with a product like Dupixent hopefully which will be approved towards the end of this quarter where you can change people's lives, that is always going to get value for you. So maybe I'll just stop there and take the next question.
Michael Aberman: Next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Ying Huang: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I have a question on EYLEA, should we assume that your market share in 2017 in AMD and DME will be relatively stable. That’s how you come to the single digit guidance and then related to that, Novartis has a Phase III for RTH258 that’s comparing a Q3 month regimen to the Q2 month for EYLEA. I was wondering if you guys have any thought about that? Thank you.
Leonard Schleifer: Yeah. I'm not going to get into the granular basis of how we came up with our assumptions, Ying, because as I said, you start to add them up and you wind up with lots of errors. So, it isn’t like one thing drove it versus another. So, we'll keep you posted on a retrospective basis, how our market share is doing, but predicting that it's just -- it's very difficult. George can address the Novartis trial.
George Yancopoulos: Right. And we want to remind you that their study is really just intended to show that some percentage of their patients can get by with every three months dosing. And we've already shown data that shows that a substantial number of our patients can also get by with three months dosing. I think that neither they nor I are advocating three months dosing for every patient. It's just that they're trying to produce data akin to ours which actually shows that a substantial number of patients can indeed get by with every three-month dosing.
Leonard Schleifer: Yes, and I will just say that, look, this is a hard business and when you load of the eye with a lot of drugs, which is what they're doing, they are going to have to show that they don’t get inflammation, they are going to have to show that you don’t get hypertension systemically which was seen in some of the earlier trials and you just don't know, so we will have to wait and see and we will look at their data, but as George said, I'm not sure that the way that they have set up the trials will accomplish anything more than we’ve already have data for, so we will see.
George Yancopoulos: And I think one brings up an important point, I mean, they're trying to do it by putting in many, many more molecules of their agent as compared to EYLEA, and to get a rather similar efficacy bar and with that, as Len pointed out, comes additional risks that they are going to have to show that they are not actually causing.
Michael Aberman: Okay. Next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Raymond from Raymond James. Your line is open, Chris.
Chris Raymond: Hey, thanks for taking the questions. So still a question for the sarilumab, so assuming you guys get a timely US approval here, some of the survey work has shown real traction for a Kevzara especially in its subque format with -- it looks like real impact on embryo and HUMIRA, so at least my view sarilumab has pretty significant differentiation versus ACTEMRA, and you have got this positive head-to-head trial versus HUMIRA, it’s more convenient administration etcetera. So, Len, as you even mentioned on this call, you've been a pretty outspoken critic of pharma pricing and the TNF market has been one of more glaring examples of aggressive pricing practices and I know, Len, you don’t want to talk about specific pricing strategies but you guys really struck I think a great note with the pricing decision on EYLEA, would you say that the inflammatory biologics market allows a similar setup here for you to really make a statement or is that market different from the one that EYLEA launched into?
Leonard Schleifer: Chris in a word, yes, we think that the constant price increases and the magnitude of them are a reflection of several things, one somewhat tone deafness on the people taking these huge increases and somewhat of complexities of the system about how all of these rebates work, and I think some of this is being unwound. So, we do have sort of a three-part strategy if we get Kepzara to market, which we expect we will. One is to provide it as a reasonable alternative to anti-TNF therapy either in first-line or after failures. The second is to try and position it if we can as the preferred IL-6 agent based on the profile of the product. We’ll have to see how doctors respond to that. And by the way, there is this growing market for monotherapy, which I think as you mentioned we do have attractive data in. So, monotherapy -- that is without methotrexate, which is not the most well-liked drug, to be frank -- is a growing part of the market. And the third part of our strategy is the one that you just referred to, which is that there is an opportunity to come up with more responsible pricing. That’s all that I should say at this point.
Michael Aberman: Next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas from Citigroup. Your line is open.
Robyn Karnauskas: Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my question. So, I just want to ask another pricing question. Can you talk a little bit about if you’ve seen any pricing pushback in the U.S. and Europe? And you did mention on pricing for -- I can never pronounce it. You talked about formulary -- they will be positioned positively. Maybe talk about how you think about the lessons from pricing PCSK9 and where you might be getting your confidence in the positioning on the formulary for [indiscernible].
Leonard Schleifer: Yeah. So, a good question, Robyn, and thanks. The PCSK9 story will be a case study, and there are lots of views on this. And the complexities in the context that they were launched following the Hep C struggles that the payers and manufactures had makes that somewhat of a unique story combined with the fact that you had a market of pennies a day fabulous statins which really could serve a lot of the market obviously. In our drug, Dupixent, this is a whole different story. First of all, we have outcomes data now. The outcomes data are the endpoints. People’s skin and their itch is really a big deal are getting dramatically better. And I think that -- so when you’re starting with that, that’s very important. You're also going into a field which the FDA has said it's a breakthrough, we think it's a breakthrough, I think my discussions with the payers, their people think it's a breakthrough. And most importantly, the patients and their doctors believe this is a breakthrough. So, that’s a whole different kettle of fish than when you're dealing with a drug, for example, a cholesterol-lowering drug where people are not even sure they want to have their cholesterol lowered, or if it was any good to have their cholesterol lowered. We believe it was, of course, but there was this pushback. Here with this drug, people want this drug, people need this drug, I think that the data are remarkable consistent across all of our trials, it really is a breakthrough. So, we have had very productive conversations meeting with payers who I think have been receptive to trying to not make is always so adversarial. And look, we have a role, they have a role and we can spend a lot of time pointing fingers at each other, like a lot of people do, and farmers running around saying, well, the middleman has taking too much of it and the middleman is saying that the prices are too high and their patients are wondering what is hell is really going on, or we can try and work together and come up with a breakthrough product that has responsible pricing and good solid formulary access without significant barriers to the right patients getting the drug. I am an optimist and I base that optimism not just based on my genetic makeup, but on the fact that I've actually had conversations with the most senior leaders of the most important payers and I have felt that we've gotten a very good reception to our approach. So, I'm really looking forward to telling you the details when we launch and to getting this product to patients.
Michael Aberman: Next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from Adnan Butt from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Leonard Schleifer: Thanks, Adnan.
Adnan Butt: Hi. Thanks. Maybe for George, based on -- for nesvacumab, based on either Phase I or biology, you mentioned the bar is high versus EYLEA, but is the bar different than the bar you would have expected for PDGF?
George Yancopoulos: Well, I think that the preclinical data was just very weak for the PDGF class. We had been working on that for 20 years and largely went into that program as a defense as try to -- just in case somehow the anomalous early clinical data were proven to be true. Ang2, the data -- the preclinical data is much stronger, but as you said, EYLEA poses such a high bar for efficacy that it’s a challenge for anything to improve it, especially EYLEA does such a good job on things like retinal edema, which is one of the major causes of reversible vision loss. So, we're anxious to see, testing the hypothesis in patients, we think it’s worth going forward and testing it. We hope for patients’ sake that it is going to make an improvement, but like anything else, I mean it’s a high bar and it’s going to be hard to actually beat it.
Michael Aberman: Great. Next question?
Operator: Your next question comes from Yatin Suneja from SunTrust. Your line is open.
Yatin Suneja: Good morning, guys, Thank you for taking my question. Question is on Praluent, could you guys comment maybe on how the ODYSSEY OUTCOME trial might differentiate Praluent versus Repatha? And then, George, you mentioned, you expect increased uptick after positive data in appropriate patient, could you maybe expand on that, how do you view or how do you define that appropriate patient population? Thank you.
Leonard Schleifer: Right. So, it’s a little bit early to answer the question on how we are going to differentiate. We know that the trials are slightly designed differently in different patient populations but we haven’t seen any data yet whatsoever, all we have heard is topline data so we have to wait until we actually get our data and analyze carefully the data that’s been presented. George, you can comment.
George Yancopoulos: And just to remind you, your patient population was a higher risk population post-acute coronary syndrome type population. So, you might expect that these patients might have both a higher risk which is one reason why our study had less numbers of overall patients than the Repatha study, but also that you might have a different degree of benefit in these patients and that it might be represented in different components that comprised of various events of interest.
Leonard Schleifer: In terms of appropriate questions -- appropriate patients, I think that was actually Bob Terifay, who had mentioned that, I think what he is saying is that, we want people to be have the maximally tolerated statins before they go on to choose Praluent to further lower their LDL, assuming that they have the appropriate cardiovascular -- atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. In terms of getting more patients through the system, I think this will be driven both by doctors. There are obviously some doctors who have been waiting for outcomes and, therefore, and only using, let’s say, in their most severe patients with severe hypercholesterolemia. But now I think that that may change. So, you might get more drive and more prescriptions coming through. I also believe that with OUTCOMES data the payers are not insensitive to the change in the science, and they will evaluate this and think about the various barriers that are in place. And I believe they may lessen some of those barriers to make it somewhat easier to get these prescriptions to go through.
George Yancopoulos: And there is one important thing though. Whenever we talk about differentiation from Repatha we need to keep in mind that we are differentiated. This is the only molecule that has a low dose option. There are a large number of patients receiving that low dose option and a large number of physicians who prefer to start with that dose. That is how we conducted the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study.
Yatin Suneja: Yes. Thank you.
Michael Aberman: Okay, Michael. Next question?
Operator: And our next question comes from Alethia Young from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Alethia Young: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. It seems like the FDA has been kind of tough around manufacturing and stuff. So, I know you’ve sort of addressed some things with the [indiscernible]. But maybe can you talk about how the breakthrough designation has helped with the Dupixent, and like kind of what are the remaining steps and how confident you feel about being on time for this approval?
Leonard Schleifer: Yeah. I think the FDA has been and should be tough about manufacturing. We rely on our system -- both self-regulated, responsible manufacturers regulating their production and quality; as well as third-party regulators, the FDA -- to ensure the quality of our drugs. We have no problem with that at all. And I think that sanofi doesn’t either, and they’ve worked hard now to improve and get that plant in an acceptable format. We still have to go through the routine pre-approval inspections -- routine in the sense it’s not a routine inspection; it’s routine in the sense that you have to have it before a drug is approved. But we’ve been through those before as they have, and we’re optimistic and we have worked very hard to get ready for that and expect that we should be able to get through that. If we do, we would expect an approval by the end of the year -- the end of the quarter. Sorry. And in terms of the breakthrough status, actually, that’s been very, very, very helpful. I think it’s a terrific program that Congress devised, because it gets the focus of the people, it gets the staffing on the project to move things along, it gets you more access, it gets your questions answered, etcetera, etcetera. So, I do think that is a good program and my perspective on it is, they don't give that out so easily, they have high standards, and when you get it they do work well with you. So, no gripes from me. I'm not one of those people, when things don't go well, I just blame the FDA, it's just the opposite. I want a test FDA, because I want a high bar, and want a balanced and fair playing field, but I want a high bar so that we're just not in the, if you will, as I said the other day, in the infomercial business and anything you can say is fine and doesn't matter whether the product actually works or not.
Mike Aberman: Next question. We have time for one more question. For those of you who don't get a question today, I want to apologize. We are in the office and we made an entry, so please give us a call and we'll try to get you on in the next earnings call. So, this will be the last question.
Operator: Our final question comes from Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Cory Kasimov: Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question and squeezing me in. so, relatively speaking, how do you view the market opportunity for EYLEA in non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy compared to the products currently approved indications, assuming of course you have positive Phase III data for that patient population? Thanks.
Leonard Schleifer: Yeah. Once again, I'm glad you asked the question on the way you did. On a relative basis, the number of patients is substantially higher who have proliferative diabetic retinopathy as compared to those that have proliferative diabetic retinopathy with diabetic macular edema. And so, you open up a much larger group of patients who potentially could benefit from the drug. Of course, this is, sort of, almost treating people who have yet to realize you’re treating people who have eye disease, lots of eye disease, but it hasn't affected their vision yet. And so, you have to convince them that to get an injection in the eye to protect their vision. I think that's somewhat of an impediment, but because -- if you have strong data, the numbers there are much, much larger. Anyway, so I think it's a big opportunity on a relative basis. Let me just close by saying that, for us, we get it. We know how important EYLEA is, but we -- and so we're going to defend and try to extend that. We also get how important it is to make our late stage pipeline a big commercial success. And we have worked very, very hard to get ready for what we think could be a game changing -- and people like to use game changing, breakthrough, all that stuff. But the truth of the matter is, those kinds of products don't come along that often. Where George and his team are able to give us a weapon to address, really almost put your finger on the control system for allergic diseases and do that in a way where you don’t have the immune system dysfunction that you do when you do that, let’s say, for Type I immunologic disorders such as the anti-TNF, which do great things, if think about it, when you control the anti-TNF part of the immune system, you are able to come up with drugs that treated rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease. Now that’s pretty amazing but on the other hand it came with some risk. On the other side of the immune system, if you can control that the way Dupixent seems to be able to do we might be able to have a drug that can address lots of allergic disorders not just the first one. The way these are regulated and the way they can be promoted are only indications by indication. But there are lots of indications here, you can think of it as we have drug for atopic dermatitis, we have a drug for potentially asthma, a drug potentially for nasal polyps with chronic sinusitis, potentially for food allergies, eosinophilic esophagitis, and so on. And to be able to have that control, okay, without having the side effects profile that you get from the other side of the immune system, the anti-TNFs, I think it's quite remarkable. So, we are extremely excited about that and where the science is taking us there and how the company can evolve from what are tremendous opportunities on that side of the equation and we're not giving up, obviously, we think Praluent, obviously, we're are very pleased when that came out last evening and we are going to fight very hard to get our appeal successfully and to make that an important product as well. And our pipeline with all the things in it in a tough pricing environment, I think Regeneron is really the place to be because you get innovation and innovation is something that will always generate value. Price increases are nice but if you can’t get them you better be able to innovate and that’s our sweet spot. So, maybe, Michael I will turn it back over to you.
Michael Aberman: Well, that concludes our call for today. We appreciate everyone calling in. Again, a couple of people have emailed me, we will call you back. If you want to hear from us, please give us an email or drop us a line, we are in the office. Operator, that concludes our call.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Once our call concludes, Bob Landry and the rest of IR team will be available to answer further questions. With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.
Leonard Schleifer: Thanks, Michael, and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us on the call and webcast today. I would like to begin by giving you a high-level stance of our near-term and longer term priorities at Regeneron. EYLEA our flagship anti-VEGF continues to remain a key financial driver for Regeneron. We are pleased with the continued growth of EYLEA and are committed to maintaining our leadership position in the branded anti-VEGF market by pursuing both additional indications for EYLEA such as diabetic retinopathy, where we currently have a Phase III study ongoing. And we are also looking at ways in which we can improve upon the high efficacy bar set by EYLEA through combinations within antibody to Ang2 where we currently have two Phase II studies ongoing. While EYLEA remains very important to our business, we are equally focused on the ongoing launch of Praluent or PCSK9 antibody for long LDL cholesterol as well as advancing our pipeline. For Praluent, we believe that if outcomes data are positive it will drive greater use of this class. As mentioned in our release, we expect this second interim analysis by the end of this month. Moving on to Sarilumab our IL-6 receptor antibody for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, as you heard last week, we received a complete response letter from the FDA, this was due to certain manufacturing deficiencies, not specific to Sarilumab. They we observed during a routine inspection of a Sanofi fill and finish plant in France. Sanofi has provided comprehensive responses and is working closely with the FDA to address the deficiencies as expeditiously as possible. It is only been a week since we received the complete response letter and we are preparing to engage in meaningful discussions with the FDA, so it is too early for us to comment on the expected timeline for a potential Sarilumab approval. We do not expect these manufacturing deficiencies will impact Dupilumab or as it is now known by its branding Dupixent, where our Biological License Application or BLA is currently under FDA prior review for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in the dose. The FDA action date for the BLA is at the end of March. Dupixent is a very important pipeline product candidate for us and we believe that atopic dermatitis represents an area of high unmet need. As a reminder, we received breakthrough designation this indication. In addition to atopic dermatitis, we are also investigating Dupixent in other indications including asthma, where we recently completed enrollment in our second pivotal study. In midterm, we are looking forward to important clinical progress several of our Phase II and III programs, which spend a variety of therapeutic areas such as allergic diseases, pain, viral diseases, ophthalmology, oncology, cardio metabolic diseases, inflammatory and rare diseases. These programs have the potential to drive the next wave of growth for Regeneron. You will hear more about the key clinical developments from some of these programs from George. At Regeneron, we have always been committed to long-term science and innovation. In fact, today’s marketed products as well as the 16 product candidates in clinical development were all home grown in our internal R&D engine. We will continue to invest in science and technology that can provide sustainable innovation and growth well into the future. This unique long-term focus on science is at the heart of why we have been able to attract top talent, which is key to our continuing success. Through that end, last week we were thrilled to be named by science magazine as the number one company in the biotech or pharmaceutical industry to work for. A recognition we received for four of the last six years. We know that our industry has faced many important questions regarding pricing of drugs. This is not the forum to discuss the complex issue of drug pricing, but I think it is important to note that Regeneron is in a unique position. As the company founded on Science and committed to the research and development of important new products, we are well positioned to succeed even in a difficult and constrained pricing environment. In fact, we have never raised prices on any of our drugs choosing instead to grow through the optimization of currently marketed products by pursuing new indications, as well as the introduction of new medicines. Our future potential growth will be driven by this strategy. With that, let me turn the George.
George Yancopoulos: Thank you Len and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us today. I would like to begin with Dupixent, our IL-4/13 blocker, which we believe is one of the most exciting late stage drug candidate in the industry. We are investigating Dupixent in a wide variety of allergic diseases. The most advance of which is uncontrolled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Just last month, we had the opportunity to present detailed results from SOLO-1 and SOLO-2 which were two identical Phase III studies that investigated Dupixent in the monotherapy setting at the annual EADV Conference. These data were also concurrently published in the New England Journal of Medicine. These were the first large pivotal studies where systemic investigational therapy demonstrated significant reduction in the signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis with an average reduction in skin scores of about 70% accompanied by a marked reduction in the usually unrelenting itch associated with this disease and almost 40% of these patients achieving clearing or near-clearing of their skin lesions. Unlike other immune modulating therapies, there was no evidence of increase immunosuppressant and the most common adverse events in the two trials were injection side reaction in conjunctivitis. We were encouraged by the excitement with which these data were received by the physician community, as well as by patients and we believe that this speaks to the current unmet need and frustration with currently available therapies for this severely debilitating disease. As Len mentioned, our BLA for Dupixent for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis is currently under FDA review and has been given priority review status and an action date of March 29, 2017. While the SOLO studies were in the monotherapy setting, we have also reported positive one-year top line data from the CHRONOS Phase III study, which explore Dupixent in combination with topical corticosteroids. The safety and efficacy findings from the long-term CHRONOS study were consist with those observed in SOLO-1 and 2. I’m pleased to share that LIBERTY AD CAFÉ a Phase III study of Dupixent with common topical corticosteroids in adult patients with severe atopic dermatitis were controlled with or intolerant to or ineligible for oral cycle is now fully enrolled. We along with our collaborator Sanofi, expect to complete the regulatory submission in Europe and Japan in the fourth quarter of 2016. We also plan to initiate a Phase III study in the pediatric severe atopic dermatitis population in the first quarter of 2017, in patients between the ages of 12 and 17. We are pleased that similar to the adult indication Dupixent has received breakthrough designation for the treatment of pediatric patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. While atopic dermatitis is the most advanced indication in development for Dupixent, we are making headway with our asthma program as well. We have previously announced positive results from our first pivotal study of uncontrolled persistent asthma, despite treatment with inhaled steroids and long-acting agonists. As a reminder, these data demonstrated improvements in both lung function as measured by FEV and exacerbations in all patients, regardless of baseline Eosinophil status. There was a 15% improvement above placebo in FEV1 and a 75% reduction in exacerbations in the overall population treated with the 300 milligram every two-week dose. The most common adverse event associated with treatment in this study was injection side reaction. In September, we announced completion of enrollment in LIBERTY asthma quest, which is our confirmatory Phase III pivotal study of Dupixent in this indication. The primary end-point of this study is at 52 weeks and we therefore expect to make a regulatory submission in the U.S. towards the end of 2017. We also expect to initiate a Phase III study in pediatric asthma patients in early 2017. We were also exploring the use of Dupixent in several other allergic indications such as nasal polyps, where we expect to initiate a Phase III study earlier next year and in Eosinophilic Esophagitis we are currently in a Phase II. Turning to Fasinumab, our nerve growth factor antibody for pain. In October, we provided an update on this program. Following the observation of the case of progressing osteoarthritis in the patient receiving high dose Fasinumab, who had a history of advanced osteoarthritis of the knee, the FDA placed our Phase II study in chronic back pain patients on clinical hold. This event prompts an unplanned interim analysis study, which had already completed 70% of its targeted enrollment. The unplanned analysis showed clear evidence of efficacy with improvement in pain scores in all Fasinumab groups compared to placebo at eight and 12-week timeframes with p value less than 0.01. Preliminary safety results were also generally consistent with those observed previously with this class. The FDA has since communicated that we can continue development of Fasinumab in chronicle back pain by excluding patients who have advanced osteoarthritis. We are also continuing our pivotal program in osteoarthritis with final design elements still receiving regulatory feedback. The Fasinumab program will contain safety data from 10,000 patients overall. Moving to Praluent. The recent news on the discontinuation of development of Bococizumab obviously has a major impact on the PCSK9 landscape. This further underscores a very high bar in terms of safety and efficacy for this class. This example also highlights to us the value of our fully human VelocImmune based antibody technology. In terms of our Praluent program, our 18,000 patient ODYSSEY outcome study remained ongoing. We expect the second interim analysis for futility and overwhelming efficacy by the end of this month. We and our collaborator Sanofi have also completed regulatory submissions for the once-monthly dosing formulation of Praluent in the Europe and Japan territories as well as in the United States, where we have been granted an FDA action data January 24, 2017. Our immune-oncology continues to advance and expand. We believe that these are still early days in the area of immune-oncology with a net collective knowledge of this field evolving rapidly and the competitive landscape changing continuously. Evidence of this includes the recent surprising sale year of the market leading PD-1 antibody in first line lung cancer. Regarding our PD-1 program, our potentially pivotal study in Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma is ongoing and we plan to announce additional studies in the near future. In addition, we are also studying PD-1 in combination with our by specific CD-20 by CD-03 molecule. As this year at the American Society of Hematology or ASH conference we will be presenting monotherapy data from the CD-20 by CD-03 program. Lastly, we plan to advance Regeneron 3767 and the antibody LAG-03 into clinical development by the end of 2016. In October, we announced top line results from the Phase II combination study of EYLEA with Rincumab, our PDGFR receptive antibody in wet Age-related Macular Degeneration or wet AMD where the data demonstrated no improvement in Best Corrected Visual Acuity, the primary end-point of this study versus EYLEA alone. We think these study results demonstrate the high hurdle that has been set by the well established efficacy and safety of EYLEA. That said, we are looking for ways in which we constraint in our EYLEA franchise. To that end, we are conducting a Phase II study of EYLEA in a co-formulated combination with Nesvacumab, our antibody to Ang2 in AMD and DME. The DME study is fully enrolled while the study in wet AMD continues to enroll patients. We were also exploring longer acting approaches in this class. And with that summary, let me turn the call over to Bob Terifay.
Robert Terifay: Thank you George and good morning everyone. Third quarter U.S. EYLEA or Aflibercept net sales grew 16% year-over-year. Net U.S. EYLEA sales in the third quarter were $854 million and year-to-date sales were $2.5 billion. Net Ex-U.S. EYLEA sales in the third quarter were $471 million, which represents 27% year-over-year growth unadjusted for currency fluctuations. Net Ex-U.S. year-to-date sales were $1.4 billion. EYLEA is the market-leading product among FDA approved anti-digest agents for all of its approved indications in the United States. In the U.S., we are seeing increased competitor discounts and rebates. We are carefully accessing these actions. As I’m sure you are well aware there is a pending proposal from the centers for Medicare and Medicaid services regarding position reimbursement for physician administrated Medicare Part B or buy and bill drugs. We have worked hard on the policy and legislative front on this issue and will be prepared to respond on the commercial front as needed to make sure that patients continue to have full and complete access to EYLEA. Bringing now the Praluent or Alirocumab. As reported by Sanofi, net sales in the third quarter were $38 million with the U.S. accounting for $32 million of the total. Sales data and IMS total prescription data indicate that Praluent and Evolocumab market share are roughly 50-50 in the United States. As reported by IMS, U.S. total prescriptions for Praluent increased sequentially to 60% versus second quarter of 2016. The challenge for the PCSK9 inhibitor class continues to be the significant reimbursement hurdles for the physicians’ offices and patients, resulting in a low volume of prescriptions being dispensed. This is resulted in physicians’ offices reserving their initial prescription to eliminate pool of patients. We continue to focus our efforts in improving access and improving the prescription process through the payers in specialty pharmacies. We are gradually seeing more payers loosen their utilization management criteria, including removing the requirement prior Ezetimibe therapy. In addition, we are now seeing some patients shortening the number of months that a patient needs to be on maximally tolerated statin therapy and eliminating a specialist only prescribing or consultation requirement. Others have streamlined the prior authorization process. ODYSSEY outcomes data positive, are anticipated to be a key driver in shaping the future success of Praluent. Outside of the United States, Praluent was approved in the EU in September of 2015 with the product now approved in 41 countries. Reimbursement discussions are currently underway with several governments across Europe. Positive reimbursement decisions have been issued in the UK, Spain, Norway and the Netherlands. It still remains a challenging reimbursement situation with some countries awaiting cardiovascular outcomes data. We continue to plan for the potential launch of Sarilumab in the United States. As an example, we have a major presence at the upcoming American College of Rheumatology meeting this month in Washington DC. We will be presenting data from our MONARCH study of Sarilumab as monotherapy in patients for who are poor [Indiscernible] responders as well as subset analysis from our pivotal U.S. registrational studies. We will have a display to your presence highlighting the essential role of IL-6 in rheumatoid arthritis. The European Marketing Authorization Application for Sarilumab is currently under review by the European Medicines Agency, with a potential decision on the application expected in mid 2017. Co-promotion decisions for Europe and other ex-U.S. countries will be made over time. We are currently preparing for Dupixent or Dupilumab commercialization within FDA PDUFA date of March 29, 2017. We will be co-promoting Dupixent with Sanofi Genzyme in the United States. Co-promotion decisions for other countries will be made at the later date. We are aware that payers and pharmacy benefits managers are proactively evaluating the cost effectiveness of emerging therapies for atopic dermatitis in the United States. We want to take a moment to discuss how we are thinking about the Dupixent commercial opportunity, which differs in many important respects in the situation we phase with Praluent. Dupixent has already demonstrated efficacy on the most important outcomes. Consistent efficacy on rash severity, itching and quality of life measures. In the United States, there are 1.6 million patients with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. The majority of which will not likely receive Dupixent therapy. We estimate that approximately 300,000 of these patients have exhausted all approved therapies and have failed or unable to tolerate unapproved use of immunosuppressant therapies. Many of these advanced patients are suffering from a host of related issues, including sleep disturbances, anxiety and depression. These atopic dermatitis patients should not be denied therapy. We hope payers and insurers will provide appropriate and timely access to Dupixent, should it be approved. And the patients will not have to step through unapproved immunosuppressant therapies, many of which had bought Black Box warnings. We plan to work closely with all stakeholders including patients, physicians and payers to achieve this goal. With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer Bob Landry.
Robert Landry: Thanks Bob and good morning. Regeneron posted strong financial results in the third quarter of 2016 as well as entered into two new exciting collaborations. We are also lowering and tightening full-year 2016 guidance on non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D, non-GAAP SG&A, our effective tax rate and capital expenditures. Let me start with our top-line third quarter earnings. The third quarter 2016 non-GAAP net income was 365 million in non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $3.13. This represents an increase of 32% in both non-GAAP net income per diluted share as well as non-GAAP net income in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015. Regeneron’s third quarter 2016 non-GAAP net income primarily excludes non-cash share based compensation expense and the $25 million upfront payment made connection with our third quarter 2016 license in collaboration agreement with Adicet and includes the income tax effect of these non-GAAP reconciling items. Of all reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings that is set forth in our earnings release. Total revenues in the third quarter of 2016 were $1.2 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 7% over the third quarter of 2015. Net product sales were $857 million in the third quarter 2016 compared to $738 million in the third quarter of 2015. EYLEA U.S. net product sales were $854 million compared to $734 million in the third quarter of 2015 representing 16% year-over-year growth, sequential quarter-over-growth was approximately 3%. During the third quarter of 2016, EYLEA experienced a slight increase in U.S. distributor inventory levels as compared to the second quarter 2016, but continues to be within our normal one to two week targeted range. As mentioned in our press release issued this morning, we are tightening our full-year 2016 U.S. EYLEA net sales guidance to be year-over-year growth of 23% to 25%. Ex-U.S. EYLEA sales were product revenue is recorded by our collaborator Bayer were $471 million in the third quarter of 2015 compared to $371 million in the third quarter of 2015 representing a 27% increase on a reported basis. On an operational basis or constant currency basis, sales increased approximately 25%. In the third quarter of 2016, Regeneron recognized a $171 million from our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. total Bayer collaboration revenue for the third quarter 2016 was $191 million. Turning now to our Sanofi collaboration. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was a $144 million for the third quarter of 2016. The Sanofi collaboration revenue line item primarily consists of reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred R&D expenses, reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred commercialization related expenses, and our share of profits or losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies. In the third quarter of 2016, our share of the collaboration’s losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies, which includes Praluent and pre-commercialization activities and costs in connection with Sarilumab and Dupixent was $112 million, which can be found in table four of our earnings release. Netted within the collaboration losses were the global sales of Praluent, as recognized by our collaborator Sanofi, of $38 million for the third quarter of 2016. Before moving to expenses, I would like to highlight two third quarter business development transactions. The first is the collaboration we entered into Teva to developing commercialize or NGF antibody Fasinumab under the terms of the agreement Teva paid Regeneron $250 million upfront payment and we will equally share on an ongoing basis R&D expenses of approximately $1 billion under a global development plan. We plan ratably recognize the upfront payment as revenue over the related performance period. The signing of this agreement did not have a material P&L impact on the third quarter of 2016. As a reminder, the intellectual property associated with our late-stage pipeline included Fasinumab has been migrated offshore thus expenses in revenues associated with the program will be recognized in foreign jurisdictions with cash rate lower than in U.S. Federal statutory rate. The other 2016, third quarter business development transaction was a collaboration with Adicet, which will allow us to discover and develop engineered next generation immune cell therapeutics. In accordance with this agreement, we paid Adicet $25 million upfront payment in the third quarter of 2016, which we have recorded as GAAP R&D expense in our consolidated statement of operations, but have excluded from our non-GAAP net income. Turning now to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expense, which is calculated as the total GAAP R&D expense less R&D non-cash share-based compensation expense as well as the upfront payment we made to collaborate our Adicet was $437 million for the third quarter of 2016. Our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculate as the total non-GAAP R&D expense plus R&D reimbursements from our collaborators was $256 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Our press release includes all the information and is required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense. As a result of the recently executed collaboration with Teva regarding Fasinumab, we are lowering and tightening our full-year 2016 guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to be in the range of $945 million to $975 million from our previous guidance range of $970 million for just over $1 billion. Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $221 million for the third quarter of 2016. We are tightening and lowering our full-year 2016 guidance for non-GAAP SG&A to $965 million to $995 billion from our previous guidance range of $980 million to $1.02 billion. Note that, even after lowering and tightening our full-year guidance, we do not expect to see any material pre-launch cost savings from the PDUFA delays of Sarilumab. We will be co-promoting Sarilumab with Sanofi Genzyme and our sales force is already onboard. And as you heard earlier from Bob Terifay, we continue to prepare for the launch in anticipation and the resolution of matters with the FDA. Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization related expenses a line item found within Sanofi collaboration revenue was $66 million for the third quarter of 2016 we are tightening our full-year 2016 guidance of Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization related expenses to be in the range of $310 million to $335 million from $310 million to $340 million. Turning now to taxes. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2016 was 27.6% as compared to 46.5% in the third quarter of 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of changes in the geographic mix of earnings, inclusion of the tax benefit of share based compensation and the impact of the domestic manufacturing deductions, as compared to the same quarter of last year. As well as the discrete impact to this quarter of a change in our assessment of reserves were uncertain tax positions. For 2016, we are lowering and tightening guidance for our full-year GAAP effective tax rate to be 29% to 33% from the previously provided range of 33% to 41%. Our capital expenditures for nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $361 million. For the full-year of 2016, we are lowering and tightening our guidance for capital expenditures to be in the range of $480 million to $510 million from the previously provided range of $480 million to $530 million. 2016 capital expenditures primarily include cost in connection with renovations of our Limerick, Ireland manufacturing facility, tenant improvement in associated costs at our Tarrytown, New York facilities. Renovations in addition stores at Rensselaer, New York manufacturing facilities in the purchase of an office building New York, Rensselaer manufacturing facility. We ended the third quarter 2016 with cash and marketable securities of $2.2 billion, which includes the Teva upfront payment of $250 million. As we have reported in previous quarters, we have opportunistically reduced the number of warrants that we issued in 2011 in connection with our convertible debt issuance through repurchases from the warrant counterparties. Depending on market and other conditions, we may spend up to $415 million to repurchase or settle these outstanding warrants. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Michael.
Michael Aberman: Thank you Bob. Before turning over to Q&A let me remind everyone to please keep your questions to a single question to allow for most number of people to have a turn. With that operator, can we please open up for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Robyn Karnauskas from Citigroup.
Robyn Karnauskas: Hi guys, thank you. I’ll stick to the one question. So if I heard you correctly, it sounded like the [Indiscernible] revenue was concluded - and it’s a 12-week study, so is it possible that we could - well in the first quarter and if so or when we get results remind us how you typically release them [Indiscernible] maybe some color and executions around that. Thank you.
Leonard Schleifer: First. Since you are talking about timing, we really don’t give guidance on timing and as we have with our - we typically look at this and give the top-line press releases is our typical practice.
Robert Landry: But more in general comment Robyn, we would say that and George might want to amplify and I think it’s a tough bar, and we are constantly looking to try and improve on that and so when we get the data we certainly will give you a top-line assessment.
Operator: Our next question comes from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.
Terence Flynn: Hi, thanks for taking the question. It’s just one of the two parts, first just maybe walk us through some of the key drivers of EYLEA growth that we should consider as we head into next year here. And then Bob maybe just last year at this time you highlighted 2016 was shaping up to be an important investment year. Any thoughts here as we head into 2017 produce the [Indiscernible] market. Thank you.
Leonard Schleifer: So Flynn I’ll let Bob amplify if he likes, but the obvious potential growth drivers for EYLEA comes from demographics, aging population, more patients with diabetic eye disease, potentially would come from market share depending upon what continues to happen in the marketplace. This is potential for ups and downs there. And obviously an additional indications diabetic retinopathy those in the three places where we would be focusing and looking to drive growth off of a very large base obviously.
Robert Landry: Terence hi, it’s Bob. Yes, I mean we go out with our SG&A guidance upcoming we are not in a position right now to talk to that, but again we have spent time on this call and you have heard us previously with regards to the spending we have around Dupixent. So with the March 29th PDUFA date coming, we need to ensure that we are ready with regards to our marketing and our sales team is everything to be able to hit the road very quickly on that. And again, we are still investing behind Praluent as we wait for the outcomes data in Sarilumab. As I mentioned on the call, I mean we are putting promotional dollars behind that in our marketing and spending and when the FDA list the regulatory approval on that then we will be in a position to ensure that the product is fully supported from a marketing and sales perspective.
Michael Aberman: Next question.
Operator: Next we have Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Ying Huang: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. I have a question on the ODYSSEY outcome study here. So we know the hurdle for overwhelming efficacy ratio of less than 0.02 with the p values less than 0.0001. Can you elaborate, do you need to see consistency in every composite of the prime end-point, the all four composite of prime end-point. And also can you tell us how much confidence you have in terms of being able to need that end-points by the end of this month? Thank you.
George Yancopoulos: Yes, this is George. In some ways this decision is out of our hands and it’s very subjective in terms of there is independent monitoring board that without us is going to look at the data regardless of even if we hit the numbers that you stated in terms of our overwhelming efficacy. They have to make a decision about not only consistency and so forth that they are going to take into account whether there is rationale and it’s worthwhile, because maybe they want to look with in subgroup or another to get the complete data set. And so it’s very hard to predict something like that and as I said, is up to an independent data monitoring, its completely out of our hand and they could simply decide for example that they want to follow and get more [deaths] (Ph) in one particular subgroup even though the overall population was very clear. So the end result is I can’t really answer your question, because we just don’t know.
Michael Aberman: Okay. Next question.
Operator: Next we have Chris Raymond from Raymond James. Mr. Raymond your line maybe muted.
Christopher Raymond: Oh, sorry. Can you hear me now? Yes, thanks. So on Sarilumab, so just putting me the manufacturing delay for the drug aside, there has been some news in the biologic space information recently Amgen sort of talking about running out of it’s sort of pricing runway. And we have actually seen from some of our own work, pretty strong evidence that other sort of newer biologics have been gaining traction for some time. I wonder if you could maybe described at a high level your views maybe of the changing landscape with respect to access in PBM market power. And how you think Sarilumab once it is ultimately approved is positioned, not just necessarily from a clinical standpoint, but how you think for commercial landscape is changing in ways that may or may not favor the drug. Thanks.
Leonard Schleifer: Sure, this is Len. At the risk of unveiling a little bit of our strategy here, but not too much of it because obviously we have to get to market. It is a tough environment and the people who are paying the bills have seen what I would consider in some cases almost outrageous increases at least on the WAC price of the wholesale acquisition drugs, rheumatoid arthritis where people taking double-digit increases, sometimes twice a year. To me that suggests some sort of tone deafness in this environment. We think that we have to compete on two in two way, we have to compete with a very good drug, which we think Sarilumab will be. Of course, we have to get over this filling glitch and get to market as quickly as we can. But we think that the class is doing very well, there is some date out there from the first engine of the class where monotherapy against the leading NITNF, the and IL-6 receptor class performed better. And there are some people who simply don’t like to take Methotrexate, we have data of our own, which probably won’t be enough for us filing similar types of results with outperforming in monotherapy. But giving a solid entry with good properties is not going to be enough here and we have to compete with an offering that payers will find attractive. I think Regeneron is willing to break some of the mold here and now I’m getting some hints from my colleagues that I have probably said enough. So I will leave it at that.
Robert Landry: Its Bob. I think it’s important though also to keep in mind that the market has been characterized by a significant amount of TNF cycling and the reality is after a patient receives one TNF inhibitor, if they move a second, we see a diminishing efficacy overtime. We have an obligation from a sales and marketing perspective when we get approved to stop the TNF cycling and IL-6 inhibition plays a central role in RA. It plays a role in not only the symptoms but in terms of the progression of joint damage. And we have to educate physicians on that. So we are anxious to have the product get approved and get that message out there.
Michael Aberman: Okay, thanks for the question. Next question.
Operator: Next we have Geoffrey Porges from Leerink Partners.
Geoffrey Porges: Thanks very much for the question. Perhaps a question on the manufacturing issue. It’s been weeks since the Sanofi conference call so I presume you both had a lot more information. Could you confirm whether the auto field finish facility was included in the original BOI and whether its straightforward to switch the fill finish [Indiscernible] to that alternative facility. And then secondly, could you just tell us whether the inventory of Praluent, Sarulimab and Dupilimab, which presumably have already pre-launched is embargoed or is it likely to be usable and can you be selling Praluent from that inventory already? Thanks.
Leonard Schleifer: Yes, Jeff. As usual, you ask some of the best and most penetrating questions. And as usual we will give you or we would love to give you an answer, but we really not in a position to discuss the details of discussions that aren’t going with the FDA, how they are going to be resolved, the strategy redundancy, what is in filing, what isn’t and so on and so forth. We can summarize by saying that Sanofi is working very hard and they believe they can quickly remedy the deficiencies that were not related to Sarilumab per say, but rather some general GMP deficiencies, which there frankly and well on their way to remedy of course we have to work with the agency and they have to be satisfied. In terms of products that are already manufactured there. I think you should think the FDA sort of takes a risk based approach here, they have sort of maybe frozen in place those things that are actually being - assuming that they don’t think a plant is way out of whack. And nothing can be shipped and still they continued to fill an used product from that facility for approved products. It’s a new product such as Sarilumab, which gets sort of shout off obviously and unfortunately. We are working with them on Sarilumab and we are also working with a different group on Dupixent, which is a breakthrough product, which has a whole different set of approaches to it. So it’s complicated, you can imagine there is tremendous amount of work, a week seems like a long time maybe in your world, but in the world of regulatory interactions and manufacturing remedies and so on, it’s still relatively short time.
Michael Aberman: Next question.
Operator: Next we have Ronny Gal from Bernstein.
Ronny Gal: Thank you for taking my question. So just very quickly following on Jeff. Just looking at generic industry here when it comes to facilities the cycles improving facilities and getting product approved is actually quite long and what gives you conviction that in this case, it will be a relatively short one. And then if I could sneak a second one, 340B there has been some discussion form for that program. If you kind of give us an update about this program and how it impacts EYLEA sales?
Leonard Schleifer: We are going to give you only one question. And so the first question has to do with how do we know how quickly this is going to be remedied. Well we don’t know how quickly it’s going to be remedied for sure, obviously. We know how quickly, which is in a relatively short period of time that Sanofi feels as if they can get the plant in full GMP compliance. In fact, they have already broadened all sorts of efforts and resources, they have already submitted a detail plan, they have already submitted the first or second progress reports against that plan. And so, we feel that the strategy is the right one, and the approach is the right one. Obviously, we will just have to work with the agency and see how quickly they can feel comfortable that the plan is ready to go. Next question.
Operator: Next we have a Alethia Young from Credit Suisse.
Alethia Young: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just one on the pediatric population, I know you quantified a little bit more about the adults with the 300,000 a-day. Can you kind of frame that in similar likely nature or similar nature as to the pediatric population please.
Leonard Schleifer: Bob do you want to comment at all on this.
Robert Terifay: Yes, I don’t think we are prepared to sort of go into the numbers in the pediatric population especially things were just embarked on our Phase III program now.
Michael Aberman: Okay. Next question.
Operator: Next we have an [Indiscernible] RBC Capital Markets.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, thanks for the question. Maybe for Bob, On EYLEA pricing issue are aside - is EYLEA growth tampering a bit. We had thought that DME would be as big as A&D. What are the individual market dynamics, perhaps if you can give any color on that?
Robert Landry: So, we have done very, very well with EYLEA in DME that has been the driver of growth over the last couple of years. Primarily driven by the impressive protocol p results, which indicated that EYLEA was superior Lucentis and that Fasinumab on its primary end-point. The challenge with continuing growth in DME is that there are number of patients that never make it to the retinal specialist office. They go to an ophthalmologist who do laser therapy, laser is a revenue driver in the ophthalmologist office and they don’t make it to the retinal physician’s office where they could get access to anti-VEGF therapy. This has been a focus for us, we are educating, we are trying to educate patients that if they do have DME, they ought to get themselves to an retinal specialist, but this is chipping away at a habit among the ophthalmologist and its going to take some time. But we continue to see that the DME market does offer substantial growth opportunities for us in the future and as Len mentioned earlier if and when we get to diabetic retinopathy indication that would be a further driver.
Michael Aberman: Thanks. Next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Scotti from Evercore ISI.
John Scotti: Hi, good morning thanks for taking my question. On EYLEA, I think you previously mentioned that you are seeing a bit of an increase in gross to net and I was just wondering if you are still seeing that steady increase in gross to net and potential smaller erosion in that price. And if so, what is the magnitude of that and whether or not you see this trend is stabilizing or continuing into 2017.
Leonard Schleifer: Yes. I don’t think there has been much sequential change at all in the gross to net, it’s been flat sequentially in the last two quarters.
Michael Aberman: Next question.
Operator: Next we have Cory Kasimov from JP Morgan.
Cory Kasimov: Hey, good morning guys, thanks for taking my question. So, what is the PEDUFA date for a monthly Praluent and early next year. Can you just talk a little bit about the importance of extended dosing in this study? I mean clearly this is a payer constraint market today, but what might monthly dosing mean a little bit down the road? And how do think about even maybe longer term dosing options potentially entering this market from competition at some point in the future. Thanks.
Leonard Schleifer: Yes, I’m not convinced that the driver of this market is whether or not you have something every other weak or every month or what have you. I do believe that people will be driven by the LDL lowering by the outcomes data that would we hope we will support the LDL hypothesis, will continue to support it. And largely driven by payers, they have already demonstrated that they will not pay for convenience, if you look at the hepatitis C class, they put a much less convenient regimen up against a much more expensive regimen. So I don’t think convenience per say is going to drive the market. On the other hand, we like to come up with offerings that are as convenient as possible for patients.
Robert Landry: So just add to that. So far the patients that have received Praluent on a every two week basis have been happy with the dosing frequent, whereas convenience is not a big issue, but as Len pointed out, we would like to offer another dosing form for those patients who do want monthly convenience. But this is not an issue in the marketplace at the current time.
Michael Aberman: Next question.
Operator: Next we have Jim Birchenough from Wells Fargo.
James Birchenough: Yes, hi guys, just a question on the co-formulated Ang2 EYLEA product. And referencing data for the PDGF program. Is there anything in the co-formulation of the two drugs that limits the efficacy of each individual component whether it’s viscosity and ability to inject the full dose of the amount of protein you are giving to the back of the eye. I’m just trying to see if there is learning’s from the PDGF program that might inform how we just think about the co-formulation part of this for the Ang2 product? Thanks.
George Yancopoulos: Yes, we have no reason to think that there is any issues what so ever with that or that would have contributed all to the results and that the results we believe simply reflects the biology or the lack of biology for the PDGF pathway.
Michael Aberman: Next question.
Operator: Next we have [Indiscernible] from SunTrust.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Question on Praluent. Could you comment on the value-base contract, I mean we know Amgen mentioned that they are entering into value-based contract for their PCSK9. Is that happening with you, how do you see that impacting the dynamics going forward?
Leonard Schleifer: Well one thing I should mention is many plans do not have the ability at the present times to enter into these types of arrangements. So it’s going to be a rarity that a plan is able to implement value-based price contracting. However, for those that can do it, we are working with those plans to establish a value-based contract more appropriate.
Michael Aberman: Great. Next question.
Operator: Next we have [Indiscernible] from Jefferies.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, thanks, guys for taking my questions. How do you think payers will define moderate-to-severe for atopic dermatitis patients, because we hear like many darns don’t typically follow easier score out at scales, but I just had a look at by surface area to determine severity of disease?
Leonard Schleifer: I think it varies by geography in Europe, [EZ 75] (Ph) or PASI 75 is the driver of definition of disease in psoriasis. And we anticipate that EZ 75 will be something we have to educate physicians on and they are already preparing themselves for that. In the United States, you are correct, EZ scores are not relevant to the physicians and IG8 scores are not specific enough. So we are working right now on plans with payers on how to better define the disease. George?
George Yancopoulos: Yes, we suggest like you know that obviously in our studies on average the patients that we study had more than 50% of their body surface. At baseline covered by this disease and a quarter of the patients had 85% or more of their body covered with this disease. This just shows how severely these patients are and it’s not just that their skin is covered with this rash, but this is a weepy, itchy, horrific rash that they just can’t escape. And remarkably enough as we said despite the heavy burden of disease at baseline almost 40% of these patients achieved a clear or almost clear status. Really in this business do you have a privilege to be involved in a story like this that can make such a difference in patients’ life. We have been lucky here at Regeneron that we have done this a couple of times already but we think that Dupixent is really a once-in-a-lifetime story where you can really impact such an important disease, so dramatically having an average 70% improvement among all patients. And the thing that’s also so stunning to us about Dupilumab is that it looks like it might have the promise to do likewise in a host of related allergic diseases. Including the overall asthma population where they are again and in most uncontrolled severe population once again the results are very impressive from our first pivotal study and we think the same maybe the case in a host of other allergic setting. So the short answer to your question is, unfortunately there is a lot of patients who have more than 50% of their body surface covered. Those patients are certainly by any category considered severe patients. As Bob already told you, many of them have exhausted all other options and we just hope that all the other ancillary things don’t keep these important patients from getting access to this important life-changing drug.
Leonard Schleifer: Yes, I understand before I turn to what George has said, which is that in contrast to Praluent. We knew with Praluent of course that we could lower cholesterol rather dramatically, but to most patients unless they are highly involved in the detail of their care, which some are, but many to them that isn’t the end all, be all something that they wakeup everyday wondering how to get their cholesterol down. Of course they have had a heart attack and everybody in the family does, then they do pay attention to that. But then there was the push back, well you don’t really know do you that it improves outcomes and we’re just going on a hypothesis. Even though there is a great deal of data to certainly support that hypothesis. So it’s not a disease that people are clamoring to get treated and it’s not outcomes that are readily in hand. Contrast that with Praluent where these patients are desperate for treatment, truly desperate for treatment and we are not talking about the topical treatments that are available such as steroids that might become available when you are dealing with small areas relatively to modest disease. We are talking about the kind of patients George referred to, which are really quite significant. And these patients can see the outcome themselves, they can tell that they are doing better and we see it in our studies, we see it in our questionnaires, we see it in whether or not there is sweeping because they can scratch themselves so badly. I heard a story the other day which practically was a group of us who practically brought us all to tears, where a little boy who was visiting his grandparents and so cuddling and sleeping on the same bed. With very bad atopic dermatitis said to his grandparents, can you each hold one of my hands when I sleep so I don’t scratch myself so badly. I mean think about that, this is a disease that people really are looking for treatment. And if we can get this drug approved, first for adults and hopefully down the road for children, we can really provide something that they can tangibly feel. We are passive about making sure that we remove all the barriers out there and we expect to work with patients, with doctors, with payers, with organizations to make sure that people are aware of this treatment and can get access to it. Next question.
Michael Aberman: Yes I think, we have time for one last question.
Operator: Our final question comes from Phil Nadeau from Cowen & Company.
Phil Nadeau: Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in. Just one question on some of your prepared remarks. You mentioned that your competition for EYLEA is beginning to increase the discounts that they are offering. I want to understand the dynamics there a bit more, is there a cycle for when discounts are negotiated and there are any signs that you are seeing this is something that’s demanded by payers or is it just something that the competition is taking upon themselves to do?
George Yancopoulos: Yes, remember this is a Part B drug and there really not the same kind of environment we have a timing and a cycle with patients. For the most part there is some small amount of that that goes on. But for the most part the discounts and rebates that have been offered have been sort of directly backed to the physician’s office et cetera, et cetera. We continually revaluate that situation, we looking what are impacts, we are very sensitive to doctors being have to make a choice of what to give the patients, what they might think the best drug would be because of a rebate situation or something like that. We think most retinal physicians don’t do that, but we certainly understand that we will then as the markets shifts we are prepared to react if necessary.
Leonard Schleifer: Great. Thank you all for joining the call today. As we mentioned before, the IR team and Bob, the Chief Financial Officer will be available to answer any questions that didn’t make it on the call. That ends the call for today.
Operator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today’s conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2016 Q2  (2016-08-04 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Sylvia and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Dr. Michael Aberman. Dr. Aberman, you may begin.
Michael S. Aberman, M.D.: Thank you and good morning and welcome to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Second Quarter 2016 Conference Call. An archive of this webcast will be available on our website under Events and Presentations for 30 days. Joining me on the call today are Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; George Yancopoulos, Founding Scientist, President of Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer; Bob Terifay, Executive Vice President, Commercial; and Bob Landry, Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A. I would also like to remind you that remarks made on this call include forward-looking statements about Regeneron. Such statements may include, but are not limited to, those related to Regeneron and its products and businesses, sales and expense forecasts, financial forecasts, development programs, collaborations, finances, regulatory matters, coverage and reimbursement matters, intellectual property, litigation matters and competition. Each forward-looking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected in such statements. A more complete description of these and other material risks can be found in Regeneron's filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, including its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, which was filed with the SEC this morning. Regeneron does not undertake any obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. In addition, please note that GAAP and non-GAAP measures will be discussed on today's call. Information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP are available in our financial results press release, which can be accessed on our website at www.regeneron.com. Once our call concludes, Bob Landry and the IR team will be available to answer further questions. With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.: Thanks, Michael, and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us on the call and webcast today. Before I turn the call over to my colleagues who will discuss our scientific, commercial and financial performance, I'd like to take a few minutes to give you some broader perspective on Regeneron and our business. Regeneron continues to advance its mission to bring important new medicines to patients in need. EYLEA is our drug used to treat a number of potentially blinding diseases and with millions of injections administered each year, it is one of our most important approved products and continues to grow well globally. EYLEA is now at an annual global net sales run rate that exceeds $5 billion. This has been driven both by the approval of EYLEA in new indications as well as new data that have further increased the confidence of physicians in this product. Thanks to our long-standing belief and investment in science and technology, we are now in the midst of a new product cycle which has the potential to impact multiple disease settings. This investment in science has resulted in PRALUENT, our PCSK9 antibody for lowering LDL cholesterol, and additional potential near-term approvals that could address rheumatoid arthritis and atopic dermatitis. Our late stage pipeline also includes programs in asthma, pain, respiratory syncytial virus and the immunotherapy of cancer. Our earlier pipeline opportunities continue to grow with a total of 15 product candidates currently in clinical development, including seven that we are developing independently, with several more expected to enter the clinic in the near term, making for a pipeline that can address potential opportunities ranging from rare orphan diseases such as fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva or FOP, to emerging infectious diseases, epidemics such as Zika. George will provide specific details on some of these programs later in this call. All of these opportunities are the results of investments we made in science and technology over the last 20 years, yielding a pipeline that is entirely home grown. Our commitment to the long-term is unwavering as we invest in the next generation of technologies to support our future pipeline. For example, our Regeneron Genetics Center and our investment in technologies with companies in the areas of gene editing and cell therapy such as Intellia and Adicet, which are synergistic with our existing capabilities. I should also mention that we recognize that we operate in a rapidly changing environment that poses new challenges to the commercialization of our products, and we continue to try and develop innovative solutions to address these issues. Lastly, we believe it's absolutely essential to attract the best and brightest minds to scientific careers, and to elevate the place of science in our society; therefore we were thrilled to announce in May that Regeneron was selected as the new sponsor of the Science Talent Search. Regeneron is only the third sponsor in this renowned 75-year history of this high school science talent competition, which was previously sponsored by Intel and before that by Westinghouse. George and I are both alumni of the Science Talent Search and we believe the program plays a vital role in encouraging talented young people to pursue a path in science and engineering. With that introduction, let me turn the call over to George.
George D. Yancopoulos: Thank you, Len, and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us today. I'd like to begin with progress in our late-stage pipeline. In the second quarter we reported positive data from three Phase 3 studies of dupilumab, our interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 blocker in patients with uncontrolled moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, which is a chronic inflammatory skin disease. Dupilumab is the first systemic therapy to show positive Phase 3 results in this indication. On our last earnings call, we talked about the positive data from the first two Phase 3 studies, SOLO 1 and SOLO 2, which studied dupilumab as a monotherapy. In June, we just recently reported the results from the third study, LIBERTY AD CHRONOS, which was a long-term study that investigated dupilumab in combination with topical corticosteroids, which are currently the standard of care in the United States for the treatment of this difficult disease. Overall, the efficacy observed in the CHRONOS study was very consistent with the previously-reported positive Phase 3 SOLO 1 and SOLO 2 studies of dupilumab in the monotherapy study. While the primary endpoint of the CHRONOS study was assessed at 16 weeks, the study continued until 52 weeks and efficacy was sustained in both the dupilumab 300 milligram weekly as well as the 300 milligram every other week dose groups through this one-year mark. At 16 weeks, about 40% of the patients in both dupilumab dose groups achieved clear or almost clear skin status as measured by the Investigator Global Assessment score compared to about 12% of the patients in the topical steroid only arm. Nearly two-thirds of the patients receiving dupilumab achieved a 75% improvement in the average – improvement in the overall skin score as assessed by the Eczema Area and Severity Index, or the EASI score, compared to about 23% of patients in the topical steroid only arm. This was the first long-term Phase 3 study to show that dupilumab in combination with topical steroids was superior to topical steroids alone and provided sustained efficacy and significantly improved measures of overall disease severity, skin clearing, itching and quality of life through one year of treatment. The overall rate of adverse events and serious adverse events was comparable between the groups treated with dupilumab in combination with topical steroid and the topical steroids alone. Serious and/or severe infections were numerically higher in the topical steroid alone group. Adverse events that were noted to have a higher rate with dupilumab treatment included injection site reactions, which were seen in 20% of the patients on the dupilumab weekly arm, 16% of the patients in the dupilumab every two week arm, and 9% of the patients in the placebo plus topical steroid alone arm; and conjunctivitis, which was observed in 19% of patients in the dupilumab weekly arm, 13% of patients in the dupilumab every other week arm, and 8% of patients in the topical steroid alone arm. About 22% of the patients in the placebo group, 23% of the patients in the dupilumab weekly group, and 28% of the patients in the dupilumab every other weekly group had a reported history of allergic conjunctivitis coming into the study. These one-year results from the CHRONOS study further suggest that dupilumab impacts the apparent activation of the interleukin-4/interleukin-13 pathway and results in significant efficacy without the side effects associated with immune suppressing therapies. In this regard, and very importantly, we have not observed an increase in overall infections or serious infections in our atopic dermatitis program to date. The U.S. BLA submission has been completed, and we look forward to working with the FDA to bring this important breakthrough therapy to patients as soon as possible. We're also developing dupilumab in other allergic diseases such as asthma, nasal polyps and eosinophilic esophagitis. As a reminder, our first pivotal study in asthma showed that two doses of dupilumab, 200 milligram and 300 milligram every other week, in combination with inhaled steroids and long-acting beta agonist demonstrated a statistically significant 12% to 15% improvement in lung function as measured by FEV1 over placebo at week 12, and a 64% to 75% reduction in the annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbations over placebo. The most common adverse event was injection site reaction, which was more frequent in the dupilumab dose groups at 13% to 25% compared to 12% in the placebo group. The incident of infections was balanced across treatment groups at 42% to 45% in dupilumab arms and 46% in the placebo arm, as was the incidence of serious adverse events which were seen in 3% to 7% of the dupilumab groups and 5% in the placebo group. We expect our confirmatory one-year Phase 3 study of dupilumab in this indication to complete enrollment in the third quarter of 2016. As a reminder, we are the only late-stage biologic that targets both IL-4 and IL-13, and recent competitor developments in the late-stage asthma space are consistent with our pre-clinical data and our hypothesis that it is important to block both of these interleukins. Turning to PRALUENT, our 18,000 patient ODYSSEY outcome study is ongoing. As we had previously disclosed, the Data Monitoring Committee for this study completed the first interim analysis when 50% of the total events had accrued based on unblinded study data. In addition to reviewing the safety study, the DMC performed a futility assessment and recommended that the study continue with no changes. A second interim analysis for futility as well as for overall efficacy, when 75% of the targeted primary events has occurred, is expected later this year. As Len mentioned, we also have three other late-stage programs: sarilumab, our interleukin-6 receptor antibody for rheumatoid arthritis, where we expect FDA action by October 30; fasinumab, our NGF antibody for pain associated with osteoarthritis; and REGN2222 for respiratory syncytial virus or RSV. Turning now to our earlier-stage pipeline, in May we reported positive interim proof of concept data from a Phase 2 study of evinacumab, an antibody to angiopoietin PTL3 in patients with a homozygous form of familial hypercholesterolemia. These patients continue to have a major unmet need as they are typically not as responsive to standard lipid lowering therapies such as statins or even to PCSK9 inhibition and some of the treatment options available to them are limited by the accompanying safety and tolerability concerns. Although these data were from a small number of patients, we are encouraged by the additional 55% reduction in LDL cholesterol levels at week four on top of standard of care compared to baseline. In this study, evinacumab was generally well tolerated and there were no adverse events leading to discontinuation. The most common drug-related adverse events were injection site reactions, which were mild in severity. Our Phase 2 study of EYLEA in a coformulated combination with rinucumab, our PDGF receptor antibody, in wet age-related macular degeneration, or wet AMD, which has been granted fast track designation, is fully enrolled and we expect top line data from this study in the fourth quarter of 2016. This is a three-arm, two-stage study with patients randomized to receive one of three dosing regimens: EYLEA alone, EYLEA in combination with low dose PDGF blocking antibody, or EYLEA in combination with high dose PDGF blocking antibody. The primary efficacy endpoint of the first stage of this study is the mean change in visual acuity at week 12 from baseline. The second stage of the study is designed to confirm and extend the findings from the first stage of the study. Our Phase 2 combination studies of EYLEA in a coformulated combination with nesvacumab, our antibody to angiopoietin-2, in AMD and DME continue to enroll patients. We are very excited by our earlier stage pipeline in immuno-oncology where both our PD-1 antibody and our CD20/CD3 bi-specific antibodies have demonstrated promising activity in early clinical trials. Our potentially pivotal study with our PD-1 antibody in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma continues to enroll patients and we hope to be investigating additional agents in combinations over the next six to 12 months. We have also expanded our capability in the area of precision immunotherapy with our recently announced collaboration with Adicet, which will allow us to discover and develop engineered next generation immune cell therapies. This collaboration takes advantage of our unique VelocImmune and Veloci-Next technologies that will allow us to use cell-based therapies to target tumor cells. We also recently initiated a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers of REGN2477, an activin antibody being developed for the treatment of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, or FOP, and other musculoskeletal disorders. We remain committed to using our technologies and approaches to help address emerging infectious diseases such as Ebola, MERS and Zika. For Zika, we have identified several fully human monoclonal antibody candidates that are able to potentially block the virus – to potently block the virus from infecting cells in vitro. And early data indicate that these antibodies are protective in an animal model. We're now in the process of scaling up for human trials. We also recently initiated our first-in-human study in healthy volunteers in our Ebola program which has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA. With that, let me turn the call over to Bob Terifay.
Robert J. Terifay: Thank you, George, and hello, everyone. We're pleased with the sales growth of EYLEA or aflibercept injection, both thin the United States and ex U.S. in the first half of 2016. We've made progress in improving access in reimbursement for PRALUENT, or alirocumab, among U.S. payers. In addition, the European and Japanese launches for PRALUENT continue to progress. And we are now preparing for the potential U.S. launces of sarilumab and dupilumab over the next year. Starting with EYLEA, second quarter U.S. net sales grew 27% year over year. Net U.S. EYLEA sales in the second quarter were $831 million. Net ex U.S. EYLEA sales in the second quarter were $486 million which represents 44% growth year over year on a reported basis. We continue to have a strong position in our U.S. market share leadership for EYLEA in the FDA approved anti-VEGF market in terms of injections as reported by 203 retinal specialists in our quarterly market research survey. According to our survey results, in the overall anti-VEGF market, EYLEA has a 37% share of injections as compared to 19% for ranibizumab and 44% for off label, repackaged bevacizumab. On the other hand, with our growing market share, our expenses to support reimbursement activities, including patient support services and reimbursement assistance, have also increased impacting both our gross to net ratio as well as our profit margin. I should note that there are currently a series of proposals from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services regarding physician reimbursement for physician-administered Medicare Part B, buy and bill drugs which could lead towards physicians favoring the use of bevacizumab or in large-volume retinal practices, ranibizumab due to the provision of increased direct-to-physician financial incentives from the manufacturer and group purchasing organizations. The impact of any changes is difficult to predict, though we are monitoring the situation very closely. Regeneron believes that EYLEA is clearly differentiated from both bevacizumab and ranibizumab. Physicians and patients should not be denied access to any drug therapy that is deemed appropriate. We believe that physician choice should be preserved and alternative schemas to reduce healthcare cost should be explored. Turning now to PRALUENT, as reported by Sanofi, net sales in the second quarter were $24 million worldwide, with the U.S. accounting for $21 million of the total. I'm pleased to share that as of July 1, approximately 74% of commercially insured lives and approximately 91% of Medicare insured lives have access to PRALUENT. We continue to see improvement in the number of prescriptions that are successfully being filled, with both PRALUENT and evolocumab generally splitting market share evenly. However, only approximately 25% of our prescriptions written actually get dispensed. Unfortunately, due to unprecedented strict utilization management criteria and very tedious prior authorization paperwork that the pharmacy benefits managers and health plans have put in place, many patients who are eligible for treatment with a PCSK9 inhibitor have not had the prescriptions filled. We continue to focus our efforts on improving access, or improving the prescription process through the payers and the specialty pharmacies. Over the last several months, we've seen some payers loosen their utilization management criteria removing a requirement for prior ezetimibe therapy. Others have streamlined the prior authorization processes. ODYSSEY outcomes data, if positive, are anticipated to be a key driver in shaping the future success of PRALUENT. Outside of the United States, PRALUENT was approved in the EU in September 2015 with the product now available in several countries. Reimbursement discussions are currently underway with several governments across Europe. Positive reimbursement decisions have been issued in the UK and Spain among others. It still remains a difficult reimbursement market with some countries awaiting outcomes data. In the United States, we've submitted the supplemental BLA for the 300 milligram monthly dose of PRALUENT, and have been granted a PDUFA date of January 24, 2017. We have also submitted a regulatory application for PRALUENT monthly dosing in the EU. Also in July, PRALUENT was approved in Japan. We've submitted a BLA to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for sarilumab our IL-6 receptor inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis and have been granted a PDUFA date of October 30, 2016. Earlier this week, the European Marketing Authorisation Application or MAA for sarilumab was accepted for review by the European Medicines Agency. We will be co-promoting sarilumab with Sanofi Genzyme in the United States and we've completed hiring of her field-based team. Training again this week. Copromotion decisions for other countries will be made over time. Were currently preparing for dupilumab commercialization with the potential U.S. approval in the first half of 2017. Will be copromoting dupilumab with Sanofi Genzyme and have begun interviewing our sales management team. Copromotion decisions for other countries will be made at a later date. With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Landry.
Robert E. Landry: Thanks Bob, and good morning to everyone. I have several financial updates to provide this morning. Let me start with our top line second quarter earnings. In the second quarter of 2016, non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.82. This represented an increase of 24% in both non-GAAP net income per diluted share as well as non-GAAP net income in the second quarter 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015. Regeneron's second quarter 2016 non-GAAP net income excludes non-cash share-based compensation expense and the $75 million upfront payment made in connection with our April 2016 license collaboration agreement with Intellia. It also includes the income tax effect of these non-GAAP adjustments. A full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings as set forth our earnings release. I will describe further detail shortly, effective this quarter, our non-GAAP net income is no longer includes an adjustment from GAAP tax expense to the amount of taxes that were estimated to be paid or payable in cash. Total revenues in the second quarter of 2016 were $1.2 billion which represented a year-over-year growth of 21% over the second quarter of 2015. Net product sales were $834 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $658 million in the second quarter of 2015. EYLEA U.S. net product sales were $831 million compared to $655 million in the sink quarter 2015 representing a 27% year-over-year growth. Sequential quarter-over-quarter growth was 6%. EYLEA distributor inventory levels continue to be within our normal one to two week targeted range, and the June 30 levels were very similar to our March 31, 2016 levels. Please note that we are reaffirming our 2016 U.S. EYLEA net sales guidance to be year-over-year growth of between 20% and 25%. Ex U.S. EYLEA sales, where product revenue is recorded by our collaborator, Bayer, were $486 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $338 million in the second quarter of 2015, representing a 44% increase on a reported basis. On an operational basis, or constant currency basis, sales increased approximately 42%. In the second quarter of 2016 Regeneron recognized $167 million from our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. Total Bayer collaboration revenue for the second quarter of 2016 was $192 million. As a reminder for the EYLEA franchise, during May 2016 we stopped incurring the royalty expense in connection with our agreement with Genentech related to global EYLEA sales. This benefited our cost of goods sold in cost of collaboration manufacturing line items. Turning now to our Sanofi collaboration, total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $163 million for the second quarter of 2016. Sanofi collaboration revenue line primarily consists of reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred R&D expenses, reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization related expenses, and our share of profits or losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies. In the second quarter of 2016, our share of the collaboration's losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies, primarily PRALUENT, was $122 million, which can be found in table four of our earnings release. Netted within the collaboration losses were the global sales of PRALUENT, as recognized by our collaborator Sanofi, of $24 million for the second quarter of 2016. Turning now to expenses, non-GAAP R&D expense was $406 million for the second quarter of 2016. Our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as the total GAAP R&D expense less R&D reimbursements from our collaborators, R&D non-cash share-based compensation expense and the Intellia upfront payment, was $222 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016. Our press release includes all the information that is required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense. Given our forecasted spend and associated reimbursement levels for the second half of 2016, we are increasing and tightening our full-year guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to be in the range of between $970 million to just over $1 billion from the previously provided range of $875 million to $950 million. This increase is a result of two factors. A forecasted increase in spending shift from partnered to unpartnered antibody development programs; we now have seven antibodies that we are developing independently, including two that are in late stage, RSV and fasinumab. And a greater allocation of unreimbursed manufacturing costs within our Rensselaer, New York facility to R&D as opposed to inventory due to less demand for PRALUENT than was anticipated. Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $244 million for the second quarter of 2016. We are increasing and tightening non-GAAP SG&A expense in 2016 to $980 million to $1.02 billion from the range of $925 million to $1 billion. This increase is primarily driven by our expenses to support EYLEA reimbursement activities, including patient support services and reimbursement assistance along with additional investments in EYLEA's commercialization. This increase is partially offset by lower commercialization and prelaunch spend associated with our collaboration antibodies with Sanofi. As you may recall, last quarter we introduced a new guidance component: Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses, which represents reimbursement of internal and external costs that Regeneron incurs in connection with preparing to commercialize or commercializing, as applicable, PRALUENT, sarilumab and dupilumab. Again, this is a line item found within Sanofi collaboration revenue and is referenced in Table 4 of our press release. For the second quarter of 2016, the reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses was $86 million. We are lowering and tightening this guidance in 2016 to be in the range of $310 million and $340 million from $320 million to $370 million. Turning now to taxes. Prior to the quarter ended June 30, 2016, our non-GAAP measures included an income tax expense adjustment from GAAP tax expense to the amount of taxes that were paid or payable in cash for the respective period. Historically, there was a significant difference between the company's GAAP effective tax rate and the actual cash income taxes paid or payable primarily due to tax benefits related to employee exercises of stock options. The tax benefits related to employee exercises of stock options were historically recorded in additional paid in capital for GAAP reporting purposes. During the second quarter of 2016, the company early adopted Accounting Standards Update 2016-09. The new standard requires companies to recognize tax benefits in connection with employee exercises of stock options in the income statement. In other words, we will account for tax deductions related to stock option exercises in the period of exercise as a discrete item to the quarter. With the early adoption of the new standard, the company chose to discontinue its former non-GAAP income tax expense adjustment since, by adopting the new standard, it eliminated one of our primary differences between the company's effective tax rate and cash income taxes paid or payable. As a result, our second quarter 2016 and 2015 non-GAAP financial results included in our earnings release for comparison now reflect this continuance of our non-GAAP income tax expense adjustment. This new standard will result in variability in our effective tax rate from quarter to quarter, as based on GAAP rules, these items are not forecasted in our estimated annual effective tax rate. These deductions are based on the company's stock price and individual employees' decisions on when to exercise their stock options. The current tax-related adjustment in our reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income in Table 3 of our earnings release solely represents the income tax effects related to our non-GAAP pre-tax adjustment. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2016 was approximately 33%, which is 8% lower compared to the second quarter of 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of changes in the geographic mix of earnings and share-based compensation as compared to the same quarter of last year. For 2016, our guidance for our GAAP effective tax rate for the full year will be 33% to 41%. Our capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2016 and for the six months ended June 30, 2016, were $139 million and $243 million respectively. We are lowering our full-year 2016 capital expenditure guidance to a range of $480 million to $530 million from the previously provided range of $550 million to $625 million. These 2016 expenditures include the expansion of our manufacturing capabilities in both Rensselaer, New York and Limerick, Ireland, as well as growth in our Tarrytown, New York headquarters as we continue to grow our employee base. Regeneron's balance sheet had $1.64 billion of cash and marketable securities as of June 30, 2016. Less than $500,000 of our originally issued $400 million of convertible senior notes due October 1, 2016 remain outstanding. With that, I would now like to turn the call back to Michael.
Michael S. Aberman, M.D.: Thank you, Bob. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call for Q&A. As we like to give as many people a chance to ask questions as possible, as always, please limit yourself to one question. Our team will be available in our office after the call for any follow-up questions. Operator, if you can now open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.
Cameron Bradshaw: Hi. This is Cameron Bradshaw filling in for Terence. Thank you for taking our question. I was wondering, for the Phase 2 trial of EYLEA combined with your PDGF, looks like we're going to see data in the second half of this year. Can you just remind us of the trial design and then what you're hoping to see with respect to efficacy in order to make a go/no-go decision on the Phase 3? Thanks.
George D. Yancopoulos: This is George. The study design really has two stages. The first is a head-to-head-to-head between the three groups that we described in our call, the combination of the PDGF blocker on top of EYLEA versus EYLEA alone with two doses of the blocker. That's the first stage. As you know, even in studies with hundreds of patients in them, as we've of course seen, we have as much experience as anybody alone and with our collaborators in doing these large studies, there can be a lot of variability in letters gained. So we design the study to include a second stage as well that actually shows the effect of adding on therapy on top within the same groups. That we predict to be a more powerful way of confirming if there are added benefits of the PDGF therapy. So we will have the firs type of comparison, which we consider perhaps to be slightly less powerful in the timeframe that I just described, and then we will also be getting the second stage of data. So depending on how strong the first set of data is, we will either be able to make a decision at that point or we'll be awaiting the results from the second stage to help us and make that decision.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.: I would just add in terms of helping you think about it, for us, since this is a single injection of the two antibodies by the physician, that we don't have to have a gigantic benefit. We just have to have something that's clearly beneficial because the hurdle for us to move forward isn't that great because there's no additional burden on patients having to take an additional injection.
Michael S. Aberman, M.D.: Great. Next question.
Cameron Bradshaw: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas from Citigroup.
Robyn Karnauskas: Hi, guys. Thank you. So you mentioned that access is opening up a little bit for the PCSK9s. Can you talk a little bit about what percentage of the payers had higher restrictions initially this year? And then how did that change? What percentage of people are not requiring prior auth or reduced the requirements for filling out forms, et cetera? And then going to that, what do you think the trigger point was for doing that? And what are the timing for these events? Is it third quarter? What triggers these things and how do we think about that going forward? Thanks.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.: Bob?
Robert E. Landry: So there have been some payers that, based upon the FDA decision not approve ezetimibe based upon their OUTCOMES data that have said since ezetimibe does not have an FDA indication for the prevention of cardiovascular outcomes, that on their own or at the advice of some of their physician medical directors, they've removed the ezetimibe step edit. And that has happened in a few plans already.
George D. Yancopoulos: With regards to the prior authorization paperwork, some of the payers had prior authorizations that required tens or almost up to 40 questions. It became very tedious for the physicians. So some of the plans have begun to change their prior authorization to be simpler and, again, that is in place in a few payers now. I think the real driver that's going to change things is going to be when we get the OUTCOMES data for the product.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.: Thanks Bob. It's Len. Just to amplify on that, it seems to me there are three ways, three important factors you can consider. Assuming that we have a relatively high satisfaction rate, that patients get on the drug, get their cholesterol lowered and tolerate the drug, this is not like the hepatitis C market. Those should be long-term patients so we begin to accumulate them as opposed to constantly having to find to replace as you would, let's say, in a hep C environment. Secondly, as Bob said, the cardiologists are not like the rheumatologists where they have people in their office who are very experienced in dealing with these prior authorizations and paperwork, and I think that they are getting more efficient at it. They are somewhat frustrated by it for sure, and some of them are giving up. Some say, well, I'll wait for outcomes before I got to the mat with fights and things like that. But I do believe that the experience of the doctors in picking the patients that they know, each PBM for each patient or each payer, if you will, they are getting better at knowing how to get this done as they get more experience. And then of course finally, as George mentioned, we hope that the OUTCOMES data later this year will change the dynamic out there in terms of the feeling, the compelling need to go on these products if we show an OUTCOMES benefit. Next question?
Operator: Our following question comes from Ronny Gal from Bernstein.
Ronny Gal: One second.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.: Do we have a question today?
Ronny Gal: Yep, right here. Okay, sorry. Actually, never mind.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.: Okay.
Michael S. Aberman, M.D.: Okay. Next question.
Operator: Our following question comes from Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Ying Huang: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just one more on PDGF. So if you look at Fovista plus the Lucentis, it seems that there's a four letter difference. Can you help us frame the expectations for your coformulated EYLEA plus PDGF antibody? I know you're comparing to EYLEA of course, so does that four letter apply in this case? And what are you expecting from the outcome? Thanks.
George D. Yancopoulos: Well, we consider it very hard to interpret these sort of existing studies because, as I said, we've actually seen with larger studies when you actually repeat the study, four letter differences easily go away. So, we really consider this a very early field and based on a lot of the science, it's really very, very hard to predict what, if any, benefit will be seen here. We do think that our unique two-stage design will end up giving us probably the best data and most convincing perspective on whether there is an added benefit or not. And as Len pointed out, the fact that if there is an added benefit, we'll be able to do it with a single injection and assuming appropriate safety, we'll make it easier to deliver that benefit to patients with this approach. And remember, our approach here, we're combining two very similar antibody-like drugs into a single coformulated injection as opposed to giving two very different types of drugs with separate injections.
Michael S. Aberman, M.D.: Great. Next question.
Operator: Our following question comes from Geoffrey Porges from Leerink.
Geoffrey C. Porges: Thanks very much for taking the question. Just on dupilumab. George, could you just comment first on the conjunctivitis. Is that signal real? Are you seeing it in the other studies, for example, in asthma or esophagitis? And then related to that, could you just talk a little about the launch outlook? What are the parallels or differences to the PRALUENT experience and how might you get payers to let some patients through in this case?
George D. Yancopoulos: Okay. Well. The first part is very interesting in terms of the conjunctivitis. We have consistently seen it in our atopic dermatitis studies. We have not seen it in our asthma studies. As you know, there's differences for examples in the way topical steroids are used in the populations and so forth. And we have various ideas about why this may be the case. That said, even though it seems specific to the way the drug is being used in this particular patient population and perhaps with either the use or actually the less use of topical steroids in the treated patients. The comforting thing is that these patients do have, as we pointed out in the call, they do have already a lot of history of conjunctivitis. So this is not really something brand new to the patients. And the conjunctivitis that is seen here on dupilumab seems to be of mild to moderate severity and is limited. Most cases actually resolve during treatment and very few, if any cases, actually lead to discontinuation. So it seems as if the benefit risk is really maintained in the face of this. That said, also in terms of the second part of your question about dupilumab, we think it's a very different situation compared to PRALUENT. I mean, there is a huge unmet need here. Patients are really suffering from ongoing symptomatology and the data actually shows that this symptomatology is actually markedly improved with the dupilumab treatment. So that it seems to us that there's going to be a lot of patients who really are – and we already know – who are going to so positively impacted in their life that they're going to be demanding this drug. And it seems to us that these patients will deserve to have this first systemic therapy that can really make a difference in their lives. Let me remind you that this is – we're talking about the most moderate to severe class of the patients here which are more than 1 million patients in the United States alone, and these patients really have very few other alternatives. And as you see with our data in CHRONOS where we treat on top of topical steroids, the standard of care, very few, only about 10% of the patients or so, become clear or almost clear with topical steroids as opposed to about 40% on the drug. And there's not only, of course, the cosmetic effects of having these skin lesions and so forth and the associated infections and so forth that you get, but there's an enormous amount of itch which drives a lot of behavioral problem and so forth. There's associated depressive and psychological symptomatology here and so forth. And we've actually shown that much of this is actually impacted in our studies. So we think this can be a very important drug for this population of patients and we think that there's going to be a very important opportunity to make a lot of difference in a lot of people's lives, which is what should count in this business. But beyond that, I think that we also have to remember that dupilumab is really a franchise onto itself. The data really suggests that we have hit upon here with blocking both interleukin-4 and interleukin-13, the critical drivers of allergic disease in general. We're hoping ODDYSEY to extend the findings from our first pivotal study in asthma by confirming them with the second pivotal study, and we will also be continuing to study in other allergic diseases, whereas you've already seen we already have some positive data in other allergic diseases in early stage studies as well. So this can benefit not only the allergic and atopic diseases of atopic dermatitis, but we hope to be able to have studies that confirm it to additional allergic diseases as well.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.: I just wanted to add one thing, Jeff. In terms of about the difference between PRALUENT, just to re-emphasize what George already said, which is that most people don't like to think of themselves as sick and they don't like to have to take a cholesterol lowering drug. Oh, I'll fix it with diet or I'll take my statin or what have you. But patients with atopic dermatitis really suffer. It's really made its way into pop culture. There's a new series on HBO – I don't know if any of you have seen it – called The Night Of and the actor, John Turturro, portrays this lawyer who suffers terribly from atopic dermatitis. He has to wear sandals. He goes to a group to discuss all this and it really has a terrible impact on this life. And this, I don't think this is just a TV portrayal. I think this is what we see, that people really suffer from this disease. I think one last point to just add as well is that unlike most other biologics that are immunomodulators where you see in general whether it's the TNFs or a variety of other classes you generally see a doubling of the serious infection risk rate. This appears to be more of an immunomodulator that is correcting an immune deviation. And actually as we reported and as we summarized during this call, there is no increase in infections and in serious infections here. So once again this is an important option that's being offered to the patients in contrast to other alternatives which are essentially immunosuppressing. And to have this sort of efficacy with a non-immunosuppressing agent I think is also offering a lot of hope to patients.
Michael S. Aberman, M.D.: Okay. Next question.
Operator: Following question comes from Chris Raymond from Raymond James.
Christopher Raymond: Ah, hey, thanks. Yeah, so just as another question here, I guess, on dupilumab in atopic dermatitis. So maybe for Bob if possible. So I'd imagine your marketing prep's pretty underway now with the BLA submitted. And I know we know the vast majority of intervention here is topical corticosteroids. But I'm just curious, what has your work uncovered in terms of the use of other biologics off-label and physician satisfaction with these agents? And maybe can you talk about how you're thinking about this as you formulate your launch plans? Thanks.
Robert J. Terifay: Sure. So as George pointed out, there are approximately 1.6 million patients in the United States who are uncontrolled on topical therapies who have moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. A very small proportion of those patients have received other therapies, immunosuppressant agents, generally not biologics but things like cyclosporine and methotrexate. The challenge with those therapies is you can't use them long term. They've got some toxicities that really interfere with the patient's long-term use of the therapy and thus, their symptoms will come back, their itch will come back and their quality of life will decrease. So there is a huge opportunity for dupilumab in these uncontrolled moderate to severe patients. There's the pent up demand among patients and physicians to get the patients on therapy and to improve their lives.
George D. Yancopoulos: And to add to that, in terms of biologics, we do not believe that there's any convincing evidence with any available approved biologics that show efficacy in this disease setting. And as you know, there's also no other late-stage biologics that are promising in this area. So this really has a chance to really be providing something to patients that don't really have any other alternatives at this point.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.: I would add also, to make sure you think about these other diseases as other significant opportunities. There's been a desire to have a drug, like a biologic, that could effect, in asthma, for example, that could treat all patients. That could have an effect both on FEV1 and on exacerbations. And no such drug has been forthcoming as yet, and we're excited that our first pivotal trial demonstrated in the broad population affect both on FEV1 and on exacerbation. So hopefully if we can confirm that in our trial that's just about to be completed in enrollment, think ahead about a year for the trial, and then the data, we could be onto something, a whole new opportunity, which people really are looking for. Something that can treat all the patients, and that can treat both the FEV1 and the exacerbations.
George D. Yancopoulos: Right. As Len briefly touched upon, a very important feature that of course we're hoping to confirm in our second pivotal study is this point about the broad population. I mean, so far biologics have been limited to the so called, the more allergic or eosinophilic type patients, and is the only places where substantial efficacy has been noted. And it's, as Len said, mostly only with exacerbations and not on lung function. So if we can confirm the results of the first pivotal, it could confirm another major hope for patients who really need these types of therapies.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.: And the last point on that, which I know George likes to make when he speaks about this at meetings, is that we can't forget the fact that people who have asthma frequently have atopic dermatitis and people who have atopic dermatitis frequently have asthma. These are overlapping syndromes because they are scientifically related, I should say pathophysiologically related, we think, through the IL-4/IL13 pathway. So, next question?
Michael S. Aberman, M.D.: Next question.
Operator: Next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI.
John Scotti: Hey, good morning. It's John Scotti in for Mark. Maybe I'll just ask a quick one on the Adicet collaboration. Could you just elaborate a little bit more on the technology behind off the shelf therapies there? And I guess, how does that approach differ from those that are already in development, such as Cellectis? And then I guess maybe, when could we see some of those assets entering the clinic?
George D. Yancopoulos: Well, I think...
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.: Wait, before you answer that George, I just wanted to make one comment that is, if I went to Broadway and had so many stand-in actors, I would be mortified.
George D. Yancopoulos: Okay. I think and important point to make is, we really believe in people and we believe in synergies. And we've had long-standing interests to be working with Aya Jakobovits who's really leading Adicet. And obviously, she's been in areas that we've been in. We have enormous respect for her, her capabilities. And so we really feel that we can work well together with her and her team. And number two is the synergies with our existing programs. This is why we make these sorts of deals. We believe that we have a lot of potential tools and starting points for making the sorts of targeting reagents that would be introduced into these cell therapies using our existing technologies such as our VelocImmune and our Veloci-Next technologies which really, nobody else in this field has access to right now. So we're hoping that we put together our unique capabilities that nobody else in the cell therapy space has together with a pioneer and a leader in this area such as Aya Jakobovits and her team that we could really do special things. And I think at this point, that's what we want to say about this collaboration.
Michael S. Aberman, M.D.: Great. Next question?
Operator: Following question comes from Adnan Butt from RBC Capital.
Adnan Shaukat Butt: Hey, thanks folks. Let me ask a 10-Q question. It lists PD1 as embarking on potentially pivotal studies over the next year. Are there unique indications or combinations that you have selected already? Any details there please?
George D. Yancopoulos: Yeah. So it's already been publicly disclosed that we're already in a potentially registration study in a unique indication that we think has a lot of promise for various reasons and where we've already seen early clinical activity in our earlier studies which is cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. And so that is, for example, one setting. We've also identified additional settings. That has been publicly disclosed. We've also identified additional settings that we'll be going into, we hope both potentially with it as a monotherapy but also with new combinations.
Michael S. Aberman, M.D.: Great. And we have time for one last question.
Operator: Our final question comes from Alethia Young from Credit Suisse. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Hey guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just going back to your prepared remarks, I was just wondering with EYLEA, like is it something that you're kind of starting to experience just as – like what are the dynamics for why like the financial incentives that manufacturers were providing are increasing or groups purchasing? Why did you specifically kind of bring that to our attention this quarter? Thanks.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.: Well I think that, it's Bob, it's highlighting to you what's going on in the marketplace. And we're seeing more of these things than we have in years past. It's not been any drastic change but it's just sort to get in front of these things, we monitor them and we have responses prepared should they be necessary. Bob, want to add anything?
Robert J. Terifay: No. It's a dynamic in the marketplace that impacts the growth of EYLEA and we just wanted to discuss it.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.: Okay.
Michael S. Aberman, M.D.: Great. Well, that concludes today's call. I want to thank everyone for joining. As we said, myself, Bob Landry and the IR team will be available for follow-up questions. If you have any, please e-mail us or give us a call. Operator?
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2016 Q1  (2016-05-05 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Q1 2016 Earnings Conference Call. My name is John and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note, the conference is being recorded. And I will now turn the call over to Dr. Michael Aberman.
Michael S. Aberman: Thank you, operator. And good morning and welcome to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals First Quarter 2016 Conference Call. An archive of this webcast will be available on our website under Events and Presentations for 30 days. Joining me on the call today are: Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; George Yancopoulos, Founding Scientist, President of Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer; Bob Terifay, Executive Vice President, Commercial; and Bob Landry, Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A. I would also like to remind you that remarks made on this call include forward-looking statements about Regeneron. Such statements may include, but are not limited to, those related to Regeneron and its products and businesses, sales and expense forecasts, financial forecasts, development programs, collaborations, finances, regulatory matters, intellectual property and competition.

Once our call concludes, Bob Landry and the IR team will be available to answer further questions. With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Thank you, Michael. A very good morning to everyone who has joined us on the call and webcast today. The first quarter of 2016 was busy and we have a lot to share with you today. Our strategy remains, as always, to focus our unique capabilities in drug discovery and development on bringing important new medicines to patients in need. George will provide you with some of the recent exciting progress we have made in that regard. From a high-level perspective, we had positive data readouts from three Phase 3 programs: Praluent for lowering the LDL cholesterol in the apheresis setting, sarilumab in rheumatoid arthritis, and dupilumab in atopic dermatitis. We also reported positive data from a Phase 2/3 study in osteoarthritis for fasinumab, our NGF antibody for pain. And we continue to make good progress with our earlier-stage assets and discovery efforts. Turning to our marketed products, EYLEA has continued to deliver solid growth and we are able to increase our guidance for the year. Praluent's launch is still ongoing and has obviously faced a difficult reimbursement environment. While we fully understand payers' efforts to control costs, we do have serious concerns that appropriate patients are having undue difficulty getting approval for Praluent. We continue to be optimistic over the long term that Praluent will provide an important cholesterol-lowering option to many patients. Bob Terifay will provide more detail on EYLEA and Praluent. Following that, Bob Landry will provide more detail on financial results for the first quarter of 2016, as well as updated guidance. Finally, we are approaching the potential approval and launch of two new products, sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, is under review with the FDA; dupilumab is being developed for a number of indications and we are targeting completion of our rolling BLA submission from moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in the third quarter of 2016. With that, let me turn the call over to George.
George D. Yancopoulos: Thank you, Len. And a very good morning to everyone who has joined us today. Let me begin with an update on EYLEA. In addition to the Phase 2 co-formulated combinations of EYLEA with rinucumab, an antibody to the PDGF receptor, and nesvacumab, an antibody to Angiopoietin-2, we have also commenced PANORAMA, a Phase 3 study of EYLEA in non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy in patients without diabetic macular edema, or DME, which will evaluate whether EYLEA can improve their retinopathy. Additionally, the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network, or the DRCR, initiated a related clinical study called Protocol W to evaluate the potential of anti-VEGF therapy in preventing worsening of severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. This study will explore every 16-week dosing of EYLEA, which is the only anti-VEGF treatment being investigated in this study. In February, we received two new results from Protocol T, a government-sponsored study in patients with DME comparing the safety and efficacy of EYLEA versus Lucentis and Avastin. The primary efficacy endpoint for that study was at one year, which showed significantly better vision gained with EYLEA than either with Lucentis or Avastin. The second year of the study was not designed to rigorously compare the anti-VEGF agents, as the second year results were increasingly confounded by variable dosing frequency as well as additional or adjunctive therapy, such as laser. Along these lines, it is important to point there was a greater number of injections and substantially more use of laser associated with Avastin treatment than the overall population. Despite this, when compared with Avastin, EYLEA demonstrated a statistically significant five-letter gain, or an entire line of vision, in patients with poor vision at baseline. At two years, the rates of most ocular adverse events were similar across the three study groups. There was, however, statistically significant lower rate of arterial thromboembolic events, including non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction and vascular death in the EYLEA group compared with the ranibizumab group. Our Praluent launch is underway and Bob Terifay will provide further details on the commercial front. Our 18,000 patient ODYSSEY outcome study is ongoing. The Data Monitoring Committee for this study has completed the first interim analysis when 50% of the total events had accrued based on unblinded study data. In addition to reviewing the safety data, the DMC performed a futility assessment and recommended the study continue with no changes. We remain blinded to the actual result of this analysis and the study is ongoing. A second interim analysis for futility as well as overwhelming efficacy could potentially occur in the second half of 2016, when 75% of the targeted primary events have occurred. In March we reported positive data from the Phase 3 ODYSSEY ESCAPE study in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia who required chronic weekly or bi-weekly apheresis. Apheresis is an invasive, expensive and time-consuming therapy given to the patients with the highest cholesterol levels and the greatest need. Our studies show that Praluent reduced the need for apheresis by 75% compared to placebo and 63% of Praluent patients no longer required apheresis compared to 0% of the patients in the placebo arm. Praluent is the only PCSK9 inhibitor that has been studied in this apheresis setting, which represents some of the most severe hypercholesterolemic patients. The adverse events that occurred more frequently in the Praluent-treated patients were injection site reactions and myalgia. We expect our Supplemental BLA for the once-monthly dosing regimen of Praluent to be filed in the second quarter, which, if approved, will expand our dosing flexibility options. Turning now to our late-stage pipeline, where we've had some very positive news. I'd like to start with sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody which is under review by the FDA for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. In March, we announced positive data from the Phase 3 MONARCH study of sarilumab versus HUMIRA, which demonstrated that sarilumab was superior to HUMIRA in the monotherapy setting in improving signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis at 24 weeks. This was the first head-to-head study in the monotherapy study using a subcutaneously administered IL-6 inhibitor. The use of IL-6 inhibition in the monotherapy setting has been growing and these data provide us with a competitive product profile. Data from the MONARCH study will be included in our European submission, which is expected mid-year 2016. Turning now to dupilumab, our IL-4/13 blocking antibody, where we recently announced positive top-line data from the SOLO 1 and SOLO 2 monotherapy Phase 3 studies in adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. These were the first Phase 3 studies of a systematic therapy to demonstrate a significant improvement in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis and confirm the positive data we had seen in our Phase 2b study. Overall, the studies demonstrated significant improvements in measures of disease severity, skin clearing, itching, quality of life and mental health. We expect to present detailed data from the SOLO studies in an upcoming medical conference. We continue to expect top-line data from the Phase 3 CHRONOS study, which explores dupilumab in combination with topical corticosteroids, in the second quarter of 2016. We expect to complete the rolling BLA submission for dupilumab in atopic dermatitis in the third quarter of 2016. We remind you that dupilumab has received Breakthrough Designation from the FDA for this indication in adults. In the first quarter of 2016, we initiated LIBERTY AD CAFÉ, a Phase 3 study of dupilumab to support our European submission. This study investigates dupilumab with concomitant topical corticosteroids in adult patients with atopic dermatitis who are not adequately controlled with or intolerant to or ineligible for systemic cyclosporine A treatment. In addition to the studies in the adult setting, we also plan to initiate a Phase 3 study in the atopic dermatitis indication in the pediatric population once we have data from the ongoing Phase 2 pediatric study that is now fully enrolled. We expect these Phase 2 data in the second half of the year. We're also investigating dupilumab in other indications, including asthma, where we are currently enrolling our 1,700-patient pivotal study. We're also advancing clinical development in indications, such as nasal polyps and eosinophilic esophagitis. For fasinumab, our NGF antibody, earlier this week we announced positive data from our Phase 2/3 study in osteoarthritis, which provides us with our first safety and efficacy data with our subcutaneous dosing regimen. This was the first completed study using an antibody to NGF that performed extensive imaging of knee, hip and shoulder joints at screening and throughout the trial. Interestingly, we found that subchondral insufficiency fracturing and even osteonecrosis were present in this population at screening. Further, our findings in patients following fasinumab treatment are consistent with prior data, suggesting that there may not be a substantial increase in rapidly progressing osteoarthritis when an NGF antibody is used in the monotherapy setting. That said, this is a relatively small trial and we look forward to data from the much larger clinical studies that are underway. We have also seen some exciting developments in our earlier-stage programs. I'd like to spend a few minutes on two areas, our efforts in genetics and our recent collaboration in the arena of gene editing. In March, we published a paper in The New England Journal of Medicine based on research that was conducted at the Regeneron Genetics Center, or the RGC. The publication showed that inactivating mutations in a gene called Angiopoietin-like 4 were associated with a significantly reduced risk of coronary artery disease in humans. This is a great example that demonstrates how our efforts in the area of precision medicine can link genetic mutation information with real-world health outcomes to make actionable discoveries. Many of the findings from the RGC are already being used to inform Regeneron's robust and integrated R&D programs and give us the ability to incorporate large-scale sequencing into our discovery and pipeline approaches. It also demonstrates the advantages of our unique combination of technologies. Using our proprietary VelociGene technology, we developed animal models that corroborated the human genetics finding and we were able to use our VelociGene platform to create a fully human monoclonal antibody inhibitor of ANGPTL4 that reduced triglyceride levels in mice and non-human primates. We are also advancing a Phase 2 program of Regeneron 1500, an antibody to ANGPTL3. ANGPTL3 is thought to play a central role of lipoprotein metabolism and there are genetic data that show that patients with homozygous inactivating mutations of this gene report greater than 50% lower levels of LDL, HDL and triglycerides. Initial data from a small study in homozygous patients will be presented at the upcoming Annual Meeting of the National Lipid Association. We recently entered into collaboration with Intellia Therapeutics with the aim of advancing CRISPR/Cas gene-editing technology into in vivo therapeutic development. This was a logical fit for us, given our long-standing expertise on genetic engineering combined with our industry-leading human genetics research with the RGC, which is already identifying important genetic targets. We believe that combining these capabilities with Intellia's technology holds real promise for serious diseases that have been historically difficult to address and expands our ability to help patients where antibody-based therapies may not be the optimal approach. We continue to make progress in immuno-oncology. REGENERON 2810, our PD-1 antibody program, has entered a Phase 2 potentially registrational study in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. We'll be presenting some preliminary Phase I data at the upcoming Annual ASCO Conference. With that, I would like to turn over the call to Bob Terifay.
Robert J. Terifay: Thank you, George. And good morning, everyone. During the first quarter of 2016, we continued to see strong sales growth for EYLEA, or aflibercept injection, both in the United States and the rest of the world. We've made substantial progress in securing access and reimbursement for Praluent, or alirocumab, among U.S. payers. In addition, the European launch for Praluent continues to progress. We also are now preparing for the potential U.S. launches of sarilumab and dupilumab over the next 12 months to 15 months. Starting with EYLEA. First quarter U.S. net sales grew 44% year-over-year. Net U.S. EYLEA sales for the first quarter was $781 million. Net ex-U.S. EYLEA sales in the first quarter were $419 million, which represents 44% growth year-over-year on a reported basis. We continue to see quarter-over-quarter increases in our U.S. market share leadership for EYLEA in the FDA-approved anti-VEGF market, both in terms of dollar sales as well as injections as reported by 207 retinal specialists in our quarterly Market Research Survey. We're encouraged about future growth opportunities for EYLEA based upon the recently reported two-year results of the independently conducted Protocol T comparative study of EYLEA versus ranibizumab versus bevacizumab in patients with diabetic macular edema. However, I should point out that we are closely monitoring pressures on EYLEA sales as the year progresses. There are currently a series of proposals for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services regarding physician reimbursement for physician-administered Medicare Part B buy and bill drugs, which could lead towards physicians favoring the use of off-label repackaged bevacizumab, or in large volume retinal practices, ranibizumab, due to the provision of direct-to-physician financial incentives from the manufacturer. Regeneron believes that EYLEA is clearly differentiated from both bevacizumab and ranibizumab. Physicians and patients should not be denied access to any drug therapy that is deemed appropriate. Therefore, we and scores of other manufactures, patient advocacy groups and industry associations will or have already submitted objections to CMS and Congress recommending the physician's choice be preserved and alternative schemas to reduce healthcare costs should be explored. Turning now to Praluent. As reported by Sanofi, net sales in the first quarter were $13 million, which understates the actual physician and patient demand. As we reminded you over the last several quarters, we anticipated that it will take some time for commercial and government payers to conduct formulary reviews, make reimbursement coverage decisions and begin to process patient claims. I'm pleased to tell you that, as of April 1, approximately 74% of commercially insured lives and 91% of Medicare-insured lives have access to Praluent. We've recently seen an improvement in the number of prescriptions that are successfully being filled. Highlighting our improved coverage as well as our share of voice among healthcare professionals, the most recent nationally syndicated Prescription Audit for the week ended April 22, 2016 indicates that Praluent captured approximately 50% of new prescriptions in the class. Unfortunately, due to unprecedented strict management utilization management criteria and very tedious prior authorization paperwork and documentation that the pharmacy benefits managers and health plans have put in place, many patients who are eligible for treatment with a PCSK-9 inhibitor have not had their prescription filled. Frustrated by this process, healthcare professionals are limiting their prescriptions to the sickest of patients and prescription volume for the PCSK-9 inhibitor class is limited. We're focusing our efforts improving the prescription process through the payers and specialty pharmacies. We're also working with physician's offices to ensure the prescription process is better understood on a payer-by-payer basis. Over the last several weeks, we've seen two payers loosen the utilization management criteria, removing the requirement for prior ezetimibe therapy. ODYSSEY OUTCOMES data, if positive, will be a key driver in shaping the future success of Praluent. Outside of the United States, Praluent was approved in the EU in September of 2015, with product now available in several countries. Reimbursement discussions are currently underway with several governments across Europe. Outside the United States it remains a difficult reimbursement market, with some countries awaiting OUTCOMES data. We've submitted a BLA to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for sarilumab, our interleukin-6 receptor inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis, and have been granted a PDUFA date of October 30, 2016. We will be co-promoting sarilumab with Sanofi-Genzyme in the United States and are actively recruiting our field-based team. Co-promotion decisions for other countries will be made over time. We're excited about the potential U.S. launch for sarilumab. Given the central role of interleukin-6 in the inflammation contributing to the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and, more importantly, disabling joint destruction, we believe that IL-6 inhibitors should be used early following tumor necrosis factor, or TNF, inhibitor failure. Recently issued U.S. and European guidelines support the use for IL-6 inhibitor class in earlier lines of treatments, and this is particularly relevant for those patients who can not take combination therapies with methotrexate. With multiple players competing in the anti-IL-6 marketplace, this should contribute to improved physician awareness and understanding of the inadequacy of TNF inhibitor cycling and the need for early IL-6 inhibitor treatment. Subcutaneously administered sarilumab has strong clinical data in terms of the improved signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and prevention of bone damage in methotrexate inadequate responders. Similar improvements in the signs and symptoms of RA had been reported in TNF inhibitor inadequate responder population. We continue to prepare for the potential U.S. launch of dupilumab, our IL-4 and IL-13 inhibitor, which we expect in 2017. There are approximately 1.6 million patients with inadequately controlled moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in the United States. We'll be co-promoting dupilumab in the United States. Co-promotion decisions for other countries will be made at a later date. With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Landry.
Robert E. Landry: Thanks, Bob, and good morning to everyone who has joined us today. In the first quarter of 2016, non-GAAP net income per diluted share decreased 11% to $2.57 versus first quarter of 2015 and non-GAAP net income of $293 million decreased 13% versus first quarter of 2015. Regeneron's 2016 non-GAAP net income primarily excludes non-cash share-based compensation expense and includes an adjustment for income taxes. A full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is set forth in our earnings release. Total revenues in the first quarter of 2016 were $1.2 billion, which represented year-over-year growth of 38% over the first quarter of 2015. Net product sales were $784 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $545 million in the first quarter of 2015. EYLEA net product sales in the United States were $781 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $541 million in the first quarter of 2015, which represents an increase of 44%. Sequential quarter-over-quarter growth was an increase of 5%. During the first quarter of 2016, EYLEA experienced a slight decrease in U.S. distributor inventory levels as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, but continues to be within our normal one-week to two-week targeted range. As Len mentioned, we are updating our full-year 2016 U.S. EYLEA guidance to be year-over-year growth of between 20% and 25% from the previously provided guidance of approximately 20% growth. Ex-U.S. EYLEA sales were $419 million in the first quarter of 2016 as compared as to $292 million in the first quarter of 2015, representing 44% increase on a reported basis. On an operational basis or constant currency basis, sales increased approximately 48%. Product revenue from ex-U.S. EYLEA sales is recorded by our collaborator, Bayer. In the first quarter of 2016, Regeneron recognized $146 million from our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. Total Bayer collaboration revenue for the first quarter of 2016 was $180 million. I'd also like to take this moment to highlight our recently expanded collaboration with Bayer following our agreement to jointly develop the co-formulation of our antibody to Ang2 in EYLEA. In connection with this agreement, Bayer made a $50 million upfront payment to us, which was a receivable at March 31, 2016. And Regeneron has the potential to earn up to $80 million in development milestones. The $50 million upfront payment has been deferred and will be recognized over the estimated performance period. Similar to our EYLEA agreement, Regeneron has exclusive commercial rights within the U.S. and will retain all of the profits from any U.S. sales. Finally, a reminder for the EYLEA franchise. The second quarter of 2016 will be the final quarter in which we incur the royalty expense in connection with our agreement with Genentech related to global EYLEA sales. In fact, I'm pleased to announce that this royalty will officially end in two more days. Turning now to our Sanofi collaboration. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $220 million for the first quarter of 2016. The Sanofi collaboration revenue line primarily consists of reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred R&D expenses, reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses and our share of profits or losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies. In the first quarter of 2016, our share of the collaboration's losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies, primarily Praluent, was $99 million, which can be found in Table 4 of our earnings release. Netted within the collaboration losses were the global sales of Praluent as recognized by our collaborator, Sanofi, of $13 million for the first quarter 2016. Turning now to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expense was $392 million for the first quarter. Our unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as total GAAP R&D expense less R&D reimbursements from our collaborators and R&D non-cash share-based compensation expense, was $164 million for the first three months of 2016. Our press release includes all the information that's required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense. For 2016, we'd like to reiterate our previously provided guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to be in the range of $875 million to $950 million. Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $230 million for the first quarter 2016. We continue to expect non-GAAP SG&A expense in 2016 to be in the range of $925 million and $1 billion. Before I move on from our operating expenses, I'd like to take a moment to discuss the new guidance component we announced this morning, Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses, which represents reimbursement of internal and external costs in connection with preparing to commercialize or commercializing, as applicable, Praluent and sarilumab and, effective in the first quarter of 2016, dupilumab. This is a line item found within Sanofi Collaboration Revenue and is referenced in Table 4 of our press release. Going forward, we believe that providing guidance for this number will help in modeling the Sanofi Collaboration Revenue line item. For the first quarter of 2016, the reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses was $73 million and we expect this expense in 2016 to be in the range of $320 million and $370 million. Turning now to our non-GAAP tax adjustment. Cash tax as a percentage of non-GAAP pre-tax net income for this quarter continues to be lower than our GAAP effective tax rate primarily due to the tax impact of non-cash share-based compensation. On a non-GAAP basis, cash tax as a percentage of non-GAAP pre-tax net income for the first quarter of 2016 was approximately 38%. For 2016, our guidance for cash tax as a percentage of non-GAAP pre-tax income remains at 35% to 45%. As previously reported, this includes a one-time tax of approximately $222 million related to the Sanofi immuno-oncology agreement. I'd also like to reiterate that the non-GAAP tax impact of the immuno-oncology upfront payment will be spread equally throughout 2016. Our capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2016 were $104 million. Given our latest review of capital expenditures, we are tightening and lowering our full-year 2016 capital expenditures guidance to a range of $550 million to $625 million from $580 million to $680 million. These expenditures continue to build on our manufacturing expansions in 2015, which include expanding our facilities in Rensselaer, New York and Limerick, Ireland, as well as the continued expansion of our Tarrytown, New York headquarters. We ended the first quarter of 2016 with cash and marketable securities of $1.4 billion. As we've previously mentioned, we have been opportunistically entering into agreements to reduce the number of our outstanding warrants that we issued in 2011 in connection with our convertible debt. In the first quarter of 2016, we paid $242 million to reduce these outstanding warrants. Before I conclude my remarks, I would briefly like to highlight certain financial components of the recent collaboration with Intellia Therapeutics. The April 2016 agreement grants Regeneron access to Intellia's CRISPR technology platform, as well as the right to discover and develop up to 10 targets on an exclusive basis over the course of the six-year agreement. In return, we paid a $75 million upfront payment to Intellia, which we anticipate recording as R&D expense in the second quarter of 2016, but plan to exclude from non-GAAP net income. The agreement also requires Regeneron to purchase up to $50 million of Intellia's shares contingent upon Intellia consummating its initial public offering. With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Michael.
Michael S. Aberman: Thanks, Bob. Operator, at this time, we will open up the call for our Q&A period.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question is from Geoffrey Porges from Leerink Partners.
Geoffrey C. Porges: Thank you very much and appreciate the chance to ask a question, but also the 10-Q being filed today is very helpful with all the detail. I suppose a couple of questions. George, first, on dupilumab. Now you have the first Phase 3 readout. What incrementally have you learned from that in terms of the profile of dupilumab and how does that alter what you might focus on and potentially invest in for that molecule in the future? And then, secondly, just on Medicare Part B. You alluded to that and called it out in your risks and in the Q. What are you learning in the comment period and will you be submitting comments or are you aware of other comments? And do you think there's any chance that this is going to be modified or altered in schedule or scope? Thank you.
George D. Yancopoulos: All right. Well, this is George. I'll take the dupilumab question. I guess the most important thing that we learned from the two Phase 3 studies in atopic dermatitis was, number one, that we confirmed the impressive efficacy and the important benefit to patients in essentially every single efficacy readout that we explored. So, obviously, that's very gratifying and comforting when one actually sees data that is as promising as your earlier data and suggests it can really make an important difference to moderate to severe patients who really need new therapies to attack their disease. In addition, the safety profile was also very comforting. And we report extensively on it and it really does suggest that it's going to have a very important benefit/risk profile for patients. I think that basically for atopic dermatitis, it really means that it's all green lights and all speed ahead and that we're really excited that we could be really bringing forward, as the FDA has designated, a Breakthrough Therapy for these patients that need it. As you know, we also have a pivotal study in asthma that's already been read out and we're in the midst of our first Phase 3, which is now our second confirmatory study, in that indication as well. So dupilumab is a very, very exciting program. And as I already told you about today, I told you that in terms of the atopic dermatitis population, we're also moving to the pediatric population there as well, which is also an important unmet need area. Bob?
Robert J. Terifay: In terms of the Part B, we fully understand that healthcare costs need to be appropriately controlled in this country. However, the approach that has been proposed by Medicare Part B would limit options for physicians and patients to give appropriate therapies to patients who need them. For example, in the case of the retinal space, you could lead to physicians being required simply by the economics that are in place to force them to use an off-label repackaged bevacizumab, which, at least in the Protocol T trial, was shown in DME not to be as effective as the other therapies. They could be forced to use this for economic reasons. We see that a number of manufacturers as well as a number of Congressmen and patient advocacy groups recognize that you have to preserve physician choice. And so there will be a number of complaints and letters going into Congress, including our own.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yeah, just to add on it, there are literally hundreds of Congressmen who have said that this should not be done. There are others who've said that the unintended consequences that we're concerned about must be managed. The retinal groups, the ophthalmology groups and that's not to mention all of the other interested parties, such as cancer and what have you. So I think many observers, of which we're not experts on, but many observers in Washington would suggest that this seems unlikely. But we're certainly going to do our best on this as well.
Geoffrey C. Porges: Thanks very much.
Michael S. Aberman: And I'm going to remind people to try to keep themselves to one question. I'll let this one slide this time, Geoff.
Operator: And our next question is from Chris Raymond from Raymond James.
Christopher Raymond: Hey, thanks. Yeah, so just one question here. So just on the PD-1, I'm sort of struck by the news that this cutaneous squamous cell trial could be pivotal. Yeah, I know Sanofi broke that news last week, but I was wondering if you could provide a little more color on where this trial fits in with the overall development plan? Just looking at clintrials.gov (sic) [clinicaltrials.gov] (34:44), there's not a ton of detail. And obviously there's a lot of breadth of labeling potential with that type of molecule. If you could maybe talk about where you plan to take this, that'd be great.
George D. Yancopoulos: Well, we are implementing a highly integrated and very comprehensive effort in immunotherapy. And this is obviously a very competitive area and I think that there's a lot of room for people to make inroads here, provide new approaches and new benefits to patients and really make a difference in certain disease settings and just think that we have a very robust and highly integrated and comprehensive effort here, and we intend to hopefully deliver important new approaches to patients.
Christopher Raymond: Thanks.
Michael S. Aberman: Okay, next question?
George D. Yancopoulos: Yep.
Operator: Our next question is from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.
Terence Flynn: Hi. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on all the pipeline progress. So just wondering for dupi, I know it's a little bit early, but as we just think about the launch trajectory...
Leonard S. Schleifer: Taking a shot at dupilumab. I think the fact is obviously we can't answer that directly, Terence. And since we and all of us, everybody has been wrong multiple times, that these things unfold as they unfold. The factors to consider obviously is that you're already obviously seeing the PBMs taking notice of this. I saw this in somebody's report that this is the next big class that they're worried about. There are a lot of patients out there that might fit our label, assuming we get the label. But I'm sure there's going to be utilization management, make sure they've tried their topical steroids or whatever that they really have the right diagnosis, et cetera, et cetera, Now, whether there'll be "warehousing of patients," people lining up to get it, it's just really impossible for us to tell. But I would suspect that this will be one of those launches that will be patient-driven that as people get on the drug, if the results in the real world are anywhere as close to the results we've seen in our Phase 3 trial so far, I'm sure that that patient drive will be tremendous, because this is a terrible disease that people have been suffering with for decades, adults now who have it, without anything at all new to really help them and make a difference. And if you look at, whether you measure this by quality-of-life metrics, the increased risk of suicide, just the terrible burden that this puts on patients, we're optimistic that this drug can make a difference for them. So we're hopeful for a good launch. But how the actual ramp and whether it takes us a while to get it going and what the coverage looks like and all that, just too early to tell. Next question?
Michael S. Aberman: Next question, operator?
Operator: Our next question is from Adnan Butt from RBC Capital Markets.
Unknown Speaker: Hey, good morning. This is Arshad (38:06) on from Adnan. Thank you for the question. Could you please put the fasinumab safety data into context, given that the FDA seems to have already been focused on safety in general?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yeah. Well, maybe I'll make a brief comment and if George has anything to add, obviously he's welcome. Our feeling, as George said in his talk, is that we did something which we think was pretty important, which is we did an extensive and detailed screening of patients with X-rays and MRIs before they were ever exposed to drug. And that demonstrated that some of these things that people were concerned about might be somewhat induced by drug were really fairly prevalent in the population, whether they be insufficiency fractures or whether they be osteonecrosis or so on. So I think that that was important. And I do think that the FDA has come around to thinking that this has to be looked at carefully and that's what we're doing. And the right patients have to be studied and that's also what we're doing. They also have had concerns about whether or not any one of these drugs individually or as a class could have effect on sympathetic nerves and sympathetic nervous system function. We also looked at that pretty well and we'll have more to tell you about that in upcoming meetings. But we didn't see any evidence at all. So that so far things look reasonable, but, I think as George said, it's a small study and we're underpowered to pick up very small increases in some of these things and that's why we're going to study thousands and thousands of patients in our Phase 3 program.
George D. Yancopoulos: Yeah, and to add to that, I think that one of the biggest underlying fears for this class, certainly by outside people, but also by ourselves, was that the very small increase in certain arthropathy events, certain joint pathologies, that were seen particularly in combination with NSAIDs, but also a small increase even in monotherapy, might actually be reflecting a much bigger, somewhat invisible, problem that there was a bigger, destructive process that would then be seen over longer periods in time and so forth. And this is why we did this, as Len said, this extensive imaging of both the index joints but also non-index joints to see whether overall the skeleton was really changing. And as we've already said, the thing that was very gratifying was that, unfortunately for these patients suffering from this important problem, there is already significant skeletal pathology at baseline. These patients have these so-called subchondral insufficiency fractures and you can even see undiagnosed osteonecrosis in these patients and so forth. And these events, both in the index and the non-index joints, were not dramatically increased by treating with NGF. And one fear, for example, was that these asymptomatic subchondral insufficiency fractures may be happening much more frequently with drug and then eventually leading to much higher incidences of events down the line. And so it was very comforting not to see this. That said, there remains, as with any drug and certainly with a drug this active, there will continue to be risks associated with treatment. But one has to balance that with all the benefits that could be provided. Pain is a very serious problem for a lot of people, especially people suffering from osteoarthritis. And the options, obviously, as you know, are quite limiting with no new mechanism of action drugs added to this field for decades. And so the possibility and the opportunity of a new mechanism of action class that might have a different profile and also different risk profile as compared to, for example, opiates and NSAIDs and other drugs with serious risks, we're think can offer important options for patients.
Michael S. Aberman: This is Michael. I just want to make sure I added because, when talking about pain, you really have to keep in the context of really what is an epidemic in the United States in terms of drug opioid abuse and overdose, with quadrupling in the number of opioid deaths in the past number of years. As well as from the CDC website, nearly half a million people died from drug overdoses from 2000 to 2014. Almost 80 Americans die every day from an opioid overdose. So I just think we have to keep into context that having new pain medicines is really important.
George D. Yancopoulos: Yes. Okay, good. Next question?
Michael S. Aberman: Next question?
Operator: Our next question is from Ying Huang from Bank of America.
Ying Huang: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just first on the CMS proposal again. I think you guys mentioned in DME you do have superiority against some of the other medications. But in AMD, I was wondering if you guys can provide your thought on whether it could be classified as so-called therapeutically similar class and, therefore, to be subject to a reference pricing in the second Phase of that demo? And then also on the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trials. I know that trial is 90% powered to show 15% CV risk reduction. Maybe you guys can provide us on whether you think the payers would be excited about that 15% CV risk reduction. Thank you.
Leonard S. Schleifer: So, Ying, which question do you want answered? Because Michael's holding up a sign that says one question, even though he loves you. He said, which one does he want?
Ying Huang: Len, you're the boss.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Not true. Which question, Ying?
Ying Huang: All right. Maybe second. It's probably more important from my perspective.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Okay. Well, I think that the OUTCOMES data, as we saw with ezetimibe, it's not simply a matter of statistical significance. I think what people will be looking for is the robustness and the quality of the dataset, et cetera, et cetera. Certainly we powered the study based on expert input of where they thought that would be, if we saw the result, that would be a meaningful result for patients. But, of course, it's not just one number, it's not just a statistical significance. You want to see how the whole dataset looks like. And I think somebody said about ezetimibe, they have statistical significance, but, if you blinked, you could miss it. And we tried to design a study and set the parameters such that if we saw the result, we could feel confident about it that we were making a difference in these outcomes to patients.
Robert J. Terifay: Ying, I can't leave the EYLEA one hanging out there, I'm sorry. If you...
Ying Huang: I appreciate that.
Robert J. Terifay: ...remember back to the VIEW 1 and VIEW 2 studies, we actually designed studies that compared ourselves to what was the standard of care branded agent, which was ranibizumab monthly. And we studied EYLEA both monthly as well as every eight weeks. And what we saw is very similar results with the EYLEA every eight-week dosing to the Lucentis every four-week dosing. This is a major advantage to elderly patients who can't get into the physician's office on a regular basis. And so they are not therapeutically equivalent; EYLEA has a longer durability of effect. I would also point out there are data in a subset of patients in the VIEW studies that indicates that there are patients who are more refractory to anti-VEGF therapy, especially those who've received prior anti-VEGF therapy who may need more anti-VEGF treatment. And what we're seeing in those patients, we're able to dry them up better with EYLEA than with Lucentis.
George D. Yancopoulos: This is George, I also have to make a few comments here. And I think really Bob touched on an important point, that our drug showed compared to the, at the time, optimum standard of care that doubling the interval could produce at least as good results from the terms of visual acuity, but also even better results in terms of controlling vascular leak and retinal swelling and so forth. And I think that we all have to really consider that maybe – and I hate to say it, because some people are going to say, hey, you know, don't challenge the physicians here. But I think the physicians here, and we understand the limitations of the real world in practice, are doing a huge disservice to patients in terms of the systematic undertreatment that is probably occurring in this field. There is an enormous drive to try to get patient less trips to the office, less injections. And you've probably seen the release of recent data with long four-year and five-year follow-on. And after you take the patients over the more controlled phases of the study where they're getting, in general, in most studies, monthly treatment on a very carefully monitored treatment, they essentially lose almost all their vision gain over these later years of four-year and five-year follow-ups. And we believe that the data and the evidence suggest that this is really due to systematic under-treatment, patients getting less and less treatment. And particularly in that setting, if you want to deliver the best care to patients, you should be delivering the best agent that has the longest duration of action. And we think that the only agent that's really demonstrated that convincingly is EYLEA. And so I think to save patient's visions, you saw the long-term trials, patients are losing visions. Physicians are not doing the right things by their patients. They're systematically under-treating. And particularly in those settings, they should be getting the best drugs that protects patients against this vision loss.
Michael S. Aberman: Okay.
George D. Yancopoulos: And it would be a disservice if, in fact, incentives and so forth are driven to the use of an inferior agent, which will cost patients. Think about it, you're a patient who can't drive. You're a patient who can't read. You're now given a drug, all of a sudden you gain two lines, three lines of vision. That changes the world literally for you, okay? You could do things you can't do before. And now we develop a system that allows you to lose that? I think that we have to think about how we want to practice medicine in this country if we create a situation that allows that.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yeah, I think the physicians, George, are right there with you. And it would be hard for me to imagine that once the physicians are heard on this subject, that an off-label, inferior product based on a government study could set the standard.
George D. Yancopoulos: Okay. Next question?
Michael S. Aberman: Yeah, next question, please?
Operator: Our next question is from Robyn Karnauskas from Citigroup.
Robyn Karnauskas: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on all the innovation. I feel like one of the few companies where there's so much going on the call and you provide clarity. I guess I'm going to go sarilumab and ask a question about the opportunity. Because Sanofi does highlight this a lot and I feel like those of us on the Street are more skeptical about the opportunity. Help us understand what your view is of sarilumab and how you think about this. It's a competitive space, there's stuff coming up behind it from AbbVie. How are you thinking about the strength of that data? And do you have any understanding of the strategy and how you could take share from the current market or expand the current market? Thanks.
Leonard S. Schleifer: So, Robyn, thanks for your comments about innovation. Obviously, George and I have tried to build a company for the last three decades that is truly driven by science innovation, so we appreciate you taking note of that. And Bob can comment without giving away all of our intricate strategy on what the opportunity for IL-6 might be.
Robert J. Terifay: Robyn, as I pointed out earlier, I think that when Genentech launched ACTEMRA into the U.S. marketplace, it was very much a market dominated by growing TNF inhibitors. And they were a single company trying to educate on the role of IL-6 in rheumatoid arthritis and the potential benefits of using an IL-6 inhibitor earlier. It is always more beneficial, we've seen this, for example, in the statin class, where, as more and more statins became available, they grew the market. We believe that this is the opportunity for this class, that we educate physicians more, one, is as I said earlier, on the central role of IL-6 in both the signs and symptoms of RA, but as well as in joint destruction, which we feel is very important. Physicians need to understand, they shouldn't stay with a TNF inhibitor, which over time, each additional TNF inhibitor does not deliver the efficacy that they received with the first TNF inhibitor. So there's a benefit of moving to a new class. And IL-6 really does have a central role, both in symptoms as well as bone destruction.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Also, just to add, there's some historical accidents have occurred here in the order the drugs came along and having to do with pricing. And with methotrexate being the mainstay, it's a very cheap drug, it's effective. But it's not the most innocuous drug in the world from its side effects and what have you. And there are many people who, I'm told, particularly women, who don't like being on the product and that there really seems to be movement towards monotherapy. And, remember, methotrexate, some have argued that for some drugs, methotrexate provides the immunosuppression for the biologics so that any immune-related, if you will, blockade of effect doesn't appear as quickly. Suffice it to say, maybe George can comment on that more, but I can say that when we look head to head against the market leader, AbbVie, in the monotherapy setting, you've seen our data. We had a superior result.
Robert J. Terifay: And I also do, just to finish the story, sarilumab is not a me-too drug. I don't want to do cross-comparison trial data right now, but I think if you look at the prescribing information for subcutaneous ACTEMRA and you look at the results we reported with our product, we are very encouraged about the product profile that our product, which has higher binding affinity to IL-6, is going to offer in the marketplace. Maybe George wants to comment on that.
George D. Yancopoulos: I think it's important to just highlight a few things, because, once again, it all comes down to the patients and doing the best by the patients. And I think, as Bob and Len already mentioned, if you look at the science, it doesn't necessarily make sense to start all patients, particularly patients in monotherapy settings, with a TNF. And that may be a historical accident. It also doesn't make sense to just continue patients cycling on TNF if there is an alternative that can deliver them better symptomatic relief. And so we think that there's enormous opportunity for this class. And importantly in this class, and as Bob said, one of the most important things that I think that patients and physicians are concerned about is irreversible bone loss. That's one thing that you can't get back and that's one thing that's looked at in this field. And as you know, ACTEMRA is now growing through a subcutaneous formulation. And if you look in the label, according to the subcutaneous formulation that's used there in terms of inhibition of the irreversible bone loss, there's less than 50% inhibition by the subcutaneous formulation in terms of ACTEMRA in terms of the irreversible bone loss. If you look at our study, we offer two doses, and if they both get approved, our higher subcutaneous dose gives greater than 90% inhibition of irreversible bone loss. So, as Bob said, these are not identical agents. This is not a me-too. There's important differences. And there's an important opportunity to do better by patients in terms of the monotherapy setting and in terms of not just cycling through drugs that maybe aren't working for the patients and putting them on a different mechanism of action drug.
Leonard S. Schleifer: I'll also say that there have been, let me call it, commercial gains that have been played out there in that in negotiations that have gone on with the PBMs where people have used certain multiple indications as a way to drive use in other indications from what we can tell. And I think the PBMs are sort of wising up to that and moving to indication-specific pricing and negotiations. And so we actually feel that we might be entering the market at a reasonably good time where, with a lot of dynamics going on and a good product, you can make inroads. Now, I don't think this is going to be an easy road. And I don't think you can just assume that we're going to jump in and grab huge market share right off the bat, but I think we can build this into a significant opportunity over time. It's more of going to be like a slow and steady.
Michael S. Aberman: All right. Next question?
Operator: Next question is from Alethia Young from Credit Suisse. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on everything you have going on there. Just going back to the Praluent trends that you said in your script. I guess you said that Praluent got 50% of the new scripts. Can you talk about what behavior might be driving that 50%? Is it something that you're adjusting or changing that's resounding in the profile?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yeah, I think it's hard to know for sure. And we only have another minute here, so I don't want to get into great detail. But one thing that is important is that there's new coverage that's come into play, particularly in the Medicare space, which was really only recently coming on. And those plans that chose, which was most of them, a single agent as the priority drug, we were I think selected about 90% of the time. So, I think that there's some new coverage, new utilization management. And obviously, we're working hard at this. But I don't think you can consider one week a trend, whether it's going one direction. It's just a data point. But right now the market seems to be split roughly more or less equally based on that data point. How that goes over time, obviously that's what the competitive marketplace is all about.
George D. Yancopoulos: But I think our most important effort right now has to be on making sure that the right patients get access to drug. And that's really where both companies are focused. It's an important thing for the class. The patients who need drug have to get an opportunity to have access to it.
Michael S. Aberman: Operator, we have time for just one last question.
Operator: And our last question is from Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley.
Matthew K. Harrison: Great. Thanks for fitting me in. I just had two related Praluent questions. You said that two payers had loosened their criteria. I'm wondering if you can just be more specific about that, who they were and exactly what they loosened. And then you were talking about an improvement in the number of Rxs that were filled. Is that just more people getting through the utilization management criteria, or could you just be more specific about that comment as well? Thanks.
George D. Yancopoulos: Sure. Our contracts with the payers don't allow us to disclose the specific ones who've changed their utilization management criteria. But what I can say, as I did earlier, what they did is removed a trial period of 12-plus weeks of ZETIA after maximally tolerated statin therapy from their utilization management criteria. That was setting up a delay in access to PCSK9 inhibition. The physicians were having to put them on ZETIA and then wait. And it was causing a real backlog for the doctors. So, that has been removed by two of the payers. In terms of the improvement of the number of people going through the hub. I think what I could say is, one, as Len said, payers have come on board now. And, especially Medicare patients, now are getting access to therapy. I think the other thing is that the physicians as well as the specialty pharmacies are better understanding how to make the prescription process better. Now, it's not easy right now. We continue to work on improving it. But at least it has gotten better for some patients.
Leonard S. Schleifer: So, just one last comment. This is Len. In our effort to answer all your questions, what we're trying to do is give you some insight into our thinking, like why we went forward with something. We're not trying to make cross-trial comparisons, per se. We're trying to give you an idea of why we went forward and what we saw or how we felt we were differentiated. What we can say out in the marketplace obviously will be limited based on what we actually get in our various labels that are pending. And, with that, I would just say that we're pleased that the innovation machine continues to turn and produce lots of exciting things that we'll hope to update you in the scientific literature and in presentations that are upcoming. Lots of things George did not get a chance to talk about that are exciting. So we appreciate your interest and we hope to continue to be able to update you over time. Thank you very much.
Michael S. Aberman: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2015 Q4  (2016-02-09 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Q4 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today’s conference is being recorded.

Once our call concludes, our CFO, Bob Landry and the IR team will be available to answer further questions. With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Leonard Schleifer.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Thanks, Michael. A very good morning to everyone who has joined us on the call and webcast today. 2015 was another successful and productive year for Regeneron. EYLEA delivered impressive global growth and we received approval for and launched Praluent, which is indicated in the U.S. as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for the treatment of adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, who require additional lowering of LDL cholesterol. We made significant advances in our late-stage pipeline submitting a Biologics License Application or BLA for sarilumab in rheumatoid arthritis and advancing Phase 3 clinical development for dupilumab in atopic dermatitis and asthma. In 2015, we also advanced two new antibodies into Phase 3; REGN2222 for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus or RSV infection in infants and our anti-NGF antibody for osteoarthritis pain. We also advanced our early-stage pipeline with progress across multiple therapeutic areas including retinal diseases, cancer, infectious diseases and cardiovascular diseases. Turning to EYLEA performance, EYLEA is now the market-leading brand in anti-VEGF therapy for retinal disease in United States and continue to exhibit strong growth both in the U.S. and worldwide. We saw approximately 54% growth year-over-year in the U.S. with sales of $2.68 billion. On a worldwide basis, EYLEA sales were approximately 4.1 billion for the full year. For the full year 2016, we estimate U.S. EYLEA net sales to grow approximately 20% over full year 2015 U.S. net sales. We are focused on maintaining our leadership in the retinal space. We are continuing clinical development with EYLEA, where we have ongoing combination programs with PDGF and with ANG2 and are pursuing important additional indications for EYLEA that George will review later in the call. Turning now to Praluent, we are proud to have brought the first PCSK9 inhibitor to the market in the United States for patients with uncontrolled LDL cholesterol, which was approved and launched in July of last year. We are still in the early stages of this launch and have been working diligently to provide broad access to eligible patients and educating physicians and patients in order to increase adoption. Bob Terifay will provide some additional metrics on how the launch is progressing. Our mission at Regeneron for 25 plus years has been to consistently and repeatedly bring important new medicines to patients in need, and we feel that we are well positioned to deliver on this mission with our innovative pipeline. Building on last year’s approval of Praluent, we anticipate at least one approval each year for the coming years. In 2016, we anticipate the approval of sarilumab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Our breakthrough product dupilumab in atopic dermatitis is progressing and we expect to report top line Phase 3 data and submit a BLA in the U.S. during this year. Beyond dupilumab, we have a rapidly developing late and early stage pipeline that now consist of 13 product candidates that were all discovered by the scientists at Regeneron, and we expect to put additional new candidates into the clinic this year. George will provide some perspective on this during his remarks. In summary, we are in the midst of a very exciting time at Regeneron with many important events anticipated in 2016. With that, let me turn the call over to Dr. George Yancopoulos, Regeneron’s Chief Scientific Officer. He will be followed by Bob Terifay and then by Bob Landry.
George D. Yancopoulos: Thank you, Len, and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us today. As Len said, 2015 was a very successful and exciting year for R&D at Regeneron. I would like to begin with EYLEA. Diabetic retinopathy is the most common cause of vision loss in patients with diabetes and as a result of microvascular damage to the blood vessels in the retina. If left untreated, diabetic retinopathy can progress to profound and sometimes acute vision loss. While EYLEA is approved to treat diabetic retinopathy in patients with diabetic macular edema or DME, we believe that it could benefit a much broader patient population with diabetic retinopathy who do not have DME where there is no approved anti-VEGF therapy. Therefore, in the first quarter of this year, we plan to initiate Panorama [ph], a Phase 3 study of EYLEA in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy without diabetic macular edema. The National Institute of Health will also independently investigate the potential role of anti-VEGF therapy in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy. This study called Protocol-W will be sponsored by the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network or DRCR and will compare EYLEA to sham [ph] in patients with severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Protocol-W is expected to begin in the first quarter. Our Phase 2 study of EYLEA in combination with our PDGF receptor antibody delivered as a co-formulated injection in Wet age-related macular degeneration or Wet AMD is ongoing and we expect to see top line data from this study by year end. This program has been granted fast track designation by the FDA. Data from the Phase 1 study of EYLEA in combination with nesvacumab, our Ang2 antibody delivered as a co-formulated injection was presented just last week at the Angiogenesis Conference. These data show that the combination of EYLEA with nesvacumab was safe and well tolerated in patients with AMD and in patients with DME. We plan to initiate Phase 2 studies that will include both these patient populations in the first half of the year. As Len mentioned, our Praluent launch is underway and you’ll hear further details from Bob Terifay on the commercial front. Our 18,000-patient OUTCOMES trial is ongoing and we expect the first interim analysis, which will test for futility to occur later this year based upon 50% of the expected events from the trial. Also, we could potentially have our second interim analysis, which occurs after 75% of the targeted primary events have accrued by the end of this year and this interim analysis will test for overwhelming efficacy and futility. As we previously disclosed, the stopping rule for the efficacy analysis is a hazard ratio of 0.802 favoring Praluent as well as consistently across subgroups and regions, positive trends for secondary endpoints including all-cause mortality and no excess non-cardiovascular mortality. These last points are all important as we would not want to unblind a trial early because of efficacy in the primary endpoint at the cost of not reaching significant and important secondary endpoints. In addition to the OUTCOMES trial, we plan to submit a supplemental BLA in the first half of the year for the Praluent monthly dosing regimen. Turning now to sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody for rheumatoid arthritis. A regulatory submission was accepted by the FDA and has been granted an action date of October 30, 2016. The Phase 3 MONARCH trial, which is a superiority study of sarilumab monotherapy versus adalimumab is fully enrolled and we expect top line data from this study in the first half of 2016. Our European regulatory submission for sarilumab is expected to be made in the second half of 2016. I share Len’s enthusiasm for dupilumab, our IL-4/13 pathway blocking antibody, which is currently in Phase 3 clinical studies in asthma and in adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis where it’s been granted breakthrough designation, in part because there are no FDA approved systemic therapy for adult patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. We expect to report top line data from the Phase 3 atopic dermatitis study; SOLO 1, SOLO 2 and CHRONOS in the first half of this year and to complete the rolling BLA submission in the second half of the year. Our approximately 1,700-patient pivotal Phase 3 study of dupilumab in asthma is also enrolling. We also continue to explore other indications for dupilumab such as nasal polyps and eosinophilic esophagitis as well as other allergic or IL-4/13 mediated diseases. Our Nerve Growth Factor antibody or NGF antibody fasinumab is another late-stage pipeline candidate. Pain is one of the leading reasons that patients visit a doctor and osteoarthritis is one of the major sources of pain in adults, particularly older adults. The increasing use of prescription opioids to treat pain has led to a growing epidemic of drug addiction and overdose-related fatalities as well as other opioid-related side effects. Blocking NGF has already shown the ability to improve pain compared to placebo or an active comparator such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or NSAIDs in Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials. We now have a clear path forward from the FDA and will be starting a 10,000-pateint long-term treatment Phase 3 clinical study of fasinumab in the first half of the year. We anticipate reporting data from a 16-week study in osteoarthritis pain in the first half of the year. In our early stage pipeline, we plan to share data from our Phase 1/2 studies of nesvacumab, our antibody to Angptl-3 for dyslipidemia in the first half as well as data from our ongoing immuno-oncology programs such as our PD-1 program and the CD20 by CD3 bispecific program. We have obviously been very busy and productive. In fact, this year we expect to submit a record number of INDs and we look forward to sharing more details with you as these programs move into the clinic. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob Terifay.
Robert J. Terifay: Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. Fourth quarter 2015 was a productive one for Regeneron. We continued to see strong sales growth for EYLEA or aflibercept injection both in the United States and the rest of the world. We also made substantial progress in securing access and reimbursement for Praluent or alirocumab among U.S. payors. In addition, the European launch for Praluent commenced. Starting with EYLEA. Fourth quarter U.S. net sales grew 44% year-over-year. Net U.S. EYLEA sales in the fourth quarter were $746 million. Full year U.S. EYLEA sales were $2.68 billion, which represent a 54% year-over-year growth. A survey of 201 U.S. retinal specialists who evaluated their reported usage of VEGF inhibitors in the fourth quarter of 2015 indicates that EYLEA continues to be the market-leading product among FDA approved anti-VEGF agents in all of our labeled indications in terms of market share of treated eyes. Importantly, the market share of treated eyes for EYLEA in DME is roughly double that for ranibizumab and similar to that for off-label bevacizumab. Turning now to Praluent. As reported by Sanofi, net sales in the fourth quarter were $7 million, which understates actual physician and patient demand. As we reminded you last quarter, we anticipated that it would take some time for commercial and government payors to conduct formulary reviews, make reimbursement coverage decisions and begin to process patient claims. Given these reasons, as well as strict utilization management criteria, we continue to expect a gradual uptick. In response to potential delays in formulary and reimbursement decisions, we’re offering free product to appropriate patients consistent with our labeled indications who are awaiting an insurance coverage decision. This delays uptick in commercial sales reporting. For example, much of Medicare Part D or government-paid patients are receiving free drug pending formulary coverage, which is expected later in the quarter. So, performance cannot be solely judged on sales or filled prescriptions. As a reminder, the reimbursement environment is complex and is carefully managed by payors. Our goal has been to ensure that payors and healthcare providers understand the value that Praluent can offer to patients. And to that end, we have been and are still actively engaged in discussions with payors. There are approximately 240 million lives in the United States that have a drug benefit covered by commercial insurance or Medicare Part D plans. Coverage decisions have already been made for approximately 90% of these lives. However, implementation is ongoing and we expect continued rollout of the coverage over the next several months. Overall, for approximately 50% of the covered lives, a single PCSK-9 antibody has been chosen in an exclusive or preferred position. In these exclusive or preferred cases, we estimate that Praluent was chosen for about 60% of the lives. The preference for Praluent was particularly evident in the Medicare Part D decision. In Medicare, 80% of the lives have a single PCSK-9 antibody in an exclusive or preferred position. For these exclusive or preferred Medicare Part D lives, Praluent was selected approximately 95% of the time. We believe these Medicare coverage decisions are particularly important because our major indication for Praluent is for patients with a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and these patients tend to be older. According to our estimates, about 28% of stat patients in the United States are Medicare Part D patients. We are pleased to see that Praluent is resonating well with payors. As plans begin to activate their coverage, we anticipate a potential uptake in prescription volume. Importantly, almost 90% of all prescriptions processed by the hub are for our lower 75 milligram every other week dose. As a reminder, in our Phase 3 clinical studies, the vast majority of Praluent patients achieved their LDL cholesterol goals with the 75 milligram every other week dose. We continue our efforts to educate both patients and physicians on the benefits of using PCSK-9 inhibitor therapy. Outside of the United States, Praluent was approved in EU in September with product available in several countries. Reimbursement discussions are currently underway with several governments across Europe. In the fourth quarter, we submitted a BLA to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for sarilumab, our interleukin-6 or IL-6 receptor inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis. We will be co-promoting sarilumab with Sanofi in the United States and are actively recruiting our field-based team. Co-promotion decisions for other countries will be made over time. We also continue to prepare for the potential U.S. launch of dupilumab, our IL-4 and IL-13 inhibitor in 2017. We’ve recently informed Sanofi of our intent to co-promote dupilumab in the United States. Co-promotion decisions for other countries will be made at a later date. Next month, we will have a significant presence at the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology meeting in Los Angeles and the American Academy of Dermatology meeting in Washington DC. With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Landry.
Robert E. Landry: Thanks, Bob, and good morning to everyone who has joined us today. Overall, we are pleased with the full year performance Regeneron delivered in 2015. For the full year 2015, we are in $12.07 per diluted share from non-GAAP net income of 1.4 billion. This represents a year-over-year growth in non-GAAP diluted EPS and net income of 21% and 19%, respectively, for the full year 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2015, non-GAAP net income per diluted share increased 1% to $2.83 versus fourth quarter of 2014 and non-GAAP net income of 327 million was unchanged versus fourth quarter of 2014. Regeneron’s 2015 non-GAAP net income excludes non-cash share-based compensation expense, non-cash interest expense related to our senior convertible notes, loss on extinguishment of debt in connection with conversions of a portion of our convertible notes during 2015, and an adjustment for income taxes. Non-GAAP income tax expense is based upon cash income taxes paid or payable for 2015. A full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is set forth in our earnings release. Total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2015 were 1.1 billion and 4.1 billion for the full year of 2015, which represented year-over-year growth of 37% for the three months and 46% for the full year. Net product sales were 750 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and 2.69 billion for the full year of 2015 compared to 522 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 and 1.75 billion for the full year of 2014. EYLEA net product sales in the United States were 746 million in the fourth quarter and 2.68 billion in 2015 compared to 518 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 and 1.74 billion for the full year 2014, which represents an increase of 44% and 54%, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2015, EYLEA experienced a slight increase in U.S. distributory inventory levels as compared to the third quarter of 2015, and overall a slight decrease in comparison to the fourth quarter 2014 but remains within our normal one to two-week targeted range. As Len mentioned earlier, our U.S. EYLEA net sales growth guidance for full year 2016 over 2015 is approximately 20%. Ex-U.S. EYLEA sales were 413 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to 297 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, representing a 39% increase on a reported basis. Ex-U.S. EYLEA sales for the full year 2015 were 1.41 billion compared to 1.04 billion for 2014, representing a 36% increase on a reported basis. On an operational basis or constant currency basis, sales increased approximately 54% for the three months and 58% for the full year 2015. Product revenue from ex-U.S. EYLEA sales is recorded by our collaborator, Bayer HealthCare. In the fourth quarter of 2015, Regeneron recognized 140 million from our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the United States and 467 million for the full year 2015. Total Bayer HealthCare collaboration revenue for the fourth quarter was 165 million and 580 million for the full year 2015. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was 166 million for the fourth quarter and 759 million for the full year 2015. The Sanofi collaboration revenue line primarily consists of reimbursement of Regeneron incurred R&D expenses, reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization related expenses and our share of profits or losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies. In the fourth quarter of 2015, our share of losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies, primarily Praluent, was 96 million and for the full year 2015 was 240 million, which can be found in Table 4 of our earnings release. Netted within these losses were the global sales of Praluent as recognized by our partner Sanofi of 7 million for the fourth quarter 2015 and 11 million for the full year 2015. Recall that Praluent was launched in the third quarter of 2015. Turning now to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were 389 million for the fourth quarter and 1.37 billion for the full year 2015. Our unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as the total GAAP R&D expense less R&D reimbursements from our collaborators and R&D non-cash share-based compensation expense was 214 million for the three months and 570 million for the full year 2015. We note that this comes in slightly above our 2015 non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense guidance of 540 million to 560 million, primarily due to higher expenditures for our NGF program. Our press release includes all the information that is required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expenses. For 2016, we’d like to reiterate our previously provided guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to be in the range of 875 million to 950 million. Our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D spend is driven by three factors; advancing our pipeline outside of the Sanofi and Bayer collaboration, particularly our programs for NGF, RSV and CD20 by CD3; our obligation to pay for 20% of the Phase 3 clinical development expense following the first positive Phase 3 results of our partnered antibodies, primarily driven by the potential positive dupilumab Phase 3 readout in the first half of 2016; the advancement of our immuno-oncology pipeline in collaboration with Sanofi and proprietary R&D initiatives such as those in the area of human genomics. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were 213 million for the fourth quarter and 646 million for the full year 2015. We expect non-GAAP SG&A expense in 2016 to be in the range of 925 million and 1 billion. The increase in our SG&A expense is primarily driven by the ongoing Praluent launch, which is entering its first full year of launch and preparing for the potential commercial launches of both sarilumab and dupilumab. As we have mentioned previously, in 2015 we began paying significant cash income taxes as compared to prior periods. Cash tax as a percentage of non-GAAP pre-tax net income for this quarter as well as for all of 2015 is based on an estimate of the cash tax paid or payable for the full year. This amount continues to be substantially lower than our GAAP effective tax rate. On a non-GAAP basis, cash taxes as a percentage of non-GAAP pre-tax net income for the fourth quarter of 2015 and for the 12 months ended December 31, 2015 was approximately 16% and 18%, respectively. For 2016, our guidance for cash tax as a percentage of non-GAAP pre-tax income is 35% to 45%. This includes a one-time tax of approximately 222 million related to $600 million of our December 31, 2015 deferred revenue balance remaining from the immuno-oncology upfront payment from Sanofi that we received in the third quarter of 2015. The cash tax impact of the immuno-oncology upfront payment will be spread equally throughout the year. Our capital expenditures for the 12 months ended December 31, 2015 was 678 million. We expect our capital expenditures to be between 580 million and 680 million for 2016. These expenses continue to build on the manufacturing expansions made in 2015, which include expanding our facilities in Rensselaer, New York and Limerick, Ireland as well as the continued expansion of our Tarrytown, New York headquarters. We ended the fourth quarter of 2015 with cash and marketable securities of 1.7 billion. As we have previously mentioned, we have been opportunistically entering into agreements that reduce the number of our outstanding warrants that we issued in 2011 in connection with our convertible debt. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we paid 50 million to reduce these outstanding warrants and in January 2016, we paid an additional 135 million to reduce more outstanding warrants. We intend to continue seeking opportunities to further reduce these outstanding warrants into 2016. With that, I’d like to turn the call back to Michael.
Michael Aberman: Thanks, Bob. Before starting the Q&A, I just want to correct quickly that the 10-K will be filed later this week not later this morning. With that operator, we can start the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Ying Huang with Bank of America.
Ying Huang: Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks very much for the questions. First of all, we know that Amgen’s CV outcome trial will likely readout earlier than you guys. I want to ask you about the thought on that. So do you think that will put Praluent potentially at a disadvantage in the commercial market or actually you’ll get a ripple effect, because both drugs are in the same class of PCSK-9 inhibitors? Secondly, maybe for Bob, some investors are a little concerned about the cost trend here. So can you kind of layout in the outer years, for the next three, five years, what are your thoughts for the year on SG&A and also R&D costs, and also maybe some trend in long-term tax? Thank you.
Michael Aberman: Let me just remind people, one question. Thank you. Go ahead, Bob.
Robert J. Terifay: I think on the cardiovascular outcomes trial, obviously as George pointed out we feel it’s very important that not only do we meet the primary endpoint but that we ensure that if there are key secondary endpoints that we allow them to come to fruition so that we ensure that we have a robust out of package. In terms of the impact of Amgen coming earlier than us, it would be speculative to really say what that means. But we do think that Amgen having positive data will be positive for the overall class.
Robert E. Landry: Ying, hi, it’s Bob. With regards to your question on costs, certainly it’s something that we take very serious about this. As we mentioned several times in the quarters last year, we are in the midst of a sizable Praluent launch against the very formidable opponent. And on top of that we are in the midst of launching sarilumab in the fourth quarter of 2016 and we’re also preparing for first half 2017 for dupilumab. So for those three launches, it is putting stress on our SG&A number. With regards to R&D, we’ve highlighted some drivers with regards to the increase in unreimbursed R&D, the biggest one probably being the NGF program. As you’ve heard from Len and George earlier, the program is full-speed ahead with regards to entering Phase 3 very, very shortly. We’re also moving forward with our RSV. Now these are both un-partnered products. And then again, we get our first positive Phase 3 readout for dupilumab in the first half of 2016 and as you know and as we’ve said before, that’s a driver with regards to us picking up 20% of the program cost associated with that. So that would not only include atopic dermatitis that would also include the asthma indication associated with that. So all of these things associated are putting some stress on our expenses and maybe Len may have a few additional comments.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Thanks, Bob. I would just say that if you study this industry and companies in it, nobody ever has a perfectly spaced pipeline. These spaces are usually too wide with lots of whitespace and lots of worry what to do, where is the next drug going to come from or if very infrequently as is the case here with Regeneron, there’s a lot going on that’s very compacted in time. We, of course, would rather have the latter than the former and that’s what I think is that we’re managing through. It’s an exciting time. And approval in 2015 for Praluent, 2016 we hope for sarilumab, 2017 the first approval for dupilumab and beyond that approvals for dupilumab in asthma, perhaps NGF coming up, RSV progress and perhaps approvals down the line there in immuno-oncology. So we have a very intensely compacted pipeline that we have to manage both from a technical point of view, from an operational point of view, a manufacturing point of view and of course, as Bob says, from a financial point of view.
Ying Huang: Thank you.
Michael Aberman: Next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.
Terence Flynn: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I’m sorry for the background noise. On Praluent, just wondering if you can give us any additional commentary on the types of patients coming on to therapy, and maybe what percentage of scripts are actually getting filled versus rejected? Thanks.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes, I don’t think we can get into the metrics in terms of those things, Terence, unfortunately. It’s a fairly competitive marketplace out there. I will reemphasize that some of the points – take this opportunity to reemphasize some of the points that Bob made, which is that we feel on the contracting side that process is starting to wind down in terms of about 90% of the lives who have either commercial or Medicare Part D coverage, decisions have been made. They haven’t been fully implemented on many of them and in fact the rollout is just going to keep going over the next several months and even into the second quarter of this year, some coverage won’t begin. We did particularly well in those cases where there was an exclusive or preferred decision made. We won that business over 60% of the time. And as Bob said in the Medicare business where it’s a large proportion of the statin use and a large proportion of our patients, we were able – when there was an exclusive or preferred decision made and that was 80% of the time, when there was an exclusive or preferred decision made that went, 95% of the lives went to Praluent. So we’re very pleased that our product offering is resonating well and that people I think are getting our message.
Robert J. Terifay: In terms of the patient types, as we mentioned there are very strict utilization management criteria in the category. So it is strictly within the labeled population, which is patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and patients with a history of coronary disease. So we’re seeing patients who had myocardial infarction, patients with very, very high baseline LDL-C, patients who have FH. These are the patient populations for which the product is being dispensed.
Leonard S. Schleifer: And we’re hoping in the elderly population where we did win so much of that business that the availability of our low dose is something that will resonate well with doctors, especially as they’re treating elderly people and perhaps wanting to start on a lower dose. Next question, Michael.
Michael Aberman: Next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges with Leerink [ph].
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks very much for taking the question. I might go back to EYLEA, if I could. I’m a little confused both by the quarterly result and then by your guidance. You grew 1.5% sequentially Q3 to Q4. You originally guided this year for 25% to 30% and you grew 54%. And now you’re guiding for 20% next year. If I run 1.5% sequential growth forward, it only gets to about 15% for the year. Can you give us a sense of were there any one-time items in either Q4 or Q3 or that you’re anticipating for next year, or are you just taking a cautious approach? And how is the underlying demand trend from Q3 to Q4? Thanks.
Robert E. Landry: Right. So, I think – Geoff, thanks for your question. One point is that this is not driven by inventory or things like that. Inventory increased very slightly but within our range in the fourth quarter and year-over-year inventory actually decreased a little bit. So there really wasn’t – that wasn’t a driver. When you look sequentially, you do have to be careful. There are seasonality trends. Fourth quarter, lots of holidays; fourth and first quarter, lots of weather. And so you know how we feel about forecasting, it’s about the most imprecise scientifically unscientific activity we do here. But it isn’t a matter of guiding conservatively, aggressively or what have you, it’s just trying to give you our best guess with the information we have and looking into the future, which is of course difficult.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thanks.
Michael Aberman: Next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adnan Butt with RBC Capital Markets.
Adnan Butt: Hi. Thanks. So I’ll ask a question on the EYLEA combinations. You have now seen data from both Ang2 and PDGFR. Which one seems more compelling? And in the past, you have shed some doubts about PDGF as a target. Has that view changed since seeing data? Thanks.
Leonard S. Schleifer: George can comment but there isn’t much to change our view because the only thing we’ve really seeing thus far is that we can deliver these products in a combination and we can do that in what appears to be a safe way. Too early to talk about any efficacy. But George, do you have any comments on that?
George D. Yancopoulos: Yes. Similarly, I don’t think our views have changed that much. Mechanistically, the rationale we believe is a little stronger for the Ang2 and the PDGFR pathway. But either way, we would of course be excited if in the clinic either one of these combinations brought added benefit to patients especially because we think that with our ability to combine these agents into a single – formulation of single injection, if there is increased benefit we’ll be able to have the most convenient delivery regimen for the patient. So we’re only hoping for success with these combinations.
Leonard S. Schleifer: I might say on combinations, there are others who are trying to do a fixed bispecific approach and I think as George has talked about this in some of his previous meetings we’ve had, which is that the rationale there to us seems better to be able to combine these as separate drugs in a single formulation so you can adjust the concentration and dose of each one to an optimal level. When you see a result with a bispecific, you don’t know whether or not it’s got anything to do with both drugs acting or only one just acting better than the monospecific antibody or a drug that you had compared it to. So, we like the approach we’re using. We like the technology but the data are going to determine exactly where this goes.
Michael Aberman: Okay. Next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Birchenough with Wells Fargo.
Nick Abbott: Good morning. It’s Nick in for Jim this morning. Can I just go back to the PD-1 inhibitor? The trial has ballooned from 60 to now apparently 973 patients. There is now a quad arm of chemo, [indiscernible] and GMCs [ph]. So can you just talk a little bit about what data we’re going to get from this trial and what exactly it is you’re trying to show in this trail and perhaps contextualize that with what competitors are doing with their PD-1 inhibitors? This is obviously a very large and complex trial. Thank you.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes, we’re not going to give out the data but George may want to comment on what the general approach is.
George D. Yancopoulos: Right. The first point was just to convincingly demonstrate activity and where we think it fits compared to competitors. Second was to get a broad idea of which settings and which indications but also the notion of any novel combinations which could then direct us to both settings and combinations where there might be opportunities. And I think we’ve said and Michael can say exactly when that we will be talking about some of this data in the not too distant future. Michael, when are we going to be talking about it?
Michael Aberman: We just said later this year.
George D. Yancopoulos: Okay.
Leonard S. Schleifer: And so the programs are going well. They have obviously been enlarged because we’re pleased with the initial results that we’re seeing and we’ll be sharing some of that with you at the upcoming appropriate cancer meetings.
Michael Aberman: Okay. Next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Raymond with Raymond James.
Laura Chico: Good morning. This is Laura Chico in for Chris Raymond today. I guess I’d like to just go back to Geoff’s question on the EYLEA guidance for a moment. I know you mentioned seasonal and weather potential impacts in Q1 but are there any other broader headwinds we should be thinking about in 2016? Thanks.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes, so it’s always hard to anticipate trends that will drive a drug at this point. Remember, we’re in the fifth year of a launch, which is a pretty big deal to be expecting 20% year-over-year growth on a very large base. So we see the product still growing, which is I think the most important – if not quantitative, it’s the most important qualitative statement. We’ve become the leading brand in anti-VEGF in the market and we take this franchise very seriously as we think there are additional growth drivers. George talked about the fact that we want to develop in diabetic retinopathy and he’s talked about looking at it in combinations with PDGF and Ang2. So we’re still committed to developing this market both in the United States and with our partner Bayer outside of United States. We should note that the growth we demonstrated in the United States here was purely volume. We did not take any price increases. Now from a macro sense, if there are payor changes on how things are reimbursed or things like that what we can’t say now because there are none in place. But if things change, I think there will be more rhetoric this year during election year than actual action. But we monitor this very closely. We think our drug is a sight saving, an important therapy and we’re going to continue to try and grow this franchise.
Michael Aberman: Okay. Next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matt Roden with UBS.
Jeffrey Hung: Thanks for taking the question. This is Jeff Hung in for Matt. Regarding the Protocol C trial, when should we expect the two-year data to be presented? And then secondly, in terms of what we might expect to see, it looks like the EYLEA acuity curve in the 20/50 or worse group is trending a bit higher as you approach the one-year mark. So this raises the question, could the data get better versus competitors in the second year and how would you frame the two-year data for us? Thanks.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes, I don’t think we can frame the two-year data because we’ll just have to wait and we expect it to come sometime in the first half of this year. We don’t control the data obviously. The data is controlled by our friends at DRCR. I will say that for us the most important dataset was at the primary endpoint at one year where we did show superiority to the other therapies and we showed a very strong safety profile. As you go up to the second year when you have less patients, some dropouts and what have you, we’ll have to see the dataset and we’ll have to look carefully at hopefully to show our drug continues to have a strong safety profile as it has in all of our studies to date.
George D. Yancopoulos: Yes, just to build on what Len is saying, really the only valid direct comparison would be in the first year, because that’s when the drugs were really tried side-by-side using very similar paradigms, dosing regimens and so forth. In the second year, things get hopelessly confabulated by the fact that the dosing regimens change, there’s a lot more PRN usage, there’s a lot more laser usage and so forth. So it’s going to be very hard to deconvolute I think the second year data.
Michael Aberman: Okay. Next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Barclays.
Geoffrey Meacham: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So last year with EYLEA, Protocol T obviously a big driver of DME adoption. I wanted to see if you guys could talk sort of qualitatively about where you think VEGF share of the overall DME market is, what you think the next leg of growth is, and maybe what a driver of that is? Is it just more blocking and tackling in the marketplace or are there follow-on datasets that you feel like could be more meaningful to retinal specialists? Thanks.
George D. Yancopoulos: So, Geoff, obviously we have seen a lot of our growth this year coming in the DME segment of the marketplace. Unfortunately, there still are a large number of patients who have diabetes that don’t get yearly-dilated eye exams, don’t get into the retinal specialists. And so DME is currently still undertreated although VEGF inhibitors are being used more broadly for patients who are diagnosed with DME, the opportunity for us is to make patients aware that they’ve got to get their eye exam and get into a retinal specialist if they do have any problems with their vision. And that really is a major focus of our promotion this year.
Leonard S. Schleifer: And as George mentioned in his talk, remember we have an indication for diabetic retinopathy in the setting of DME but the much broader indication of diabetic retinopathy without DME, broader in terms of number of patients is something that we would like to get added to the label and that’s why we are conducting pivotal studies to broaden the label for that indication. So, I think it’s sort of the same, Geoff, but we see growth in demographics; more patients getting older, more patients with diabetes. We see strength in potential market share both from off-labels and from – coming from the off-label Avastin and perhaps from Lucentis. We see geographic growth with more room to grow outside the United States. Our ratio outside the United States is as not as high as it is inside the United States in terms of market share and finally new indications potentially as I mentioned.
George D. Yancopoulos: And just to add to that, there is a lot of patient and doctor education that needs to be done. It’s still true that unfortunately despite the data showing that anti-VEGF therapy can provide much better vision results than laser therapy, laser is still the preferred therapy in the DME population. There’s a lot of patient education and doctor education there. And as Len said, that’s just for the approved setting DME diabetic population. There’s at least three times as many patients who have diabetic retinopathy without DME. So if the current studies really show their results, there’s an opportunity there as well.
Geoffrey Meacham: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan.
Cory Kasimov: Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I’m curious what you think is driving the impressive Medicare uptake so far for Praluent, if it’s something specific to the drug’s profile such as the dosing options you mentioned, it’s primarily the lower dose or does this have more to do with pricing discounts being offered? I’m just trying to understand the dynamics there. Thanks a lot.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes, that’s always hard to know because we of course don’t know what the other side of financial offerings are, we only know ours. But we believe in all of these meetings, we spend a lot of time trying to educate the technical people with the payors about the product profile. We do believe that the low dose, particularly in elderly patients, might be something of value for physicians to choose. Remember, the vast majority of patients are able to get to their desired level using the lower dose. Now whether or not the attitude of doesn’t matter how low you go and it’s too complicated for doctors to be able to understand the use of low and high dose, I think that puts not quite enough faith in doctors and my colleagues in the medical profession. They get the difference and I think this maybe resonating frankly.
Michael Aberman: Okay. Next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI.
Mark Schoenebaum: Thanks, guys. I’ll follow Michael’s rule of no more than seven questions.
Michael Aberman: Thank you, Mark.
Mark Schoenebaum: Amgen has actually said that their base case at the final analysis for the CVOT trial is a risk reduction of about 25% to 35%. So I was struck by your statement that your DSMB would consider about a 20% reduction as overwhelming efficacy. Can you give us what your base case assumption is at the final analysis for risk reduction? And just related, Amgen talks a lot about their IVIS trial and how they think that’s very important. To my knowledge, you guys aren’t conducting one. I’d just like to hear you speak about your decision there and your thoughts on if that data will be meaningful in the marketplace. Thanks so much.
George D. Yancopoulos: All right. I guess we’re not talking about a base case, we’re telling you exactly what the study is actually trialed, is powered to pick up. So that’s the numbers that we’re giving. And certainly we’re looking at a variety of imaging studies and so forth. As Bob said, we certainly realize and recognize that a lot of the outcomes data and these imaging studies and so forth, they are going to speak to the class effects. And so we’re hoping that their results will be positive and we’re also going to be looking at what studies that we can be doing in addition to our outcome studies and in terms of imaging.
Leonard S. Schleifer: It does seem, Mark, you may be one of the only people on the planet who can remember each and every outcome study with the statins and which statin that was used in the outcomes trial. But I do think for the most part there is some genericization. There will be subtle differences. And just to emphasize what George was saying about the power, I think Amgen is basically telling you, which is correct, which is that in previous studies the amount of risk reduction you get is proportional to the absolute number of milligrams per deciliter that you lower LDL cholesterol. Now, of course, in their Phase 2b/3 studies and I should say their Phase 3 non-outcome studies as well as ours, the starting LDL cholesterol was higher and so the overall LDL absolute reduction was a lot and therefore the risk reduction was a lot. When you start out with a more modest LDL, which we’re both doing in our outcomes trial, you have less LDL lowering and on average you should have less risk reduction but we think a very robust result. And we’ll be able to look across the barriers, spectrums of people had this starting LDL and so on and so forth. So we’re very confident in the LDL hypothesis. Remember, Brown and Goldstein were the first people to understand the LDL receptor on our Board of Directors, so this is something we’ve been very close to for a very long time. So we believe in the LDL hypothesis and we believe the outcomes trials should continue to support that.
George D. Yancopoulos: I think Len said it very well but it was a little complicated even for me to understand. I think the point is, is that the important message here from these studies, I think it’s going to be more qualitative than quantitative. As the FDA always cautions, it’s impossible to compare between studies and that’s because there are so many inherent differences; in the type of the population just starting LDL, whether they had recent events or whether it’s more of a secondary prevention type of a setting and so forth and so on. So there’s so many differences between the populations. So I think one is looking more for qualitative messages here as opposed to just quantitative differentiators.
Mark Schoenebaum: Qualitatively, I’d like to say thank you.
Michael Aberman: You’re welcome, Mark. Next question.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Qualitatively, you’re welcome.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alethia Young with Credit Suisse.
Alethia Young: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just one on dupi. I thought I saw like a pediatric trial that was a small trial that was ongoing. Just wondered if you could give us your updated thoughts on the path forward in peds for dupi, please?
George D. Yancopoulos: Well, as you know, pediatrics patients with atopic dermatitis are a very large population of people. And these children, many of them, suffer greatly. So we would love to see our drug program expanded to be able to treat the children. Of course, the normal way that this is done is that you wait until you have completed your Phase 3 studies in adults before moving more aggressively into children. But after I think looking at our program and an advisory panel on this subject, the FDA and the advisory panel I think pushed us and we agreed that we should be looking even before we had the final Phase 3 data, because the data we saw in Phase 2b was so strong. I remember it was designated a breakthrough therapy by the agency. So we have moved into pediatrics. We have a Phase 2 study that’s ongoing in patients between the ages of 6 and 17 and we expect to be able to get you data from that perhaps later this year. And we have a Phase 3 pediatric study planned as well. So we see the need, we see the children who suffer and don’t have good alternatives and we would very much like to expand to be able to treat them.
Michael Aberman: Next question. Operator?
Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley.
Matthew Harrison: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I just wanted to ask on both the Ang2 and the PDGF follow-ons, you obviously are now going to be running two large Phase 2 studies for both of those drugs. One will read out I guess end of this year and the next one, I assume, sometime next year. How are you thinking about bringing both of those into Phase 3? Will you decide on them independently or will you wait for both datasets to decide how to move them forward? And anything you can say around what kind of bar you think is relevant from an efficacy standpoint there to be able to move those forward? Thanks.
George D. Yancopoulos: Well, I think data always speaks for us and to us and that’s how we make our decisions. So we I think have designed a very robust and comprehensive Phase 2 program for both of these combination approaches. And we’ll make the decisions based on the data. I think certain advantages that we would have is that if the efficacy advantage or the interval differentiation is sufficient, we’ll be able to conveniently and in a cost effective manner be providing both agents to the patients. So we’re not really limited by sort of saying, oh well, yes, there is an advantage, but it’s so modest, how do you justify a whole new biologic here? We’re in the unique position of being able to provide both agents in a very cost effective manner regardless of what the benefit if there is definitive, convincing additional benefits. But it’s all going to depend on the data.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes, I can’t overemphasize what George just said so I’ll repeat it, which is that – some people are trying to develop add-ons as two separate injections, which really means that you must have a robust efficacy and safety profile to justify the risks because injections in the eye although probably none have – there’s been no more injections than I can imagine has been with EYLEA around the world, but the injections in the eyes still carry a small but real risk each time physicians sticks a needle in the eye without putting anything in there. And so if you’re going to have a very small benefit, two needle sticks probably won’t be justified. And as George said, the cost – we can deliver these at the same costs, if necessary, in a single injection. So we have both the financial burden as well as the injection burden really under our control. So therefore we can be driven to go to the market with smaller benefits than you might have to hold yourself up to if you have to do multiple injections and add-on costs.
Michael Aberman: Operator, we have time for one last question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Phil Nadeau with Cowen and Company.
Philip Nadeau: Good morning. Thanks for fitting in my question. Just a question on how you think we should model Praluent’s uptake through 2016? I know in the past you’ve said that it will take several quarters for sales to reflect end user demand. Is there a point in 2016 where you think the reimbursement negotiations will be finished and sampling will begin to subside where we can begin to see end user demand reflected in sales, or is 2016 really a preparatory year for the post event study uptake of Praluent?
Leonard S. Schleifer: So just to clarify although as we discussed, the class currently has penetrated 90% of covered lives. Many of the payors have yet to implement their insurance coverage. So we expect to see that coverage continue to come on board over the next several months. Once that coverage comes on board, there is going to be some time for physicians to understand what the utilization management criteria are and how to really document the prior authorization to get these patients through the entire process to get a dispensed prescription. So I would say you’re going to see very gradual uptake for several months until we get to some kind of a steady state.
Michael Aberman: Great. Operator, with that this concludes our call. I want to thank everybody. As per usual, myself, the IR team and Bob Landry, our CFO, are available for follow-up questions as needed at our office. Please let us know if you want to talk. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.

===== 2015 Q3  (2015-11-04 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this call may be recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dr. Michael Aberman, Senior Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations with Regeneron. You may begin.
Michael Aberman, M.D.: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' third quarter 2015 conference call. An archive of this webcast will be available on our website under Events and Presentations for 30 days. Joining me on the call today are Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; Dr. George Yancopoulos, Founding Scientist, President of Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer; Bob Terifay, Senior Vice President, Commercial; and Bob Landry, our Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks, we'll open the call for questions and answers. I would also like to remind you that remarks made on this call include forward-looking statements about Regeneron. Such statements may include, but are not limited to those related to Regeneron and its products and business, sales and expense forecasts, financial forecasts, development programs, collaborations, finances, regulatory matters, intellectual property and competition. Each forward-looking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected in such statements. A more complete description of these and other material risks can be found in Regeneron's filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, including its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 and Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, which was filed with the SEC this morning. Regeneron does not undertake any obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. In addition, please note that GAAP and non-GAAP measures will be discussed on today's call. Information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP are available in our financial results press release, which can be accessed on our website at www.regeneron.com. Once our call concludes, the team will be available to answer further questions. With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Leonard Schleifer.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.: Thank you, Michael, and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us on the call and webcast today. I'm pleased to share with you that we delivered another strong quarter. EYLEA continued to show growth both in the U.S. and globally. Praluent, our first-in-class PCSK9 inhibitor for the treatment of elevated LDL cholesterol was approved and the launch is underway. And we continue to advance our early and late-stage pipeline programs. This quarter, I am particularly proud to announce that quarterly global sales of EYLEA surpassed $1 billion for the first time in the product's commercial history. Overall, EYLEA has driven the solid financial performance we delivered in the third quarter of 2015, which you will hear more about from Bob Landry. Based on the continued strong growth in U.S. EYLEA net sales, we are increasing our full-year U.S. EYLEA net sales guidance to year-over-year growth of between 50% and 55% from the previously provided range of 45% to 50%. To help put in perspective how strong the performance of EYLEA has been during the first nine months, you may recall that our original guidance that we provided at the beginning of the year was for 25% to 30% year-over-year growth. Bob Terifay will review EYLEA sales in more detail. In the third quarter, we received regulatory approval in the U.S. and the EU for Praluent, our PCSK9 antibody. While the U.S. launch is still in its early days and many challenges remain, we, along with our collaborator Sanofi, are encouraged by what we have seen so far. Bob Terifay will discuss the ongoing launch in greater detail. We have also made important progress with our pipeline. Today, we have four late-stage antibodies: sarilumab for rheumatoid arthritis; dupilumab for a variety of allergic and atopic diseases; REGN2222 for respiratory syncytial virus; and fasinumab, our NGF antibody for osteoarthritis-related pain. We also made important announcements around our early stage research programs, including a collaboration with the U.S. Health and Human Services' Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority Division, also known as BARDA, in Ebola, which highlights Regeneron's rapid response capabilities for emerging infectious diseases. And the publication of our discovery of the mechanistic basis for the rare disease known as fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, or FOP, in science translational medicine, as well as the identification of a therapeutic candidate for this terrible disease. You'll hear more about some of these advances from George. As we discussed on our last quarterly call, early in the third quarter we announced a major new collaboration with Sanofi in immuno-oncology, and we continue to advance our programs in this area. I want to take a moment to reflect on our achievements this quarter, as they highlight Regeneron's unique position. While we continue to have strong top line growth from EYLEA, we are also in the midst of an important launch with Praluent and are positioned to bring multiple important new medicines to patients in the coming years, including sarilumab for rheumatoid arthritis and three additional antibodies which are in late-stage development. Our investments in R&D have the potential to help diverse groups of patients in need. We expect to make significant investments in the coming year to support these important programs in terms of launch and development costs. These critical investments will fuel our efforts to continue to move our pipeline forward and thereby, hopefully, allow Regeneron to continue to execute on its mission to provide important new medicines to patients in need. Bob Landry will update you on our financial results. In addition to our progress with our late-stage antibodies, we maintain our commitment to continue to innovate, whether that is for rare diseases like FOP, emerging diseases like Ebola, or the genetics effort at the Regeneron Genetics Center, to name a few. With that, let me turn the call over to Dr. George Yancopoulos, Regeneron's Chief Scientific Officer. He will be followed by Bob Terifay and then by Bob Landry. George?
George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D.: Thank you, Len, and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us today. As Len mentioned, we have remained committed to being a research-driven company, and the depth and breadth of our proprietary technology and the resulting pipeline of molecules, all of which have been invented in our own labs, is a testament to that vision. Len and I are proud of our team and what they are accomplishing. One of the features that distinguish us as a company is that the core group of scientists who helped build Regeneron from the very beginning continues to be actively involved as leaders and is now being joined by the next generation of new scientists who are attracted to our research-based approach. To that end, we are proud that we are one of the top two employers by Science Magazine for the fifth year in a row, and once again the top employer in the biopharmaceutical industry. Turning to developments this quarter. I would like to begin with Praluent, where we currently have a Phase III outcome study ongoing. We expect this study to be fully enrolled by the end of the year, with final data expected in 2017, and interim analysis by the independent data monitoring committee reported next year. At the annual meeting of the European Society of Cardiology Congress, we presented new data from a pooled analysis of over 1,200 heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia patients, one of the major group of patients for whom Praluent is indicated. This represented the largest group of HetFH patients ever studied in a Phase III program. This pooled analysis was concurrently published in the European Heart Journal. We look forward to presenting additional new analyses from our Phase III program at the American Heart Association meeting this upcoming weekend. We have submitted our BLA for sarilumab, our interleukin-6 receptor antibody for rheumatoid arthritis, and look forward to a potential FDA action in the second half of 2016. Next week, at the American College of Rheumatology meeting, we will be presenting additional Phase III data for sarilumab, including data from the positive target study which was in patients who are inadequate responders to, or intolerant of, TNF alpha inhibitors, in combination with non-biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, or DMARD therapy. We'll be hosting a conference call next week from ACR. The target data, along with the previously reported published data from the Phase III mobility study of sarilumab in combination with methotrexate in patients who were inadequate responders to methotrexate alone, are included in our regulatory submission in the U.S. In addition, the Phase III MONARCH study of sarilumab versus adalimumab in the monotherapy setting is now fully enrolled, and we expect to report data from this study in the second half of 2016. Turning to dupilumab, our antibody that blocks the interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 pathways. We expect to see data in early 2016 from our pivotal Phase III studies in atopic dermatitis, both of which are fully enrolled, with the regulatory submission to follow in the second half of the year. A Phase II study in the pediatric atopic dermatitis population is also fully enrolled, and we are committed to moving as quickly as possible to address this important patient population. In the asthma indication, our confirmatory Phase III study is ongoing and enrolling patients. As we have mentioned previously, following discussion with the FDA, we'll only need to conduct one Phase III efficacy study in this indication since the FDA has said that our Phase IIB trial could be considered pivotal. In addition, we continue to explore other potential allergic indications for dupilumab such as nasal polyps and eosinophilic esophagitis. Regeneron 2222, our antibody to respiratory syncytial virus is in Phase III clinical development. An open-label pharmacokinetic portion of this study has been completed in healthy preterm infants and has enabled dose selection for the second part of this Phase III study which is expected to commence shortly. A separate, second Phase III study is planned for next year. Fasinumab, our antibody that blocks nerve growth factor, is currently in Phase III clinical studies for osteoarthritis-related pain. Last month, we announced a collaboration agreement in Asia for this program with Mitsubishi Tanabe and look forward to working with our new Japanese collaborators to advance fasinumab. We also announced and launched our new immuno-oncology collaboration with Sanofi during the quarter. With the additional resources and commitment to immuno-oncology, coupled with our capabilities in both immunomodulatory antibodies and bispecific antibodies, our goal is to become a major contributor to this exciting new field. Our PD-1, which is expected to serve as a backbone of several future combination approaches, continues to enrolling patients in an early clinical study, as is our CD3xCD20 bispecific antibody, which is not included in the immuno-oncology collaboration, but will nevertheless serve as the proof of concept for our overall bispecific platform. I'd now like to spend a few minutes on our earlier stage pipeline. In September, we announced that Science Translational Medicine had published a paper describing the discovery and preclinical validation of a key biological mechanism that drives the pathophysiology of a rare genetic disorder, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, or FOP. FOP is a progressive, severely disabling and ultimately fatal disease in which muscles, ligaments, tendons and other connective tissues are transformed into bone. While FOP is a very rare disease – there's approximately 800 confirmed cases in the world – we've been inspired by the stories of the patients with this terrible disease by our interactions with the International FOP Association which represents the patients and their families, and the clinical community, particularly Dr. Fred Kaplan and his group at the University of Pennsylvania, as well as our own scientific drive to understand this important pathway's potential implications to other diseases. A critical factor that enabled us to elucidate this signaling pathway and identify active (13:25) as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of FOP was our proprietary VelociGene technology. We used this to develop a genetically humanized and novel mouse model of FOP in which the hypothesized molecular pathophysiology of disease was elucidated. Additionally, our proprietary VelocImmune platform enabled us to generate an antibody highly selective to the therapeutic targets. We think underserved diseases like FOP highlights the need for innovative R&D, and we hope that our efforts may ultimately result in important new therapies. Similarly, I would now like to provide you with an update on our efforts in emerging infectious diseases that pose a risk to public health such as ebola. We believe we can take advantage of Regeneron's rapid response technologies in this space as they can be immensely useful in emergency situations for diseases that cause a large and quickly expanding threat to the general population. In September, we announced that we have received funding from BARDA to advance, test and manufacture a monoclonal antibody cocktail for the treatment of ebola virus infection. In addition to ebola, a proprietary antibody, Regeneron Rapid Response platform has been used to generate antibodies for Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome or MERS, which has been the recent cause of outbreaks in both Saudi Arabia and South Korea. It has the potential to address other emerging infectious diseases. Before I turn the call over to Bob Terifay, I would like to briefly highlight the impressive speed by which the Regeneron Genetics Center, or the RGC, has become a leader in the human genetics space. In October, we presented several abstracts at the American Society for Human Genetics meeting, which showed the potential of our unique approach, which integrates genomic data with electronic health records from a growing database of patient volunteers. We are currently on track to sequence over 100,000 individuals by early 2016, approximately two years after we launch this initiative. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Bob Terifay.
Robert J. Terifay: Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter was a significant one for Regeneron. EYLEA, or aflibercept injection, continued to demonstrate strong sales growth both in the United States as well as the rest of the world. In addition, in July, we launched Praluent, alirocumab in the United States, for the lowering of poorly-controlled low density lipoprotein cholesterol in certain high-risk patient groups. Praluent was also approved in September by European regulators. Starting with EYLEA, third quarter U.S. net sales growth was 65% year-over-year. Net U.S. EYLEA sales to distributors in the third quarter were $734 million. Underlying physician demand has continued to remain strong and grew sequentially quarter-over-quarter by 10%. A survey of 200 U.S. retinal specialists who evaluated the reported use of VEGF inhibitors in the third quarter of 2015, indicates that EYLEA growth in the quarter was driven largely by growth in diabetic macular edema or DME and macular edema following retinal vein occlusion. Third quarter net sales were also impacted by a slight increase in distributor inventory levels. I should note that fourth quarter net U.S. sales could be negatively impacted by several factors such as potential changes in inventory levels, seasonal fourth quarter holidays resulting in reduced offices and potential bad weather. According to our third quarter survey of retinal specialists, the market share of eyes treated with EYLEA in DME is roughly doubled that for ranibizumab and similar to that for off-label bevacizumab. Our market share of eyes treated for macular edema following retinal vein occlusion actually surpassed the individual shares for both bevacizumab and ranibizumab in the third quarter. Per the survey, EYLEA continues to be the market leading product among FDA approved anti-VEGF agents in all of our labeled indications in terms of market share of treated eyes. Outside of the United States where we share EYLEA profits with our collaborator, Bayer HealthCare, third quarter EYLEA net sales were $371 million, representing 34% year-over-year growth on a reported basis. This is notwithstanding substantial adverse currency impact. In constant currency, ex-U.S. EYLEA net sales in the third quarter grew 58% year-over-year. Regulatory and pricing approvals for new indications continued to contribute to ex-U.S. sales growth. For example, just this past week, Bayer HealthCare received regulatory approval in the EU for EYLEA for the treatment of visual impairment secondary to myopic choroidal neovascularization. Let's turn now to Praluent. While it is still very early in the launch, we are pleased with our operational implementation of the launch. The Regeneron and Sanofi field teams were fully trained and in physician offices on the first business day after approval. To date, we have jointly called on over 39,000 healthcare professionals and 4,600 healthcare professionals have participated in our educational programs. Over 4,000 prescribers have submitted prescriptions to MyPRALUENT, our reimbursement and patient services hub. Of all prescriptions received, approximately 90% of the prescriptions have been filled for our recommended 75-milligram low dose option. As reported by Sanofi, net sales to wholesalers in the third quarter were $4 million. As a reminder, the reimbursement environment is complex and will be carefully managed by payers. Our goal has been to ensure that payers and healthcare providers understand the value that Praluent can offer to patients. And to that end, we are actively engaged in extensive discussions with payers. We continue to emphasize to payers that physicians and patients should have choice in selecting a PCSK9 inhibitor. We expect that it will take several months for some commercial and government payers to conduct formulary reviews, make reimbursement coverage decisions, and to begin process of patient claims. Given these reasons, we expect an initial gradual uptake at launch. In response to potential delays in formulary decisions and reimbursement decisions, we are offering samples and free product to appropriate labeled patients who are awaiting an insurance coverage decision. This may delay uptake in commercial sales reporting. For example, for Medicare Part D or government-paid patients, there can be up to a six-month coverage decision period. So, for the next several quarters, performance cannot be judged based upon reported sales or filled prescriptions. We would expect that this would understate both the volume of physician and patient adoption. As a proxy for physician prescription demand, we are currently evaluating physician prescriptions submitted to the MyPRALUENT hub for reimbursement verification. In the third quarter of 2015, submissions were consistent with our expectations. Outside of the United States, Praluent was approved in the EU in September with some launches expected before year-end. As mentioned earlier, we recently submitted a BLA to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for sarilumab, our interleukin-6 or IL-6 inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis. We're actively preparing for a potential U.S. launch in 2016. As part of our prelaunch preparation, we will have a large presence at the upcoming American College of Rheumatology meeting in San Francisco this weekend. We also continue to prepare for the potential U.S. launch of dupilumab, our IL-4 and 13 inhibitor in 2017. For example, last month, at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology meeting in Copenhagen, hundreds of dermatologists participated in our educational symposium on atopic dermatitis. We are actively in the process of hiring internal commercialization team members for both sarilumab and dupilumab ahead of their potential launches. With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Landry.
Robert E. Landry: Thanks, Bob, and good morning to everyone. Regeneron posted strong financial results in the third quarter of 2015. In the third quarter of 2015, we earned $3.47 per diluted share from non-GAAP net income of $403 million, which represents year-over-year growth in non-GAAP diluted EPS and net income of 38% and 37%, respectively. Regeneron's third quarter 2015 non-GAAP net income excludes non-cash share-based compensation expense, non-cash interest expense related to our senior convertible notes, loss on extinguishment of debt in connection with conversions of a portion of our convertible notes during the quarter, and non-cash income taxes. Third quarter non-GAAP net income is based upon an estimated full year cash tax rate that reflects cash income taxes expected to be paid or payable for 2015. The difference between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings were primarily driven by non-cash share-based compensation expense and non-cash income taxes. And a full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is set forth in our earnings release. Total revenues in the third quarter of 2015 were $1.14 billion, which represented year-over-year growth of 57%. Net product sales were $738 million in the third quarter of 2015, compared to $449 million in the third quarter of 2014. EYLEA net product sales in the United States were $734 million in the third quarter of 2015, compared to $445 million in the third quarter of 2014, which represents an increase of 65%. During the third quarter of 2015, EYLEA experienced a slight increase in U.S. distributor inventory levels as compared to the second quarter 2015, but remained within our normal one to two-week targeted range. As Len mentioned earlier, we are raising our U.S. EYLEA net sales growth guidance for full year 2015 over 2014 to be between 50% and 55%, from our previous guidance of 45% to 50%. Ex-U.S. EYLEA sales were $371 million in the third quarter of 2015, as compared to $277 million in the third quarter 2014, representing a 34% increase on a reported basis. On an operational basis, or a constant currency basis, sales increased approximately 58%. Product revenue from ex-U.S. EYLEA sales is recorded by our collaborator, Bayer Healthcare. In the third quarter of 2015, Regeneron recognized $131 million from our share in net profits from EYLEA sales outside the United States. Total Bayer Healthcare collaboration revenue for the third quarter was $158 million. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $225 million for the third quarter of 2015. The total, the Sanofi collaboration revenue line, primarily consists of reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred R&D expenses, reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses, and our share of profits or losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies. As a reminder, while we get reimbursed for antibody-related commercial expenses that we incur, these, along with the commercial expenses that Sanofi spends on the antibodies, are included as expenses in the calculation of antibody profits and losses. In the third quarter of 2015, our share of losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies, primarily Praluent, was $75 million, which can be found in table four of our earnings release. Netted within this loss were the U.S. sales of Praluent for the quarter, as recognized by our partner Sanofi, of $4 million. Additionally, in connection with our new immuno-oncology collaboration with Sanofi, in the third quarter of 2015, we received $640 million in upfront payments from Sanofi, of which we recognized $20 million as collaboration revenue during the quarter. These non-refundable upfront payments were recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt, and are being recognized as revenue ratably over the related performance period, which is currently estimated to be approximately eight years. Note that the deferred revenue balance from these upfront payments as of the end of 2015 is currently anticipated to be approximately $600 million, and subject to taxation at the U.S. statutory rate in 2016. Turning now to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $362 million for the third quarter. Our unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as total GAAP R&D expense less R&D reimbursements from our collaborators and R&D non-cash share-based compensation expense, was $135 million for the quarter. Our press release includes all the information that is required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense. As a result of a growing number of unpartnered pipeline candidates and our having reached Sanofi's full year 2015 antibody discovery reimbursement level of $145 million during the first three quarters, we expect our unreimbursed R&D expense to continue to increase in the fourth quarter. Therefore, we are raising and tightening our guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to be in the range of $540 million to $560 million, from our previous guidance range of $510 million to $550 million. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $174 million for the third quarter, a sequential increase of 22% versus second quarter 2015 and 111% versus the third quarter of 2014. These percent increases are in line with our expectations and are primarily driven by the commercialization expenses to launch Praluent. We are tightening our guidance for non-GAAP SG&A to $630 million to $650 million, from our previous guidance range of $610 million to $650 million. As we've mentioned previously, in 2015, we began paying significant cash income taxes as compared to prior periods. Our non-GAAP tax rate for this quarter, as well as for all of 2015, is based on an estimate of the cash taxes paid or payable for the full year, which will be substantially lower than our GAAP effective tax rate. On a non-GAAP basis, our cash tax rate for the third quarter of 2015 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, was approximately 19% and 18%, respectively, of non-GAAP pre-tax income. As we approach year-end, we are tightening our cash tax guidance as a percentage of non-GAAP pre-tax income to be between 16% and 20% for 2015, from the previously provided range of between 15% and 22%. In September, we entered into a collaboration with Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation for our NGF antibody, fasinumab, which is in late stage development for osteoarthritis-related pain. Under the terms of the agreement, Mitsubishi will obtain exclusive development and commercial rights to fasinumab in Japan, Korea and nine other Asian countries, excluding China. The signing of this agreement did not have a material impact on the third quarter of 2015, nor will it materially impact the P&L for the full year 2015. In connection with the collaboration, we received a $10 million non-refundable upfront payment from Mitsubishi, which was deferred upon receipt and will be recognized ratably as revenue over the related performance period. We are also entitled to receive up to an aggregate of $65 million in payments for development milestones achieved by us, and $150 million in other contingent payments, primarily related to development milestones achieved by Mitsubishi. Our capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 were $500 million. This spend is slightly lower than expected and as a result, we are tightening and lowering our full year 2015 capital guidance to a range of $625 million to $675 million, from $675 million to $750 million. Our Raheen, Ireland commercial manufacturing site, which is under construction, continues to represent our largest capital investment in 2015, and is progressing as planned. This 400,000 square foot, state-of-the-art, biologics production facility is now operational, with the first production line on track to enter validation within a few months. In the third quarter, we also saw the completion and opening of two new buildings on our Tarrytown campus which has provided us with approximately 297,000 square feet of new laboratory and office space. We ended the third quarter of 2015 with cash and marketable securities of $1.58 billion. This reflects both the $640 million of upfront payments we have received from Sanofi related to our immuno-oncology collaboration, as well as a $400 million disbursement made to reduce the number of outstanding warrants originally issued in connection with the issuance of our senior convertible notes in 2011. Before I hand the call over to Michael for Q&A, let me reemphasize Len's comments regarding the important investment year 2016 is shaping up to be. This investment year will be anchored by the funding of Praluent during its first full year in the market and will also include preparing for the launch of multiple important new medicines that we plan to bring the patients specifically, sarilumab for RA and dupilumab for atopic dermatitis. With regards to R&D investment, we are planning for significant expenses related to our late-stage pipeline which includes: initiating in the first half 2016 the funding of 20% of dupilumab's Phase III clinical development cost for both the asthma and atopic dermatitis indications, assuming positive Phase III data is reported for dupilumab and atopic dermatitis; the continuation of funding 20% of Phase III studies in both Praluent and sarilumab; advancement of our Phase III REGN222 and fasinumab programs in progressing our early stage, un-partnered pipeline forward (30:46). In addition to incurring these investment expenses, it's important to remember that the intellectual property associated with our late-stage pipeline has been migrated offshore; thus these expenses will be incurred in foreign jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, which we expect will result in higher cash tax and effective tax rates for 2016. With that I'd like to turn the call back to Michael.
Michael Aberman, M.D.: Thank you, Bob. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call to Q&A. As we'd like to give as many people a chance to ask questions as possible, as always, we request you to limit yourself to one question. For other questions that you don't get to ask, our team will be available in our office after the call for follow-up questions. Thank you, and operator, if you could please open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our question. Our first question comes from the line of Ying Huang of Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Ying Huang: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on a great quarter for EYLEA. So, first I have a question on the formulary access for Praluent. You have got the branded Tier 2 preferred formulary access from Express Scripts. Should we expect a similar tiering for the other payers? And then some investors have been wondering that given this preferred status, branded Tier 2, you probably have to provide a sizeable rebate for Praluent. Is that the case? And the secondly, maybe for Bob Terifay here, you have been gaining share for EYLEA in both AMD and DMD (32:49)? In the fourth quarter, maybe you're saying that there are some headwinds here, but shall we assume that you'll continue to gain share from both off-label Avastin and also Lucentis? Thank you.
Michael Aberman, M.D.: Ying, thank you for your three questions.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.: Yeah, Ying, do you have one of those that you'd like us to answer? We'll take them all.
Ying Huang: You can pick one, Len.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.: Well, first of all, as formulary access, we've always stated and Bob has stated that the company believes what's best in this field for patients is that patients and doctors have a choice, and they are the ones who make the decision. And so, that's where we'd like to see things turn out. How things actually turn out and the size of rebates, et cetera, et cetera, is not something that we can predict or speculate or comment on at this time. If Bob wants to comment on the EYLEA gaining share or, go ahead Bob.
Robert J. Terifay: So obviously, we've been encouraged by the growth that we've seen, especially in DME with market share. Physicians have been very pleased with the outcomes of the independent Protocol T study which compared the three available products for DME in the marketplace, and have adopted EYLEA very rapidly there. To project where things are going to go in the future, Ying, I can't do that for you. So, we'll have to see how the market plays out.
Ying Huang: Thanks.
Michael Aberman, M.D.: Next question?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Schwartz of Leerink Partners. Your line is now open.
Joseph P. Schwartz: Thanks very much. You have two very large Phase II studies looking at PDGF and ANG2 in combination with EYLEA. So I was wondering if you could talk about how you're thinking about positioning the – or alternatively – are you looking to select one of these programs versus the other to take it to Phase III?
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.: Yeah. I'm sure this is going to be a data-driven decision, and we'll see what we get. George, you have anything further to add on that?
George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D.: Well, just as Len said, we let the data speak and help us guide our decision, so we can't predict how it will work out.
Joseph P. Schwartz: Does it make sense to target any different solutions (34:50) with ANG2 versus PDGF?
George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D.: We'll see.
Michael Aberman, M.D.: In terms of PDGF, as you probably know, it's not appropriate for use in diabetic macular edema. So certainly, the ANG2 has a broader potential application.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.: But at the end of the day, we have to look at the data and we don't have it yet.
Michael Aberman, M.D.: Next question?
Joseph P. Schwartz: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Terence C. Flynn: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. First, just on Praluent, can you comment at all of the prescriptions that have been submitted, what percent you'd expect to get filled? Or maybe to ask another way, what percentage meet the label criteria? And then just the second one is on the antibody for FOP. Just wondering what's gating to moving that into human and if we could see proof of concept data next year. Thanks.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.: So, I don't think we can get into the details – I'm not even sure we have all the details at that level of granularity. In this competitive environment, we probably can't even share them. Sorry about that, Terence. In terms of FOP, George, any feeling when we might be able to get that into patients?
George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D.: Yeah. I mean, certainly, we're moving it along. And I think, as with any complex setting like this in a rare disease, it's going to be – we're going to have to deal with the complexities of dealing with the patient population and also try and design the right clinical study where it's not clear that all the right endpoints and approaches have been defined to date. So, it's a complex problem, but we do think that there's a lot of reason for hope here. And we hope to do our best to bring the – to develop this in the right way and see if we can really make a difference in these patients' lives.
Michael Aberman, M.D.: Great. And the next question?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond of Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Christopher Raymond: Hey. Thanks. Just a question on Praluent. I wanted to clarify exactly the range of outcomes around this ODYSSEY outcomes interim look. I think this is the first time I think I've heard you guys overtly talk about this interim look in 2016. Last time, I think I heard you guys talk about it, you were saying that the DSMB would be taking this look and you'd be blinded. Can you maybe talk about if there's a chance that there could more detail? Thanks.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.: George, do you want to take that?
George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D.: Well, let me ask my man, Aberman here. Are we allowed to disclose the details on this?
Michael Aberman, M.D.: Yeah. There was a publication where these details were spelled out.
George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D.: All right. Thank you.
Michael Aberman, M.D.: So, if people want to look at that, they can. But I wouldn't – not everything – but yes.
George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D.: Okay. All right. So as you all know, this is an event-driven trial and it all depends on when the events actually occur and that's not entirely predictable. But the interim analyses are gated to occur when 50% of the events have occurred. That initial analysis will be an interim analysis by the Data Safety Monitoring Board for futility. And then when 75% of the events have occurred, there will be a second interim analysis for both futility and overwhelming efficacy.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.: So I don't think that we'll be expecting to get anything, any information that we can relay other than if something has been met and we get that information. Beyond that, these things sort of occur out of our sphere of influence and information. They just go on by the DSMB. Okay. Next question, Mike?
Michael Aberman, M.D.: Yeah. Next question?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adnan Butt of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Adnan S. Butt: Hey. Good morning, everyone. So, first on Praluent. One of the payers did not offer exclusivity. Could other payers take a similar approach, or could exclusivity still exist for others? And then on 2170, the combo PDGFR and EYLEA. Either Leonard or George, what kind of a benefit do you think would be of interest to clinicians over EYLEA alone?
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.: So, on the first question, I don't think there's any real correlation between what one payer does versus what another payer could or might do. Obviously, we continue to feel that patient and physician choice is the best way to go and we'd like to see all or most of the market, if possible, go in that direction. As far as what the patients – what doctors would like to see in any of these combination trials, it's always the two things; which is the potential for better efficacy or a longer duration of action with potentially less injections. George, anything to add to that?
George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D.: Yes. I do think that it's important to point out that, I mean, obviously, safety here will be key because of the longstanding experience with EYLEA in this space. And so I think that that will be the first thing people, physicians should not want to be endangering their patients' lives for a little bit of benefit. But if there is a benefit in the setting of good safety, I think it's important to point out that I think any benefit should be of interest to physicians, particularly because, in our approach, we will be providing both agents in a single intra-vigial (40:15) approach. So, for example, if physicians had to think about giving a second injection to gain just a little bit of efficacy, that would take maybe, a lot more thinking. But the fact that it's all provided in a single intra-vigial (40:29) injection, assuming that the safety is good, you would think that any benefit would then be adopted by the physicians and their patients.
Michael Aberman, M.D.: Great. Next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Roden of UBS. Your line is now open.
Matthew Roden: Great. Thanks very much for taking the picture – for taking the questions – and congrats on a nice quarter here again. George, big picture of question for you on how you think about the opportunities you have with your bispecifics, as it relates to other technologies out there like cellular therapies, CAR T, et cetera. CAR T has shown some pretty profound efficacy in some smaller studies, selective indications, but bispecifics, of course, have potential benefits on logistics, convenience, potential safety advantages, et cetera. But I guess when I think about cancer therapy, I always think about efficacy being paramount. So, can you talk about what you'd like to see from your bispecific programs, whether or not you think a similar level of efficacy is potentially achievable with bispecifics versus CAR T, and if not, whether or not the other advantages are sufficient to be important to patients. Thanks.
George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D.: Yeah. We agree with you. I mean, our goal is to have our bispecific program essentially achieve the sort of efficacies that one can imagine by genetically engineering the T cells themselves but also producing, and as you said, a logistically much more reasonable way, for more widespread utilization by physicians and patients. So, yeah, our target, our goal, and the science that's backing it up, is hoping that we are going to be achieving those levels of efficacy. It may not be an immediate – there may have to be combinations of bispecifics and so forth – but that is, indeed, the goal.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.: Yeah. Just to add one of the things that George, I think, has talked about publicly about this, is that bispecifics do add the advantage of better ability – not just convenience and logistics, but dose titration. George, maybe you want to comment on that?
George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D.: Yeah. That's also an important point in that, as we've seen with the CAR T cells, one will be able to, for example, slowly dial up the bispecific level to get more gradual kill, which could result in much better safety and efficacy in the patients. And also, in settings where one might want to withdraw treatment, either temporarily or permanently, you have those opportunities as well. So, as Len said, there is the possibility – and there's also the possibility of mixing and matching the right bispecifics, that one could get actually even better efficacy and improved safety and so forth. But of course, it's going to be a long process. There's going to be a lot of work to be done, and there's a lot of unknowns here. But we have a lot of potential here, we feel.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.: Yeah. And of course, building the whole pipeline of immuno-oncology under one program allows us, I guess, George, to do combinations which...
George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D.: Yeah. I think that that's the one thing that we are, perhaps, the most excited about is – it's not clear to me if anybody else has the toolkit – has built a toolkit over the years that we have here. And that we have here, in ways which are more easily, perhaps, matched and tested. So, that's one of the reasons we also have a lot of excitement about this program.
Michael Aberman, M.D.: Operator, next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison, Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Matthew K. Harrison: Great. Thanks very much for taking the question. I just wanted to go back to EYLEA and some of the potential headwinds that you guys had mentioned for the fourth quarter, and just make sure that we understood what you were trying to say. If you look at your guidance, obviously, at the high end of the range, there's some sequential growth, and at the sort of midpoint, it actually goes negative quarter-over-quarter. I'm just wondering, are you expecting a lot of inventory? Do you view your guidance as conservative? Or do you just think the seasonality that you've seen in years past, and you're sort of baking that into the number? Thanks.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.: So, we're trying to give the best guidance we can give based on the information we have, and while we've always said to you (44:58) that looking into the future is not necessarily the most productive thing one can do, but we do our best. And the fact is – Bob, you want to comment that you took into account?
Robert E. Landry: Yeah. I think historically, if you look even last year, when we had rapid growth occurring in diabetic macular edema, fourth quarter over third quarter growth did slow down. And it's related to a seasonality we see. We do see some inventory adjustments many times. We also have the holidays. And it's not just, for example, a Thanksgiving or a Christmas, it's the days preceding and the days following, where a number of the patients just don't want to go to the doctor's office around the holidays. So we see less visits and less injections. Len calls me the weatherman. I can't project what's going to happen with the weather, but we do have to take into account that the fourth quarter often does have storms, which also does impact office visits. So, that's why our guidance is the way it is; some growth on the high end, and some loss on the low end.
Michael Aberman, M.D.: Great. And next question please?
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.
Phil M. Nadeau: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the progress. First, one clarifying question. On your guidance for the interim analysis for Praluent in 2016, is that specifically referring to the first interim? And, when do you expect to see the second interim at 75% of events? And then second, on the scripts for Praluent. I know you said that they're not accurate. Your competitor, Amgen, is saying that, in their opinion, their scripts are becoming increasingly more accurate. Is the difference between you based on your sampling program specifically? Thanks.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.: Yeah. As far as the interim analyses, this is speculation, because it's not based on enrollment or time. It's based on the number of events. We think there's a good possibility that we could see both analyses during 2016, based on the event rate that we've seen. The first one is, George mentioned, would be for futility, and the second one would be for futility and overwhelming efficacy.
George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D.: And remember, you don't know what to root for because, if the drug works really well, you'll actually accrue events at a lower rate, so it's complicated.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.: Anyway, as far as – I don't think we have anything further to add on the Praluent story, Bob, unless you have any...?
Robert J. Terifay: I would caution you, if you look at the IMS prescription data, the numbers are very, very small right now. Both companies are offering samples and have bridge programs for patients who don't yet have insurance coverage, to allow patients to get access to the product while we're working with the payers to achieve coverage. So, it's hard – I wouldn't project anything off samples at this – or off RXs at this time.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.: And just remember, for example, as Bob mentioned I think in his remarks, that Medicare can take up to six months. And many of our – since one of our main indications is for people who have atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and insufficient lowering, with current therapies, of their LDL, many – since they have disease, many of these people are elderly, are Medicare, and they may not get coverage for six months, which would put us into the early part of next year.
Michael Aberman, M.D.: Next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
Mark Schoenebaum: Hey, guys. Thanks a lot for taking the question. And Lenny, just for the record, I thought this was fantastic, absolutely fantastic quarter. And I thought, for my question, I would just back up a little bit. And as one of the longest serving CEOs in big-cap biotech and big-cap pharma and small-cap biotech for that matter, just wondering if you could share some wisdom about what we're all hearing right now around drug pricing? And I think coming from the platform of Regeneron to opine on this is powerful because you're developing specialty medicines, primary care medicines, biologics across all different disease types including ultra-orphan, as well as things like obviously the PCSK9 canine antibody. So, what do you think is happening right now? Do you think the current price points of drugs are sustainable? Do you think the rate of inflation's got to decline? What's your sort of – what are your sort of thoughts on that, Len? Thank you.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.: Yeah. This is probably more than a 30 second comment. There's a lot of...
Mark Schoenebaum: I've got till 4:00 PM booked. So...
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.: Yeah. Well, we can take it offline because I do have a lot of thoughts on the subject of drug pricing. I am a big believer that we need pricing power in this industry. Pricing power comes from patents. I like to say, remember what President Lincoln said is, that patents add the fuel of interest to the fire of genius. And I think that basically translated into modern terms, capital being the fuel that fires things up here, capital is agnostic. And it will only go where we can get a good return. So, if we want innovation, we want new drugs, we have to figure out ways to make sure that it's attractive for investors, and that means to be able to reasonably price. On the other hand, to some respect, the pharmaceutical industry, maybe might say the biopharmaceutical industry, is reviled for lots of different reasons and is attacked from many different quarters, including some from my next door neighbor in town, Secretary Clinton, and sometimes for very good reason. There have been some scandalous things that are done in the industry. You read them about every day, and it's no surprise if you couple that with high prices that people get very disgusted with the industry. On the other hand, as I said, if you're an innovative company such as – that we are – innovation needs to be rewarded but you have to do it in a way where you create value for patients in the healthcare system. So, Mark I would like to just go back to – I'd like to say that we have a lot we can say on that issue – but I prefer changing the subject back to what I thought I heard you say which is we had a fantastic quarter, which is nice of you to say that. Next question.
Michael Aberman, M.D.: Thank you. Next question operator.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lyn Boyton (52:04) of Guggenheim. Your line is now open.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.: I think we lost that question.
Michael Aberman, M.D.: Why don't we go to the next person?
Operator: All right. Our next question comes from the line of John Newman of Canaccord.
John Newman: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question and my congrats on the quarter even if it's not – I suppose – as enthusiastic as Mark's, but great numbers. So, my question is a general question on Praluent. I'm just wondering, how do you think long-term about the compliance on the product? Because even with oral drugs, sometimes, unfortunately, patients don't take their medication but given the dosing interval for Praluent, I'm just curious when you think about the drug internally, what do you think about in terms of kind of the ranges of compliance that (52:57)?
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.: So, compliance for a drug that is preventative for a silent killer can be very difficult because people for lots of reasons don't want to think or admit that they have problems that need to be treated. They feel fine. Why do I have to take these medicines, et cetera, et cetera? In terms of specifically compliance for Praluent, the only thing – the only data that we have because it's too early to tell from the commercial world yet – the only data we have is from our clinical trials where, I believe, and Bob or George can correct me if I'm wrong, that the compliance for the injections was extremely high, even higher perhaps than for the concomitant statin therapy that people were on.
Robert J. Terifay: That is the situation with the clinical program. One thing I would say is that Praluent is an injectable specialty product. The nice thing about that is we have to refill the prescription by mail on a monthly basis to the patient. So, we have an opportunity to encourage patient adherence with the product on a monthly basis, actually with outbound calls or if the patient wants a text message or however. So, I do hope that with the constant contact with the patients, we will be able to add to the adherence. I will also say that at least from the clinical program, the safety profile for Praluent was very good so the patients were not feeling bad on the product which should also help with adherence.
George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D.: And I think it should also be pointed out that paradoxically, one should realize that there may be advantages vis-à-vis compliance with long-acting antibody drugs because if you're late by a day or even a week or longer with the dose, it's not like skipping even a day or let alone a week with one of these small molecule drugs where you completely lose your efficacy, because these are such long-acting drugs. So, I think that in terms of the biological effects and the ability, not that we would encourage it, but being late or even missing a dose, you can still retain long-term biological effects. And I think that that's – those sorts of effects of missing doses of short-acting drugs, obviously, that's been demonstrated in other fields such as in the hypertension field and so forth – so I think that that's something to consider as a major advantage for long-acting biologicals.
Michael Aberman, M.D.: Operator, another question?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your line is now open.
Geoffrey Meacham: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. It sounds like from Bob's comments in the prepared remarks that 2016 will be a big investment year. And I know you guys aren't a position to give guidance for next year, but I was hoping to maybe in broader brush strokes to get a sense as to what some of the bigger variables were as you look to next year? Thanks.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.: Yeah, Geoff. I think, if you go back over to transcript, what Bob referred to and what I was trying to direct you towards, is that we have a lot of investment related to the launch of Praluent. We have investment related to the ongoing ODYSSEY trials where we split 20%. In dupilumab, if in the early part of the year, if the Phase III are positive, we'll start picking up 20% of the expenses in the entire Phase III program for both atopic dermatitis as well as in asthma. And also, we'll be picking up prelaunch expenses for dupilumab. We also have some unpartnered assets in NGF and RSV and we also have the launch of sarilumab. So, those sorts of pipeline events, we think these are great investment opportunities because we think of the potential – if you think about the potential, for example, of dupilumab, we think that's a very high-potential product – and the rest of the pipeline has high potential. So, we have to make these investments. But clearly, we will be making them next year. Bob, did you want to add anything?
Robert E. Landry: Yeah. So, just to punctuate what Len said, I mean, again, it's the convergence of a lot of things, as Len kind of listed verbally and again, what's in our transcript all kind of coming to ahead in 2016. And again, it's also important that we've talked about the migration of our late stage antibodies, offshore. And again, a lot of our expenses related to these things will be taken in tax jurisdictions that are going to be lower than the federal statutory tax rates. So that will also have an impact with regards to ETR and cash tax rates. So again, it's all of these things together, all for – as a good story type message.
Michael Aberman, M.D.: Operator, we have time for one last question.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Cory W. Kasimov: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thank you for squeezing me in here. I wanted to ask more broadly on Praluent. Now that you've had three months on the market, are you able to gather and share any real-world feedback on the key aspects of Praluent's profile that's really resonating most with physicians? Or maybe said in other way, are there any early points of pushback aside from gaining broader coverage? Thanks a lot.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.: Yeah. I mean, I think, Bob has said in his talk and what's important to emphasize is that we have a low dose option and that's the recommended starting dose. And what we're seeing in our prescriptions is 90% of docs are opting for that recommended low 75-milligram starting dose, so we think that's resonating with physicians. Beyond that, I think it will kind of much further to say, it's too early.
Michael Aberman, M.D.: Thank you, everybody, for joining. Operator, this will be the conclusion of our call. And again, if you have any follow-up questions, please e-mail myself, Manisha, Colleen (59:00), on the IR team and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. That does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Have a great day, everyone.

Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Michael, and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us on the call and webcast today. The second quarter was yet another strong and successful quarter. EYLEA continued to show very impressive growth, and we achieved significant advances in our pipeline, which now has late-stage clinical programs across five diseases. And in the month of July, we launched Praluent, a first-in-class medicine for the treatment of elevated LDL cholesterol for US patients, and we entered into a strategic new collaboration with Sanofi in the exciting and evolving field of immuno-oncology. Financially, we delivered a strong quarter driven by top-line growth. On a worldwide basis, EYLEA delivered nearly $1 billion of sales in the second quarter. I think I'm going to say that again, it sounded good. On a worldwide basis, EYLEA delivered nearly $1 billion of sales in the second quarter. Based on the strong US EYLEA net sales in the second quarter, we are increasing our full year US EYLEA net sales guidance to be year-over-year growth of between 45% and 50% from the previously provided range of 30% to 35%. We are particularly pleased with the FDA approval of Praluent, which represents the fourth approved drug that was discovered at Regeneron labs led by my partner George Yancopoulos. We and our partner Sanofi have launched Praluent in the United States and are proud to bring an important new option to patients who struggle with elevated LDL cholesterol or bad cholesterol and the physicians who treat them. You will hear more about the ongoing launch from Bob Terifay. On the strategic front, we recently announced a major collaboration with Sanofi in immuno-oncology. We believe that these are early days in immuno-oncology, and the efficiency and sophistication of our VelociSuite technologies including our proprietary bispecific platform, combined with our capabilities in human genetics and our established partnership with Sanofi, make us uniquely positioned to accelerate the development of potential new immuno-oncology treatment options. You'll hear more about this from George from a scientific perspective and Bob Landry with just some of the financial implications of this collaboration. On the pipeline front, we have made steady progress. We now have 15 antibodies that are in clinical development, and we have late-stage programs in five different therapeutic areas: sarilumab for rheumatoid arthritis; dupilumab for atopic dermatitis and asthma; fasinumab for pain, and REGN2222 for RSV or respiratory syncytial virus. With that, let me turn the call over to Dr. George Yancopoulos, Regeneron's Chief Scientific Officer. He will be followed by Bob Terifay and then by Bob Landry. George?
George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist; President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer: Thank you, Len, and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us today. Before I talk about the pipeline, I want to offer my congratulations to all my colleagues at Regeneron as well as our partners for the continued success of EYLEA and the recent approval of Praluent and also acknowledge the many patients, investigators and physicians involved in all these efforts. Last week, we announced a major collaboration with Sanofi in the arena of immuno-oncology, and I'd like to begin by providing some additional details on the scientific and strategic aspects of this collaboration. Immuno-oncology has been a rapidly evolving area and has shown the potential to dramatically improve outcomes for patients with certain types of cancers. The current immuno-therapies which are delivered as monotherapy or in combination with traditional chemotherapy have yielded overall response rates in the 10% to 30% range. Many of these responses have been durable and have led to increased survival indications such as melanoma, kidney and lung cancer to date. While these data are incredibly exciting, we believe that the field is still in its early days. Our goal is to improve outcome in a range of different cancers. We believe that we are well positioned to deliver on this goal. We increasingly believe that the future of cancer medicine will involve innovative combinations of targeted medicines. We're cognizant of the fact that this is a crowded area with many players who have immuno-oncology assets that are more advanced. Nevertheless, we believe that the key to future successes in this complicated area is the efficiency and sophistication with which one can attempt and evaluate novel treatments and their combinations in novel settings. And we believe that we are well positioned to be competitive in this area. With Regeneron's unique biology, technology and genetics capabilities, we hope to be able to combine antibodies to multiple targets, adopt creative ways to use these antibodies as well as harness novel technologies such as biospecifics. In addition, access to our proprietary animal models allow us an early indication of which combinations are more likely to be successful in the clinic, which we think gives the collaboration an additional advantage. In terms of novel combination therapies, we have several immune targets such as LAG3 and GITR in late-stage preclinical development. Our PD-1, antibody which we anticipate might be the foundation of several combination therapies has already demonstrated evidence of activities in early clinical trials. In addition, we believe that our novel and proprietary bispecific platform will deliver additional opportunities for both monotherapy and combination approaches. Our first is bispecific, a CD20xCD3 antibody, which is outside of the Sanofi collaboration, has already demonstrated activity in early human trials and could potentially pave the way for multiple additional bispecifics to enter the clinic in the coming years. These other potential bispecific antibodies are included in our immuno-oncology collaboration with Sanofi. Bob Landry will review the financial aspects of the collaboration shortly, but let me highlight some of the key aspects of the deal, and in particular, the differences from the existing antibody collaboration. As a reminder, in the existing collaboration, Sanofi provides funding for pre-clinical discovery and development work up through filing of an investigational new drug or IND application, at which point Sanofi can either opt in or not for these antibodies. During that pre-clinical work, Regeneron has final say over all activities. If Sanofi opts in, Sanofi funds 100% of the clinical development cost and also has final say over clinical development and commercial activities. Under the new immuno-oncology collaboration, Sanofi's right to opt in is later, at clinical proof of concept, which means Regeneron has greater control of development through a later stage. In addition, after opt in, unlike the existing collaboration, Regeneron retains the leading global development role and lead commercialization role in the US for half of the antibodies on an alternating basis beginning with PD-1. Obviously, there's an incredible amount of trust that has been built through the many years of the Sanofi collaboration that allows such an arrangement, and we look forward to working with Sanofi on building an immuno-oncology franchise. In terms of late-stage antibodies, let me begin with our most advanced program, sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody which is in clinical studies for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. In the second quarter, we reported positive data from three additional Phase 3 trials, including the SARIL-RA TARGET study of sarilumab in combination with non-biological disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, or DMAR therapy, in patients who are inadequate responders to or intolerant of TNF-alpha inhibitors. These data are in addition to the previously reported data from the Phase 3 MOBILITY study where sarilumab demonstrated positive results in both signs and symptoms as well as in radiographic progression. We're on track to submit a BLA in the US by year-end, and a regulatory submission in Europe towards the end of next year. One of the most exciting late-stage product candidates in our pipeline is dupilumab, our IL-4/13 pathway blocking antibody which is in clinical studies in multiple indications. Our pivotal Phase 3 studies in the atopic dermatitis indication are fully enrolled and we expect to report data from these studies in the first half of next year. Our second pivotal study of dupilumab in asthma is currently enrolling patients. This Phase 3 study will explore two doses of dupilumab, 200-milligram and 300-milligram, administered every other week. As we have mentioned previously, following discussion with the FDA, we will only need to conduct this one additional Phase 3 efficacy study in this indication since our Phase 2b trial will be considered pivotal. Our Phase 2 study of dupilumab in the eosinophilic esophagitis is ongoing and currently enrolling patients. Turning now to our other late-stage programs. NURSERY-PreTerm, our first Phase 3 trial of our antibody for RSV, is enrolling patients in the Southern Hemisphere where the RSV season is from May through October. A second Phase 3 trial in this indication is planned for later this year in the Northern Hemisphere. I'm happy to report that fasinumab, our NGF antibody, is now in Phase 2b/3 clinical trials. We expect to hear from the FDA in the second half about the partial clinical hold, which if lifted, will allow us to conduct studies that are longer than 16 weeks in duration. Our EYLEA combination trials are ongoing. A Phase 2 trial of EYLEA co-formulated with our PDGF receptor antibody is underway and has been granted fast-track designation for the treatment of wet AMD. Our Phase I combination study of EYLEA co-formulated with our ANG2 antibody is also ongoing, and we expect to report data from this study later this year. The Regeneron Genetics Center continues to make progress, anchored by our foundational collaboration with Geisinger Health System. We currently have about a dozen additional collaborations across a variety of therapeutic areas and remain on track to sequence 100,000 individuals by the end of this year. With that update, I'd like to turn this call over to Bob Terifay.
Robert J. Terifay - Senior Vice President, Commercial: Thank you, George, and good morning everyone. This is a very exciting time in the history of Regeneron. Almost four years after its initial US launch, EYLEA or our aflibercept injection continues to demonstrate strong sales growth. In addition just last month, Praluent or alirocumab received US regulatory approval for the lowering of poorly controlled low density lipoprotein cholesterol in specific high-risk patient groups, and was shortly thereafter made available to patients who need it. Praluent was also given a positive recommendation by the European regulators, with EU approval expected in September. Starting this with EYLEA. Second quarter US net sales grew 58% year-over-year. Net US EYLEA sales to distributors in the second quarter were $655 million. Underlying physician demand has continued to remain strong and grew sequentially quarter-over-quarter by 19%, representing the highest sequential quarter-over-quarter growth that we've experienced since the third quarter of 2012. Market research with retinal specialists indicates that a key driver of EYLEA growth in the second quarter is the continued positive impact of the results of the Protocol T study in patients with diabetic macular edema or DME. As a reminder, this independent NIH-sponsored study explored the comparative effectiveness of EYLEA with ranibizumab and off-label bevacizumab and demonstrated that EYLEA provided greater efficacy despite one fewer injection and fewer laser treatments. The efficacy differences were particularly pronounced in the pre-specified group of patients whose vision was worse at study initiation. This group represents about 50% of all DME patients. These data have been viewed very positively by physicians and payers and were one of the biggest drivers of strong EYLEA growth in the second quarter. According to a survey of 200 retinal specialists evaluating the reported usage of VEGF inhibitors in the second quarter of 2015 as well as a chart audit from 183 retinal specialists, EYLEA is now the market-leading product among FDA approved anti-VEGF drugs in all of our labeled indications. With our share of eyes growing quarter-over-quarter versus ranibizumab in DME and macular edema following retinal vein occlusion and remaining consistent relative to ranibizumab in the last quarter in wet AMD. Likewise, overall EYLEA is gaining market share from bevacizumab especially in DME. The share gain is coming from both switches as well as new patient starts. Lastly, EYLEA growth is also coming from penetration into new physician practices that previously did not use EYLEA. Outside of the United States where we share EYLEA profits with our collaborator, Bayer HealthCare, second quarter EYLEA sales were $338 million, representing a 37% growth year-over-year on a reported basis, notwithstanding substantial adverse currency impact. In the second quarter, Bayer HealthCare received regulatory approval in Japan for EYLEA for the treatment of macular edema secondary to retinal vein occlusion or RVO. Turning now to Praluent. Since it's only been 10 days since US approval, it's too early for me to provide any meaningful specifics about the ongoing launch. We are however pleased with our operational implementation of the launch. We received FDA approval for Praluent on Friday afternoon, July 24. We created and trained the field forces on the final customer-facing materials, certified them on contact, and made all launch materials available to the field teams over the weekend following approval. We had a full-field force deployment on Monday, July 27. We actually had our first prescription forms submitted to our reimbursement and patient services hub called MY Praluent on Sunday night, July 26. From the information that we have, it appears that the first patient dosed with commercial Praluent occurred on Monday morning, July 27. I'd also like to spend some time talking about the eligible patient population for Praluent. We are gratified that the Food and Drug Administration has recognized a significant unmet medical need in a broad group of indicated patients, those with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, which includes patients with a history of acute coronary syndromes or myocardial infarction, stable or unstable angina, coronary or other arterial revascularization, stroke or transient ischemic attack, or peripheral arterial disease presumed to be of atherosclerotic origin. These patients are receiving maximally tolerated statin therapy and are not at their LDL-C goal. Praluent is also indicated for patients with a history of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia receiving maximally tolerated statin therapy whose conditions are diagnosed based upon a combination of cholesterol levels, physical manifestations, family history, and genetic testing. Our health economics analysis indicates that there are approximately 8 million to 10 million patients in the United States who could be eligible for PCSK9 inhibitor therapy. However, maximally tolerated statin therapy will and should remain the mainstay of therapy. With our educational efforts, we believe that more patients will likely go on and stay on statins, and therefore may be able to get to their goal on statin therapy alone. Other factors that will contribute to reduce the size of the actual PCSK9 inhibitor market include the resistance of some physicians to use biologic therapy for LDL-C reduction, physicians' reluctance to take on responsibility for prior authorization documentation, patients' unwillingness to inject themselves, and ongoing low physician and patient urgency to get LDL cholesterol under control. As I've stated previously, the reimbursement environment is complex and will be carefully managed. Our goal has been to ensure that payers and healthcare providers understand the value that Praluent can offer to patients. And to that end, we are actively engaged in extensive discussions with payers. We expect that it will take several months for some commercial and government payers to conduct formulary reviews, make reimbursement coverage decisions, and begin to process patient claims. Given these reasons, we expect an initial gradual uptake at launch. In response to potential delays in formulary decisions and reimbursement decisions, we're offering samples and free product to appropriate labeled patients who are waiting an insurance coverage decision. This may delay uptake in commercial sales reporting. For example, for Medicare Part D or government pay patients, there could up to a six-month coverage decision period. So for the next several months, performance cannot be judged based upon reported sales. This would understate both the volume of physician and patient adoption. Outside of the United States, Praluent has received a positive opinion from the European CHMP with approval expected in late September. Our 18,000 patient ODYSSEY outcomes study is ongoing and we expect this study to be fully enrolled by year-end with completion expected by the end of 2017. Turning now to sarilumab. The IL-6 inhibitor class has shown consistent double-digit growth in the United States year-over-year. If sarilumab is approved, it will be the second entrant in this class. With the availability of second agent in the class, we anticipate that increased awareness and education should contribute to further class growth. We also continue on our pre-commercialization efforts for dupilumab. For example in June, we had a major presence at the World Congress of Dermatology meeting in Vancouver, British Columbia. With an educational booth and symposium focused on the pathophysiology of and impact of atopic dermatitis. With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Landry.
Robert E. Landry - Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Bob, and good morning to everyone who has joined us today. Regeneron posted another strong financial performance in the second quarter of 2015 and we are very pleased with our financial results for the first half of the year. In the second quarter of 2015, we earned $2.89 per diluted share from non-GAAP net income of $338 million, which represents year-over-year growth in both non-GAAP diluted EPS and net income of 17%. Regeneron's second quarter 2015 non-GAAP net income excludes noncash share-based compensation expense, noncash interest expense related to our senior convertible notes, loss on extinguishment of debt in connection with conversions of a portion of our convertible notes during the quarter and non-cash income taxes. Second quarter non-GAAP net income reflects cash income taxes expected to be paid or payable for 2015. A full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is set forth in our earnings release. Total revenues in the second quarter of 2015 were $999 million, which represented year-over-year growth of 50%. Net product sales were $658 million in the second quarter of 2015 compared to $418 million in the second quarter of 2014. EYLEA net product sales in the United States were $655 million in the second quarter of 2015 compared to $415 million in the second quarter of 2014, which represents an increase of 58%. During the second quarter of 2015, EYLEA experienced a slight decrease in US distributor inventory levels as compared to the first quarter 2015 but remains within our normal one to two week targeted range. I also want to note that despite having launched almost four years ago, EYLEA experienced sequential dollar sales growth this past quarter of $114 million, the largest in the product's history. As Len mentioned earlier, we are raising our US EYLEA net sales growth guidance for full-year 2015 over 2014 to be between 45% and 50% from our previous guidance of 30% to 35%. Ex-US EYLEA sales were $338 million in the second quarter of 2015 as compared to $247 million in the second quarter of 2014 representing a 37% increase on a reported basis. On an operational basis, our constant currency basis sales increased approximately 64%. Sequentially, sales grew 17% when comparing second quarter 2015 versus first quarter 2015 on an operational basis. Product revenue from ex-US EYLEA sales is recorded by our collaborator, Bayer HealthCare. In the second quarter of 2015, Regeneron recognized $107 million from our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the United States. Bayer HealthCare collaboration revenue for the second quarter was $134 million. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $195 million for the second quarter of 2015. The Sanofi collaboration revenue line item primarily consists of reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred R&D expenses, reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses, and our share of profits or losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies. As a reminder, while we get reimbursed for antibody-related commercial expenses that we incur, these along with the commercial expenses that Sanofi spends on the antibodies are included as expenses in the calculation of antibody profits and losses. In the second quarter of 2015, our share of losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies, primarily Praluent, was $46 million. This can be found in table four of our earnings release. Turning now to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $330 million for the second quarter. Our unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as the total GAAP R&D expense less R&D reimbursements from our collaborators and R&D non-cash share based compensation expense, was $110 million for the quarter. Our press release includes all the information that is required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense. Given the unreimbursed R&D expense for the first six months of 2015 and in light of the additional reimbursements associated with the recently executed immuno-oncology collaboration, we are lowering and tightening our guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to be in the range of $510 million to $550 million, which is lower than our previous guidance of $525 million to $575 million. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $142 million for the second quarter. As you might have noted, this is a significant increase when compared to the first quarter 2015. As we have said before, this was driven by higher commercialization expenses in anticipation of the launch of Praluent. For the full year, we project non-GAAP SG&A expenses to be between $610 million and $650 million, which is lower than our previous guidance of $650 million to $725 million. To be clear, the new SG&A guidance does not reflect any planned change in the combined investment we and our partner Sanofi are spending on the launch and commercialization of Praluent, but rather results from more of these expenses being incurred by Sanofi than by Regeneron. Non-GAAP cost of goods sold was $60 million for the quarter. The components of this line item include the costs in connection with producing EYLEA commercial supplies, start-up expenses associated with our Limerick manufacturing site, and the most substantial component, the royalty expense in connection with our agreement with Genentech related to US EYLEA sales. As reiterated in earlier quarters, we are obligated to pay this royalty until May 2016, at which the point the payments will end. As we had mentioned on last quarter's call, in 2015 we began paying significant cash income taxes as compared to prior periods. Our non-GAAP tax rate for this quarter and for the full year 2015 is based on an estimate of the cash taxes paid or payable which will be substantially lower than our GAAP effective tax rate. On a non-GAAP basis, our cash tax rate for the second quarter of 2015 and for the six months ended June 30, 2015 was approximately 23% and 18% respectively of non-GAAP pre-tax income. The increase to the second quarter rate versus first quarter 2015 reflects an increase in our projected annual cash tax rate. This increase is due to a higher forecasted full year non-GAAP income before tax related to higher estimated US EYLEA net sales and cash taxes paid or payable on a portion of the upfront payments we will receive in connection with our new immuno-oncology collaboration with Sanofi. In addition, this quarter includes incremental cash tax related to first quarter earnings as the cash tax forecast in the first quarter used a lower estimated full-year cash tax rate. Primarily as a result of these changes, we are raising and tightening our cash tax guidance as a percentage of non-GAAP pre-tax income to be between 15% and 22% for 2015 from the previously provided range of between 10% to 20%. In light of our recent immuno-oncology collaboration with Sanofi, I'd like to discuss how you should model some of these financial components of this collaboration. As was outlined in an earlier press release, Sanofi has committed to an initial investment of up to $2.17 billion, which includes $640 million in upfront payments and a potential sales milestone of $375 million to Regeneron. Regeneron currently anticipates that the nonrefundable upfront payments will be recorded as deferred revenue that is recognized over the related performance period beginning in the third quarter of 2015. Note that the deferred revenue balance from these upfront payments as of the end of 2015 is anticipated to be subject to taxation for cash tax purposes in the US in 2016. In terms of expenses, we will recognize immuno-oncology collaboration research and development expenses in our P&L in the quarter in which they occur and also recognize as Sanofi collaboration revenue the portion of these R&D expenses that are reimbursable by Sanofi, similar to our antibody collaboration. Accordingly, Regeneron will continue to incur unreimbursed R&D for its portion of the R&D that remains unfunded. These obligations include the following: Regeneron will spend up to approximately $1.1 billion under the immuno-oncology collaboration discovery agreement and Sanofi will reimburse us for up to $825 million of these costs. Regeneron and Sanofi will equally fund post proof-of-concept development for clinical programs, for which we are considered the development and US commercialization lead. For REGN2810, our PD-1 antibody that is currently in clinical development, a separate $650 million commitment has been established that will be equally funded by both companies. Regeneron is the development and commercial lead in the US for this program. In addition, Sanofi will fund 100% of any development costs associated with the immuno-oncology clinical programs for which they are considered the development and global commercialization lead. Regeneron's recently filed 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2015, and a Form 8-K filed on July 31, 2015, provides further disclosure of our recent immuno-oncology collaboration with Sanofi. Our capital expenditures for the first half of 2015 were $354 million. Given the first half spend and our remaining outlook, we are tightening our 2015 capital expenditure guidance to a range between $675 million to $750 million from $650 million and $750 million. Our Raheen, Ireland, commercial manufacturing site, which is under construction, continues to represent our largest capital investment in 2015 and continues to progress as planned. Additionally, both the first half 2015 expenditures and full year 2015 guidance includes infrastructure expansions related to increasing our manufacturing capacity in Rensselaer as well as the ongoing expansion of our Tarrytown R&D and corporate headquarters in order to meet our continual growth outlook. We ended the second quarter of 2015 with cash and marketable securities of $1.19 billion. With the recent execution of the immuno-oncology collaboration, we are expecting receipt of the $640 million in upfront payments from Sanofi shortly. As we have been reporting, we have been opportunistically repurchasing the warrants that we issued in 2011 in connection with our convertible debt. We intend to continue repurchasing these warrants up to an aggregate amount of $400 million. With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Michael.
Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations: Thank you, Bob. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call to Q&A. As we'd like to give as many people a chance to ask questions as possible, we request you limit yourself to one question. Bob Landry and the IR team will be available after the call for follow-up questions. Thank you. Operator, you can please open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. Good morning, guys. Congratulations for a great quarter. The first question on the strength of EYLEA in this quarter. Bob, maybe can you give us a little bit more color in terms of whether you also see more penetration in AMD rather than just in DME and where that share is coming from? And then secondly, just a question on Praluent. CVS' CEO just said on the earnings call this morning that they plan to employ a similar strategy to the so-called formulary exclusion strategy to manage their PCSK9. So, I was wondering what's your strategy if that happens actually from the payers. And then just a housekeeping question, are you going to block the IMS subscripts for Praluent or not? Thank you.
Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations: That was three questions, Ying. So bad instruction following.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: All right. Bob Terifay, please.
Robert J. Terifay - Senior Vice President, Commercial: Well in terms of EYLEA growth, the bulk of the growth is coming in DME, both in terms of growing the DME market overall for the anti-VEGF class, as well as taking market share from both Lucentis as well as bevacizumab. We do see some growth in RVO and some slight growth in wet AMD. But the majority of the growth that we're seeing is in DME. In terms of your questions on Praluent, it's too early to talk specifically about payers, but we've always expected that the payers are going to want patients to step through maximally tolerated statin therapy in order to get access to Praluent. And that is our labeling. And so, it's not a surprise that people are advocating for patients to have been on maximally tolerated statin therapy. The IMS data, yes, we intend to utilize IMS data. So, you will see the IMS data in the audits.
Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations: Okay. Next question. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just another one on EYLEA for DME. You mentioned you're seeing new prescribers there. Are those retinal specialists or is there a broader category here? And then do you have any insight on referral trends from either ophthalmologists or endos to retinal specialists of DME patients? Thanks.
Robert J. Terifay - Senior Vice President, Commercial: So, the new practices are generally smaller ophthalmology practices that were rebuying Avastin because they were not familiar with all the reimbursement techniques in terms of buy and bill. But with the recent DME data, there's more interest in utilizing EYLEA. With regards to referrals, as we've talked about on the last couple of calls, we are actively working with ophthalmologists as well as optometrists to build awareness of the need for regular screening for eye exams and to get patients to retinal specialists as soon as DME is diagnosed. And we're hoping some of the is starting to pay off.
Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations: Next question?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the bispecific in the PD-1. On the past two calls you've characterized responses that you seen with those patients. I don't know if you'd be willing to give us some more detail around that. And if you're not, could you tell us when we might see that data? Is it possible to see that data at ASH this year? Thanks.
George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist; President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer: Yeah. We're waiting for the appropriate medical conference in which to provide more detail Thanks.
Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations: Next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Mohit Bansal - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my question. This is Mohit filling in for Robyn. Congratulations on a great quarter. So, turning a little bit on your RSV program, could your Phase 3 trial be a pivotal trial given the plan is to enroll 24 patient in this trial? And what is the baseline risk of developing RSV in the babies you are enrolling in this trial? Thank you.
Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations: I think you're asking about the RSV pivotal trials, whether it's Phase 3 and the last one the risk of enrolling infants or?
Mohit Bansal - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So, the baseline risk of developing RSV in these patients. So because I mean, it seems like a natural history kind of study. That's why I am asking.
George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist; President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer: Right. No. These are considered to be pivotal studies and we've discussed very carefully with the FDA in terms of the infant population which is in fact intended to be a somewhat broader population of infants at risk. Thank you.
Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations: Next question.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Bernstein. Your line is open.
Geoffrey Craig Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. Appreciate the chance to ask a question. George, can I just throw a couple of questions to, first, on the immuno-oncology side, you mentioned both that you have opted in and will be the commercialization partner for the PD-1, but also alluded to the fact that you may have a PD-L1. Could you give us a sense of your view of the relative merits of a PD-1 and a PD-L1, because superficially you might say that that was overkill. And then just on the RSV, again could you explain where you are in terms of having a final manufacturing process to take into pivotal trials? I mean, are you there yet? Can you scale up with the process you have?
George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist; President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer: Yeah. On the first question, we certainly feel that the signs suggest and maybe the early clinical data suggest that if anything PD-1, if anything should have somewhat broader efficacy than PD-L1. On the other hand, there may be some patients who might be able to tolerate a PD-L1 better in settings where for example, they maybe getting some toxicity due to for example inhibition of PD-L2. So we think it might be useful to have both components, but certainly we think that PD-1 should be more likely the broader foundational therapy. On the second question, yeah, we're using our standard manufacturing approach, which we've used for all of our other clinical programs for RSV. So, we think it's certainly commercializable.
Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations: Great. Next question.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adnan Butt with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Adnan S. Butt - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey. Thanks. Congrats on the solid EYLEA number as well. So first, could you comment on the scale and scope of the sampling program? Will it require the same pre-authorization process that we would be expected of a paid script? And then is there a two-year follow-up of Protocol T data as well? And is that going to be as meaningful? Thanks.
Robert J. Terifay - Senior Vice President, Commercial: So in terms of the sampling, we have to obviously obtain physicians' signatures to be able to get access to the samples, but then it is up to the physician to determine which patients get access to the therapy.
George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist; President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer: In terms of Protocol T, yes, there will be two-year data and certainly we're very interested in seeing what that data will look like.
Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations: Great. Next question.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of John Newman with Canaccord. Your line is open, please go ahead.
John Newman - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question and I'd like to add my congrats on the EYLEA number, very strong. My question is regarding the development strategy for both PD-1 and PD-L1. We've seen a few companies around the fringes running studies in combination with – or running studies where two investigational drugs are being tested at the same time. And I'm just curious if that might be a strategy that you would discuss with the agency that could allow you to sort of maybe leapfrog some of your competition in the PD-1 and the PD-L1 space. Thanks.
George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist; President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer: Yeah. We are certainly exploring that opportunity. We agree with you that that is frankly going to be a necessary approach for the entire field to make appropriate progress in this very complex setting. So, I'm sure that we and a lot of other people are thinking and considering that approach.
Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations: Great. Next question.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Schwartz with Leerink Partners. Your line is open.
Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations: You may be on mute, Joe.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Joe, you might be.
Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations: Or fell asleep.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We'll come back to Joe.
Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations: Next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Unknown Speaker: Hi, guys. This is John (41:10) filling in for Mark. Congrats on the quarter. Just a quick one on the RSV program, if I may. So, I think you previously mentioned the half-life of the antibody could result in, so less frequent dosing. I was wondering if you've disclosed the dosing regimen of the antibody in Phase 3. Is it in fact less frequent than Synagis? Are you doing once per season dosing? And then really fast on IO. I'm trying to better understand how the logistics of alternating the lead programs work. So, is it by order of filed INDs, or is it by when Sanofi opts in to the collaboration? And how would that work for a combination regimen? Thanks.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Michael can take the second one. Then we'll go back to.
Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations: Yeah, that will be alternating at the time of opting in. And there is a mechanism for how to deal with combinations where you're combining two different products either in the discovery program or the license side. I don't know if I want to get into that detail. Perhaps after the call.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: But this is a good time to say that. This is Len. Our relationship with Sanofi, as George said in his opening remarks, has really been quite spectacular and has been built on many, many years of closely collaborating on every aspect of what we do, from discovery, to early development, to full development through scale up, and through commercialization now with Praluent. So I think the partners know how to work together, and this will be handled rather straight forwardly. The basic concept from your vantage point is that on half the programs, we'll be taking the lead, on half the programs they'll be taking the lead.
George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist; President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer: Yeah, just to elaborate on what Len says, I mean, we've done it before. We're going to just do what's right for the program. And we don't necessarily follow the contract because we have such a good relationship with Sanofi. If it makes sense not to alternate as per what's in the contract, we'll do what's right for the program. In terms of RSV, yeah, we are certainly exploring less frequent dosing regimens in the pivotal studies and we have reason to believe that they might work, so we're hoping that the data might support that.
Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations: Thanks, John (43:23). Next question?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Skorney with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Colleen Hanley - Robert W. Baird & Co.: Hi. This is Colleen Hanley in for Brian Skorney. Thanks for taking my questions. Two quick ones for you on Praluent. How will Praluent be distributed? Will it be through retail distributor or special channel? And you touched on this a little bit before, but do you think IMS prescription data services will be good surrogates for sales or will distribution be so selective that you can't really offer a decent capture rate? Thanks.
Robert J. Terifay - Senior Vice President, Commercial: So, I'll start with the IMS, it's going – as I said earlier, it's going to take several months for us to get to a sales reporting that is reliable based upon it taking some time to get reimbursement, patients being on samples, and patients being on free product. So when the IMS data comes out later this week, it's not going to be terribly reliable. It will improve over time. But again remember, not all of the specialty pharmacies report to IMS, so some of the data are projected. So obviously, ultimately it's going to be our actual sales data that are going to be more reliable. In terms of Praluent distribution, we are distributing through a network of specialty pharmacies.
Colleen Hanley - Robert W. Baird & Co.: Okay. Thank you.
Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations: Great. Good questions, the next questions please?
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking the questions. I wanted to ask about the IO collaboration as well. So in addition to in-house combinations, will you also be looking outside of the Regeneron and Sanofi pipelines for potential combos? And do you have any residual concerns that IP potentially becomes an issue given the land grab that's currently going on in the field? Thanks.
Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations: I'll – the first question, the answer is yes. We will be exploring all opportunities for combinations. So I don't have specifics, but there's no reason why we couldn't look outside the collaboration for novel combinations. That said, thankfully for us, we have George and his team and we have a plethora of things to do internally. And so those will probably definitely take precedence. In terms of IP, Len? Standard answer.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I don't think – we look at IP very carefully. We're pretty experienced and been in the antibody IP business for a long time. And we should just leave it at that.
Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Okay. Thanks guys.
Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations: Next question?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Schwartz with Leerink Partners. Your line is open.
Joseph P. Schwartz - Leerink Partners LLC: Thanks for coming back to me. I was wondering if you could give us some insight into what is it about the IO antibodies that you're pursuing that makes you so enthusiastic about the potential to obtain better responsiveness or safety and tolerability? Yeah, you alluded to the response rates, that it sounds like you think you can improve upon it. Is it higher affinity for the target as was the case with dupilumab, other aspects of the technology that you can offer us some insight into your approach there?
George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist; President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer: Well, I think what's going to be required for success here is a really comprehensive approach and bringing to bear many different antibody candidates in the right settings, in the right combinations. And we have not only some of the more carefully characterized targets covered, but we also have a large number of innovative and novel targets. And we think that there's going to be a little bit of magic and maybe a certain degree of luck and a lot of science involved in figuring how to best do this. And this is what we think that we're historically strong at. So this is why we think that this is a great opportunity, because it is so early in the game here and it's going to be a complex business and the complexity I think plays to our advantages.
Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations: Next question?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gbola Amusa with Chardan Capital. Your line is open.
Gbola Amusa - Chardan Capital Markets LLC: Hi. Thank you for taking my call. Gbola Amusa from Chardan Capital. On EYLEA, on the beat, could you just confirm where dosing has gone year-over-year? We've seen for the overall market for example, dosing has gone from four per year to five to six to seven. So could you confirm that there weren't major changes there? And then secondly on your economic interest in wet AMD through gene therapy with your Avalanche stake and partnership, could you give any thoughts on the recent Phase 2a data on wet AMD? Or if it's too early for that, would you give us a sense on when we may get more visibility on your intentions with that program?
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Right. So, in terms Avalanche, Mike, you might want to comment on that.
Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations: Yeah. My comment will be, we're not going to comment on that. We'll let the process go out and you'll hear from Avalanche.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I might just remind everybody that the prime mover of the Avalanche deal for us was to get a look into gene therapy for eye diseases where there is no standard of care already and where gene therapy would be uniquely positioned as a therapeutic choice. So therefore, the risks, rewards of the programs would be greater. Nevertheless as Michael says, we will look at and review this data as we expect to.
Robert J. Terifay - Senior Vice President, Commercial: In terms of EYLEA dosing, we're trending very close to what we see in our prescribing information which is dosing every eight weeks. I'll remind you, if you look at the number of doses per year in the Protocol T trial, which had a different dosing regimen, they lined up pretty closely to what we saw in our own DME studies. So physicians are generally after an initial loading dose period, able to get patients out for at least eight weeks.
Gbola Amusa - Chardan Capital Markets LLC: Okay, so -
Robert J. Terifay - Senior Vice President, Commercial: No year-over-year – apologies, no year-over-year change drove the beat effectively. It was -
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So you're asking the question do we have more doses, which is driving the increase. No, we're not seeing more doses drive, per year driving net sales.
Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations: Great. And our next question.
Gbola Amusa - Chardan Capital Markets LLC: Great. Thank you.
Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations: Thanks, Gbola. Next question.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
Phil M. Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Let me add my congratulations on all the progress. Just a question on dupilumab and atopic dermatitis. In the adult pivotal program, can you remind us what you need to file? Can you file on the 16-week data, or do you need to wait for the 52-week data? And then similarly on atopic dermatitis for kids, what is the update on the pediatric development plan, and when could you start pivotal trials there? Thanks.
George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist; President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer: So in terms of the filing, we expect to have to do the 16-week data from two of the trials, but we'll expect to have one-year data from the longer-term trial for the initial filing. So we'll have thousands of patients in that initial filing.
Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations: The other question is pediatrics.
George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist; President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer: Oh, pediatrics. I'm sorry. Those pediatric PK and other preparatory studies as well as getting into actual efficacy studies is really ongoing. There was a panel, a conference on this and the idea was that we should be moving sooner rather than later and not waiting for the outcome of our Phase III data to move into what can be fairly devastating conditions for pediatric patients. So that program is ongoing.
Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations: All right. Next question?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Your line is open.
Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. A couple on Praluent. I know you guys don't want to give too much detail on launch strategies, but is relaxing payment terms as you do with EYLEA initially part of the plan? If you don't want to answer that, when you think about the economics, the payback economics to Sanofi for Praluent, are those flexible depending on the launch trajectory? In other words, can you tweak those in a material way depending on the trajectory? Thanks.
George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist; President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer: The payback economics are based upon a percentage of profit, so it's already – it's all embedded in there and it's only based on the percentage. When the product turn profitable we pay a percentage, 10% of our profits back for repayment.
Robert J. Terifay - Senior Vice President, Commercial: In terms of the payment terms and remember EYLEA is a buy-and-build product under very different circumstances from Praluent, so we don't have the same terms.
Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations: Next question, operator?
Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks.
Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations: Thanks, Geoff.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Biren Amin with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Biren Amin - Jefferies LLC: Yeah, thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just on EYLEA. Could you review the physician assessments program that you're providing with the DME launch, because I believe you had a pretty robust program at the time of the wet AMD launch? And second question is on PD-1 Phase 1 trial. What tumor types are being enrolled in? What's the rationale for combination with cyclophosphamide? Thanks.
Robert J. Terifay - Senior Vice President, Commercial: So, our patient assistance program is consistent with all of our EYLEA indications. We have an income cutoff of $100,000 per patient in terms of income. And if they fall within that, they get access to the patient assistance.
Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations: George, the question was on rationale for cyclophosphamide in PD-1.
George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist; President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer: Yeah, the notion is that cyclophosphamide might be, in a certain way, not blocking T-cell effectiveness and response while activating a certain type of immune activation pathway, so that it might work well to go in combination with PD-1. In terms of in our first studies, we're going after a board group of diverse patients in terms of cancers.
Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations: Operator, we have time for one last question.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Matt Roden with UBS. Your line is open.
Matthew M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Thanks very much for taking the question and congrats on really nice progress this quarter. I just want to go back to EYLEA. And, Bob, it seems like everything that you're describing here in terms of the gains that you've made commercially with EYLEA in really all settings should be practically sustainable, right? And yet this quarter, we've seen a 21% Q-on-Q growth that's a lot higher than we've seen in the recent three quarters or so, really the most we've seen in three years. So I guess what I'm getting at is, when you look at the guidance, it seems to imply reversion to single-digit growth for the remaining 3Q and 4Q this year. And I'm just trying to understand why shouldn't the gains that you've made be sort of sustainable? And it occurs to me that the guidance might just be conservative, but I'm just trying to understand if there are any other factors we need to consider that should drive a reversion in the growth. Thanks very much.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Bob may want to comment beyond the usual factors, which are includes seasonality, there's effects on the pent up demand that maybe were satisfied after Protocol T came out. Bob, anything else?
Robert E. Landry - Chief Financial Officer: Well, I think our guidance, we feel very confident in. But yeah, we do model based upon what happens in previous years and we do see in the third and fourth quarter that there is with vacations and holidays and the risk of snow, that sometimes there is some seasonality.
Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations: Great. Thank you everybody for participating in this call. As I mentioned earlier, the IR team as well as our CFO, Bob Landry, is going to be available if there's follow-up questions. We'll be in our office. Please shoot us an email or give us a call and we'll try to get back to you. Thank you very much. Operator, that concludes the call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Once our call concludes, the IR team will be available to answer further questions. With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Michael, and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us on the call and webcast today. The first quarter of 2015 was once again a very busy and productive time for Regeneron. Our underlying business continues to be strong, and we believe that we are well positioned to further execute on our goal of building an innovative company that consistently brings new medicines to patients with serious diseases. We are pleased with the continued growth that we have seen with our flagship drug, Eylea, also known as aflibercept, where U.S. sales grew over 50% year-over-year. Based on these strong results, we are raising our guidance for the U.S. Eylea net sales growth for the full year 2015 to 30% to 35%, from the previously provided range of 25% to 30%. Turning to Praluent, we and our collaborators, Sanofi, are actively engaged in preparing for our upcoming FDA advisor committee meeting on June 9. In the U.S., we have been granted an FDA action date of July 24. Our commercial teams have been very busy preparing for the anticipated approval and launch of Praluent, and you will hear more about this from Bob Terifay. As we have said before, we believe that our long-term growth will be fueled by our ability to consistently bring innovative medicines to the market. To do this, we must continually advance and refuel a pipeline of medicines to help patients. We now have 16 product candidates in the clinic, and you'll hear more about some key advances from George. In particular, our late stage pipeline is advancing rapidly, with a submission plan for sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody later this year, and continued progress with dupilumab, our IL-4, IL-13 blocking antibody. With that, let me turn the call over to George, and he will be followed by Bob Terifay and then Bob Landry. George?
George Damis Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist, President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer: Thank you, Len, and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us today. Let me begin with Eylea. In February, the full results of the independent NIH-sponsored Protocol T study in diabetic macular edema, or DME, were published online and subsequently in the print edition in March in the New England Journal of Medicine. The results from this study demonstrated that, compared to Lucentis and Avastin, Eylea provided significantly greater efficacy, despite one fewer injection and fewer laser treatments. The improvement with Eylea relative to alternative anti-VEGF therapies were particularly apparent in the group with moderate or worse vision loss at the start of the trial. We are pleased with the positive reception that these data have garnered from the retinal specialist community. Eylea received an additional FDA approval in the first quarter when it was approved for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy in patients with DME. Outside the United States, Eylea was approved by the European Commission for the treatment of visual impairment due to macular edema secondary to retinal vein occlusion, or RVO. Our combination trials with Eylea are underway, and a Phase II trial of Eylea co-formulated with our PDGF receptor antibody is now ongoing. This trial will explore two doses of the PDGF receptor antibody, each combined with 2 milligrams of Eylea in a single intravitreal injection. The FDA has granted this program fast-track designation for the treatment of patients with wet AMD. Our phase I combination study of Eylea co-formulated with our ANGPTL2 antibody, nesvacumab, also in a single intravitreal injection, is also ongoing, and we expect to report data from this study later in the year. Turning to Praluent, our PCSK9 antibody for lowering LDL-cholesterol. 18-month results from the ODYSSEY long-term trial were published in the New England Journal of Medicine, in a paper titled Efficacy and Safety of Alirocumab in Reducing Lipids and Cardiovascular Events. These data showed robust and consistent LDL-cholesterol lowering with Praluent from the largest double-blind placebo controlled trial of a PCSK9 inhibitor to date, and demonstrated that Praluent, when added to statin therapy at the maximally tolerated dose, significantly reduced LDL-cholesterol levels. Additionally, in a post hoc analysis from this study, there was evidence of a reduction in the rate of major adjudicated cardiovascular events, or MACE, with Praluent. At the American College of Cardiology Meeting, we presented data from the CHOICE I and CHOICE II studies, which explored every four-week dosing of Praluent. Though the every four-week dosing data will not be included in the initial Biologics License Application, these are important data that further support an individualized dosing approach to patients' lipid-lowering needs. Importantly, these data were consistent with the LDL-cholesterol lowering observed among alirocumab-treated patient across our Phase III program to date. Turning now to our immunology and inflammation portfolio. Dupilumab, our IL-4, -13 blocking antibody, has made clinical progress across multiple indications. As a reminder, the positive Phase IIa data of dupilumab in asthma and atopic dermatitis were both published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Later this month, we will be presenting data from the positive Phase IIb study in asthma at the Annual Meeting of the American Thoracic Society. As a reminder, following discussions with the FDA, this study will be considered a pivotal trial, which means that we will only need to conduct a single Phase III efficacy study in asthma, which we recently initiated. An additional major indication for dupilumab, atopic dermatitis, for which we have been granted breakthrough designation, is currently enrolling patients in the Phase III LIBERTY program. We also recently initiated a study in atopic dermatitis in children. We expect to initiate another Phase III program in patients with nasal polyps with associated chronic sinusitis later this year. Our proof of concept study in the eosinophilic esophagitis indication is ongoing. Turning to sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody for rheumatoid arthritis, which has demonstrated positive data in both signs and symptoms, as well as in radiographic progression, in the Phase III MOBILITY study. We expect to report data from additional Phase III studies in the second quarter of this year. We are planning on a regulatory submission in the United States in the second half of the year. We now have a pipeline of 15 fully human monoclonal antibody products that are in clinical development. I'd like to take a few minutes to highlight some of our earlier stage pipeline antibodies. Fasinumab, our nerve growth factor antibody for chronic pain, is expected to move into pivotal studies later this year in osteoarthritis. RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, is a common seasonal infectious disease that is the leading cause of bronchiolitis, pneumonia and hospitalization in children under the age of 1. Based upon our discussions with the FDA, we now plan to move into pivotal studies with this program, which we expect to initiate mid-year in the Southern hemisphere. Our antibody is designed to have a higher affinity for RSV and a longer half-life than the currently approved therapy, which could result in less frequent dosing. Regeneron 1033 is our fully human antibody to GDF8 or myostatin. We recently presented proof of mechanism data in healthy volunteers at the International Conference on Frailty and Sarcopenia Research. In a separate Phase II proof-of-concept study in elderly patients with sarcopenia, all three doses of Regeneron 1033 met their primary endpoint of an increase in lean body mass by DEXA scan at 12 weeks compared to placebo, with changes compared to placebo of approximately 2%. This is in line with other agents that target GDF8. We also observed improvements in some, but not all, exploratory functional endpoints in this trial. Overall, the drug was well tolerated, with no safety signals. Based on these initial results, we are considering various options for next steps for this molecule, which may include combination with other agents. Data from this Phase II study will be presented at a future medical meeting. Turning to immuno-oncology. Our earlier stage assets are advancing. Our PD-1 antibody and our CD20xCD3 bispecific antibody are both in the clinic. While it is still very early, and we have only enrolled small numbers of patients, we have already started to see preliminary signs of clinical activity, such as B cell depletion with the bispecific antibody, and early clinical responses with our PD-1 antibody. We hope to be able to share more data from these programs with you later this year or early next year. We also have multiple additional immuno-oncology targets in pre-clinical development which we anticipate could be moved into the clinic in the next 12 months to 14 months. I also want to take a moment to give you an update on the progress that we have made at the Regeneron Genetics Center, or the RGC. We have entered into several key collaborations, including with a hospital for sick children in Toronto for the world's largest genetic study in pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease, with the Broad Institute and Lund University for large scale cardiovascular target sequencing project, and the University of Maryland for an Amish genetics collaboration. We expect to have sequenced about 100,000 individuals by the end of this year. With that, I would like to now turn the call over to Bob Terifay.
Robert J. Terifay - Senior Vice President-Commercial: Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. This has been a very exciting quarter for the Commercial group at Regeneron, as we continue to grow our market shares across the indications for Eylea, rapidly build our internal and field-based capabilities to potentially launch Praluent or alirocumab later this summer, and roll out our pre-launch programs for sarilumab and dupilumab. I'd like to begin my comments today with Eylea. First quarter U.S. Eylea net sales to distributors were $551 million, which represents a 51% increase over first quarter 2014 and a 5% increase over fourth quarter 2014. Importantly, underlying physician demand remained strong, and grew from fourth quarter 2014 to first quarter 2015 by over 10%. Much of this growth appears to be related to the reaction among physicians to Protocol T study, which George just discussed and which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at several retinal meetings in the first quarter of 2015. According to a qualitative survey of 201 retinal specialists conducted in March 2015, over 50% of the eyes treated with VEGF inhibitors for DME are now treated with one of the two FDA-approved DME therapies, with Eylea capturing a greater share versus ranibizumab. Importantly, the market share gains for Eylea are not just resulting from ranibizumab share declines, but also from bevacizumab shares declines. We're also seeing market share growth in wet age-related macular degeneration, or macular edema following retinal vein occlusion. According to our qualitative survey, the market share for Eylea now surpasses that for ranibizumab in the United States. Eylea was approved by the FDA in July 2014 for the treatment of DME. DME is characterized by a low diagnosis rate. Moreover, of those eyes diagnosed, only a minority are treated with anti-VEGF therapy. In order to ensure that more diabetic patients get annual dilated eye exams to detect DME, in the first quarter, we instituted an extensive public awareness campaign entitled, Don't Let Diabetes Steal Your Sight, which includes displays at diabetes patient conferences, a patient website, and unbranded advertising in diabetes patient publications and web programs. To address the limited DME patients' access to VEGF inhibitors and its potential impact on patients' vision, we're conducting educational programs with optometrists, encouraging early referral of DME patients to retinal specialists where they're more likely to receive access to anti-VEGF treatment. In the first quarter, we added another indication for Eylea, diabetic retinopathy in patients with diabetic macular edema. This new claim extends insights for physicians into the role of Eylea in DME management. Not only does Eylea reduce macular edema, it also improves retinal damage, highlighting the special role of VEGF inhibitors in the treatment of DME, and further supporting why VEGF inhibitors should be more broadly used in patients with DME. Turning to the ex-U.S. Eylea business, where we split profits with our collaborator, Bayer HealthCare. First quarter 2014 (sic) [2015] (15:45) ex-U.S. Eylea sales were $292 million, representing a 34% increase year-over-year on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, this represented year-over-year growth in excess of 50%. Ex-U.S. Eylea sales continue to be important driver of growth, with continued regulatory approvals and registrations. For example, in the first quarter of 2015, Bayer achieved CHMP approval of Eylea for macular edema secondary to retinal vein occlusion in Europe. With respect to Praluent, or alirocumab, our PCSK9 inhibitor for hypercholesterolemia, we and Sanofi are busy preparing for a potential third quarter 2015 U.S. launch. Let's first discuss the potential patient population for Praluent. Statins remain the standard of care for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, and should always be used as first-line therapy. Praluent has been studied in, and will be positioned for, high-risk patients who cannot get to their low density lipoprotein cholesterol, or LDL-C target, on a maximally tolerated statin, or cannot tolerate statin therapy. We believe there's a significant underserved market of approximately 11 million patients in the United States at high risk who are not at their LDL-C cholesterol targets, despite standard of care therapy. These high risk patients include those with familial hypercholesterolemia, those with statin intolerance, and those at high risk because of a previous cardiovascular event or other comorbidities. Praluent has been developed to address the individualized LDL-C lowering needs of patients. Praluent was studied using two different dosage strengths, a 75-milligram every two weeks dose, which provides on average about a 50% LDL-C reduction from baseline, and a 150-milligram every two weeks dose which provides on average a 60% or more LDL-C reduction from baseline. Consistent with the dosing approach to most cardiovascular medicines, including statins, antihypertensives and anticoagulants, we expect the usual starting dose for Praluent to be the low dose, the 75-milligram dose. Dosing can be adjusted depending upon patient response to therapy. The availability of two different dosing strengths, offering different levels of LDL-C reductions, is an important point of differentiation for Praluent. Obviously, this is all dependent upon FDA review and approval as the year goes by. In terms of commercializing Praluent, Regeneron and Sanofi share in all global and U.S. internal strategic and technical planning and execution. We also share sales force promotion for Praluent in the United States. The majority of Regeneron's three field-based teams: our special representatives, our hospital specialists, and our reimbursement specialists, have been hired, and the first two waves of home office training have been completed. I'm very impressed with the caliber and experience of the Praluent team that we hired in less than three months. This required screening 20,000 resumes and conducting almost 2,000 interviews. This will be a market that requires development, given that Praluent represents one of the first injectable biologics for chronic cardiovascular disease with a novel mechanism of action. We've already launched our unbranded physician and patient campaigns, including educational websites. Meanwhile, we're busy finalizing testing of the potential branded campaigns, preparing our sales and education pieces and programs, and evaluating pricing options. As has been broadly reported in the press, the PCSK9 inhibitor class is garnering significant scrutiny from payers, pharmacy benefits managers, and specialty pharmacies. We expect the reimbursement environment to be complex and carefully managed. Our goal is to ensure that payers and healthcare providers understand the value the PCSK9 inhibitors can offer to patients, and the need for physician choice when initiating PCSK9 inhibitor treatment. We're working with the players involved in the market access decision-making process to focus on patient good. That said, it will likely take several months for commercial and government payers to conduct formulary reviews, make reimbursement coverage decisions, and begin to process patient claims. Given these reasons, we expect an initial gradual uptake at launch. We're also busy preparing the market for the potential launch of sarilumab in the United States next year. We have a significant presence at the European League Against Rheumatism meeting in Rome in June, and the American College of Rheumatology meeting in San Francisco in November. Overall, we are undertaking substantial commercial investments to fully maximize these exciting opportunities and reach appropriate patients who can benefit most from treatment. Bob Landry will provide more detail on the financial impact. With that, let me turn over the call to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Landry.
Robert E. Landry - Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Bob, and good morning to everyone who has joined us today. Overall, we are very pleased with our first quarter 2015 performance. In the first quarter 2015, we earned $2.88 per diluted share from non-GAAP net income of $336 million, which represents year-over-year growth in non-GAAP diluted EPS and net income of 27% and 28%, respectively. Regeneron's first quarter 2015 non-GAAP net income excludes non-cash share-based compensation expense, non-cash interest expense related to our senior convertible notes, loss on extinguishment of debt in connection with conversions of a portion of our convertible notes during the quarter, and non-cash income taxes. First quarter non-GAAP net income was reduced for cash income taxes expected to be paid or payable in 2015. A full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is set forth in our earnings release. Total revenues in the first quarter were $870 million, which represented year-over-year growth of 39% for the three months ended March 31, 2015. Net product sales were $545 million in the first quarter, compared to $362 million in the first quarter of 2014. Eylea net product sales in the United States were $541 million in the first quarter, compared to $359 million on the first quarter of 2014, which represented an increase of 51%. During the first quarter, there was a modest decrease in U.S. Eylea distributor inventory levels as compared to the fourth quarter 2014, and inventory levels remained within our normal one- to two-week targeted range. Underlying physician demand grew by over 10% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. As Len mentioned earlier, we are raising our U.S. Eylea net sales growth guidance for full-year 2015 over 2014 to 30% to 35%, as compared to 25% to 30%, on the strength seen from first quarter U.S. Eylea performance. Ex-U.S. Eylea sales were $292 million in the first quarter of 2015, as compared to $218 million in the first quarter of 2014. Product revenue from ex-U.S. Eylea sales is recorded by our collaborator, Bayer HealthCare. Please keep in mind that our reported ex-U.S. Eylea sales will not be exactly the same as the ex-U.S. numbers that Bayer Healthcare reports, this is because for Japan, Bayer reports their sales to their distributor, Santen, while we report Santen's in-market sales. Ex-U.S. Eylea sales in U.S. dollars trended down in the first quarter of 2015 when compared to fourth quarter 2014, due to foreign exchange headwinds. On a constant currency basis, sales increased sequentially by a mid-single-digit percentage. I do want to reinforce that currently, our overall P&L exposure to currency movements remains limited, due to the fact that the bulk of our revenue is U.S.-based. Additionally, we have partially offsetting European operating expenses from our Irish plant start-up, Sanofi-incurred Praluent launch expenses outside the U.S., and European clinical trial expenditures. In the first quarter of 2015, Regeneron recognized $89 million from our share of net profits from Eylea sales outside the United States, after repayment of $14 million in development expenses. Bayer HealthCare collaboration revenue for the first quarter was $124 million. This included one $15 million sales milestone, which represents our final milestone to be earned from Bayer relating to ex-U.S. Eylea sales. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $173 million for the first quarter of 2015. The Sanofi collaboration revenue line primarily consists of reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred R&D expenses, reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses, and our share of profits or losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies. In addition, in the first quarter of 2015, Sanofi collaboration revenue included previously deferred revenue relating to our ZALTRAP collaboration agreement with Sanofi, which was amended during the quarter. As a reminder, while we get reimbursed for antibody-related commercial expenses that we incur, these, along with the commercial expenses that Sanofi spends on the antibodies, are included as expenses in the calculation of antibody profits and losses. In the first quarter of 2015, our share of losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies was $22 million, which can be found in Table 4 of our earnings release. Please keep in mind that as we approach the potential approval and launch of Praluent under our antibody collaboration with Sanofi, we expect our share of losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies to substantially increase. However, once Praluent, and eventually other antibody products, are launched and become profitable, our share of profits and losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies will become positive revenue. Additionally, I like to highlight a change in the line item included within Sanofi collaboration revenues. Regeneron share of losses in connection with the commercialization of ZALTRAP, which will no longer be applicable following the amended ZALTRAP agreement we entered into this past quarter with Sanofi. Under the terms of the amended agreement, Sanofi will be solely responsible for the development and commercialization of ZALTRAP indications worldwide, including all cost associated with these activities. Sanofi will pay Regeneron a percentage of net sales of ZALTRAP between 15% and 30%, and also pay Regeneron for all quantities of ZALTRAP that we manufacture. As a result of entering into this amended agreement, we recorded $20 million of technology licensing and other revenue this quarter, primarily related to our earned percentage of net sales of ZALTRAP for the period from July 1, 2014 through March 31, 2015, and for our manufacturing of ZALTRAP commercial supplies for Sanofi. In addition, in the first quarter of 2015, we recognized $15 million of previously deferred revenue under the ZALTRAP collaboration agreement, which was included in Sanofi collaboration revenue. Turning now to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $284 million for the first quarter, and our unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as the total GAAP R&D expense minus R&D reimbursements from our collaborators in R&D non-cash share-based compensation expense was $110 million for the quarter. Our press release includes all the information that is required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense. For 2015, we'd like to reiterate our previously provided guidance of non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to be in the range of $525 million to $575 million. Our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D spend is primarily driven by three factors: our obligation to pay for 20% of the phase III clinical development expense following the first positive Phase III results of our partnered antibodies, advancing our unpartnered pipeline in proprietary R&D initiatives, such as those in the area of human genomics. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $117 million for the first quarter, and we do expect SG&A expenses to accelerate over the balance of the year as we ready the market for the launch of Praluent. We continue to expect non-GAAP SG&A expenses in 2015 to be in the range of $650 million to $725 million. As previously mentioned, a portion of the SG&A expense will be offset by the reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses recorded within Sanofi collaboration revenue. Non-GAAP cost of goods sold was $40 million for the quarter. As a reminder, in 2015, we expect to begin paying significant cash income taxes. Our non-GAAP tax rate for this quarter, and for all of 2015, will be based on an estimate of the cash taxes paid or payable for the full year, which will be substantially lower than our GAAP effective tax rate. On a non-GAAP basis, our estimated tax rate for the first quarter of 2015 was approximately 12.5% of non-GAAP pre-tax income. We continue to guide for cash tax as a percentage of non-GAAP pre-tax net income to be between 10% and 20% for 2015. Our capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2015 were $114 million. Given this first quarter spend, in our remaining outlook, we are tightening our 2015 capital expense guidance to be between $650 million and $750 million, as compared to $650 million and $800 million. Our Limerick commercial manufacturing site, which is under construction, continues to represent our largest capital investment in 2015, and we are on track to begin manufacturing validation batches in the second half of this year. We also recently completed a land purchase of approximately 100 undeveloped acres adjacent to our Westchester County campus in Tarrytown to provide flexibility for future expansion. We ended the first quarter of 2015 with cash and marketable securities of $1.23 billion compared to $1.36 billion at December 31, 2014. The decrease in cash and marketable securities versus year-end 2014 was partly due to higher trade accounts receivables resulting from lengthened payment terms to U.S. Eylea customers effective mid-2014 in connection with the launch of Eylea for the treatment of DME. These extended U.S. Eylea dating (30:12) terms were subsequently reduced in the first quarter 2015. In addition, during the first quarter of 2015, we paid a total of $125 million to reduce the number of outstanding warrants held by one of our warrant holders. These warrants had originally been issued in connection with the issuance of our senior convertible notes in 2011. Also, in a noteworthy change to our liquidity profile, in March 2015, we entered into a $750 million revolving credit facility which provides access to capital for general corporate purposes. We have no current plans to draw upon this facility. Lastly, in April, note holders surrendered $127 million principal amount of our senior convertible notes which will be settled in the second quarter of 2015. After settling these conversion obligations, only $35 million principal amount of our senior convertible notes will remain outstanding. All of these transactions are more fully explained in our first quarter 2015 10-Q which was filed earlier this morning. With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Michael.
Michael S. Aberman - Senior Vice President, Strategy & Investor Relations: Thanks, Bob. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call for Q&A. As we'd like to give as many people a chance to ask questions, I remind everyone to please limit yourselves to one question. Again, as a reminder, our team will be available in our office after the call for any follow-up. Thank you, operator, if you can now please open the call for questions.
Operator: And our first question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Citi. Your line is now open.
Yaron B. Werber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks for taking my question. Really, congrats, this is a terrific amount of progress, especially on the pipeline. I'm going to be boring and just take the first Eylea question. It looks like the growth looks pretty good, obviously, and the launch in DME, which frankly sort of tracks with what our servers (32:05) have been saying historically, which is faster than your initial comments going back six months ago. What's the difference? What's driving the growth? Is it just purely Protocol T, or are you actually seeing market growth? Thank you.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Bob, do you want to take that?
Robert J. Terifay - Senior Vice President-Commercial: The Protocol T study has definitely had an impact on the perception of Eylea in the treatment of DME. And it appears that a lot of the growth, much of the growth, is coming at the – share offset from bevacizumab and ranibizumab. We are now focused on trying to grow the market more, as I indicated, by getting more patients into retinal specialists. But the initial growth appears to be primarily at the – coming from the competitors.
Michael S. Aberman - Senior Vice President, Strategy & Investor Relations: Next question?
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Bernstein. Your line is now open.
Geoffrey Craig Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you very much, and add my congratulations on the progress and the good results for the quarter. Perhaps I'll just take a question on the pipeline, George, since you're on the call. On 2222, you moved the timeline up, which is encouraging. Do you think it's feasible that you could get through Phase III in a single season in the Southern and Northern hemisphere? And, related to that, is it looking as though this is a product that's suitable for full-term infants, or are you going to focus on the preemies, as your predecessor did?
George Damis Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist, President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer: I think those are great questions. Of course, generally, one would need to have two pivotal trials. So we're hoping that we would be able to complete in one season, one of the studies, though we are prepared to extend it if need be. And I think – you point to the potential opportunity here. There's a large unmet need. RSV is, in terms of total numbers, occurs much more frequently in full-term infants, as you point out, and it causes a lot of disease and morbidity in that population, where, right now, treatment is not standard of care, and it would be wonderful to that population to offer them an alternative that – or to offer them a therapy that could actually prevent this serious disease in infants. So, it's possible that that could comprise a large part of the opportunity.
Geoffrey Craig Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks very much.
Michael S. Aberman - Senior Vice President, Strategy & Investor Relations: Great. Next question?
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.
Chris J. Raymond - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey. Thanks. Just another sort of DME question. I think you guys have long talked about the share of intravitreal therapies in DME patients being obviously less than AMD. I think the number, I've heard you guys say it for a while, is 40% share. So, some of our feedback has been that that might be coming higher as time progresses. I wonder if you could maybe update your thoughts for us on what that share might be now or have you seen it, given all the data that's come, have you seen specifically, a movement in that share? Thanks.
Robert J. Terifay - Senior Vice President-Commercial: Chris, obviously, all of our information, and the information that is in the public domain, is from anecdotal qualitative surveys with physicians. I think that there's some growth in the anti-VEGF penetration. But the reality in DME is, unlike wet AMD, where patients' vision is at risk if you don't treat aggressively, this is a disease where physicians go slower. And I think, aside from the 40% that you're quoting, the bigger challenge in this marketplace is that many patients get diagnosed with DME and don't make it to a retinal specialist. They're with an optometrist or with an ophthalmologist, where they don't get access to anti-VEGF therapy. So, we're working very hard right now to try to get more people into a retinal specialist and treat it with an anti-VEGF therapy, but that is the big obstacle in the marketplace, to make sure the doctors get to the right doctor – or the patients get to the right doctor. George?
George Damis Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist, President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer: Yeah. And I just want to make a few comments. Obviously, this is a relatively new field. But now I think, over the last few years, the field has really recognized some things that make a huge difference. Of course, as Bob said, one of the problems is that there's a low diagnosis rate, and there's a low treatment rate right now. However, there's also now the recognition from the entire field that anti-VEGFs really are a dramatic improvement over the previous standard of care and approaches, including laser therapy and so forth. So I think that's a really big recognition. And, of course, another huge piece of data now comes from the Protocol T study that says that some anti-VEGF agents are much more powerful at controlling the disease, and improving vision, than other anti-VEGF agents. So, we believe that there is a very large unmet need here, in terms of patients not being diagnosed and not being treated with anti-VEGF therapy, and not receiving, obviously, the best anti-VEGF therapy. And that's a very, very large opportunity.
Chris J. Raymond - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions, and good morning to everyone. So, Len, I know that you recently met with the CEO of Sanofi. Can you give us, on a high level, what you think the collaboration's going through, and where the strategic direction there is for Sanofi with your collaboration? And then, I have a detailed question about the DRCR trial. So, obviously, we have all anecdotally heard from doctors that the result has been making impact on their practice in DME. Do you guys think that there will be some read-through or spillover effect into AMD as well? Thank you.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Ying. I have one question for you. Are you following me around, or...?
Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Actually, Len, I want to know what happened in Cuba, too.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: So, the answer to your first question is yes, of course, we've met and spoken with, several times, the CEO, as we would – expected to do with such an important collaborator of ours, with Sanofi. I think Olivier was a great choice by Sanofi's board to lead that company. He's got a lot on his plate, but we were pleased to see that, high up on that list, was the relationship with Regeneron. That relationship has got a lot to do, and we've – certainly our focus, both on, how do we make sure that the launches are going to go seamlessly and spectacularly – that's sort of job number one. You do all this hard research and development work, and now we got to finish it off by strong launches. And obviously, we've got three potential launches coming over the next several years. Not just with Praluent for low cholesterol, but also sarilumab for rheumatoid arthritis and, of course, dupilumab for a variety of allergic diseases, including atopic dermatitis, asthma, and perhaps several others. So, we have lots to talk about, the relationship is strong, and we have plenty to do. In terms of the – your question is whether there's a halo effect of the Protocol T, I've heard several people suggest that that's the case. One person told me that previously, a practice might be able to just carry Avastin, if they didn't want to get into the buy and build business, but when they see the Protocol T data, they feel they have to carry Eylea, because there's such a differential there. And once they start doing it, and then they might be more inclined to use it for AMD. I don't know how often that sort of scenario plays out, but I can imagine some sort of a halo effect. Of course, we're out of the promotional aspect about this. We can – we don't talk to doctors about Protocol T, we don't promote it. Our field force doesn't promote it, because it's not in our label. But the good thing about the retinal community is that they have lots and lots of meetings. And it's already been presented at a retinal specialty meeting. It's been – was presented – I was at the ARVO meetings over the past several days, it will be presented again at several – at the ASRS and several other retinal meetings. So they have lots of opportunity to hear – and frankly better than to hear from us, which we can't do. They hear from the people who conducted the studies, who make a very strong presentation about the results. So, I think it will move market share. In DME, I think it will increase market share, moving more people to get treated, and I think it potentially could have a halo effect.
Michael S. Aberman - Senior Vice President, Strategy & Investor Relations: Thanks, Len. Next question?
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning, thanks for taking the question. Just wondering if you can maybe provide us some insight into the potential questions or topics at the upcoming ad com for Praluent? And if not on that question, then maybe you could give us some more details with respect to any shift in your account base for Eylea post the DME launch. Just wondering if you can comment at all about growth trends from existing accounts versus new accounts? Thanks.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Terence. As far as the advisory panel, we're waiting, as you are, for the FDA briefing book and the questions to come out. So, when we know them, obviously you'll know them. We, of course, have our war games and our scenarios, but we'll probably not comment on that and let Regeneron-Sanofi do its work, and Amgen will have to do its work and, of course, the FDA will be doing the most important work. Bob, did you want to comment on the Eylea question?
Robert J. Terifay - Senior Vice President-Commercial: Yeah. I think that, in terms of accounts, we've pretty well penetrated the retinal accounts. And so, our DME business is coming from existing accounts. It is interesting that diabetes is distributed differently in the United States than wet AMD. So, we do see a different geographic disbursement of the sales. But in terms of the accounts, it's pretty much the same accounts.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: The one qualitative thing, of course, that we feel very good about is that, when you're going into a new product cycle, which we hope we're going into, it's nice that your flagship product is still really growing very strongly. At 50% year-over-year in the U.S. growth, that was terrific, and that was with a little modest inventory drawdown. I think that that bodes well, that the company is strong and continues to be strong, as we try and broaden our base of important products.
Michael S. Aberman - Senior Vice President, Strategy & Investor Relations: Next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Schwartz with Leerink Partners. Your line is now open.
Joseph P. Schwartz - Leerink Partners LLC: Great. Thanks very much. I'm wondering, I'm still intrigued by the approach that you're taking for Regeneron 1033 in sarcopenia. So, I was wondering if you could expand a little bit about the signals that you saw, in terms of the functional endpoints. Are any of them potential registrational endpoints? And then, what kinds of combinations are you contemplating for this drug?
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: George?
George Damis Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist, President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer: Well, we certainly are very gratified that this genetically defined pathway can indeed be followed up with the biologic, and you can see the right type of biological responses without untoward effect, sort of as the genetics would have predicted. So, that is very gratifying for the whole field of genetics and genomics and so forth. This is a very complicated area. You talked about registrational endpoints and so forth. This is a very young field. There really hasn't been too much done in this area. So that's still a developing area, in terms of how one would approve it. And in terms of combinations, that's still very early in our program, and certainly, there's a lot of competitive issues there, so I'm not going to necessarily get into what we might imagine. But certainly, this is an area where we think that there's the possibility of taking this one pathway, where you see this moderate benefit, perhaps, and combining it with others, and perhaps increase the benefit, both in terms of the anatomy and in terms of the function, and be able to provide a more meaningful result to patients.
Joseph P. Schwartz - Leerink Partners LLC: Yeah. Do you think that the accelerometry tools could help you get around any requirements for PROs that the FDA might otherwise require? Seems like Novartis is working a lot on that area.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: We can have this as a side – about, perhaps, these fine details.
Joseph P. Schwartz - Leerink Partners LLC: Okay, sounds good. Thanks.
Robert J. Terifay - Senior Vice President-Commercial: We'll talk.
Michael S. Aberman - Senior Vice President, Strategy & Investor Relations: Okay, next question.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Roden with UBS. Your line is now open.
Matt M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Nice quarter, guys, and thanks for having me on the call. I wanted to come back to the RSV program, gratified to see that moving forward sooner rather than later, and I'm just trying to think around the corner a little bit, to see how – thinking about how this program could play out here. George, would I be wrong to interpret your prior comment as meaning that there seems to be interest or buy-in among the regulators to move into a broader target population, the full-term babies? And then related, maybe more of a commercial question is, in that core population of those born 32 weeks to 34 weeks gestation, I'm just trying to understand what kind of data you think you need to show to get around or mitigate any kind of pricing strategy that might arise from your competitor? Thanks very much.
George Damis Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist, President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer: Right. Well, my prior comments, I think, were just that. In that I think that these questions point out that the current standard of care is that the actual infants that are treated with the RSV therapeutics is very, very limited and there is a much broader population that, in fact, the CDC has actually said could dramatically benefit if this type of approach could be made more broadly. And certainly, that is shaping our thinking, and I think that's about – that about represents our perspective.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: I would only add perhaps, George, to emphasis your comments, that we hope to have a differentiated product on – in terms of maybe how long it might be able to be – last before you have to give a repeat, or something of that nature. So, it isn't simply, if we do something, the competition can respond in kind commercially, there may be differentiations in the product as well. We'll have to see that as the data goes on.
Michael S. Aberman - Senior Vice President, Strategy & Investor Relations: Okay. Next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Adnan Butt with RBC Capital Market. Your line is now open.
Adnan S. Butt - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hi. Thanks, and let me throw a curveball and ask on fasinumab. So would that be a Phase III study or a Phase II in it, and would you be starting at the same dose levels where the program finished off? Thanks.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. The thing about that program that you have to understand is that, you could call these really whatever you want, Phase II/IIIs, Phase IIbs, Phase IIIs. What's going to drive it is not the number of efficacy trials you have or need. What's going to drive this program is the number of patients you need exposed, very – thousands of patients exposed, and that's really going to be the main driver. The efficacy part of this is pretty much in hand for the – across the class. It shows impressive efficacy. Refining the doses, of course, can be done in a IIb/III setting. But really, the way you have to think about this, the way we're thinking about it, is that it's a question of making sure you're getting the adequate exposure done that would support a filing.
Michael S. Aberman - Senior Vice President, Strategy & Investor Relations: Great. Next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert (sic) [Robyn] (49:31) Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Unknown Speaker: Hi, guys. This is Adnan (49:36) for Robyn. Congrats on the progress. So, just going back to the PCSK9 launch. Being about one month ahead of the competitor, how do you view – what's the benefit there? And also, could you comment any on the litigation, I guess, with Amgen regarding the patent? Thank you.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. So, we have no comment on really either of those, and that's it.
Unknown Speaker: Fantastic.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: We think – to reiterate what we said in the past, we don't believe we infringed any valid claims. If you've been following this close enough, what we've already said is that, in lieu of a preliminary injunction proceeding, the court's going to give a early trial date, expecting that to be around March of next year. Beyond that, we really don't have much to say. And how we're going to use our month to our advantage is – probably better off we keep that to ourselves, or we'll lose that advantage.
Unknown Speaker: I tried. I tried. I tried. Well...
Robert J. Terifay - Senior Vice President-Commercial: It's worth trying. I know Amgen wanted you to try but, but we can't oblige, sorry.
Michael S. Aberman - Senior Vice President, Strategy & Investor Relations: Next question.
Unknown Speaker: One follow-up, one quick follow-up just, that you may be able to answer. How do you view potentially broadening the label for PCSK9?
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: I didn't hear that. Say it again?
Unknown Speaker: Sorry. In terms of – how do you potentially view – I know your launcher is a small – a more narrow label for PCSK9. How do you potentially view a broader label, and when we might see that?
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I'm not sure what the question is. You know we've done a very broad development program that focuses on the people who really could benefit. We think that it would be irresponsible for anybody to suggest that statins aren't the first line of approach here. Statins have been a very good drug. They've been shown to have very strong effects on cardiovascular outcomes. They've been used by millions and millions of people of every race and nationality around the world. There's a strong safety record, and we're – so, we're – we really believe that that's not the marketplace we're going after, obviously. What we're looking for, nevertheless, is that there are millions, if not – maybe even 10 million people who – where statins is not adequate for them, for a variety of reasons. Maybe they've got familial hypercholesterolemia and they just simply can't get their cholesterol where their doctors would like it to go. Maybe they have been on statins and they've had a heart attack, or very high risk and they – still at risk, they need to go even lower. And maybe there are some people who are statin intolerant. I think you've heard all sorts of estimates out there of how many peoples and what the market size is and et cetera, et cetera. I'm sure that those are grossly exaggerated, at least the ones that I've read. I think that this could be an important class of drugs when used properly, and when respecting the fact that statins should be the front line of therapy.
Unknown Speaker: Thank you very much.
Michael S. Aberman - Senior Vice President, Strategy & Investor Relations: Great. Next question, please.
Operator: Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. So, with regard to your PD-1 candidate, can you elaborate a little on your latest thoughts around development plans there, and whether you expect to only combine the agent with other in-house assets, or if you'll be looking for outside collaborations as well? Thanks.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes and yes. And, George, you want to elaborate on that any further?
George Damis Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist, President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer: Well, I think you just gave away the answer, yes and yes is the answer. I think that we all know that this is a very exciting new class and target, and we have, as we've already indicated, we have multiple additional targets, that are within a year or two of development, that are potential partners for this therapy in various settings. And we also are very actively looking to molecules outside of our own pipeline with which to combine it. And we think it's very early in the whole entire immuno-oncology field to understand how to really best harness the potential and the power of this field. And so we're very excited to be a part of it, and we're very excited to have what, even from our very early clinical studies, looks to be an active molecule that's out there.
Michael S. Aberman - Senior Vice President, Strategy & Investor Relations: Great. Next question.
Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Newman with Canaccord. Your line is now open.
John Newman - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wondered if you could comment a bit, just obviously based on what's in the public domain regarding what is known about the difference in formulations between your PCSK9 product and Amgen's? I'm specifically curious as to what we know about the fact that your concentration is half of theirs. I'm just curious as to what types of implications that might have in the real world since, just theoretically, having a concentration that's half of another product within the same volume might suggest some differences in how the drugs are administered. Thanks.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: So John, I think you may have some confusion there. But without getting into the details of the formulation, let me just focus on the important differentiating points that potentially could arise as we look through all the data and get through the advisory panel and approval. Regeneron has a formulation that allows for the treatment at 75-milligram dosage form, as well as a 150-milligram dosage form. And there are many patients for whom 75 milligrams is more than adequate, and they will get the benefit that you're looking for. There are some where the people would like to get a higher benefit. Well then, of course, you have the opportunity to use our higher dose, a 150 milligram formulation. So we do have the ability to individualize, and we don't have to, with our product, give people what I would call forced higher dosing, or forced overdosing, more than you really need to give to get the job done. These products look – and I hope that'll come across our advisory panel, these products look very good at this stage. But of course, you're only dealing with thousands of patient-years of exposure, and for – typically our trials have lasted about 18 months. And so, when you're talking about a lifetime of therapy, of course, some people would like to – some doctors would prefer to use the lowest dose that will get the job done. That, to us, is a big point of differentiation. Maybe we should leave it at that, and more will come as we get, I think, through the advisory panel, the labeling, and the launch. And George, you want to add?
George Damis Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist, President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer: Yeah. I just wanted to make a couple of comments. I think, as Len correctly pointed out, I think the most important potential difference for the patients is the option – and for their physicians – is the option to choose between a lower dose or a higher dose, certainly for initiation of therapy. But just to – as Len said, to get the facts right, our 150-milligram dose is actually a more concentrated formulation, not a less concentrated formulation. And also, in terms of that, when, for example, their monthly dose's form is actually a – 3 mLs worth of an injection. So, these are actually things that – depending on how you look at it, would actually be considered in our favor. But those are minor details. I think the important point is Len's point about the fact that we have the flexibility of dosing, and the patients, and the physicians can, based on their baseline LDL and their goals, can decide which dosage form to initiate therapy with.
Michael S. Aberman - Senior Vice President, Strategy & Investor Relations: Operator, we have time for one last question, and for those who didn't make it on the call, we apologize. We'll make sure to try to get to you next time, and you know we'll be in the office after the call. So, final question.
Operator: Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for letting me slip in a question here. So, question for you on PCSK9. When you look at the market awareness today of the class, and maybe the urgency to treat, what are the subtleties between the U.S. and EU opportunities? I guess I'm just trying to get a sense for – if there's a reason to think that o-U.S. may be different dynamics, based on Bob's launch comment. Thanks.
Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Bob?
Robert J. Terifay - Senior Vice President-Commercial: Yeah. So, obviously, awareness is very high amongst specialists: cardiologists, lipidologists and endocrinologists, given that the data have come out at the cardiology and lipidology and diabetes meetings. In terms of the differences between the U.S. and Europe, Europe is very much governed by governmental payers. And so, although awareness is very high, it's going to come down to a decision as to which patient types are deemed to be suitable for PCSK9 inhibitor therapy, dependent upon price point. In the United States, as we talked about a little bit on the call earlier, the payers are exerting more involvement than they have in the past, but the physicians can still have choice as to which patients get access to therapy. So, I think uptake in the United States – the patient pool in the United States is likely to be larger than that outside of the United States.
Michael S. Aberman - Senior Vice President, Strategy & Investor Relations: I think, with that, I'm going to conclude today's call and thank everybody for participating. And again, we'll be in our office. I know we have a bunch of scheduled calls with you guys. And again, you know how to reach us if you need anything. So take care.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.

Once our call concludes, the IR team will be available to answer further questions. With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Thanks, Michael. And although as a small part, it was a part the way you read that forward-looking statements did contribute to Michael's recent promotion to Senior Vice President. So Michael, congratulations. Anyway, very good morning to everyone who has joined us on the call and webcast today. 2014 was another great year for Regeneron. As many of you know, we founded this company more than 25 years ago with a simple but challenging goal, to build a company that can consistently and repeatedly bring important new medicines to patients in need. With the potential approval of PRALUENT or PCSK9 antibody later this year, maturation of our antibody pipeline and continued growth of our flagship product, EYLEA, we believe now is the time where our vision increasingly becomes reality. Regeneron is evolving into a company with the potential for multiple significant revenue streams across a variety of therapeutic areas. To that end, last month, Regeneron and Sanofi announced that our regulatory applications for PRALUENT were accepted for review by the U.S. and EU authorities. We have been granted a Priority Review in the U.S. with a PDUFA date of July 24 of this year. Pending FDA review, we look forward to potentially being the first to bring the promise of this exciting new class of therapy to people with hypercholesterolemia. We are working very closely with Sanofi to prepare for a successful launch in the second half of this year. In addition to a very exciting year for our PRALUENT program, we also anticipate reporting new Phase III results for sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody for rheumatoid arthritis and submitting a U.S. regulatory application later this year. We also continue to make strong progress with dupilumab, our IL-4/IL-13 blocking antibody in a number of serious allergic diseases. We have an ongoing Phase III program in adult atopic dermatitis and are beginning new studies in pediatric atopic dermatitis. We are also making important progress in our asthma pivotal development program, and George will share some exciting details in a moment. In addition to an ongoing mid-stage program in chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps, this month we are launching a mid-stage trial from a new indication, eosinophilic esophagitis, an allergic inflammatory condition of the esophagus. Our earlier pipeline continues to advance and we now have 15 antibodies in clinical development for serious diseases, including cancer, retinal conditions, chronic pain and a life-threatening infection. Two of these antibodies, Regeneron 2222 (sic) [ REGN2222 ] for respiratory syncytial virus or RSV and fasinumab, our anti-NGF therapy for chronic pain, have the potential to move into pivotal studies this year, which will bring us to a total of 5 late-stage antibodies, of course, several important diseases. Turning to our sales and earnings performance, EYLEA continues to exhibit strong growth, both in the U.S. and worldwide. In the fourth quarter, U.S. EYLEA net sales were $518 million and full year sales were $1.74 billion, representing an approximate 23% growth year-over-year. Based on fourth quarter sales, EYLEA is now the market-leading brand in anti-VEGF therapy for the treatment of retinal diseases in the United States. We look forward to another year of growth for EYLEA in 2015, bolstered by the recent approvals in diabetic macular edema or DME and retinal vein occlusion. We expect increased use of EYLEA in DME, driven by both overall expansion of the DME anti-VEGF market and the anticipated publication of results from the NIH funded Protocol T study, conducted by the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network. In this study, EYLEA showed significantly greater gains in visual acuity than both Lucentis and Avastin. In 2015, a number of elements may impact EYLEA growth, including the Protocol T date of publication, potential changes in compound and regulations and other factors. We saw U.S. EYLEA growth last year of 23%. In 2015, we expect an increased rate of growth, which we anticipate will be in the approximate 25% to 30% range. Outside the United States, sales of EYLEA were $297 million during the quarter and $1.04 billion for the full year 2014, representing a 120% growth over 2013. Our collaborator, Bayer HealthCare, continues to drive new approvals and geographic expansion, which we believe will continue to generate strong x U.S. growth of EYLEA. Before I turn the call over to George to discuss R&D progress, I want to take a moment to touch on important investments in our business infrastructure and operations. We continue to expand our biologic production capabilities in both upstate New York and Ireland. In Ireland, we are making strong progress in our build out of a world-class 400,000 square-foot biologic production and supply chain facility. We have also significantly expanded our R&D and corporate offices in Tarrytown, New York, where we plan to open 2 new buildings later this year to keep pace with our growth. Just last month, we welcomed 3,000 employee at Regeneron and anticipate continuing to add important new talent in 2015. A key focus will be the significant expansion of our commercial organization in support of the potential PRALUENT launch. This will be a year of critical growth and important pipeline advances for Regeneron. We are committed to making the right capital and operational investments to ensure we fully maximize the value of our business this year and in the long-term. With that, let me turn the call over to Dr. George Yancopoulos, Regeneron's Chief Scientific Officer, who will discuss our pipeline and our clinical and research progress in greater detail. He will be followed by Bob Terifay and then Bob Landry. George?
George D. Yancopoulos: Thank you, Len, and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us today. I echo Len's sentiments that we are at a transformational stage in our company's history. From an R&D perspective, we had a landmark year of pipeline progress. We are poised to make significant strides in a variety of therapeutic areas. I'd like to begin with EYLEA and our retinal franchise. In March, we look forward to U.S. FDA action on our supplementary BLA for EYLEA in diabetic retinopathy in patients with DME. As you'll recall, we're received Breakthrough status and Priority Review for this indication, given the strong prospective results seen in a subset of patients with diabetic retinopathy in our VIVID and VISTA Phase III DME trials. Len mentioned the results from an NIH-sponsored DME study called Protocol T, that looked at the comparative safety and efficacy of EYLEA versus ranibizumab and bevacizumab. We are very encouraged by the data. In this study, EYLEA showed significant gains in efficacy when compared to both alternative therapies. We look forward to the full data publication and presentation by the DRCR, which we anticipate in the near future. We continue to invest in R&D that can bolster and protect our retinal disease franchise. The initial Phase I data for EYLEA, combined with our PDGF receptor antibody, were presented for the first time just this past weekend and demonstrated our ability to safely combine the 2 compounds in a single, well-tolerated intravitreal injection. We expect to begin Phase II trials in the first half of this year. Our combination study of EYLEA co-formulated with our Ang2 antibody in a single intravitreal injection, entered Phase I development for ophthalmologic indications late last year. On PRALUENT, our PCSK9 antibody for lowering LDL-cholesterol in people with hypercholesterolemia, we submitted the BLA during the fourth quarter based on data from 10 Phase III clinical trials, the largest program for a PCSK9 inhibitor in an initial BLA submission. We received a Priority Review designation with the July 24 PDUFA date. We also presented positive pivotal Phase III data at the American Heart Association meeting in November for 6 of these registrational trials, which all met the primary efficacy endpoint of a greater reduction in LDL cholesterol at 24 weeks in either active comparator or placebo. In January, we reported top line results from the first monthly dosing trials of PRALUENT, ODYSSEY CHOICE I and CHOICE II. Both studies met the primary endpoint, demonstrating that a monthly dose of PRALUENT at either 150 milligrams or 300 milligrams was effective at significantly reducing LDL-cholesterol from baseline at 24 weeks. Detailed results from these studies will be presented at the upcoming American College of Cardiology meeting in March. While these trials are not part of our initial registration package, we anticipate submitting data for monthly dosing to the FDA in the future. Turning now to sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody, which is in Phase III for rheumatoid arthritis or RA. We believe sarilumab is positioned to provide an important new treatment option to the RA community, where patients often cycle through multiple medicines during the course of their disease. In the fourth quarter, we presented additional analyses from the SARIL-RA-MOBILITY study at the Annual Meeting of the American College of Rheumatology. This year, we expect results from 3 additional Phase III studies in the SARIL-RA program, which are evaluating sarilumab in combination and as monotherapy. Dupilumab, our antibody that blocks both interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 signaling, continues to make significant progress across a number of serious allergic diseases. In the fourth quarter, we shared top line results from our Phase IIb study of dupilumab in moderate-to-severe uncontrolled asthma. In the dose-ranging study of 776 adults, dupilumab, in combination with standard of care therapy, demonstrated a significant improvement from baseline in forced expiratory volume of 1 second or FEV-1, a standard measure of lung function, as well a significant reduction in severe exacerbations or asthma attacks. This positive response was seen in both the patient population with high blood eosinophils thought to be a marker of allergic disease as well as the overall study population. We think this is a very exciting finding for uncontrolled asthma patients that have a high unmet need, often struggling with daily symptoms and recurring asthma attacks, despite the use of inhaled steroids, long-acting beta-agonist and rescue medications. We look forward to presenting the full results later this year. In addition, we recently had a very productive end of Phase II meeting with the FDA to discuss the potential asthma indications. Based on these preliminary discussions, we believe that our Phase IIb trial will be considered a pivotal trial and that we will only need a single Phase III efficacy trial to support a potential asthma BLA submission. We anticipate beginning this Phase III study in the first half of 2015. We continue to enroll patients in the Phase III program for dupilumab in adult atopic dermatitis. And as Len mentioned, we are in the process of initiating a Phase II study in pediatric atopic dermatitis this month. In addition, we look forward to presenting details from our Phase IIa chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps study this year and discussing a potential Phase III program with the FDA. Also this month, we have initiated a Phase IIa study of dupilumab in eosinophilic esophagitis, an allergic inflammatory condition of the esophagus that is being diagnosed at increasing rates in both adults and children. Eosinophilic esophagitis can make for difficult swallowing, pain and impaction of food in the esophagus, due to swelling and inflammation. This year, we also anticipate advancing 2 of our earlier pipeline programs. The first is Regeneron 2222 (sic) [ REGN2222 ], an antibody to RSV, the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children under the age of 1 in the United States, an important cause of respiratory distress in older adults. We're completing Phase I trials and are in discussions with regulatory authorities to move directly into Phase III trials in the second half of this year. The second program we believe may be ready for pivotal investigation later this year is our NGF antibody for chronic pain, fasinumab. We've had productive discussions with regulators over the last several months about the clinical hold status. And based on preclinical data we submitted to the FDA, have been allowed to conduct clinical studies of up to 4 months duration in osteoarthritis. We plan to submit additional preclinical data in the first half of 2015, that we hope will completely remove the clinical hold status. As such, we are anticipating initiating larger and longer studies in osteoarthritis later this year. Turning to our pipeline in immuno-oncology. We initiated Phase I clinical studies for 2 new antibodies, our CD20-CD3 Bispecific antibody, also known as Regeneron 1979 (sic) [ REGN1979 ] and our PD-1 antibody, Regeneron 2810 (sic) [ REGN2810 ]. This continues to be a key area for future innovation. We have a very active discovery and early development program. In summary, we've had a tremendous amount of progress with our very exciting, entirely homegrown antibody pipeline. Before turning the call over to Bob, I wanted to share that I recently joined other scientific leaders at the White House to discuss President Obama's Precision Medicine Initiative. One key priority in the initiative is a propose to sequence 1 million Americans and to link this genetic information to the electronic medical records, so as to provide greater insight into human disease and to spread the discovery of new diagnostics and therapeutics. We shared the President's vision. And, in fact, already embarked in a related effort through our Regeneron Genetic Center or RGC. Together with our partners, including Geisinger Health System, we are on track to sequence 0.25 million individuals over the next few years and to link this information to their de-identified digital health records. We're already seeing valuable insights from this effort and look forward to sharing updates with you as we go forward. With that, let me now turn the call over to Bob Terifay.
Robert J. Terifay: Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. It's been a very busy time for the Regeneron commercial team. As we build on our leadership position for EYLEA injection, which recently became the #1 FDA-approved anti-VEGF therapy for retinal disease in terms of dollar sales in the United States and as we prepare for potential launch of PRALUENT or alirocumab, I'd like to begin my comments with EYLEA. Fourth quarter U.S. EYLEA net sales to distributors were $518 million, which represent a 29% increase over the fourth quarter of 2013. According to a survey of 201 retinal specialists conducted in December of 2014, the market share for EYLEA in wet AMD in the United States is higher than that for ranibizumab. FDA-approved therapies currently hold about 56% of the overall wet AMD market. EYLEA was approved by the FDA in July of 2014 for the treatment of DME. We estimate that approximately 600,000 eyes are diagnosed with essentially involved diabetic macular edema in the United States, a similar number to those with wet AMD. Of these eyes diagnosed, only a minority are currently treated with anti-VEGF therapy. Because EYLEA has been approved using the same single strength 2 milligram dose per injection for all indications, it is difficult to give you an estimate of the proportion of our sales coming specifically from DME versus wet AMD. We've made significant progress with coverage and paid claim confirmation across the payer space for EYLEA in wet AMD -- or in DME. Currently, all Medicare jurisdictions have coverage and evidence of paid claims for EYLEA in DME, and 98% of commercialize have coverage for EYLEA for DME. Market dynamics in DME could be favorably impacted when the data from the NIH DRCR Protocol T comparative safety and efficacy study of the VEGF inhibitors are publicly presented and with the potential FDA approval for diabetic retinopathy in patients with DME. We are also working to generate unbranded disease awareness among diabetics to support patient screaming -- screening with annual dilated eye exam, so that DME is better diagnosed and more likely to be treated by retinal specialists. Lastly, we continue to expect growth in macular edema following retinal vein occlusion, based on our broadened indication for all forms of RVO in October 2014. It should be noted, however, that the macular edema following RVO market for wet -- for anti-VEGF therapy is much smaller than the wet AMD and DME markets, with 74,000 eyes treated each year. Turning to the x U.S. EYLEA business, where we split profits with our collaborator, Bayer HealthCare. Fourth quarter 2014 x U.S. EYLEA sales were $297 million. x U.S. EYLEA sales continue to be an important driver of growth and the launch outside the United States is making significant progress with continued regulatory approvals and registrations. In the fourth quarter, Bayer achieved Japanese DME approval, and last month, received a positive EU opinion in macular edema secondary to BRVO, with anticipated EMA regulatory action later this year. There is also significant x U.S. growth potential for EYLEA. The annual market for the 2 approved anti-VEGF therapies combined is approximately $3.5 billion based on a run rate observed in the fourth quarter. EYLEA currently has approximately a 34% dollar market share of the x U.S. approved anti-VEGF market as compared to a 53% dollar share of the U.S. FDA-approved anti-VEGF market. Therefore, there's ample opportunity for growth through approval on additional indications, further geographic expansion and market share gains. With respect to PRALUENT or alirocumab, we and our worldwide collaborator, Sanofi, are busy preparing for a potential third quarter 2015 U.S. launch. We believe that there is significant -- is a significant underserved market of U.S. patients of high risk, who are not at their LDL-cholesterol targets, despite standard of care therapy. These high-risk patients include those with familial hypercholesterolemia, those that are statin intolerant and those who are at high risk because of a previous cardiovascular event or other comorbidities. In the U.S., we estimate this high-risk market size to be approximately 11 million adults. This will be a market that requires significant development, given that PRALUENT represents one of the first biologics for chronic cardiovascular disease, and has a novel mechanism of action. We've already begun important educational work with physicians on the significant unmet medical need for further cholesterol reduction in patients not at goal and the role of PCSK9 in cholesterol metabolism. Regeneron and Sanofi share in all internal, strategic and tactical planning and execution, including marketing, market access, health outcomes and medical affairs. We also share sales force promotion for PRALUENT in the United States. Sanofi will initially be responsible for sales promotion at launch outside of the United States. Our hiring and infrastructural scale up is well underway and is on track. We're also completing important pricing and reimbursement analyses. We continue to be committed to value-based pricing and ensuring strong patient access to therapies. Overall, we are undertaking a substantial commercial investment to fully maximize this exciting opportunity and reach appropriate patients who can benefit most from treatment. Bob Landry will provide more detail on the financial impact. With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Landry.
Robert E. Landry: Thanks, Bob, and good morning to everyone who has joined us today. Overall, we are pleased with both our fourth quarter and full year 2014 performance. In the fourth quarter 2014, we earned $2.79 per diluted share from non-GAAP net income of $328 million. And for the full year 2014, we earned $10 per diluted share from non-GAAP net income of $1.18 billion. This represents growth in non-GAAP diluted EPS and net income of 25% and 27%, respectively, for the fourth quarter and 22% and 26%, respectively, for the full year of 2014 compared to the same periods of 2013. Regeneron's 2014 non-GAAP net income excludes noncash share-based compensation expense, noncash interest expense related to our senior convertible notes, loss on extinguishment of debt in connection with conversions of a portion of our convertible notes during 2014, a third quarter incremental charge related to our branded prescription drug fee and income tax expense. A full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release. Total revenue in the fourth quarter were $802 million and $2.82 billion for the full year of 2014, which represented growth of 31% for the 3 months and 34% for the full year. Net product sales were $522 million in the fourth quarter and $1.75 billion for the full year of 2014 compared to $406 million in the fourth quarter and $1.43 billion for the full year of 2013. EYLEA net product sales in the United States were $518 million in the fourth quarter and $1.74 billion for the full year of 2014 compared to $402 million in the fourth quarter and $1.41 billion for the full year 2013, which represented an increase of 29% and 23%, respectively. There was a modest increase in U.S. EYLEA distributory inventory levels as compared to the third quarter of 2014, although inventory remains within our normal 1- to 2-week targeted range. Overall, inventory levels in terms of units at the end of 2014 were unchanged from the end of 2013. X U.S. EYLEA sales were $297 million in the fourth quarter 2014 as compared to $184 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. X U.S. EYLEA sales for the full year 2014 were $1.04 billion compared to $472 million for 2013. Product revenue from x U.S. EYLEA sales is recorded by our collaborator, Bayer HealthCare. Please keep in mind that our reported x U.S. EYLEA sales will not be exactly the same as the x U.S. numbers that Bayer HealthCare reports. This is because for Japan, Bayer reports their sales to their distributor, Santen, while we report Santen's in-market sales. In the fourth quarter of 2014, Regeneron recognized $88 million from our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the United States after repayment of $14 million in development expenses and $301 million for the full year 2014 after repayment of $57 million in development expenses. While we did experience some foreign exchange headwinds this quarter, our exposure to currency movements currently remains limited due to the fact that the bulk of our revenue is U.S.-based. Additionally, we are partially offsetting European operating expenses from our Irish plant start up, Sanofi-incurred PRALUENT launch expenses and European clinical trial expenditures. Bayer HealthCare collaboration revenue for the fourth quarter was $137 million. This included 2 $15 million sales milestones. We are expecting to earn another $15 million milestone during the first half of 2015, which will be our final milestone to be earned from Bayer relating to our x U.S. EYLEA sales. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $135 million for the fourth quarter and $541 million for the full year of 2014. As we said previously, the Sanofi collaboration revenue line primarily consists of reimbursement of Regeneron incurred R&D expenses, our share of profits, our losses in collection with ZALTRAP, amortization of upfront and other payments received from Sanofi and our share of profits or losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies. There is an additional fifth component in Sanofi collaboration revenue that we will be separately reporting for the first time this quarter, the reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization related expenses, which can be seen in Table 4 of the press release. This item, which was $12 million in the fourth quarter, is the reimbursement we received from Sanofi for commercialization expenses that Regeneron incurs in connection with our antibody collaboration. In essence, we get reimbursed for certain antibody-related commercialization expenses that we incur and which are predominantly embedded within our SG&A line. While we get reimbursed for these commercial expenses, these, along with the commercial expenses that Sanofi spends on the antibodies, are included in the antibody P&L statement, which we then recognize as our share of the antibody profit and loss. Turning to that item, our share of losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies was $24 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $41 million for the full year of 2014. Again, shown in Table 4 of our earnings release. Please keep in mind that as we approach the potential approval and launch of PRALUENT under our antibody collaboration with Sanofi, we expect our share of losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies to substantially increase. However, once PRALUENT and eventually other antibody products are launched and become profitable, we expect this component to become positive revenue, as it will reflect our share of antibody commercialization profits. Turning now to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $301 million for the fourth quarter and $1.09 billion for the full year 2014. Our unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as the total GAAP R&D expense minus R&D reimbursements we received from our collaborators and R&D noncash share-based compensation expense was $159 million in the fourth quarter and $508 million for the full year 2014. Our press release includes all the information that's required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense. For 2015, we'd like to reiterate our previously provided guidance of non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to be in the range of $525 million to $575 million. Our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D spend is driven by 3 factors: our obligation to pay for 20% of the Phase III clinical development expenses following the first positive Phase III results of our partnered antibodies; advancing our unpartnered pipeline in proprietary R&D initiatives, such as those in the area of human genomics. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $114 million for the fourth quarter and $344 million for the full year 2014. We expect non-GAAP SG&A expense in 2015 to be in the range of $650 million to $725 million. We note that this growth in SG&A is due primarily to the prelaunch and commercialization expenses associated with PRALUENT and overall operational growth of the company. As I mentioned, the portion of the SG&A expense will be offset by the reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses recorded within Sanofi collaboration revenue. Non-GAAP cost of goods was $37 million in the fourth quarter and $126 million for the full year 2014. With regard to 2014 taxes, due to our net operating loss in tax credit carryforwards and deductions related to employee stock option exercises, we did not pay significant cash income taxes. On a GAAP basis, the effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was approximately 50% and for the full year 2014, was approximately 55%. As a reminder, moving forward into 2015, we expect to begin paying material cash income taxes. However, these cash payments will be significantly below our GAAP effective tax rate. As a result, we anticipate that our non-GAAP tax rate, beginning in the first quarter of 2015 will represent a blended rate based on an estimate of the cash taxes paid or payable for the full year. We remind you that we previously provided guidance for the cash tax as a percentage of non-GAAP pretax net income to be between 10% and 20% for 2015. Our capital expenditures for the full year ended December 31, 2014, were $333 million, which was more than double our capital expenditures in 2013. These capital outlays will play an integral role in helping to ensure that we have the necessary infrastructure in place to launch our next-generation of product candidate. We expect capital expenditures to be between $650 million and $800 million in 2015, representing a significant increase from 2014, which is primarily attributable to our expansion and construction of R&D facilities and corporate offices in Tarrytown, and our product supply facilities in Rensselaer and Limerick, Ireland. The Irish site represents the largest capital investment. The build out is well underway and we're currently on track to begin manufacturing validation batches in the second half of 2015. We ended 2014 with cash and marketable securities of $1.4 billion compared to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2013. With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Michael?
Michael Aberman: Thank you, Bob. That concludes our prepared remarks. We now like to open the call to Q&A. As we like to give as many people a chance to ask questions as possible, we request that you limit yourself to one question. Our IR team, which is now back to full strength, as Manisha is back, and includes Colleen Mackey, will be available in our office after the call for follow-up questions. Thank you, and operator, please, open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ying Huang with Bank of America.
Ying Huang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: So first of all, can you share little bit thought behind your 2015 guidance. It seems that, finally, the branded Lucentis and EYLEA have now more than 50% share of patients with AMD, and also you have achieved higher share than Lucentis. So shall we expect EYLEA to grow more than the market in AMD segment? And then, for DME segment this year, are you providing any patient assistance, given that there is a bigger component for commercial insurance here? And do you think Protocol T will be the drivers for 2015 DME growth?
Michael Aberman: How many questions you got, Ying?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Anymore, you -- we want to get them all before we don't answer them. Bob, maybe you can start with the assistance with DME.
Robert J. Terifay: Yes. So in terms of patient assistance, if someone is a commercial patient, we do offer assistance to patients for -- if they have no insurance, we offer free goods. And if they have insurance, but they have a co-pay that they cannot afford, we do offer co-pay assistance. In terms of government-pay patients, we do provide a funding to foundations, who can help patients with their co-pay if there are government-paid patients.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Okay, great. And as far as our forecast, Ying, our forecast is what it is. As you know, the science of forecasting is not the strongest science in the world. Just look what's been going on with the storm of the century that was supposed to hit New York but hit Boston. Forecasting is a tough business, but our growth forecast of 25% to 30% represent our best estimates as of today. Next question, Mike.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matt Roden with UBS.
Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I think Yogi Berra has said that he hates to make predictions, especially about the future. And so, with that, I want to also ask about the guidance, just put a little bit more meat on the bone. So the top end of the range, we calculated, that represents about 9% growth over the annualized 4Q sales of $518 million, where you say that the inventory range is normal. This implies also sequential growth at the top end of the range throughout 2015 of about 3.5% per quarter, and that's obviously, a slowdown from the 7% average last year. And now you have the full year DME and you have the Protocol T data behind you, so I'm just trying to understand why, philosophically, there should be a slowdown? I think that we, in consensus, might have thought that it's going to go the other way. So any additional color you can add would be helpful.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes. So a couple of things. First of all, the actual growth rate is going to be higher this year over last year versus last year over the year before. We grew at 22% in 2014, and we expect to grow between 25% to 30% this year. We recognize that some of those points you mentioned are forks in the road and we're going to stick with what Yogi said when you get to those forks, you should take them. And we're going to onto the next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Kantor with Crédit Suisse.
Jeremiah Shepard - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: This is Jeremiah in for Jason. In kind of -- in going to the trajectory for DME, how do you see that shaping up for 2015? Do you expect more slow and steady growth rate? Or is it more -- do you kind of see more a step up at some point? And also regarding the Protocol T study, besides the direct comparison with Avastin and Lucentis, will you be able to speak to new patient subsets? Any marketing efforts that warrant adequate study than previous studies?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Bob, do you want to handle it?
Robert J. Terifay: Well, starting with the Protocol T, obviously, that is not going to be in our labeling. So from a promotion perspective, my sales reps are not going to be able to speak to specifics subsets. As you know in the retinal community, however, there are a number of presentations each year at medical meetings, and so there will be medically relevant discussions of Protocol T. But right now, we can't talk about anything specific to Protocol T until it's presented publicly. In terms of the DME growth, as we pointed out last quarter, the DME market is a little different than the wet AMD market. It's not a market where there is an urgency to immediately treat patients with the most aggressive therapy, given that the threat to vision is slower. So we do expect the DME growth to be very gradual over time. And we continue to educate on the need for dilated eye exams, the need to get to a retinal specialist and results of our clinical studies are very encouraging. We do expect to see growth in DME, but it's going to be gradual.
Michael Aberman: Next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.
Robyn S. Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: With all the debate, I hate asking this question because I'm nervous about your response that -- no comment, but with all the debate around pricing -- and I know you won't comment on PCSK9 pricing, but a lot of the discussions happen well ahead of the launch of Sovaldi and Harvoni, and I was wondering if you could just give some -- any color you can give us like how aggressive payers are being in those negotiations and general thoughts? And then my second one, if you want to answer it is, so dupilumab, the new PCSK9, what will be the new dupilumab? Like what's hot in the pipeline that you'd like us to focus on underneath not being talked about right now?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Okay. So in terms of pricing, Robyn, of course, we're not going to get into what discussions we have or haven't had and what pricing thoughts are in terms of any specific terms, but what we've had -- what I have said and we've all said publicly is that our goals are really not that different than the PBMs. Our goals are to try and get our product, if it's approved, to patients who could benefit from it and get it to them in a way that they can afford and have access to it. The way we get to that point may be a little bit different, perhaps, little -- incentives are a little bit different for the PBMs, whether they are looking for revenue stream purely on a discount or something like that, I don't know. That's really their business. Our business is that we would like to come up with a fair price and we would like that price to be the price that would allow patients who could benefit from our drug to get access from it. In terms of the pipeline, George, you want to comment on the price you want to point, Robyn is paying attention [ph]?
George D. Yancopoulos: Well, we like to not focus on any one thing, but on the depth and numerous opportunities that we have -- just today, I guess, we talked about the fact that we could be into 2 additional pivotal programs by the end of the year. That's very exciting to us. Either one of those could turn out to be very, very important to patients and to us. And we would also point to our emerging effort in immuno-oncology, which has a lot of depth and is very comprehensive. And you mentioned that dupilumab could be the next PRALUENT. Yes, we are very excited by that because we see this incredible growth opportunity there, both within indications and amongst additional indications. We think that this could really be an important drug for very different assortments of allergic-related disease. And certainly the asthma data that we just announced the top line results, which was very well received at our end of Phase II meeting with the FDA, there's a lot of reason for excitement. And the fact that we'll be able to go forward with the single Phase III trial is very exciting to us.
Michael Aberman: Next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley.
Matthew Kelsey Harrison - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I want to ask one on the pipeline. Obviously, we saw the PDGF combo data over the weekend. You've highlighted Ang2 as an interesting compound in the past. And now that that's in the clinic and we have some sort of clinical bar in terms of the PDGF combo to look at, what sort of clinical differentiation do you think we should be looking for in terms of that Ang2 combo? And any thoughts on timing around when we might be able to see first clinical data out of that program?
Leonard S. Schleifer: George?
George D. Yancopoulos: I guess, you are asking for differentiation between the Ang and the PDGF or versus EYLEA. I think in all of these settings, what we're looking for is either increased durability and/or some sort of functional benefit supplied by the additional agent. And so these have different biologies. There's been very interesting preclinical work with both of them. So we're looking forward to both of these. In terms of the timing of the programs, I don't think we give you too many specifics on that.
Michael Aberman: Next question, operator?
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Raymond with Robert Baird.
Christopher J. Raymond - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Guys, I do have a pipeline question and maybe more of a leading question since it -- yes, I think someone asked if you could highlight what you think is most exciting. There's Regeneron 1033 (sic) [ REGN1033 ], I think you talk about in your regulatory filings, but I don't think you've really talked about it too much on your calls. But as I see in -- on ClinicalTrials.gov, looks like there's a Phase II trial that should wrap up next month in sarcopenia. Could you talk a little bit about this opportunity? How should we be thinking about it? And maybe since it is sort of mid-stage, why it's not something that you guys highlight in this venue?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Well, as I said -- I mean, it's very hard to highlight 15 different programs. We have -- as you said, we have proof-of-concept data coming out with this GDF8 antibody that you refer to that could be important for overcoming muscle atrophy in a variety of settings. And I guess we're going to wait for the proof-of-concept data to decide next steps and how exciting it will be. But I think what we're really excited about is the depth and the breadth of all of our programs having 15 antibodies and the fact that so many of them are addressing important unmet needs and could be making such important differences in patients' lives.
Robert J. Terifay: Yes, just a add to that -- I mean, even though there is individual programs, 15 different ones, some of them go across multiple disease areas, obviously. And some of those potentially, as George has talked about in other forms, represent franchise opportunities. So, for example, the Bispecifics that George and team have now realized in terms of making them and putting them into clinical trials, if we can get that franchise going, there's some real opportunity for us to become real leaders in the field of immuno-oncology because, obviously, you can use a plug-and-play strategy there, where the first one maybe targeting CD20, but the others could target whatever target you might be interested in. And some of that will be part of work we do with Sanofi. So we're actually pretty excited about -- just one of these represent another whole order of magnitude or franchise behind it.
Michael Aberman: Next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from Adnan Butt with RBC Capital Markets.
Adnan S. Butt - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: So the one question I'd like to ask is that in terms of Regeneron's participation in the commercial infrastructure, would you be breaking out details? And in terms of deciding which projects to participate in, is that a project by project decision? Or will you be in sarilumab and dupilumab as well?
Leonard S. Schleifer: So we actually make a project by project decision, and we have not announced our decision for sarilumab and dupilumab at the current time. Michael?
Michael Aberman: Next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from Yaron Werber with Citi.
Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Quick question on your 222 (sic) [ 2222 ] antibody, the anti-RSV, give us a little bit of a sense. Is this going -- is this ready to move into kids? And is this looking at prevention? And how is it differentiated from synergies?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Well, as we said, we're talking about moving into a pivotal trial this year here for this program. And that, of course, will be in children. And we think that it could be quite differentiated from the existing treatments out there. In terms of the -- which populations are actually targeted, the number of treatments that might have to be given to cover the individuals and also potentially the extent of the efficacy. So we're quite excited about this program.
Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I mean, usually, when you move into kids, you got to do sort of a challenge first, but this is an antibody. So it sounds to me like you don't feel like you need to do a challenge, whereas you can go right and do a pivotal for kids.
George D. Yancopoulos: Well, we of course have been discussing and dealing with the FDA on all of this. And when we move forward, it's all with the -- with all these communications and discussions with the FDA.
Michael Aberman: Thank you, Yaron. Next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.
Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Maybe just one clarification and one question. So with respect to Matt's question on the EYLEA guidance. Can you just clarify if favorable Protocol T data is actually factored into your guidance? Or if that's something that you would consider once we see the full data? And then on dupilumab, I was just wondering if you can share any more details on the pediatric programs for atopic dermatitis, if that would actually be a registration-enabling trial or if you're talking more of kind of a PK/PD program first before you go into a registration trial.
Leonard S. Schleifer: So in terms of Protocol T and our guidance, everything we know that kind of went into the mix and what came out was our best guess. But obviously, until we see how -- we're very excited about Protocol T, but till we see how it gets received and how quickly might or might not influence behavior, we hope it will, things could change. So it's our best information, I guess, on the future that we have as of the moment. The second question, I don't think that the first trial in pediatric atopic dermatitis will be a pivotal trial. But of course, we are in a full blown pivotal program right now with multiple Phase III trials going on in parallel and rolling well in atopic dermatitis. We're very, very pleased with how that program is getting kicked off. It's just a recent start. And obviously, we are going into pediatrics with the hope of eventually getting a label in that age group as well because there are a lot of kids there that are -- could potentially benefit.
Michael Aberman: Don't forget we have Breakthrough status. So obviously, we're going to work closely with the FDA and take full advantage of what that affords us. Next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan.
Cory William Kasimov - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I wanted to follow-up on dupilumab. For that program in asthma, so now that the FDA considers the Phase IIb sufficient to be a pivotal study, is it safe to assume that the single Phase III trial will be designed in a very similar fashion, just more centers and more patients?
Leonard S. Schleifer: George?
George D. Yancopoulos: Yes. I guess -- as you said, everything you said, makes sense.
Leonard S. Schleifer: We won't go into specifics, but I'll...
Michael Aberman: We try not to take additional risk, obviously, in these programs. Next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Barclays.
Geoffrey C. Meacham - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I know you're, obviously, not getting specifics for DME for guidance, but I just want to get some color from you all on market dynamics since the launch in DME and things like treatment experience of new starts? And then on the R&D side, there are a lot of disruptive therapies on the horizon and retinal that are frequent intravitreal injection like gene therapies, subcu, things like that. How are you guys thinking about these approaches when you prioritize your pipeline in retinal?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Right. So to answer the question, Geoff -- I am glad to hear you at your new forum, good luck. In terms of -- Bob, you want to take the first question?
Robert J. Terifay: Yes. As I said, Geoff, it's hard to tease out the DME portion of our business relative to the AMD business. We are seeing a pickup in reported usage in DME, but I can't give a precise market share right now.
Leonard S. Schleifer: And so -- and in terms of, Geoff, your question about R&D, there is a lot going on in the R&D world. We are obviously in it. You've heard about -- George talk about our PDGF program. You've heard him talk about our Ang2 program. There are other things internally that we haven't talked about? We also have a collaboration with Avalanche in gene therapy. We've looked at some of the systemic programs that you talk about. Obviously, systemic inhibition of VEGF, we've known from the very earliest of early days that it's likely to be something that could work, but the question is, can it work with the right therapeutic index? We, in fact -- George, do you want to add anything to that?
George D. Yancopoulos: Right. Our -- some of our first studies actually in the AMD field were done systemically using systemic approaches. And of course, the concern is the benefit risk with more widespread blockade. And certainly, most of us have decided that that's not going to lead to a satisfactory benefit risk. But as Len said, we are very active in this area. We consider ourselves leaders in this area. We certainly see a lot of excitement here that we don't see that any of these approaches are really going to be widespread approaches that are going to be replacing the current standard of cares. They're going to -- for at least the initial periods of time, it's going to be, we think it's including some of the areas that we're going to -- into -- addressing perhaps more niche areas that maybe perhaps over time could grow.
Michael Aberman: Great. And next question, operator?
Operator: Our next question comes from Phil Nadeau with Cowen and Company.
Philip Nadeau - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: My question is on the Amgen lawsuit with probably -- what's the update there? What has happened over the last few months? And then looking forward, I believe Amgen has asked for you guys to be barred from the market? How is that going to be decided over the next 5 months? Is there a public hearing? Or what can we look for to see the preliminary injunction be determined?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes. We're not going to comment on the ongoing lawsuit, but I'm unaware that Amgen has asked for us to be barred from the market with a preliminary injunction.
Michael Aberman: Okay. Next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Birchenough, BMO Capital Markets.
James William Birchenough - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Notwithstanding your comments about Yogi Berra. Can you give us some sense of how to think about the PRALUENT launch and benchmark it against other biologics launches? We've got the example of Prolia into the osteoporosis base. We've got cancer drug launches you're familiar with. How do we think about it just qualitatively, your expectations for the launch?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Qualitatively, we're hoping for a good launch. Is -- I don't know if that's going to be helpful to you, Jim, but it's really...
James William Birchenough - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Well, I guess, benchmarking it, Len, against some -- probably a launch versus something that goes a little steeper like an oncology drug launch. How should we think about that?
Robert J. Terifay: So, Jim, I think, obviously, you've hit the nail on the head. This is a unique marketplace. We are entering a primary care type market for biologics. So I think what you can expect is that the reimbursements will go slowly and it will be a gradual build. But as Len has always said, I was wrong on EYLEA. I don't know where we're going to go with PRALUENT. And I hope I'm wrong on PRALUENT. I mean, for us, we've got our eye on the long-term, and the potential that this product has to make a difference for people who really can't get their cholesterol down and need to get their cholesterol down. If these -- if this class of product gets approved, I think it could provide a real additional -- an important addition to the therapeutic armamentarium, and that's sort of what we're focused on. And overall the long-term, if you can bring a product to market that can really makes a difference to patients, I think you have an advantage. I do believe there will be 2 parts to this launch. The first part of the launch will be what we anticipate will be the rapid adapters, people who -- whose doctors want to get in early on a new type of approach for patients who really need it, perhaps, the familial hypercholesterolemia, who -- who've had cholesterol all their lives. I think there was an interesting article that just came out in circulation that suggests that having high cholesterol is not the only thing, it's how long you've had a high cholesterol seems to really matter. It's sort of like area under the curve or pack years of smoking that seems to be driving this. And there are people out there who've had a lifetime, decades of high cholesterol for genetic reasons and no matter what they do, can't get it down. I expect there'll be early adopters in that area. There'll be others who want to wait until we outcome studies come out. And then I think you'll see a relaunch of the product. So I think this has a possibility to be a nice study, initially driven by the early adopters and the really high need. And then the outcome studies will perhaps drive another leg up. Michael, we have time for anymore?
Michael Aberman: We have one more -- we've time for one last question.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Newman with Canaccord.
John L. Newman - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division: I promise to only ask one. Given the -- seems like almost daily attempts to read through on the pricing situation with HPV [ph] drugs to many others products that are launching -- excuse me, is it reasonable to think that payers are going to think differently about a product with a price tag at the Harvoni level and the Sovaldi level versus a product that could have a much lower price tag?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes. You had more to that question or am I missing something?
John L. Newman - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division: And also, do you think that payers are more concerned about the individual drug cost? Or do you think that they're more concerned about just the total potential long-term cost? And that's how they're going to be thinking?
Leonard S. Schleifer: It's interesting. Not all payers are the same and not -- even within a payer, they're -- the financial incentives are not always the same in terms of which book of business that you look at. There's some big books of business where they are at risk, a payer for example or PBM. And when they're at risk, they really care about total cost because they're taking the risk and they have to bear the risk of the total expenditures. On other books of business or other PBMs, they are simply there to be a good negotiator. And actually, they are somewhat from their own bottom line, they may have a societal interest, but from their own bottom line, they have less of a concern about the absolute price than -- other than getting a discount from whatever the price may be. All that, as I said, is their business. Our business is to try and get the drug out at a fair price. And clearly, we have to take into consideration what the payers think is a fair price, but as importantly, what the doctors and the patients can believe is a fair price, what they can afford with co-pays and we want it -- we don't want to get in a situation where these products are commoditized because we think there are differences between the products. And we want to get in a situation where doctors and patients can make choices. Remember what President Obama and Dr. Yancopoulos discussed last week at the White House was precision in individualized medicine. And if you -- you can't have individualized medicine if you don't have doctors making choices for individual patients. So fundamentally, we think that's a good thing and that's where we would like to wind up. Okay, Mike?
Michael Aberman: Great. Well, thank you, everybody. This is going to conclude our call for today, and we appreciate everybody. And as I mentioned, the IR team is available for follow-up. Just send us an email or drop us a line, and we'll get [Audio Gap]
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.

Once our call concludes, the IR team and our CFO will be available to answer further questions. With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Thank you, Michael, and a very good morning to everyone, who has joined us on the call and webcast today. The third quarter was another successful quarter for Regeneron. EYLEA sales continue to expand with a 23% growth in the U.S. compared to third quarter of 2013 and a more than twofold increase in sales outside the United States. Total global sales of EYLEA were approximately $725 million during the quarter. Importantly, in the third quarter, we received approval for EYLEA in the U.S. for the treatment of diabetic macular edema or DME. And in October, we announced top line results from the diabetic retinopathy clinical research network, comparative effectiveness study of EYLEA, Lucentis, also known as ranibizumab and Avastin, also known as bevacizumab, in patients with DME. In this independent NIH-sponsored study, EYLEA had significantly greater efficacy than both Avastin and Lucentis with a good safety profile. Patients receiving EYLEA also achieved this outcome with few injections and less rescue laser therapy. While these data have positive implications for the long-term growth of EYLEA, we are constrained about how much we can say about the detailed results of this study until the full data are published or presented by the DRCR. Beyond EYLEA, our company is in the midst of an evolution into a multi-product company with the potential for multiple significant revenue streams across a variety of therapeutic areas. We expect this evolution to drive our future as a company and to enhance value to our shareholders. With our collaborator, Sanofi, we will soon submit regulatory applications in the United States and EU for alirocumab for lowering LDL cholesterol. And we expect to receive Priority Review by the FDA, based on the use of a priority review voucher we purchased during the quarter. We expect additional Phase III data for sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody, next year and regulatory submission by the end of 2015. Dupilumab, our IL-4/IL-13 blocking antibody, continues to show very encouraging data in multiple indications. Last quarter, we were positive -- we reported positive dupilumab data in chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps. And earlier in the fourth quarter, we presented additional positive data in atopic dermatitis. We also recently announced that we have started the atopic dermatitis Phase III program. We expect additional Phase IIb data in asthma this quarter. Our early-stage programs are also humming along. George will share with you important progress with our earliest-stage pipeline as well as with our Regeneron Genetics Center, and landmark genomics efforts that has already exceeded our initial expectations in terms of productivity. Turning to our earnings. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $295 million and diluted non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.52. This included a $34 million, or $0.29 per share, charge that we incurred for the purchase of the priority review voucher. Bob Landry will discuss our financial performance in more detail. As we all are acutely aware, the recent Ebola virus outbreak is a serious worldwide public health emergency. Regeneron has an active infection disease research group and is working on establishing a rapid response approach to address new and serious infectious disease outbreaks as they emerge. With respect to Ebola, we already have an effort there and are consulting with various government agencies to see if our fully-human monoclonal antibody technologies can be applied to combat the virus. This is still a very early initiative, but we hope that our leading antibody Science and Technologies will be part of the solution for Ebola and other emerging infectious diseases. A recent honor that George and I are especially proud of is Regeneron being ranked as the #1 employer in the biopharmaceutical industry by Science Magazine for the third consecutive year, a 3-peat, so to speak. We are very proud of this recognition since it is a testament to our science-driven innovative culture and our incredibly talented employees. As we grow and evolve, we are focused on staying in this culture in order to maintain our edge as a leading scientific innovator and employer of choice with talented scientists. Before I turn the call over to George, let me briefly address the recent management change at Sanofi. As I'm sure you all know, last week, the Sanofi Board of Directors removed their CEO, Chris Viehbacher, and announced initiation of a search for a new CEO. We had a close and productive working relationship with Chris for many years, and we wish him well in his future endeavors. But our relationship with Sanofi began before Chris's tenure and extends deeply to both company's research, development and commercial organizations. We expect the relationship to continue without interruption and unabated, as we advance our joint pipeline, including 3 Phase III antibodies to clinical trials and into commercialization. I spoke with Serge Weinberg, Sanofi's Chairman and acting CEO, on the day of their announcement and we'll meet with him this week. Sanofi and Regeneron are committed to bringing our late-stage drug candidates to patients as quickly as possible. With that, let me turn the call over to George Yancopoulos, Regeneron's Chief Scientific Officer, who would discuss -- who will discuss our pipeline and our clinical research progress in greater detail. He will be followed by Bob Terifay, Senior Vice President of Commercial and then by Bob Landry, our Chief Financial Officer. George?
George D. Yancopoulos: Thank you, Len. And a very good morning to everyone who has joined us today. I echo Len's sentiments that we are at a transformational stage in our evolution. From an R&D perspective, we had a very successful third quarter and we are poised to make significant strides in a variety of therapeutic areas. We have 3 antibodies in Phase III clinical development, and our pipeline of more than a dozen antibodies is advancing well. I'd Like to begin with EYLEA. In the third quarter, EYLEA was approved in the U.S. in diabetic macular edema, or DME. And just last month, EYLEA received FDA approval for yet another indication, macular edema following retinal vein occlusion, which now includes both central and branch retinal vein occlusion. Outside the United States, our collaborator, Bayer HealthCare has received approval for EYLEA in DME in the European Union and for myopic choroidal neovascularization, or MCNV, in Japan. Len mentioned the results from an NIH-sponsored study called Protocol T that looked at the comparative safety and efficacy of EYLEA versus ranibizumab and bevacizumab in patients with DME. We are very encouraged by these top line data and look forward to the full data publication by the DRCR and presentation at an upcoming medical conference. We continue to invest in R&D that could bolster and protect our EYLEA franchise. Specifically, we're exploring combinations of EYLEA with other antibodies, our PDGF receptor antibody and our Ang2 antibody. Our combination trial of EYLEA with our PDGF receptor antibody is ongoing, and we expect to report initial data in early 2015. We have identified 2 doses from the Phase I study that we plan to move into Phase II, both in combination with the approved EYLEA 2 milligram dose, formulated in a single intravitreal injection. Our combination study of EYLEA, coformulated with our Ang2 antibody, also in a single intravitreal injection in ophthalmology, is on track to enter clinical development later this year. In the third quarter, we received breakthrough therapy designations for EYLEA from the FDA for diabetic retinopathy in patients with DME. This designation was based on the positive data from 2 Phase III studies in DME, VIVID and VISTA, which demonstrates statistically significant improvements in prespecified measures of diabetic retinopathy in patients with DME after 2 years of treatment. Turning now to the 3 antibody programs we have in Phase III, alirocumab for lowering LDL cholesterol, sarilumab for rheumatoid arthritis, and dupilumab which is currently in Phase III for atopic dermatitis and also being studied in a variety of other allergic and atopic conditions. In the third quarter, we reported detailed positive data from 4 pivotal Phase III studies of alirocumab, our PCSK9 antibody, for lowering LDL cholesterol in people with hypercholesterolemia. These data were presented at the Annual Meeting of the European Society of Cardiology. Across all these trials, alirocumab showed significant and sustained reduction in LDL cholesterol over one year on top of standard-of-care statin therapy across different patient types. As a reminder, a post-hoc safety analysis from the ODYSSEY long-term study showed that there was a lower rate of adjudicated major cardiovascular events, including cardiac death, myocardial infarction, stroke and unstable angina requiring hospitalization. In the alirocumab group, compared to placebo, 1.4% compared to 3%, with a nominal p value of less than 0.01. These represent the first preliminary evidence that this class may potentially lower the risk of cardiovascular events. However, definitive conclusions on cardiovascular risk lowering of alirocumab await the results of the ongoing 18,000-patient ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial, which is prospectively evaluating the potential of alirocumab to demonstrate cardiovascular benefit. We will be reporting data from 5 additional studies of alirocumab at the upcoming Annual Meeting of the American Heart Association. Turning to sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody, which is in Phase III development for rheumatoid arthritis. We will be presenting additional data from positive Phase III sarilumab RA MOBILITY study at the upcoming Annual Meeting of the American College of Rheumatology. Let me remind you that the Phase III data, we have already shown, demonstrate an inhibition of progression of structural damage at week 52 as measured by the change in the modified van der Heijde Total Sharp Score. In the MOBILITY study, the group receiving the 200 milligram dose of sarilumab plus methotrexate had a reduction of approximately 90% in the radiographic progression assessment of the modified Total Sharp Score compared to the radiographic progression with placebo plus methotrexate at week 52. The safety findings in MOBILITY study were consistent with those observed in prior investigational studies with sarilumab. We have also initiated a new Phase III study, MONARCH, which is a head-to-head study of sarilumab monotherapy compared to a TNF inhibitor, adalimumab or Humira, also as monotherapy, in patients who are inadequate responders to methotrexate. We expect to report data from the ongoing Phase III trials and plan on regulatory submissions in 2015. Dupilumab, our antibody that blocks both IL-4 and IL-13 signaling, is one of the most exciting antibodies in our pipeline and continue to make significant progress in the third quarter. We now have positive Phase II data in 3 allergic or atopic conditions: atopic dermatitis, asthma and chronic sinusitis with nasal polyposis. We also expect to see data from our phase IIb study of dupilumab in asthma before the end of this year. While asthma, atopic dermatitis and chronic sinusitis with nasal polyposis present in different ways, we believe that they all share the same basic immunopathology. The fact that many people suffer from more than one of these diseases at the same time provides evidence for this link. For example, in our phase IIb atopic dermatitis study, approximately 60% of patients had another allergic condition, including approximately 40% of patients who had a history of asthma. The positive data we have generated so far in multiple indications support our belief that IL-4 and IL-13 could be important drivers of the common underlying immunopathology that links certain allergic diseases. In the atopic dermatitis indication, we recently initiated a Phase III study called, LIBERTY AD CHRONOS. This is the first study in the Phase III clinical program for dupilumab and is a double-blind placebo-controlled multinational study, with the primary objective of demonstrating efficacy of dupilumab in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis who had administered concomitantly with topical corticosteroids through 16 weeks. The trial is expected to enroll approximately 700 adult patients and will explore 2 separate doses of dupilumab. This study is part of the Larger LIBERTY Program in atopic dermatitis that will consist of at least 5 clinical studies in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Turning to our earlier-stage pipeline. In immuno-oncology, we recently initiated the study of our CD20 by CD3 by specific antibody, also known as REGN1979, and we expect to submit an IND for our PD-1 antibody before the end of this year. We would also like to share with you the targets of 2 antibodies that have been previously undisclosed. First is REGN2222, an antibody against respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, which is currently in Phase I clinical development. This antibody is being developed in collaboration with Sanofi. RSV is a virus that affects the lungs in the respiratory passages and can result in serious illness and mortality, particularly in young children. It is the most common cause of bronchitis and pneumonia in children under the age of 1 in the United States, and is also an important cause of respiratory disease in older adults. We believe that our antibody could require significantly fewer administrations when compared to the standard -- current standard of care, which would be a big advantage for the pediatric population and open up the opportunity for benefit to a larger unmet need population. The second antibody, we'd like to disclose, is REGN1500, an antibody to ANGPTL3, in the lipid lowering space. We are particularly excited about this opportunity because there is a substantial human and mouse genetic evidence supporting the possibility that blocking ANGPTL3 can improve lipid and metabolic profiles and perhaps provide cardiovascular benefits. Continuing on the theme of genetics. We recently announced that the Regeneron Genetics Center is fully operational and that we have obtained DNA sequences from the first 10,000, the de-identified individuals. We are currently on track to be able to sequence samples from 50,000 individuals per year. While our capacity for DNA sequencing is extremely high, our competitive advantage in this field starts with the focus on the right types of individuals to sequence, such as those in our Geisinger collaboration, and is further enhanced by our ability to rapidly combine DNA sequencing with mouse gene functionization technologies. And our ability to translate findings into therapeutics using our VelocImmune technology. We have continued to expand our capabilities into foreign areas of human genetics research through new scientific collaborations with several leading institutions, an important additions to our in-house and advisory scientific teams. With that, let me now turn the call over to Bob Terifay.
Robert J. Terifay: Thanks, George. And good morning, everyone. It's been a very busy time for the Regeneron commercial team with 2 recent approvals and launches for EYLEA and diabetic macular edema and macular edema following retinal vein occlusion. And a potential launch in 2015 for alirocumab for hypercholesterolemia. I'd like to begin my comments today with EYLEA. Third quarter, U.S. EYLEA net sales to distributors were $445 million, which represents a 23% increase over third quarter 2013. Sequential quarterly growth in physician sales was 8%. Currently, EYLEA sales in the United States represent approximately half of the FDA-approved anti-VEGF therapies for retinal diseases. The vast majority of EYLEA sales come from the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration. EYLEA growth so far this year has come primarily from growth in the wet AMD market. As you know, in July, we received FDA approval for EYLEA in a third, very important new indication, DME, which is the leading cause of blindness among working aged adults in the United States. EYLEA is the first and only anti-VEGF agent approved for DME with a dosing interval of greater than every 4 weeks. According to the U.S. prescribing information, EYLEA can be dosed every 8 weeks, following 5 initial monthly doses. The Phase III studies for EYLEA in DME were the only registration studies that compared an anti-VEGF agent to standard-of-care macular laser photocoagulation therapy. Immediately, following approval, we launched EYLEA in DME. The targeted physicians are largely the same physicians who treat wet AMD. DME represents a large potential market opportunity for EYLEA. As it's estimated that approximately 600,000 eyes are diagnosed with essentially involved diabetic macular edema in the United States each year, a similar number to those diagnosed with wet AMD. Of these eyes diagnosed, only about 40% are currently treated with anti-VEGF therapy, with laser used as an alternative treatment modality. Because EYLEA has been approved using the same single strength 2-milligram dose per injection for all indications, it's difficult to give you an estimate of the portion of our sales coming specifically from DME versus AMD. Anecdotal physician reports indicate that they are using EYLEA in both their anti-VEGF naive and switch DME patients. Consistent with our prelaunch market research, physicians continue to indicate strong prescribing intent for EYLEA in DME. However, uptake will be slower than in wet AMD. There's a significant difference in the market dynamics between wet AMD and DME. In wet AMD, physicians are concerned if patients have ongoing retinal edema with fear of hemorrhage leading to sudden vision loss. Therefore, they look for alternative treatment options that might dry the retina. At the time of the EYLEA launch in wet AMD, there was a large patient population with a history of inadequate response to both ranibizumab and bevacizumab, whose physicians were waiting to switch them to EYLEA. In DME, physicians believe that the waxing and waning edema is not as dangerous to long-term maintenance of vision as in wet AMD. Thus, there's less urgency to initiate treatment of naive patients or switch patients, who have suboptimal responses to their current therapies. Anti-VEGF agents have also not been used to DME for as long as they have been used in wet AMD. So the market is not as well-developed, with laser treatments still heavily entrenched. Pair dynamics are also different between wet AMD and DME. In wet AMD, the vast majority of patients are over age 65 and covered by traditional Medicare. Traditional Medicare coverage of "buy and bill" drugs occur shortly after FDA approval. In DME, only an estimated 30% of patients are covered by traditional Medicare. Commercial payers are slower to provide drug coverage. Even when coverage is granted, notification to physicians, and the loading of reimbursement information to payer portals doesn't occur in a predictable manner. Retinal physicians, who must absorb the cost of anti-VEGF agents if they don't get reimbursed, often want evidence for each payer that the drug is covered and that each payer has paid a claim before they will prescribe the drug. For these reasons, while usage of EYLEA in DME continues to grow, we expect the uptake of EYLEA in DME to be slower than what we saw in wet AMD. Where are we so far with reimbursement? Week-over-week, we continue to make steady progress with coverage and paid claim confirmation across the payer space for EYLEA in DME. Currently, all Medicare jurisdictions have coverage and evidence of paid claims for EYLEA in DME. Regarding commercial patients. Over 95% of commercial lives have confirmed coverage for EYLEA for DME. We currently have evidence of paid claims from over half of these payers. Benefits investigations to our reimbursement hub have increased at a growing pace every month since launch. Likewise, use of physician samples for the initial patient startup therapy has increased since the DME launch. We remain confident that there's a significant market opportunity for EYLEA in DME, if physicians become comfortable with reimbursement coverage. This should be bolstered as physicians become more familiar with our Phase III DME data against standard-of-care therapy and when the pending data from the NIH DRCR Protocol T Comparative Safety and Efficacy Study of the VEGF inhibitors are publicly presented. Other potential sources of further EYLEA growth include potential changes to the regulation of compounded biologics, such as bevacizumab and our recent approval in macular edema following retinal vein occlusion. I'd now like to address the x U.S. business, where we split profits with our collaborator, Bayer HealthCare. Third quarter 2014, x U.S. EYLEA sales were $277 million. X U.S. EYLEA sales continue to be an important growth driver, and the launch outside the United States is making significant progress. EYLEA has recently been approved for the DME indication in the European Union and for the treatment of myopic choroidal neovascularization in Japan. Bayer HealthCare has also filed regulatory applications for EYLEA for the treatment of macular edema following BRVO in Europe. There remains significant x U.S. growth potential for EYLEA. Highlighting the growth potential for EYLEA outside the United States. The annual market for EYLEA and ranibizumab, the 2 branded therapies combined, is approximately $3.5 billion outside the U.S. based on the run rate observed in the third quarter. EYLEA currently has approximately a 30% share of the x U.S. branded market as compared to a 50% share of the U.S. branded market. Therefore, there is ample growth opportunity x U.S. through approval and additional indications, further geographic expansion and market share gains. With respect to alirocumab, our investigational PCSK9 antibody, that is being evaluated for lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, we and our worldwide collaborator, Sanofi, are busy preparing for U.S. and EU regulatory submissions before the end of this year and planning for potential approval in the second half of 2015. Regeneron and Sanofi share in all internal strategic and tactical planning and execution, including marketing, market access, health outcomes and medical affairs. Launch preparation is actively underway by both companies. We've recently agreed that we will share in sales force promotion for alirocumab with Sanofi in the United States. Sanofi will be responsible for sales promotion at launch outside of the United States. We reserve the right to share in x U.S. sales promotion at a later date. In this competitive marketplace, we'll not be sharing any further specifics at this time. Preparing for a significant launch, such as this one, requires planning and commercial investment. With the potential launch anticipated in the second half of 2015, that investment is already underway and will continue to accelerate in the upcoming months. As part of the agreement with Sanofi, we currently share pre- and post-launch commercial expenses, approximately 50-50, on a realtime basis. Bob Landry will provide more detail on the financial impact. With that, let me turn over the call to Bob Landry, our Chief Financial Officer.
Robert E. Landry: Thanks, Bob, and good morning to everyone who has joined us today. Overall, we're pleased with our third quarter performance. In the third quarter, we are in $2.52 per diluted share for a non-GAAP net income of $295 million, which represents a 5% and 6% increase respectively versus the 3 months ended September 30, 2013. Our non-GAAP EPS was negatively impacted by a $34 million charge, or $0.29 on a per diluted share basis, that we recognized in the third quarter 2014 in connection with our and Sanofi's purchase of the priority review voucher, which we plan to use for the anticipated BLA submission of alirocumab later this year. Regeneron's non-GAAP EPS excludes noncash share-based compensation expense, noncash interest expense related to our senior convertible notes, loss on extinguishment of debt in relation to the conversion of a portion of our convertible notes which occurred earlier in the year, and income tax expense. In the third quarter of 2014, our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation also included an incremental charge related to our branded prescription drug fee, based on final regulations issued during the quarter by the IRS. A full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings and a brief discussion of the branded prescription drug fee incremental charge is set forth in our earnings release. Total revenues in the third quarter of 2014 were $726 million, representing a 22% increase compared to total revenues in the third quarter of 2013. Net product sales were $449 million in the third quarter of 2014 compared to $367 million in the third quarter of 2013. EYLEA net product sales in the U.S. were $445 million in the third quarter of 2014 compared to $363 million in the third quarter of 2013, which represented an increase of 23%. U.S. EYLEA distributor inventory levels remained within the normal 1 to 2-week range. As mentioned in our press release issued earlier this morning, we are tightening our U.S. EYLEA net sales guidance to $1.7 billion to $1.74 billion from the previously provided range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. X U.S. EYLEA sales were $277 million in the third quarter 2014 as compared to $247 million last quarter and $125 million in the third quarter of 2013. Product revenue from x U.S. EYLEA sales is recorded by our collaborator, Bayer HealthCare. Please keep in mind that Bayer HealthCare's reported x U.S. EYLEA sales are not exactly the same as the x U.S. numbers that we report. This is because for Japan, Bayer reports their sales to their distributor, Santen, while we report Santen's end market sales. In the third quarter 2014, Regeneron recognized $85 million from its share of net profit from EYLEA sales outside the United States after repayment of $14 million in development expenses compared to $32 million in the third quarter of 2013 after repayment of $15 million in development expenses. Bayer HealthCare collaboration revenue for the third quarter was $136 million. This included two 15 million dollar sales milestones that we earned upon aggregate x U.S. net sales of EYLEA exceeding $800 million and $900 million over a 12-month period. We are expecting to earn another two 15 million dollar milestones during the fourth quarter. This would bring our EYLEA x U.S. milestones in 2014 to a total of $105 million. After that, there will only be one 15 million dollar milestone payment remaining to be earned from Bayer related to x U.S. EYLEA sales, which we expect to receive in 2015. Global ZALTRAP, or ziv-aflibercept, injection for intravenous infusion net sales, as recorded by Sanofi, were $23 million in the third quarter compared to $18 million in the third quarter of 2013. We recognized approximately $1 million as our share of the losses related to ZALTRAP in the third quarter. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $133 million for the third quarter of 2014. As we said previously, the Sanofi collaboration revenue line primarily consists of reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred R&D expenses, which was $142 million in the third quarter of 2014, our share of losses in connection with ZALTRAP, amortization of upfront and other payments received from Sanofi and our share of expenses associated with Sanofi's prelaunch commercialization expenses related to alirocumab in accordance with our antibody collaboration agreement. As we approach the potential approval and launch of alirocumab in 2015, we fully expect these prelaunch commercialization expenses to become substantial. Regeneron's share of antibody commercialization expenses was a new component within our Sanofi collaboration revenue line item first introduced last quarter, where we outlined the accounting treatment. However, I think it's worth recapping again. So let me say a few words on how we will record our share of the antibody prelaunch commercialization expenses. The prelaunch commercialization expenses that Regeneron incurs will be primarily recorded within our SG&A line. We then recognize 100% of the amount of these prelaunch expenses as reimbursement revenue, which is contained in the other line in Table 4 of our earnings release under Sanofi collaboration revenue. On a net P&L basis, this reimbursement revenue offsets the expenses we incur. In addition, we will also record 50% of the total prelaunch commercialization expenses spent by both parties as contra revenue, which is represented by the $13 million of Regeneron's share of antibody commercialization expenses in Sanofi collaboration revenue, as depicted in Table 4 of our earnings release. Please keep in mind that as we approach the launch of alirocumab and other antibodies that are part of our collaboration with Sanofi, we expect this expense, or contra revenue, to significantly increase. However, once the antibodies are launched and become profitable, we expect this component to become positive revenue as it will reflect our share of the antibody commercial profits. Turning now to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $292 million in the third quarter of 2014. Our unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as the total GAAP R&D expense minus R&D reimbursements we receive from our collaborators and R&D noncash share-based compensation expense, was $145 million in the third quarter of 2014. Our press release issued this morning includes all the information that is required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense. As we mentioned earlier, in July 2014, Regeneron and Sanofi announced that the companies had purchased an FDA rare pediatric disease priority review voucher from a third party. We, in Sanofi, shared equally the purchase price of the priority review voucher. Our share of the cost was $34 million, which we recorded as an R&D expense during the third quarter of 2014. We are tightening our unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D guidance to $490 million to $510 million from the previous guidance of $470 million to $510 million. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses for the third quarter were $82 million. We are tightening our non-GAAP SG&A guidance for the full year of 2014 to be between $330 million and $350 million from the previously provided guidance of $310 million to $350 million. As referenced earlier and illustrated within our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation, the 2014 third quarter GAAP net income included a $41 million incremental charge related to our branded prescription drug fee based on final regulations issued during the quarter by the IRS. By way of background, a non-tax-deductible fee, called the branded prescription drug fee, is imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs, such as Medicare Part B. This fee is allocated to companies based on their prior year market share of branded prescription drugs into these government programs, and the fee commenced in 2011. In July 2014, the IRS issued final regulations that provided guidance on the branded prescription drug fee which were different in some respects from the temporary regulations issued by the IRS in 2011, including the fact that a company is liable for the fee based on its branded prescription drug sales in the current year, instead of the liability only being applicable upon the first qualifying branded prescription drug sale of the following year under the temporary regulations. Given the onetime nature of this adjustment, we have elected to exclude this expense from our 2014 non-GAAP earnings. Non-GAAP cost of goods sold was $33 million in the third quarter. Included in this line item are royalty expenses in connection with our agreement with Genentech related to U.S. EYLEA sales, which we are obligated to pay until May 2016. Cost of collaboration manufacturing was $22 million in the third quarter. With regard to taxes, due to the amounts of the company's net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards available for tax purposes, the company does not currently pay significant cash income taxes. In the third quarter of 2014, our GAAP effective tax rate was approximately 55% as compared to 37% for the third quarter of 2013. For the full year, we expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be in the mid 50% range. As a reminder, since we expect to begin to pay significant cash taxes in approximately the middle of 2015, we anticipate that our non-GAAP tax rate beginning in the first quarter of 2015 will represent a blended rate based on an estimate of the cash taxes payable for the full year. We will be able to provide more details in early 2015. Our capital expenditures for the 9 months ended September 30, 2014, were $215 million, as we expand our Tarrytown, New York and Rensselaer New York facilities and continue renovations on our new biopharmaceutical manufacturing facility in Limerick, Ireland. These capital expenses will play an integral role in helping to ensure that we have the necessary infrastructure in place to launch our next generation of products. We are lowering our full year capital expenditure guidance to $300 million to $350 million from the previously provided range of $350 million to $425 million. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $1.5 billion compared to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2013. In October 2014, the company received notifications, that an additional $161 million principal amount of the company's convertible senior notes was surrendered for conversion, and settlement is anticipated during the fourth quarter of 2014. The company has elected to settle these conversion obligations through a combination of cash and shares. With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Michael.
Michael Aberman: Thank you, Bob. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Our team will be available in our office after the call for follow-up questions. Thank you. And Roland, if you can please open the call for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Raymond from Robert Baird.
Christopher J. Raymond - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Just sort of a general market trend question. I wonder if you can give me a little bit more color from what you're seeing in, so you may know that IAS has a data point that they publish every month that shows specialist office visits in the U.S. And it's shown, essentially all year, that ophthalmology business has been relatively weak in -- even when you look at it versus other specialties that have been fairly stable. I guess, first question on this is, are you seeing this? Or is this signal sort of not just right because it looks like not just EYLEA and AMD that is perhaps seeing a little bit of slowdown that's happening pretty much across the board. And any color on that would be great?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Sure. Bob can handle that. And I will just say, Len, just as an outset, that the retinal specialists are only a small subgroup of the ophthalmologists, so I'm not sure how relevant. And also, we haven't seen a slowdown in our product. Bob?
Robert J. Terifay: No. As, I think, Len summarized it, the retinal doctors are a small portion of the ophthalmology population. We are not hearing a slowdown in terms of visits. Given the urgency of retinal diseases, it would not be prudent for patients not to come into the physicians' office. So we're not seeing a falloff.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kantor from Credit Suisse. Terrific. Any chance if you could provide us with what you think the breakdown of your sales are for AMD, RVO, and DME? And in the case that you're not going to answer that question, could you tell us a little bit more about the ANGPTL3 target? Is anyone else working on it? How is this different from PCSK9? How do you see this developing longer term?
Robert J. Terifay: Yes. So what we are -- we said we can't really give you breakdown because we don't have it, but George may be able to give you a little more information on ANGPTL3.
George D. Yancopoulos: Well, as far as we know, we're the only people who are developing a fully human antibody to the target. There are other approaches that I'm not going to really comment on that are trying to use other technologies to try to hit the target. But in our hands, an antibody is, really, an optimal way to address this target and certainly, we've shown that in preclinical models. The human genetic evidence as well as a lot of animal data suggests that this really can impact lipid profiles as well as perhaps, metabolic impact. In terms of lipids, it not only lowers LDL cholesterol in an LDL receptor independent pathway, meaning that for example, it could work in familial homozygotes that have absolutely no LDL receptor function. But also, it can dramatically lower triglycerides and essentially in animal studies, normalize them regardless of how high that they are. So the human genetic data suggests the possibility that this can be associated with positive outcome benefits. So we're very excited about this target. We think that we're relatively alone in terms of fully human antibodies, which is an optimal way to address it, and we're excited about moving forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber from Citi.
Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: So I just wanted to follow-up on an earlier question. Maybe for Bob. So when you look at your earlier guidance of originally '17 to '18, now you're kind of taking to the lower end despite getting approval in DME a little earlier, so maybe I'm trying to understand a little bit. Can you help us understand what you're seeing and why you're sort of lowering the guidance to the lower end? Or what was sort of unexpected for you this year?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Sure. Bob will deal with that. I just want to finish up on the ANGPTL3, George was being -- maybe being a little bit too modest there. He and his colleagues were the first group to discover the angiopoietins, it means the angiopoietin light protein. So we have a long and rich history in this field that we're building on. And combining with our experience with PCSK9, I think this is a good and logical target that you -- we expect you're going to hear a lot more about. Bob, you want to address?
Robert J. Terifay: Yes. So first of all, I'd like to point out that we are very encouraged by the uptick that we are seeing in DME. As I said during my presentation, the benefits investigations are growing month over month since the launch of DME. We also have seen a growth in the utilization of our samples, which we did not have at our wet AMD launch. The samples are actually a way of getting patients started on to therapy whilst physicians get comfortable with the reimbursement situation. I think the big difference between the DME and the wet AMD is that the ramp is going to be a little slower. That's both because physicians don't have the same urgency to treat, but it's also because they want to have evidence that the commercial payers, who are the primary payer in wet AMD due to the -- DME due to the age of the DME patients, take a little longer to have evidence of a paid claim. So it's not that we're discouraged by the performance of the product this year, it's just in DME, it's going to take a little bit longer.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes, I think I might add that protocol T has the potential to be a real game changer, I think, in the minds of physicians. And they have not seen those data, so we hope those data will get published in the not-too-distant future, and we expect presentations by the DRCR. And as that data gets into the literature, we hope that it will influence a physician choice.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.
Robyn S. Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I'm going to ask the question, you probably won't answer and then one that maybe you will. So just with the PCSK9 lawsuit, can you just -- I know you can't comment probably on your thoughts around it. Bus is there any color you can give us on why isn't it something that we might have predicted earlier and whether or not you think at all this could influence the timing of your launch? And then the question that you might be able to answer more is, so the Phase III in atopic dermatitis you're going after adults in the broader market, as I understand it, is more children. Can you help us understand how big the adult market is versus the kids, and like, what is the path or to getting to the broader label? Thank you.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Sure, Robyn. Before I get into that, which question didn't you think we were going to answer?
Robyn S. Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Oh, the PCSK9 lawsuit with the Amgen question. Any color would make me very happy though, I appreciate it.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Well, let me just say about the PCSK9 lawsuit. I know that Amgen has said publicly that, I think, the phrase they use that, it's sort of like a football phrase, they have the will and the skill and all that kind of stuff. We're not going to comment much, but we're going to focus on the facts and the law. And we've got a lot of experience in this patent arena. As you remember, we had a patent fight with Genentech relating to our EYLEA. So this is something I think that you'll just have to watch it unfold. As far as, whether or not we -- what we can say, we don't believe that we infringe any valid claims asserted in the past. Now, Bob, do you want to comment on the split between adult and pediatric opportunities?
Robert J. Terifay: Yes. So Robyn, you're correct. Obviously, there are a large number of children that develop atopic dermatitis early in life. And as George pointed out, the interesting about these Th2-mediated diseases is those children often develop other conditions, such as asthma, food allergies and other Th2-mediated conditions. So the pediatric audience represents a very important one, and we believe these children suffer in having the severe itch, in having the rash all over their body. There are definitely limitations on sleep, limitations on their ability to learn. So we definitely intend to develop dupilumab in the pediatric population, but we had to start in the adult population. The adult population does represent a significant opportunity. There's approximately 2 million adults around the world with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis that is inadequately controlled with topical corticosteroids. The other treatment options for those patients are not chronic because they have safety drawbacks. So we believe there is a significant opportunity. We've talked to a number of these patients, they suffer in silence and this dupilumab represents a major opportunity to help these patients.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Adnan Butt with RBC Capital Markets.
Adnan S. Butt - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Len, you said Protocol T could be a game changer. When I attend meetings to talk to doctors, they appreciate the differences in safety and even efficacy. But at the same time, they say that maybe the sample sizes aren't big enough to show definitive differences in systemic side effects. So how do you think this impacts usage? Is this something that gives you an advantage versus the other agents? Is this something that helps you make the argument in front of parents? How do you expect Protocol T to play out?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes. I think we want to -- we don't want get into a debate now about this. Because we want to respect the DRCR. They worked very hard at doing this well-controlled study, it was independently conducted, multi-sites, lots of investigators. They were in complete control, and they deserve the ability to publish the data and discuss it and answer these types of questions. At a very high level, the only reason we put something out is because we believe we thought that this was material for our shareholders to know that on the top line, the data should be disclosed. But we don't want to debate. The Genentech machine is already in full gear, coming up with press statements, which I think is sort of not what we agreed to do with the DRCR. So we're not going to get into that level of debate. But if you hang in there a little while, I think everyone is going to be very pleased at how it all turns out.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.
Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: So looking at the mid-point of your new 2014 EYLEA guidance that implies about sequential growth of 12% in the fourth quarter. And I think over the last 6 quarters, you guys have averaged around 6%. So just wondering if double-digit sequential growth is the right way to think about the forward trajectory for the drug now that you have DME and BRV on board?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Well, I think the only -- as far as you should think is, as far as we've given you some information, which is your mathematics is correct for the quarter -- for the next quarter, Terence.
Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Can I ask a second one then, since...
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes. Because that was a weak question and a very narrow answer, we'll give you another one.
Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. I'll try harder this time. So obviously, in your prepared remarks, you said you selected 2 doses of 1979, your PDGF antibody that you're carrying forward into Phase II. Just wondering what type of data drove the choice of the doses there. Was it only PK data? Or did you also have some PD data that was available?
Leonard S. Schleifer: I think the first study primarily was just a safety study to demonstrate that we could deliver the product safely without inflammation and that sort of thing. And that's the main guidance of dose selection for Phase I.
Robert E. Landry: And Terence, just to be clear, the 1979 is our 80:20, so when you get there -- I know these Regeneron numbers can be confusing.
Leonard S. Schleifer: This is, yes, different numbers, sorry.
Robert E. Landry: I believe it's 2176.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Who knows, but...
Robert E. Landry: But we'll get back to you on that.
Leonard S. Schleifer: But the answer is, that was primarily a Phase I tolerability study.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Ying Huang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: The first one is related to your 2 antibodies for AMD and DME. I noticed that for the PDGF antibody REGN2176, you're doing the Phase I in AMD patients. And then you just announced the REGN910, which is the Ang2 antibody coformulated with EYLEA. You're testing that in DME patients in Phase I. I was wondering if this suggests you might use these 2 different antibodies to target different disease, one for DME, one for AMD? And then I have a question on DRCR, I mean, I hate to beat the dead horse, but Genentech and Roche were out there telling doctors that the 2 other difference between Lucentis and also the EYLEA in this trial was not really clinically meaningful. Can you make any comments around that?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes. So as far as the second question goes, as I said, you are beating a dead horse there. We're going to let the DRCR publish and speak and address the data. And when you see the full data set, come back and talk to us and talk to Genentech.
Robert J. Terifay: Actually, it's a live horse. It's just that it's still in the barn and it hasn't gone out yet, so you can't see exactly what it looks like.
Leonard S. Schleifer: As far as where Ang2 and PDGF combinations might fit in, I think that there's some preclinical data. As you might be aware, that would suggest a more restricted application for the PDGF, not wanting to use it in the DME setting. We'll see whether or not we can go broader in both settings, frankly, with Ang2 and EYLEA combinations.
Ying Huang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: So Amgen recently announced that they're increasing enrollment for the OUTCOMES trial by 5,000 patients so that they will get the OUTCOMES data no later than 2017. I was wondering if you can comment on your evaluating the OUTCOMES trial for alirocumab?
Leonard S. Schleifer: That's a very good question, Ying, but we have no comment. I'm sorry.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Matt Roden from UBS.
Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I have a question on the different horse, this one from the pipeline. And George, I guess, you have to think about where -- or I'm sure that you're considering very carefully where to invest your R&D dollars. We realized bringing in a new product cycle forward takes a lot of money, a lot of time. And I just wondered if you could talk about the rationale for bringing forward a preclinical PD-1 antibody at this point. We understand that the checkpoint inhibitors, particularly PD-1, represent a paradigm shift and providing combination approaches is one of the ways to differentiate within that. But what are your thoughts on that versus focusing on other checkpoint inhibitors, where arguably you could be more in front of the pack? And this is a little bit specific to PD-1, but it's more like I want to better understand the rationale for how you pick your projects to bring forward?
George D. Yancopoulos: All right. What we think that it's still very early in the game in terms of understanding the best and optimal way to use these various immuno regulators and checkpoint inhibitors. And we think it's very important to have our own foundation therapy to be used in a variety of combination approaches, both with other immuno regulators, but also with other classes of therapeutics as well. So we're taking a long-term view here that the real solutions, the real advances are still yet to come. And it's important to have a collection of the important players in the game to be providing the optimal combination solutions to patients in an efficient and economically feasible way as well. So it's a long-term strategy. We believe that it's very early in the game, and we're very excited about it.
Robert J. Terifay: And I think, as George has already said in some of his public talks that having more than -- if you need combinations of these, if you could have both of them, then you can control the cost with patients as well. And I think that's going to be important because we can't keep adding on expensive therapy on top of expensive therapy.
George D. Yancopoulos: I think that's a very important point. And I should also say that even our early-stage PD-1 trials, we're going to be trying to do different things than have been done before. So even our early studies may suggest a new insight and be able to provide better benefits to patients even before we get to latest stage combinations as well.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau with Cohen and company.
Philip Nadeau - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Just a question on the alirocumab patent challenge with Amgen. Can you give us some sense of the publicly available milestones that will happen between here and your launch? Amgen's obviously asked for preliminary injunction, and it seems like the time is kind of tight for a judge to make that decision. So what will we see between here and kind of your PDUFA date coming from the judge -- or coming from the case?
Robert J. Terifay: The only thing we can say is we don't expect this lawsuit to impact our plans. But the details of how this unfolds, et cetera, et cetera, are probably going to be fairly complicated and have a bit of a rollercoaster in terms of lots of activities, little activity, but that's all we have to say, Phil, at this point.
Michael Aberman: Operator, that's going to be the exit call. So I want to thank, everyone, for joining us for this call. As we mentioned before, if you give us a few minutes, we'll be in our office for follow-up questions.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes the presentation. You may all disconnect.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dr. Michael Aberman. Sir, you may begin.
Michael Aberman: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' Second Quarter 2014 Conference Call. An archive of this webcast will be available on our website under Events and Presentations for 30 days. Joining me on the call today is Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; George Yancopoulos, Founding Scientist, President of Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer, who is traveling outside the U.S. and is dialing in to the call; Bob Terifay, Senior Vice President of Commercial; and Bob Landry, Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A. I would also like to remind you that remarks made on this call include forward-looking statements about Regeneron. Such statements may include, but are not limited to, those related to Regeneron and its products and business, sales and expense forecast, financial forecast, development programs, collaborations, finances, regulatory matters, intellectual property and competition. Each forward-looking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected in such statements. A more complete description of these and other material risks can be found in Regeneron's filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, including its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, and its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2014, which was filed with the SEC this morning. Regeneron does not undertake any obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. In addition, please note that GAAP and non-GAAP measures will be discussed on today's call. Information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP are available in our financial results press release, which can be accessed on our website at www.regeneron.com. Once our call concludes, the IR team will be available to answer further questions. With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Thanks, Michael, and a very good morning to everyone. This has been a very exciting couple of weeks for Regeneron. First, this morning, we reported strong sales and earnings driven by the global performance of EYLEA, also known as aflibercept, injection. Last week, we announced the U.S. approval of EYLEA in a third indication, diabetic macular edema, an approval that came 3 weeks ahead of the expected PDUFA date. We also reported positive data from 9 Phase III studies from the ODYSSEY program of alirocumab, our LDL cholesterol-lowering antibody. And we announced the purchase of a priority review voucher, which Regeneron and Sanofi intend to use to obtain priority review for our alirocumab BLA, which is expected to be submitted by year end. In addition, our pipeline has made steady progress this quarter, highlighted by the publication in the New England Journal of Medicine of dupilumab data in atopic dermatitis and presentation of sarilumab Phase III data at the Annual Meeting of The European League Against Rheumatism, also known as EULAR, in Paris. Turning to our earnings. We delivered strong revenues and earnings per share in the second quarter. EYLEA U.S. net sales in the second quarter were $415 million, and U.S. sales saw minimal impact of inventory changes. To be clear, the inventory changes referred to in our earnings release were for the second quarter of 2013 and not for the second quarter of 2014. We included the reminder about the modest drawdown in the second quarter of 2013 to help better understand the growth of our underlying demand. We had also heard some concern by investors that the release of Medicare billing information had resulted in a shift away from the branded anti-VEGF therapies towards compounded bevacizumab. This is not a trend that we saw during the quarter. Outside the U.S., EYLEA sales continued their strong growth with sales of $247 million compared with $102 million in the second quarter of 2013. The robust sales of EYLEA globally drove our bottom line performance with non-GAAP net income of $289 million and diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.47. Bob Landry will discuss our financial performance in more detail later on this call. In the U.S., the approval of EYLEA in the DME indication was granted ahead of the FDA's target action date. This is particularly gratifying when you remember that we were able to submit the BLA for EYLEA in DME based on 1-year data approximately a full year ahead of initial expectations. We expect the DME approval to help accelerate growth of EYLEA in the second half of the year, and you will hear more about DME U.S. launch and our commercialization efforts from Bob Terifay. We also look forward to a potential approval for EYLEA in a fourth indication in the U.S. later this year in macular edema following branch retinal vein occlusion, or BRVO. For the full year, we are reaffirming our previously provided full year U.S. EYLEA net sales guidance of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. Turning to our research and development activities. We are very pleased with the recent advances in our late-stage pipeline, and you'll hear George address our pipeline progress in greater detail. This includes the recently reported positive top line Phase III data from 9 trials from the ODYSSEY program for alirocumab. These data, along with the previously reported positive data from ODYSSEY MONO, will form the basis of our regulatory submissions in the U.S. and EU, which we expect to submit by the end of the year. You will hear more about the specifics from George, but I did want to highlight that with our purchase of a priority review voucher, we expect alirocumab to be reviewed under a priority review designation in the United States, which has the potential to shorten the regulatory review time by 4 months. Sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody in Phase III for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, continues to advance. And in the June of this year, we presented details from the positive Phase III MOBILITY trial at the annual EULAR meeting. We also reported positive Phase IIb data in atopic dermatitis for dupilumab, our antibody that blocks IL-4 and IL-13 signaling, along with the concurrent publication of earlier-stage data in the New England Journal of Medicine. We are pleased by this publication, since it is not common for such early-stage data to be published in the New England Journal of Medicine. These data, along with the previously reported positive Phase II data in asthma, further underscore the potential for dupilumab in multiple indications. We are poised to begin a Phase III trial in the atopic dermatitis indication and have completed enrollment in both the Phase IIb trial in asthma and a Phase IIa trial in nasal polyposis. In total, we have a broad pipeline of 14 antibodies in clinical development, 6 of which are partnered with Sanofi. Before I turn the call over to George, I'd like to make a note of an important milestone in Regeneron's history that occurred last quarter. After 25 years as CEO of Regeneron, I've had to learn a new term that showed up on our balance sheet for the very first time: retained earnings. Bob Landry was kind enough to explain this new term to me, and I think it's worth reflecting on how challenging this business can be, given that it took us over 25 years to finally get to this point of positive retained earnings, which, as I understand it, represents Regeneron earning more money that it has lost on a cumulative basis. With that, let me turn the call over to George Yancopoulos, Regeneron's Chief Scientific Officer, who will discuss our pipeline and the progress we have achieved in greater detail. He will be followed by Bob Terifay, Senior Vice President of Commercial; and then by Bob Landry, our Chief Financial Officer. George?
George D. Yancopoulos: Thank you, Len, and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us today. The second quarter and the third quarter so far have been very exciting and data-rich period for us. Let me begin with EYLEA. As Len mentioned, the recent FDA approval for EYLEA in a third indication, DME, in the United States came 3 weeks ahead of the FDA's target action date. I'd like to acknowledge the patients and clinicians who are participating in these studies and our team's efforts. I would also like to thank the FDA for working closely with us in their typical science-driven way to bring us important medicine to patients as quickly as possible. Outside the United States, our partner Bayer HealthCare has received a positive opinion from the European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, for the DME indication and anticipates a final decision by the European Commission in the near future. We anticipated an additional label expansion later this year in macular edema following branch retinal vein occlusion, or BRVO, where we have been granted an FDA action date of October 23. Bayer HealthCare has also made a European regulatory submission for EYLEA in this indication. We recently also reported positive 2-year data for EYLEA from the VIVID trial in DME. These data were similar to the VISTA 2-year data previously reported. We look forward to presenting these data at an upcoming medical conference. Turning to sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody, which is in Phase III for rheumatoid arthritis. Which -- we recently presented details from the Phase III MOBILITY trial at EULAR. These data have been received very positively. We currently have several Phase III studies underway and look forward to reporting data from these studies in 2015. Let me now turn to one of the most exciting late-stage molecules in our pipeline, alirocumab. Last week, we reported positive top line data from 9 Phase III ODYSSEY studies, all of which met the primary efficacy endpoint of a greater percent reduction in LDL cholesterol at 24 weeks from baseline compared to either placebo or active comparators. Importantly, several of the studies used an up-titration approach, where patients started on the lower 75-milligram dose and were only up-titrated to the higher 150-milligram dose if they did not achieve protocol-specified LDL cholesterol targets. The majority of the patients were able to achieve their treatment goals while remaining on the lower 75-milligram dose administered every other week. This dosing approach was designed so that physicians and patients would have the flexibility to tailor therapy to suit the individual needs of the patient. Included in the recent readouts were data from the ODYSSEY long-term trial, which evaluated both the safety and efficacy of alirocumab compared to placebo, in each case in combination with statins and other lipid-lowering therapeutics. In a prespecified interim safety analysis that occurred when approximately 25% of patients had reached 18 months of treatment and all patients had completed 1 year of treatment, there was a lower rate of adjudicated major cardiovascular events in the alirocumab group compared to the placebo group. In this analysis, cardiovascular events were defined as cardiac death, myocardial infarction, stroke and unstable angina requiring hospitalization. While these post-hoc data are encouraging, one should not yet draw any conclusions, which can best be made from the results of the prospective, ongoing 18,000-patient ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial. The OUTCOMES trial will use the same definition of cardiovascular events as its primary endpoints to primary -- to prospectively assess the potential of alirocumab on top of statins and other lipid-lowering therapies to demonstrate cardiovascular benefit compared to statins and other lipid-lowering therapies alone. In the ODYSSEY Phase III trials, the most common adverse events were nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection, which were generally balanced between treatment groups. Injection site reaction were more frequent in the alirocumab group compared to placebo. Serious adverse events and deaths were generally balanced between treatment groups, as were other key adverse events, including musculoskeletal, neurocognitive and liver-related events. We and Sanofi are working rapidly towards regulatory submissions, both in the U.S. and globally, by year end. We will be presenting data from some of the ODYSSEY studies at the upcoming European Society of Cardiology meeting in Barcelona and expect to present additional data at other upcoming medical conferences. Dupilumab, our antibody that blocks both IL-4 and IL-13 signaling, has continued to make progress. In July, we reported positive results from a Phase IIb study of dupilumab in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. In this study, all 5 doses that were studied showed a statistically significant, dose-dependent improvement in the mean percent change in the eczema area severity index, or EASI score, from baseline to week 16, which was the primary endpoint of the study. The improvement in the EASI score ranged from a high of 74% for patients in the highest dose group, who received 300 milligrams weekly, to a low of 45% in patients who received the lowest dose of 100 milligram monthly, compared to 18% for patients in the placebo group, with a p-value of less than 0.0001 for all doses. In addition to the primary endpoint, key secondary endpoints were also improved with dupilumab. 12% to 33% of dupilumab-treated patients achieved clearing or near clearing of skin lesions as measured by investigator's global assessment, or IGA score, of 0 or 1, compared to 2% with placebo. Based on these data, we will move forward into Phase III studies in the second half of the year. In addition to the Phase IIb results, data from 4 earlier-stage placebo-controlled studies were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. This is the second potential indication for dupilumab for which data have been published in the New England Journal of Medicine. As a reminder, Phase IIa data in asthma were published last year. This further underscores the level of interest from the medical community in dupilumab. Our Phase IIb study of dupilumab in asthma is fully enrolled, and we expect data from this trial in early 2015 and data from the nasal polyposis trial, which is also fully enrolled, to be available later this year. While there have been a lot of positive developments in our late-stage development pipeline, I would like to take a few moments to address some of the exciting developments in our earlier-stage pipeline. The Regeneron Genetics Center is fully operational, and we have made additional key hires and entered into additional collaborations with academic institutions. Our earlier-stage antibody program is advancing, and we remain on track for additional INDs this year. This includes our intravitreal angiopoietin-2 antibody and EYLEA combination drug candidate in ophthalmology. We're planning our first entries into the immuno-oncology arena, where we expect our CD20-CD3 Bispecific antibody to enter the clinic by the end of this year, and we expect to file an IND for our PD-1 antibody later this year. With that, let me now turn the call over to Bob Terifay, who will provide further details on the EYLEA commercial landscape.
Robert J. Terifay: Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. It's a very exciting time to be responsible for commercialization at Regeneron. I'd like to begin my discussion today with EYLEA, or intravitreal aflibercept, injections. Second quarter U.S. EYLEA net sales to distributors were $415 million, which represents a 26% increase over second quarter 2013. Sequential quarterly growth in physician sales were 7%. The growth so far this year has come primarily from growth in the wet AMD market due to an aging U.S. population. According to a qualitative market research survey that we conducted in the second quarter, EYLEA continues to account for approximately half of the market for FDA-approved anti-VEGF therapies for wet AMD in the United States. Based on this survey, it appears that there has not been a major shift in market shares between FDA-approved anti-VEGF therapies and off-label compounded bevacizumab. FDA-approved therapies still represent approximately half the total anti-VEGF market in this indication. As you know, last week, we received FDA approval for EYLEA in a third important new indication, diabetic macular edema, which is the leading cause of blindness among working-aged adults in the United States. EYLEA is the first and only anti-VEGF agent approved for DME with a dosing interval of greater than every 4 weeks. According to the U.S. prescribing information, EYLEA can be dosed every 8 weeks following 5 initial monthly doses. The Phase III studies for EYLEA in DME were the only registration studies that compared an anti-VEGF agent to prospective macular laser photocoagulation therapy dosed at baseline and then as needed thereafter. In addition, EYLEA is the only FDA-approved agent approved for DME that has the same single-strength dose per injection as approved for wet AMD. Physicians' offices, therefore, only have to stock 1 dosage form, EYLEA 2 milligrams, without concern over inventory management of multiple dosage strengths and the risk of misbilling payors for the wrong dose. Moreover, in terms of mean gain in best corrected visual acuity at 52 weeks, EYLEA is the only anti-VEGF agent that has demonstrated similar efficacy in DME patients naive to anti-VEGF therapy and those treated with an anti-VEGF inhibitor or anti-VEGF therapy prior, which is reported in our U.S. prescribing information. We've already launched EYLEA in DME. Our sales force is already calling on the physicians treating DME, who are largely the same physicians who treat wet AMD. This provides us with great operating leverage within the EYLEA franchise. DME has the potential to be a large market opportunity. It is estimated that 600,000 patients are diagnosed with centrally involved diabetic macular edema in the United States, a similar number to those diagnosed with wet AMD. Of these DME patients, only about 40% are currently treated with anti-VEGF therapy. We expect near-term EYLEA growth in DME to come from patients who are not adequately responding to their current anti-VEGF therapy and patients new to anti-VEGF therapy presenting to a retinal specialist. Longer term, the market opportunity for EYLEA and DME is to growth the anti-VEGF market by first educating physicians and patients about the need for early screening and diagnosis of DME through regular dilated eye exams; and secondly, ensuring that diagnosed patients are referred to retinal specialists early instead of cycling through laser or steroid therapy at the general ophthalmology office. Later this year, we hope to receive FDA approval of EYLEA for the treatment of macular edema following branch retinal vein occlusion, or BRVO, which should further contribute to our longer-term sales potential. With this fourth potential indication, EYLEA would be available for patients with all types of retinal vein occlusions. In the United States, there are approximately 36,000 patients treated each year with a VEGF inhibitor for macular edema following central retinal vein occlusion. The number of patients with macular edema following BRVO is roughly 3x the number of patients with macular edema following CRVO. I'd now like to address the x U.S. EYLEA business, where we split profits with our collaborator, Bayer HealthCare. Second quarter 2014 x U.S. EYLEA sales were $247 million. x U.S. EYLEA sales continue to be an important growth driver, and the launch outside the United States is making significant progress. Over the course of 2014, we expect Bayer to embark on additional launches in the 2 approved indications of wet AMD and macular edema following central retinal vein occlusion following regulatory and then pricing approval in individual countries. Outside of the United States, EYLEA is approved in 71 countries for its wet AMD indication and 58 countries in the macular edema following CRVO indication. EYLEA has been filed in Europe and Japan for the treatment of macular -- of diabetic macular edema. If approved, Bayer plans to launch EYLEA for DME later this year. Bayer's also filed regulatory applications for EYLEA for the treatment of macular edema following BRVO in Europe and for the treatment of choroidal neovascularization secondary to pathologic myopia in Japan. Turning now to the other exciting news of last the week. We and our partner, Sanofi, are very encouraged about the potential for alirocumab, our investigational PCSK9 antibody that is being evaluated for the -- for lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. It's estimated that there are over 60 million patients in the United States and the 5 major Western European countries who are not at their target LDL-C levels despite their current standard-of-care therapies. These numbers split out fairly evenly across the regions. About 35 million of these patients are considered at high risk of a cardiovascular event, and approximately 22 million are considered at very high risk. Our market research indicates that the profile of alirocumab, if approved, would be appealing to health care professionals. Specifically, alirocumab has been studied in 2 convenient 1-milliliter dosage strengths: a 150-milligram dose and a 75-milligram dose. In our Phase III program reported to date, the majority of patients who started on a 75-milligram dose achieved their LDL-C targets without having to up-titrate to the 150-milligram dose. A goal of our Phase III development program is to provide patients and physicians with dosing flexibility to tailor therapy to suit the needs of individual patients. We're rapidly preparing for upcoming regulatory filings with potential regulatory approvals of alirocumab. Market development activities are underway with a significant presence planned at the European Society of Cardiology meeting in August and the American Heart Association meeting in November. As you can imagine, preparing for a significant launch, such as what we and Sanofi expect for alirocumab, requires planning and commercial investment. With the potential launch anticipated in the second half of 2015, that investment is already underway and will continue to accelerate in the upcoming months. As part of the agreement with Sanofi, we currently share these pre-commercialization expenses with Sanofi, approximately 50-50 on a real-time basis. Bob Landry will provide more detail on the financial impact. With that, let me turn over the call to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Landry.
Robert E. Landry: Thanks, Bob, and good morning to everyone who has joined us today. Regeneron realized strong financial results in the second quarter. In the second quarter, we earned $2.47 per diluted share from non-GAAP net income of $289 million, which represents a 43% and 46% increase, respectively, versus the 3 months ended June 30, 2013. Regeneron's non-GAAP EPS excludes noncash share-based compensation expense, noncash interest expense related to our senior convertible notes and income tax expense. In the second quarter of 2014, our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation also included an additional expense of $10.8 million related to our loss on extinguishment of debt in relation to the conversion of a portion of our convertible notes. A full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is set forth in our earnings release. Total revenues in the second quarter of 2014 were $666 million, representing a 45% increase compared to total revenues in the second quarter of 2013. Net product sales were $418 million in the second quarter of 2014 compared to $334 million in the second quarter of 2013. EYLEA net product sales in the United States were $415 million in the second quarter of 2014 compared to $330 million in the second quarter of 2013, an increase of 26%. Second quarter 2013 U.S. EYLEA net sales were impacted by a modest increase in distributor inventory. Excluding these changes in inventory, underlying demand for EYLEA in the second quarter of 2014 in the United States increased by approximately 22% year-over-year. U.S. EYLEA net sales distributor inventory levels at the end of the second quarter 2014 were consistent with first quarter 2014 levels and remain within the normalized 1- to 2-week range. As mentioned in our press release issued earlier this morning, we are reaffirming our U.S. EYLEA net sales guidance of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. As a reminder, we expect an acceleration in growth of U.S. EYLEA sales in the second half due to the recent approval of EYLEA on the DME indication and our anticipated approval later this year in the macular edema following BRVO indication. x U.S. EYLEA sales were $247 million in the second quarter of 2014, as compared to $102 million in the second quarter of 2013. Product revenue from x U.S. EYLEA sales is recorded by our partner, Bayer HealthCare. Please keep in mind that Bayer HealthCare's reported x U.S. EYLEA sales are not exactly the same as the x U.S. numbers that we report. This is because, for Japan, Bayer reports their sales to their distributor, Santen, while we report Santen's end market sales. We recognized $67 million as our share of the net profit from x U.S. EYLEA sales in the second quarter of 2014 after repayment of $15 million in development expenses to Bayer HealthCare. Bayer HealthCare collaboration revenue for the second quarter was $97 million. This included one $15 million sales milestone that we earned upon aggregate x U.S. net sales of EYLEA exceeding $700 million over a 12-month period. Depending on future x U.S. sales, we could receive at least 2 additional $15 million milestone payments this year. Global ZALTRAP or ziv-aflibercept injection for intravenous infusion net sales, as recorded by Sanofi, were $21 million in the second quarter of 2014. We recognized approximately $1 million as our share of the losses related to ZALTRAP in the second quarter. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $143 million for the second quarter of 2014. As we've said before, the Sanofi collaboration revenue line primarily consists of reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred R&D expenses, which was $139 million in the second quarter of 2014; our share of losses in connection with ZALTRAP; and amortization of upfront and other payments received from Sanofi. In addition, in the second quarter of 2014, we began formally sharing prelaunch commercialization expenses related to alirocumab in accordance with our antibody-collaboration agreement. Let me say a few words on how we will record the prelaunch commercialization expenses, as this is a new component within our Sanofi collaboration revenue new line item. The prelaunch commercialization expenses that Regeneron incurs will be primarily recorded within our SG&A line. The Sanofi collaboration revenue line will include reimbursements from Sanofi of approximately 50% of our prelaunch commercialization expenses. In addition, we will also record, as contra revenue within Sanofi collaboration revenue, our reimbursement to Sanofi for approximately 50% of the prelaunch commercialization expenses that Sanofi incurs. In the second quarter of 2014, since Sanofi spent more than we did on prelaunch commercialization expenses, there was a net balance payable to Sanofi, which appears as contra revenue of $4.3 million in table 4 of our earnings release. As we approach the launch of alirocumab and other antibodies that are part of our collaboration with Sanofi, we expect this expense contra revenue to increase. Obviously, once the antibodies are launched and become profitable, we expect this component to become positive revenue, as it will reflect our share of the antibody commercial profits. Turning to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $251 million in the second quarter of 2014. Our unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as the total GAAP R&D expense minus R&D reimbursements we receive from our collaborators and R&D noncash share-based compensation expense, was $109 million in the second quarter of 2014. Our press release issued this morning includes all the information that is required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense. As referenced earlier on this call, last week, a Regeneron subsidiary purchased a priority review voucher from a subsidiary of BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. Sanofi and Regeneron will equally share the cost of $67.5 million. Regeneron will record half of the cost as an unreimbursed R&D charge in the third quarter of 2014. Primarily as a result of this transaction, we are increasing our unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D guidance to $470 million to $510 million from the previous guidance of $425 million to $475 million. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses for the second quarter were $76 million. As we mentioned during our first quarter earnings call, we expect non-GAAP SG&A expenses to be higher in the second half of 2014 as we begin to incur greater prelaunch expenses, primarily for alirocumab and, to a lesser extent, sarilumab. However, at the same time that we begin to ramp up pre-commercial expenses on our Phase III pipeline, I do want to reinforce the favorable expense leverage we will begin to achieve for EYLEA as sales grow in the DME indication. The retinal specialists who treat DME are mostly the same as those treating wet AMD and CRVO and already being called on by our specialty sales force. Therefore, we don't anticipate a significant increase in commercial expenses related to EYLEA, even following the approval in additional indications. Thus, we anticipate a higher rate of profitability on these incremental DME sales. For the full year, we expect non-GAAP SG&A expenses of between $310 million and $350 million, which is lower than our previous guidance of the $330 million to $380 million. As a reminder, non-GAAP R&D and non-GAAP SG&A expenses exclude noncash share-based compensation expense. Non-GAAP cost of goods sold was $29 million in the second quarter. Included in this line item are royalty expenses in connection with our agreement with Genentech related to U.S. EYLEA sales, which we're obligated to pay until May, 2016. Cost of collaboration manufacturing was $16 million in second quarter. With regard to taxes, due to the amounts of the company's net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards available for tax purposes, the company does not currently pay significant cash income taxes. In the second quarter of 2014, our GAAP effective tax rate was approximately 54% as compared to 41% for the second quarter of 2013. The tax rate for the second quarter of 2014 was negatively impacted from losses being incurred in foreign jurisdictions with rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate and the expiration at the end of 2013 of the federal tax credit for increased research activities. For the full year, we expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be in the mid-50% range. We ended the second quarter with a strong cash position of $1.4 billion in cash and marketable securities. This increased cash balance reflects strong operational cash generation realized during the 6 months ended June 30 of $381 million versus to $214 million for the same period last year. Our operational cash flow was offset by financial transactions related to the conversion of $61 million principal amount of our convertible notes. Total cash payments related to these financial transactions were $204 million. These transactions are further explained in Footnote 9 in our second quarter 2014 10-Q, which was filed earlier this morning. With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Len.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Thanks, everyone. We are pleased by the progress that we have made in the first half of the year and are focused on delivering on our goals for the remainder of the year and beyond. We look forward to the ongoing launch of EYLEA in the DME indication. On the regulatory front, we will be working diligently towards submitted regulatory applications for alirocumab by the end of the year, both in the U.S. and in Europe, in collaboration with Sanofi. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Michael.
Michael Aberman: Thank you, Len. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Our team will be available in our offices after the call for follow-up questions. Thank you. And operator, if you could please now give instructions and open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs.
Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I was just wondering -- I know you're not going to give specific guidance for 2015 at this point, but if we look at your unreimbursed R&D expense this year and we net out the half of the priority review voucher expense, is that the right run rate to think about going forward? Or should we expect a step-down in expense, given you've completed most of the PCSK9 Phase III trials?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Bob?
Robert E. Landry: Thanks for the call. No, on unreimbursed R&D, if you do the math, you know it's going to be basically be higher in the second half of 2014 than it is in 2013, even if you back out the voucher. We do expect that to continue, as you've heard from kind of George and Len with regards to numerous programs that we have that are -- that remain partnered and unpartnered. And certainly, the unpartnered piece is what's going to hit the unreimbursed R&D, in addition to everything else we have going on. So I do envision our unreimbursed R&D to be higher in 2015 than it would be in 2014, less the voucher.
Operator: Our next question is from Robyn Karnauskas of Deutsche Bank.
Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: So just thinking about the daily market. You talked about early growth coming from switching. I was just wondering, how many people do you think are really failing therapy? There hasn't been a lot of anti-VEGF. So how does it differ from AMD? Were you calling a lot more people who are failing therapy? And how do you think about the dynamics of the launch versus AMD?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Bob?
Robert E. Landry: So Robyn, the thing we know about DME from the clinical programs for both EYLEA as well as our competitors, is that if you look at the OCT measures, which are the measures of whether the retina is completely dry or not, DME is a much more VEGF-mediated disease with a lot more retinal wetness. So if physicians are using OCT to guide their treatment, which they often do, we anticipate that there will be a large number of potential switch candidates. I'm not going to quantify the specifics of that. I still think the major opportunity is the longer-term opportunity in DME, which is to expand the market. There are still a number of patients who are still being treated with laser, as well as steroids, which both have their own drawbacks. And so our real focus is to try to get patients treated early, treated when they are anti-VEGF treatment naïve. Obviously, we'll be glad to get the switches, but our opportunity is really to get the new patients and get them early.
Operator: The next question is from Yaron Werber of Citi.
Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: So what can you tell about the SR-31 [ph] gene therapy for AMD? And how sustainable are the protein levels from the gene expression?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes, it doesn't exactly sound like Yaron. But the answer to the question is that we really don't have any comments about that program. You really should be talking to Avalanche directly, as they're managing and running it and have all the data.
Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: What are the timelines for the EYLEA PDT Phase I/II data?
Leonard S. Schleifer: We haven't really commented more on that. Obviously, those trials are ongoing.
Operator: The next question is from Jason Kantor of Crédit Suisse.
Jeremiah Shepard - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: This is Jeremiah filling in for Jason. In regards to the outcome study for alirocumab, how much different is the patient population than what you've enrolled for the long-term study? And also, is there any predetermined -- in terms of the OUTCOME study?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes. We're not going to get into the -- it's a very competitive area, so we don't want to get into too many of the details of our program in this setting. I think it's better left for scientific meetings. Although we can say that, obviously, the people in our study are at high risk, and they will have been treated with a statin, an ongoing treatment with a statin.
Operator: The next question is from Adnan Butt of RBC Capital Markets.
Adnan S. Butt - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: It's Adnan. I wish I had put associate on the ticket. 2 questions, but here's my question. For the PCSK9 products, what's the feasibility of showing differentiation amongst the different anti-PCSK9s that are in development? Is that possible, either on dosing, administration, label, et cetera? And if you can't answer that, then my question is on the certainty of filing for -- using the voucher.
Leonard S. Schleifer: I didn't get the second question. What was the second question?
Adnan S. Butt - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: If you can't answer the first one, then what's the precedent for using the voucher strategy to get a priority review? What's the certainty around that?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Right. So let me briefly just say, on the first one, I think that, from a basic biochemical point of view, the antibodies that most people are developing are subtly different, but not major differences. And many of the differences and differentiations, I think, will come from the program design, the label, et cetera, et cetera. We think we conducted a pretty robust program. We had a long treatment study, which looked at safety and efficacy over a long period of time in a well-controlled manner, which is where some of the cardiovascular retrospective analysis came from. So I think we'll have to see. In terms of -- there is a precedent for the priority review voucher being used, and it was slightly different voucher. This was a tropical disease one, and I believe Novartis used it in one of their programs.
George D. Yancopoulos: I think a major comment should be made just about the differentiation in that our program is unique in terms of having the 2 dosage forms, and maybe Bob Terifay wants to comment more on that.
Robert J. Terifay: Yes. I agree with Len and George. I think that this comes down to how you develop your drug. And obviously, our studies -- or many of our studies are still underway. But when we designed our program, we specifically focus on tailoring therapy to the individual needs of patients. Different patients have different baseline LDL-C levels dependent upon what they're on as background therapy. And so we designed the program to really allow the therapy to be tailored to the patient.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes, I just want to add that the way these antibodies -- there's a lot of different antibodies out there, and they bind PCSK9 in different ways, in different sites, in different molecular attach points, et cetera, et cetera. So some of the nuances there are not immediately obvious, but there are significant differences between the antibodies and how they bind, et cetera.
Operator: The next question is from Matt Roden of UBS.
Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: It's on alirocumab. And if I may, come I'll break it up into a clinical component and a commercial component. The clinical side, you mentioned the caveats of the cardiovascular event finding. We appreciate this is a post-hoc analysis, but what do you think is reasonable to conclude from that data point? And would you expect those data to be reflected in the label? And then on the sort of operational planning side, you guys cite the 35 million patients at high risk for cardiovascular events, 22 million are very high risk. It sounds like your sort of commercial operations will position this as explicitly a primary care product. So is that correct? This is an area where we've kind of struggled to model to what extent this is going to be specialty product versus a primary care market. And it has a lot of implications on pricing strategy, expenses, margins, top line opportunity. So I know you can't give guidance on all this stuff, but it would be helpful if you could maybe touch on some of those items.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Sure. Well, just a brief comment on the label. It's just too early to talk about the label. You can be sure we'll be submitting all the data that we have. In terms of what conclusion you can draw, I think both George and I have said that you can't draw any firm conclusions from a post-hoc analysis. We will be testing this analysis in a prospective way in the OUTCOME study when we actually look for outcomes. But of course, we will submit all the data that we have. And what's in the label, we will discuss once we get the label from the FDA. In terms of how we are going to commercialize this, what our strategy is, I doubt whether -- those are all great questions. It's as though you were sitting in some of our meetings over the last year or so. But we're trying to address them all, but this wouldn't be the right place to address them.
Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. Is there -- maybe it's just too early to comment about pricing, of course. But if you think about the doc feedback we've gotten, we've heard some folks talk about this being a CCU product and others talking about a major secondary prevention drug. Is there a way to marry those 2 opportunities?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Once again, good questions, but just too early for us to talk about our commercialization strategy at this point. Thanks for the thoughts, though.
Operator: The next question is from Joseph Schwartz of Leerink Partners.
Joseph P. Schwartz - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division: I was wondering, when are we going to be able to learn about your EYLEA-PDGF combo product at the next data point, whenever that is? Will there be any derisking data beyond safety and tolerability to see how efficacy could stack up relative to other anti-PDGF combinations?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Maybe George wants to add to this, but the only thing I would say, from these early studies, you would expect to find primarily safety and tolerability results. George?
George D. Yancopoulos: We think that the field is still quite open. It's not really been established what the PDGF pathway can provide. And we hope that ultimately, our program will be able to definitively answer that question. But also, obviously, potential advantages of our program is that we will be providing, potentially, the combination opportunity in the same injection, which obviously would have, I think, great advantage to the patients and to the physicians. But we don't think -- certainly, the standard hasn't been set or even defined. It's not clear exactly what the PDGF advantage can be, and we hope that our program might be the first to definitively define what the benefit could be.
Operator: Next question is from John Newman of Canaccord.
John L. Newman - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division: The question is on alirocumab. Can you give us a sense, any kind of information or direction you can give us in terms of the magnitude of difference that you saw in the post-hoc CV analysis? And also, given that your product will be supplied to the market in 2 dose strengths, do you think that might result in fewer injection site reactions in the real world, since the smaller dose level would be less viscous?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes. This is not the forum to get into the details of our data. Obviously, we would have put it out in the press release if we intended to do that. You'll find that the details will get presented at the appropriate scientific conference. In terms of the 75-milligram and 150-milligram, I don't think the goal there was to talk about injection site reactions. That's not why we mainly developed a different dosage form. Injection site reactions have not been a significant problem overall for the program at either dose. But George, maybe you might want to reiterate a little bit about the 75 and 150 strategy?
George D. Yancopoulos: Yes. We think, obviously, physicians and patients often have different needs and desires in terms of what they want to do. We believe the 150 dosage form will allow for those patients and the physicians who feel their patients need to have their cholesterol robustly lowered and rapidly, we have that dosage forms. And for those who want a more flexible approach and try a lower dose first and see if they can get to goal with the lower dosage form first and then only up-titrate if need be, we have that as well. And I think that a lot of physicians feel that, that flexibility, regardless of the drug or the indication, often has certain advantages, so we're offering that flexibility to the physicians and their patients.
Leonard S. Schleifer: And they'll both be in a 1-cc dosage form.
Operator: The next question is from Phil Nadeau of Cowen and Company.
Philip Nadeau - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Just one question on EYLEA and DME. That's on the reimbursement environment. Could you give us some details about the proportion of patients that are Medicare versus Medicaid versus private pay? And then, within Medicare, could you remind us how that works in DME? Will you need to get a new code, or can you use the AMD code to get reimbursed immediately?
Leonard S. Schleifer: So thanks for the question. We appreciate your following us so persistently for such a long time. We'll let Bob answer your specific questions.
Robert J. Terifay: So, as you surmise, DME is a little bit different than AMD. AMD is a patient population that is generally elderly, and so we have a lot of Medicare patients. DME splits out roughly 50/50 with regards to Medicare and non-Medicare or commercial pay. With regards to the Medicare segment, there is a -- it splits out about 35% is roughly traditional Medicare and the rest of it is Medicare Advantage. In terms of reimbursement, I don't want to get into too many specifics, but what I can tell you is we do not need a new J-Code. Medicare does have a law that they have to cover new therapies that are available for patients. Right now, we're just waiting for people to load the code into -- load the price and the information into their systems. But they will have to reimburse retrospectively for the indication. And so most of our focus right now is on the Medicare patient population.
Leonard S. Schleifer: So just to be clear on that Medicare, that's about 40% is Medicare. Of that, and the majority of that is traditional Medicare. So it's 30% of the overall population, not 30% of Medicare.
Robert J. Terifay: No, that's right. Sorry.
Operator: The next question is from Chris Raymond of Robert W. Baird.
Laura K. Chico - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: This is Laura Chico in for Chris Raymond. I guess, I was a little surprised to hear you say that there's been really no change in terms of the Avastin share -- or rather, there might have been some stabilization there in the AMD market. Just wondering, how do you think the landscape might evolve over the next 12 months? Do you expect that to continue or -- just be interested in your comments there.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes. So barring any sort of structural change, we would imagine things would sort of continue basically splitting out the way they are. Although we do know that the FDA is still reviewing their whole compounding enforcement strategy and they have not come out with a definitive statement yet on how they're going to handle biologics, so we're still waiting to see how that turns out. Although we know they have stepped up some of their enforcement activity in this area for sure.
Operator: Next question is from Biren Amin of Jefferies.
Biren Amin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Would you expect that there's a significant pool of treatment-experienced DME patients that are available to switch to EYLEA in -- I guess, similar in size to what you experienced in wet AMD 2 years ago?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes, it's difficult to quantify that. But surely, there are some patients who are not satisfied with their results and that would be candidates for switching. And we've already sort of heard that from doctors that they've got patients who they plan to switch. And actually, some have already tried, and we've seen a few tweets about that out there in the retinal community. But in terms of quantifying that, I think we'll just have to get -- wait for the -- this quarter to play out so we can get a better idea.
Operator: The next question is from Jim Birchenough of BMO Capital Markets.
Unknown Analyst: It's Mike in for Jim. He's on vacation. And I'd like to ask a question on the pipeline. You have a number of product programs, primarily in Phase I. And I'm wondering if you can direct us towards programs that might be reading out with data that could be leading to large, important trials next year. In particular, the GDF8 program, you have close to 400 patients that were being recruited into trials that perhaps might read out later on in the second half of the year.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes, we haven't given too much guidance. You've identified one that we have talked about, so we'll have to see those data when they do come out. That's an interesting opportunity that a number of companies are sort looking at. Of course, we are going to be looking forward to our CD20 Bispecific getting in the clinic this year, our anti-PD1 and the IND filed before the end of the year. So those would be some up-and-coming new programs. And obviously, we do have a tremendous amount with our Phase II programs in dupilumab, getting data from asthma and getting data from nasal polyposis and finishing up the sarilumab Phase III, et cetera. So there is a lot going on, but we don't have any more to update you at this point other than what's in our filings today.
Operator: And the last question is from Geoff Meacham of JPMorgan.
Carter L. Gould - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: This is Carter on for Jeff. For the pediatric priority review voucher, it's my understanding that you have to notify the agency at least 90 days in advance of filing. Can you tell us if you've already notified the agency of your intent to file with the voucher?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes, we are not going to get into those details at all. The only thing we're going to tell you is that we have acquired the voucher. And we -- Sanofi and Regeneron plan to use it to obtain priority review, and we will follow all the rules and regs, et cetera, et cetera.
Michael Aberman: Okay. Thank you very much, everybody, for joining us on this call. As I mentioned earlier, myself and the team, Manisha, et cetera, will be available for follow-up questions. If you need them, just e-mail us and we'll schedule a time. Operator, that concludes the call.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Q1 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Michael Aberman, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.
Michael Aberman: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' First Quarter 2014 Conference Call. An archive of this webcast will be available on our website under Events and Presentations for 30 days. Joining me on the call today is Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; George Yancopoulos, Founding Scientist, President of Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer; Bob Landry, Chief Financial Officer; and Bob Terifay, Senior Vice President, Commercial. After our prepared remarks, we'll open the call for Q&A. I would also like to remind you that remarks made on this call include forward-looking statements about Regeneron. Such statements may include, but are not limited to, those related to Regeneron and its products and business, sales and expense forecast, financial forecast, development programs, collaborations, finances, regulatory matters, intellectual property and competition. Each forward-looking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected in such statements. A more complete description of these and other material risks can be found in Regeneron's filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, including its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, and Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2014, which was filed with the SEC this morning. Regeneron does not undertake any obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. In addition, please note that GAAP and non-GAAP measures will be discussed on today's call. Information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these measures to GAAP are available in our financial results press release, which can be accessed on our website, www.regeneron.com. Once our call concludes, the IR team will be available to answer further questions. With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. The first quarter was another significant quarter for Regeneron. The global EYLEA franchise continued to grow, and I will address that in more detail shortly. Our pipeline made progress, and we now have 15 antibodies in clinical development. We continue to make advances towards our mission of bringing important and innovative new medicines to patients. Our financial position has continued to strengthen, and we have embarked on new R&D initiatives and collaborations, including a collaboration with Avalanche Biotechnologies in the field of gene therapy that we announced earlier this week. Let's turn now to some of the specifics of the quarter. The EYLEA franchise continues to exhibit strong growth, with global net sales of $577 million in the first quarter, representing a 54% increase compared to global EYLEA sales of $376 million in the first quarter of 2013. First quarter 2014 EYLEA net sales in the U.S. was $359 million, which represents a 14% increase compared to first quarter of 2013. Net sales in the first quarter of 2014 were negatively impacted by a decrease in distributor inventory, while net sales in the first quarter of 2013 benefited from an increase in distributor inventory. Excluding these inventory changes, underlying demand for EYLEA in the first quarter in the United States increased by over 25% year-over-year. And this increase was despite the severe winter weather conditions that we believe impacted patients' ability to get to their physicians' offices for scheduled visits in many parts of the U.S. during the first quarter. Bob Terifay will provide further details in his remarks. x U.S. EYLEA sales -- net sales were $218 million compared to $62 million in the first quarter of 2013, which was the first full quarter of EYLEA sales outside the U.S. by our x U.S. partner, Bayer HealthCare. Looking ahead at the rest of 2014, we expect a number of potential growth drivers for EYLEA in the U.S. As announced previously, we have been granted an FDA target action date of August 18 for EYLEA in the Diabetic Macular Edema, or DME, indication. We believe that over the long term, in the United States, DME could be as significant an opportunity as wet AMD. We have also been granted a PDUFA date of October 23 for EYLEA in the fourth indication macular edema following branch retinal vein occlusion, or BRVO. With these 2 potential label expansions in the second half of the year, we expect an increase in the growth of EYLEA sales in the U.S. in 2014 to be weighted towards the second half of the year. Taking these factors into consideration, we reaffirm our previously provided full year U.S. EYLEA net sales guidance of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. You will hear more about the commercial performance of EYLEA from Bob Terifay. Further confirming our commitment to expanding our presence in the ophthalmology space, early this week, we announced an exciting collaboration with Avalanche to research and develop novel gene therapy products for the treatment of ophthalmic diseases. Avalanche is a leader in the field of next-generation gene therapy technologies, and we look forward to working with them to expand our approaches to developing novel therapies for diseases of the back of the eye. In the coming months, we anticipate a large amount of new slope from our late-stage pipeline. We expect to report Phase III data from 9 studies about Alirocumab, our PCSK9 antibody for lowering LDL-cholesterol. Alirocumab clinical trials are addressing several patient populations, where, despite current therapies, there continues to exist a significant number of patients at high-cardiovascular risk. It is estimated that worldwide, there are approximately 22 million diabetic patients on statins with LDL-cholesterol levels greater than 70 milligrams per deciliter. There are 7.6 million secondary prevention patients, at least 250,000 diagnosed heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia patients, and finally, about 5.8 patients -- 5.8 million patients who are statin intolerant. All of these patient populations are at high-cardiovascular risk and could potentially benefit from a therapy that could lower their LDL-cholesterol more than can be achieved with current standard of care. We hope to present our Phase III data from sarilumab, our IL-6 antibody, with achievement of rheumatoid arthritis in the medical conference this quarter. Despite the availability of several TNF inhibitors for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, it is believed that up to 40% of patients are inadequately controlled or unable to tolerate their first TNF-alpha inhibitor. We believe that sarilumab has the potential to offer a very compelling product profile, with the flexibility of both low-dose and high-dose subcutaneous regimens, coupled with every-other-week dosing, which might offer a good option for patients. For dupilumab, a potentially important new therapy for patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, we look forward to reporting top line Phase IIb data and starting a Phase III program in this indication shortly. We are also currently exploring dupilumab in Phase II trials for asthma and nasal polyposis and evaluating starting the drug in a variety of other Th2-mediated diseases. You will hear further details from George. With that, let me turn the call over to George Yancopoulos, Regeneron's Chief Scientific Officer, who will discuss our pipeline in greater detail. He will be followed by Bob Terifay, our Senior Vice President of Commercial, and then by Bob Landry, our Chief Financial Officer. George?
George D. Yancopoulos: Thank you, Len, and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us today. I'm happy to report that Regeneron's broad pipeline continues to advance. Let me begin with EYLEA. As Len mentioned, we've been granted a PDUFA date of August 18 for EYLEA in the DME indication and October 23 for the macular edema, following BRVO indication. Our x U.S. partner, Bayer HealthCare, has also submitted applications for marketing authorization in the DME indication in the European Union and in Japan. Diabetes is a growing significant public health issue worldwide, and diabetic macular edema represents one of the site-threatening complication of diabetes. If approved, we hope to be able to provide a new therapeutic option for the treatment of this condition. We are going to be getting a lot of data from our late-stage antibody programs in the very near term. Let me begin with alirocumab, a monoclonal antibody for lowering LDL-cholesterol. Beginning in June, we expect to start reporting data from 9 Phase III studies about alirocumab. We have previously reported positive data from the Phase III ODYSSEY MONO study, which studies alirocumab in the monotherapy setting. The data from these 10 studies will be the basis for our regulatory submissions globally. And we expect to be ready to make these submissions by approximately at the end of 2014. In the U.S., the regulatory submission is gated on the progress of the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial and discussions with the FDA. Since both the trials and our discussions are ongoing, we cannot give more precise guidance on timing in the U.S. at this time. This past quarter, we also shared data for the first time for alirocumab dosed every 4 weeks at the 150-milligram dose in patients who were not on statin. We think this regimen could be an important option for patients to be dosed every 4 weeks, with an easy-to-use, single 1-milliliter injection of alirocumab. We are studying this dose in the CHOICE II trial that was started in the first quarter and is already fully enrolled. I'm also happy to report that the CHOICE I study, which explores 300 milligrams dosed every 4 weeks, is also fully enrolled. We believe that the Phase III ODYSSEY program is designed to yield robust efficacy and safety data. Excluding the OUTCOMES trial, we expect to have over 5,000 patient years of double-blind exposure at the time of the completion of these trials. As we have mentioned before, we have also designed our program to support the ability of physicians to personalize therapy and either start patients at a higher dose or start at a lower dose and up-titrate necessary, thus offering greater flexibility to suit individual patient needs. Our Phase III program in rheumatoid arthritis with sarilumab, our antibody targeting the IL-6 pathway, is progressing. And we hope to present the full positive data from the Phase III MOBILITY study in an upcoming medical conference shortly. We reported top line positive data from this study in the fourth quarter of 2013. There are currently 4 more Phase III studies of sarilumab in RA that are ongoing, with expected readouts beginning in 2015. Turning to dupilumab. We continue to be very excited by this IL-4 receptor alpha antibody that blocks both the IL-4 and IL-13 signaling pathways. Dupilumab is currently in clinical trials for asthma, atopic dermatitis and nasal polyposis. At the Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, also known as Quad AI, we presented positive data from a Phase IIa study of dupilumab in atopic dermatitis. We expect to report data from our Phase IIb study of dupilumab in atopic dermatitis in the second quarter of 2014 and expect to initiate a Phase III study shortly thereafter. Dupilumab is also currently in a Phase II proof-of-concept trial in nasal polyposis and a Phase IIb study in asthma. We are evaluating the potential use of dupilumab in additional clinical indications. As you can see, we have a busy late-stage pipeline. Our early-stage pipeline is also active and growing. We now have a total of 15 antibodies in the clinic, including 2 that entered the clinic this year: REGN2176, our PDGF pathway blocking antibody; and REGN2222, against an undisclosed target. We expect at least 2 additional antibodies to enter the clinic by year-end, including our first clinical candidate in immuno-oncology, a bispecific antibody. All of these antibodies were derived using our VelocImmune technology. 8 of the 15 antibodies that are currently in clinical development are being developed in collaboration with Sanofi, including our newest antibody in the clinic, REGN2222. I would now like to also spend a few minutes talking about a recent new R&D initiative. As we announced on Monday, we have entered into a collaboration with Avalanche Biotechnologies to develop next-generation gene therapy products in ophthalmology. Genetics has always been an area of interest and expertise at Regeneron. As such, the movement to gene therapy is a natural fit. We view Avalanche as a leader in this field, particularly as it applies to diseases of the eye and development of novel vectors that specifically target retinal cells. Our scientific and commercial expertise in ophthalmology, combined with Avalanche's novel vector technologies, will allow us to invest and investigate potentially breakthrough therapies in ophthalmology. With that, let me now turn the call over to Bob Terifay, our Senior Vice President of Commercial, who will provide further details on the EYLEA commercial landscape.
Robert J. Terifay: Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin with EYLEA, or intravitreal aflibercept injection. First quarter U.S. EYLEA net sales were $359 million. According to a qualitative market research survey that we conducted in the first quarter, EYLEA continues to account for approximately half of the branded anti-VEGF market in the United States for the treatment of wet AMD. And the brand of market continues to represent approximately half of the total anti-VEGF market in this indication. As previously mentioned, we saw distributors build EYLEA inventory towards the end of last year, which was driven partly by the tightening of our commercial payment terms, beginning in January of 2014. During the first quarter, inventory levels were worked down to the normalized 1- to 2-week range compared to the greater than 2 weeks of inventory at the end of 2013. Putting inventory aside, if we look at sales to physicians from the distributors, we saw an increase this quarter of over 25% on a quarter -- on a year-over-year basis and an increase of approximately 3% over fourth quarter of 2013. While there was quarter-over-quarter growth in sales to physicians, we believe the first quarter 2014 U.S. EYLEA sales to doctors were negatively impacted by severe weather conditions in the United States. The inclement weather made it challenging for patients in some parts of the countries to travel to their physicians' offices. Anecdotally, physicians have reported that in the Northeast, Midwest and mid-Atlantic, the weather resulted in fewer patient visits to physicians' offices. EYLEA is an in-office procedure, and the typical wet AMD as outpatient is elderly, making travel this winter particularly difficult. An analysis of sales to physicians by geography shows that EYLEA sales growth in the first quarter was strongest in the parts of the country that did not experience such severe weather, such as the Pacific Northwest, the West Coast, the Southwest and the Southeast. Turning to the macular edema following central retinal vein occlusion, or CRVO indication, the second indication for which EYLEA has been approved in the United States, data from our survey suggest that EYLEA in this indication represents over 40% of the approved branded anti-VEGF market. The branded anti-VEGF market continues to represent about 45% of the overall market. As Len and George mentioned, we're awaiting regulatory decisions for EYLEA in 2 additional indications: diabetic macular edema and macular edema following branch retinal vein occlusion, or BRVO. DME could be as big of a market opportunity as wet AMD. As we have said before, it is estimated that approximately 600,000 patients are diagnosed with clinically significant macular edema in the United States. Of these patients, only about 40% are currently treated with the anti-VEGF therapy. If approved in these indications, we expect an acceleration of growth in the United States' EYLEA sales in the second half of this year. I now like to address the x U.S. EYLEA business, where we split profits with our collaborator, Bayer HealthCare. First quarter 2014 x U.S. EYLEA sales were $218 million. x U.S. EYLEA sales continue to be an important growth driver, and the launch outside the United States is making significant progress. According to data provided by Bayer HealthCare, EYLEA has approximately a 30% share of the market in Germany and is gaining share in the United Kingdom and France, 2 countries where the drug was only recently launched. Over the course of 2014, we expect Bayer to embark on additional launches in the 2 approved indications of wet AMD and macular edema following central retinal vein occlusion, following regulatory and pricing approval in individual countries. Outside of the United States, EYLEA's approved in 61 countries for the wet AMD indication and 40 countries in the macular edema following CRVO indication. With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Landry.
Robert E. Landry: Thanks, Bob, and good morning to everyone. Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter performance. We earned $2.26 per diluted share from non-GAAP net income of $263 million, which represents a 27% and 31% increase, respectively, versus the 3 months ended March 31, 2013. Regeneron's non-GAAP EPS excludes noncash share-based compensation expense, noncash interest expense related to our senior convertible notes and income tax expense. A full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is set forth in our earnings release. Total revenue in the first quarter was $626 million, representing a 42% increase compared to total revenues in the first quarter of 2013. Net product sales were $362 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared to $319 million in the first quarter of 2013. EYLEA net product sales in the United States were $359 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared to $314 million in the first quarter of 2013, an increase of 14%. ARCALYST rilonacept net product sales were $3 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared to $5 million in the first quarter of 2013. As mentioned earlier on the call, first quarter 2014 U.S. EYLEA net sales were adversely impacted by a drawdown of distributor inventory levels to a more normalized range of 1 to 2 weeks on hand. As stated in our press release issued earlier this morning, we are reaffirming our U.S. EYLEA net sales guidance of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. This guidance factors in the potential approval of EYLEA in the DME and macular edema following BRVO indications in the U.S. in the second half of the year. x U.S. EYLEA sales were $218 million in the first quarter 2014 as compared to $62 million in the first quarter of 2013, which was the first full quarter of EYLEA sales outside the United States. Product revenue from x U.S. EYLEA sales is recorded by Bayer HealthCare. As Bob Terifay mentioned in his comments, the EYLEA x U.S. launches on a strong trajectory and showed sequential quarter-over-quarter growth of 18%. We and Bayer HealthCare are very pleased with the progress that EYLEA is making outside the U.S. and anticipate further growth as Bayer continues the global rollout into additional markets, including Spain, Italy and Canada. We recognized $61 million as our share of the net profits from x U.S. EYLEA sales in the first quarter of 2014, after repayment of $14 million in development expenses to Bayer HealthCare. Bayer HealthCare collaboration revenue for the first quarter was $125 million. This included 2 $15 million sales milestones that we earned upon aggregate x U.S. net sales of EYLEA exceeding $500 million and $600 million, respectively, over a 12-month period. Depending on x U.S. sales, we could receive 2 additional $15 million milestone payments this year. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $131 million for the first quarter of 2014. As we've said before, the Sanofi collaboration revenue line primarily consists of reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred R&D expenses, which was $128 million in the first quarter; our share of losses in connection with ZALTRAP, ziv-aflibercept for intravenous infusion, which was $3 million in the first quarter; and amortization of upfront and other payments received from Sanofi. Global ZALTRAP net sales as recorded by Sanofi were $22 million in the first quarter. Turning to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $244 million in the first quarter of 2014. Our unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as the total GAAP R&D expense minus R&D reimbursements we received from our collaborators and R&D noncash share-based compensation expense, was $95 million in the first quarter of 2014. Our press release issued this morning includes all the information that's required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense. For 2014, we are reaffirming our previously provided unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D guidance of $425 million to $475 million. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses for the first quarter were $71 million. For the full year 2014, we are reaffirming our non-GAAP SG&A guidance to be between $330 million to $380 million. We are expecting our non-GAAP SG&A expenses to be higher in the second half of 2014, as we begin to record prelaunch expenses for alirocumab. As a reminder, non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses exclude noncash share-based compensation expense. Non-GAAP cost of goods sold was $27 million in the first quarter. Included in this line item are royalty expenses in connection with our agreement with Genentech related to U.S. EYLEA sales, which we're obligated to pay until May 2016. Cost of collaboration manufacturing was $16 million in the first quarter. Turning now to taxes. The company does not currently pay or expect to pay in the near term significant cash income taxes. In the first quarter of 2014, the GAAP effective tax rate was approximately 63%, which is higher than our previously reported rate. Recently enacted New York state tax legislation reduced our New York State income tax rate to 0%, effective in 2014. While this will provide us with New York State tax relief, we also took a onetime tax charge in the first quarter to reduce our related deferred tax assets. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2014 was also negatively impacted by the expiration at the end of 2013 of the federal tax credit for increased research activities and losses incurred in foreign jurisdictions with rates lower than the federal statutory rate. For the full year 2014, we expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be in the low- to mid-50% range. At the end of the first quarter, we have cash and marketable securities totaling approximately $1.2 billion. We also had trade accounts receivable approximating $800 million. With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Len.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Thanks, Bob, and thank you, everybody else. The coming months will be filled with data from many of our programs, including expected readouts from the Phase III alirocumab program and Phase IIb dupilumab trial in atopic dermatitis, both of which we are doing in collaboration with our partner, Sanofi, and the -- as well as the data presentation of the Phase III sarilumab MOBILITY results, also in collaboration with Sanofi. In addition, we are preparing for the potential approvals and launches of EYLEA in 2 additional indications: diabetic macular edema and macular edema following BRVO. We are working steadily towards advancing our pipeline and investing in novel technologies. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Michael.
Michael Aberman: Thank you, Len. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] The IR team will be available in our offices after the call for follow-up questions. Thank you, and operator, if you could please give instructions and open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Robert Baird & Co.
Christopher J. Raymond - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: So just curious, you guys highlighted sort of, as I heard it, 2 factors here for the seasonality. One was weather and the other was inventory. And I think we kind of knew about the inventory, from your comments earlier in the year. But not asking for exact figures, could you give some sense of the breakdown between the 2? And with weather improving in April, May, can you maybe talk about what sort of trends you've seen in the regions that were affected in Q1?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Chris, thanks. Len. Thanks for your questions. In terms of the last part of your question, we just never comment about how -- quarters ago and mid-quarters. Just a standard policy here. In terms of the breakdown between weather and inventory, it's hard to do that. Inventory, we told you about, you can sort of quantify that, based on what the information we gave you at the end of last year and this call. Weather is just a guess how much that impacted things, and it's really hard to know, although, as Bob indicated, we saw a good and stronger growth in regions that were not impacted by the weather. This is -- we're just beginning also to understand the seasonality of our business here because up until now, we've been in the really rapid part of the growth of the launch, and you haven't seen -- it obscures any seasonality. When you look quarter of this -- first quarter of this year compared to first quarter of last year, the underlying growth to doctors was still very strong. So that's the information we have, and I know you'd like to crawl around a little bit more, but I think that's all we're going to be able to give you today, Chris. Sorry.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kantor with Crédit Suisse.
Jason Kantor - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Well, I was going to ask that exact same question, but I have plenty more. Could you give us an idea of what kind of [indiscernible] that you would hope could come out of the collaboration with Avalanche? What kind of deliveries are we talking about? Is this something that would augment or replace anti-VEGF therapy? Are we looking at other diseases of the back of the eye? Could you give us some better sense of what you're trying to get out of this collaboration?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Sure. Maybe George can comment on that in a little more detail. But in terms of the business terms -- before he gets into the science, the business terms of that -- we get to work on some very specific targets, as well as we get to have a certain right to negotiate for what they have in the clinic already for anti-VEGF. But we believe that it's the ability to go after diseases that are not easily addressed by conventional pharmaceuticals that's intriguing here. George?
George D. Yancopoulos: Yes. To that end, we're not announcing what the targets are, but the point being that as Len said, they have an interesting set of technologies and vectors that allow you to target, perhaps, particular cell types. It's a way of, perhaps, getting longer-term delivery of a gene product. And it also allows gene products that maybe can't be delivered as protein to be delivered to the eye. So I think it's a very interesting collaboration. Of course, we note that it's a relatively long-term investment and collaboration that's not going to necessarily be yielding something in the very near future.
Jason Kantor - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: When would we expect to see any data from the PDGF program?
Leonard S. Schleifer: So the PDGF program is early going. And so I guess we'll get -- so when we have them, we'll give them to you. We're just in the Phase I part of this program. So until we get a little more into it, it will be hard to give you some timeframes.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Schwartz with Leerink Partners.
Joseph P. Schwartz - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the market opportunity that you see for alirocumab before and after CV OUTCOMES data is generated. You gave some metrics on the various segments of patients. Do you see adoption more or less in any of those areas if you're approved, just on LDL versus several years away when you get CV OUTCOMES data?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Right. So I'll let Bob take that question. But let me just make the general point here, is that the drug is not approved yet, so we're speculating on how the drug might be used. We don't know what the label actually will be. But we can talk to you about the kinds of patients that, based on our research, might find that they and their doctors would want to use this product before OUTCOMES and some afterwards. Bob?
Robert J. Terifay: Yes. So I think the important point is when you look at the high-risk -- so I think when you look at the high-risk patients with uncontrolled LDL-C, there are approximately 20 million of those patients in the United States. And there is a significant unmet medical need that LDL-C reduction in and of itself is an important goal for patients. I think that the enriched patient populations that are particularly interesting are those who had a history of a cardiovascular event, as well as those who are statin intolerant. Statin-intolerant patients don't have a very effective alternative to statins, and so those -- both of those markets represent significant opportunities, as does the heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia patient population, who are also very, very poorly controlled.
Joseph P. Schwartz - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division: Do you have any market research that says what physicians -- to what degree they're willing to use it in these segments before...
Robert J. Terifay: I'm not going to give you the specifics right now, but there is significant -- physicians, when they see the product profile, are very, very interested in using the product.
Michael Aberman: And if I could add also, it's Michael, we did an IRC, we had a call just a month ago. We presented some of our early market research that did show just unwillingness to prescribe. So if you want to go, I can share those slides to talk about awareness, as well as likely how they're prescribing monoclonal, so we can do that offline.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.
Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Just one quick one and then a little more in-depth ones. First, just on the gross to net. Can you guys give us any update there in terms of where this stands, given you mentioned you're still tracking the -- how your drug is now post in the hyper-growth phase. And then the second question is just any expectations for the ongoing DRCRnet, DME trial, comparing EYLEA, Lucentis and Avastin?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Right. So do we have any color at all on the...
Robert E. Landry: Yes, Len. I mean, what we saw in the first quarter from a gross to net has been consistent to what we've seen. We had a little bit of an outlier in the first -- in the fourth quarter of 2013, but it was kind of as expected, our gross to net, for quarter 1, pertaining to EYLEA.
Leonard S. Schleifer: And in terms of the DRCRnet study, I don't -- we don't know exactly but -- when the data will be available. I think this is referring to some studies being conducted by a consortium. And my understanding is it might be late this year. But I'm not -- Bob, do you have any further information now?
Robert J. Terifay: I don't have any.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.
Mohit Bansal - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: This is Mohit filling in for Robyn. She is hosting our Healthcare Conference in Boston. So the question is regarding the market dynamic in DME. Could you please help us understand how the DME market is, in terms of maturity when you compare it to AMD? And do you expect AMD like [indiscernible] for DME as well?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Right. So in terms of maturity, I would say that the market is not very mature yet. Bob Terifay might have some color on that. And as well as in terms of the uptake, we don't want to get into predicting the launch here. So Bob?
Robert J. Terifay: As we said, we believe that the long-term market opportunity in DME is at least as big as the wet AMD market opportunity. At the present time, about 400,000 patients are treated with an anti-VEGF therapy each year for wet AMD. When you look at DME, it is growing year-over-year, but it's currently at about 240,000 patients are treated with an anti-VEGF. The issue is that a lot of these patients are still out with the general ophthalmologist who uses laser therapy in these patients. The issue with laser therapy is that it does affect the visual field for the patient. And so the real challenge for us is to make sure that we emphasize to patients that they need to get a dilated retinal exam as early as possible and regularly. And they need to get to a retinal physician for treatment. And that really is going to be the focus of our launch. But I will tell you that since Lucentis launched in the diabetic macular edema indication, the market has grown.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes, I just want to reemphasize that our Phase III data that we submitted to the agency was a head-to-head comparison against laser. So we think that data, if the drug gets approved and then gets into a label, could have an influence on practice, in terms of the selection. As Bob mentioned, laser still has a pretty strong legacy. I was at the ARVO meetings and some previous retinal meetings early this year, and basically, the sense you get from those meetings is that laser for center-involved macular edema is really being relegated not to the front line. It's moving more and more to anti-VEGF therapy with the approval with Lucentis in that indication.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau with Cowen and Company.
Philip Nadeau - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: I wanted to ask on the dupilumab Phase IIb data that's going to be out sometime over the next few weeks, what your expectations are for the data. I guess, in particular, when I look at the Phase IIa with the EASI-50 responders at 100%, I guess that's not going to change. I'm curious on the placebo on there. However, it looks like 30 days, that was still trending up. So is there a chance that over 3 months, maybe placebo kind of also approaches that 100%? And same -- similar questions on the pruritus numeric rating scale and the IGA score, all those were trending down at 30 days. Would we be wrong for the -- to our group in just extrapolating those lines out to 3 months? Is there anything different in the design between the IIb and the IIa that would kind of make that a not valid expectation?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Phil, I'll let George if he wants to get into some more detail, but I think that you may be approaching it in the wrong way. I don't think there's much of a gain to get into trying to predict exactly what these numbers are. I think that what we can say is we feel extremely confident in this program that we're going to have strong data, based on what I feel is a very strong Phase I and Phase IIa program. That's the main message here. George, do you want to add?
George D. Yancopoulos: Yes. You should go back and just review the Phase IIa data, which was a 12-week study which was presented. And we do think that, that data, we're hoping -- because that data was very impressive, we're hoping to replicate that sort of data into Phase IIb. The 100% numbers you're talking about was in the Phase I study in combination with topical corticosteroids. So the average percent change in EASI over the 12-week study was about 75%. So that means the average percent change in the total patients was about 75%, and the placebo group was about 25%. That was in the 12-week study, as I said, the Phase IIa. And the proportion of patients who achieved an EASI-50 at 12 weeks was about 85% and the placebo group, about 35%. So what we're hoping -- these obviously are very impressive data, which we hope would be replicated in the Phase IIb. And that's what we're looking for. We're looking to get quite similar data to what we saw in the Phase IIa, which was a 12-week study.
Leonard S. Schleifer: George, could you just comment because he made a question whether placebo continues to change over the course of the trial. Is that what we saw or is it...
George D. Yancopoulos: Well, the placebo does go up slowly, but it was a 12-week study. I think Phil was thinking about our Phase Is, which were 4-week study. So the increase from 1 month to 3 months is only about from 25% to 35% in placebo. So obviously, we saw a very big differential with the 85% EASI-50 -- 85% of patients achieving EASI-50 with dupilumab over 12 weeks. So there was obviously a very substantial drug-associated benefit compared to placebo, and as I've said, I think, the hope is that we can replicate them. Just to give you some other outstanding numbers, EASI-75 is the percent of people who had a 75% improvement. It was about 60% in the treated group and only about 14% in placebo. So there's really a relatively impressive drug effect. The same with pruritus scores and every other assessment. And as I said, we only hope that this really represents the -- what this drug can really do and continue to do on patients. So what we're hoping for is to largely just replicate these impressive Phase IIa data.
Philip Nadeau - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: And are there any differences in enrollment criteria that we should keep in mind, that could result in slightly different patient population? Or are the patients almost exactly the same?
George D. Yancopoulos: There are slight differences that could affect different aspects of the study, different jurisdictions, more patients, U.S. versus Europe, things like that. But our biggest hope is just to reproduce these sort of data that we've already seen.
Operator: Next question will be out of line with Matt Roden with UBS Securities.
Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I want to take a stab at quantifying the inventory again and better understanding the underlying demand trend. So based on what you said, it seems to me that the channel swing might have been something like $25 million to $30 million between 4Q and 1Q. So first of all, are we on the right track here? And then if we back that out of '14 numbers, then we're looking at about 2 straight quarters of about 3% sequential demand growth. So is that about what should be expected until you get label expansion later this year? And we realize you have a big opportunity here with DME coming up, but is there anything you think can be done to revitalize this quarter and the opportunity?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes. So I don't think we want to get into predicting quarter-by-quarter sequential growth rates. I don't think your calculations are wildly off. I don't want to get into the fine details of them. But I think that we did tell you that the sequential growth in the fourth quarter to first quarter was about 3%. And we did tell you that we expect the growth -- the bigger part of the growth would come, subject to the approvals that we have in the latter part of the year. So I think your thinking is good. So maybe that's all I want to say on that. I do want -- as long as we were back on EYLEA, in case we don't come back to it, I do want to say that it's a very interesting marketplace, of course, with lots of things going on. There's still questions about what's going on with compounding. There's still, of course, all the issues related to rebates. And then there's, of course, our poor friends and customers, the retinal docs, who, I think, took a lot of unnecessary abuse with articles in Washington Post and New York Times where they were -- it made it look like that if you needed a loan, you should call your local retinal doctor, and that probably was a little bit unfair because most of that money was being -- going through their shop to pay for either Lucentis or EYLEA. So I just wanted to make a little comment about that. But the bottom line is that the business continues to grow, but we expect the big growth to come in the latter part of the year, hopefully, with the approvals.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley.
Matthew Kelsey Harrison - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I want to go back to dupilumab and just ask sort of a question around, there are a lot of other antibodies in development for asthma, some are IL-4 -- I mean, some IL-5, so a bunch of different mechanisms. But I'm just wondering if you could maybe help us understand mechanistically where you think the differences are and how they might play out clinically between dupilumab and some of these other antibodies.
Leonard S. Schleifer: So I'll let George handle that. But just from a -- before he gets into the technical aspects, just from a broad perspective, you're right there, there's a lot going on in asthma, and George can comment on where we fit in. But there's been a lot less going on in atopic dermatitis, and that's a disease with a lot of people -- Bob, how many people have moderate to severe atopic dermatitis?
Robert J. Terifay: Over 1 million.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Over 1 million in the United States with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, so that's -- from a competitive point of view, not a mechanistic point of view, obviously, the asthma space is more competitive. But, of course, it's a very serious disease. Atopic dermatitis is a troubling disease, albeit not life-threatening, but a really serious troubling disease to many patients with less competition. George, do you want to get into the mechanistic stuff?
George D. Yancopoulos: Yes. Well, the basic question that you get at in terms of mechanism is which of the side [ph] kinds [ph} are the most important drivers of the disease processes in these various settings? And I think that, mechanistically, what we think is emerging, and in fact we think that our data is really contributing to this, is -- to shed some light on what's going on, in terms of what many view as a worldwide growing epidemic in terms of all sorts of allergic diseases. And we're not just talking about allergic asthma, but we're also talking about atopic dermatitis, but we're talking about everything else as well, food allergies, all sorts of other allergies, seasonal allergies and so forth. They're well documented by the New York Times and the CDC. I mean, there's been this huge uptick in all of these diseases. And one possibility is that these diseases have unrelated mechanisms and unrelated causes, and the upticks are just all occurring at the same time but are unrelated. So we believe, instead, that there's reason to think all of these as essentially variations of the same disease and that it's the same fundamental mechanistic drivers that are skewing the immune system, perhaps due to shared environmental impacts and drivers. And that the same mechanistic drivers are contributing to variations of the same disease and in some people are manifested as allergic asthma, and others as atopic dermatitis, and somebody else as sinusitis and somebody else as seasonal allergies. And we believe that the data suggest that 4 and 13 are the critical mechanistic pathway drivers, perhaps, for all these diseases. And the thing that we think is quite stunning and perhaps unprecedented is to have produced data that shows very interesting effects in 2 important variations of this class of disease, that is allergic asthma and atopic dermatitis, by hitting this pathway. I think that this really does suggest for the first time that, indeed, all of these related diseases perhaps have the same drivers, and that IL-4 and IL-13 are the core pathway drivers. So it may be true that for one or another one of these diseases, a downstream factor could be important because that -- and it may be true for that variance of disease, but not another variation of disease. But it's also quite possible, we're very excited about this possibility, that 4 and 13 could be the core drivers of a large proportion of the allergic diseases that are now being driven.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Newman with Canaccord.
John L. Newman - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division: I just wondered if you could talk about how much detail you might provide going forward on your Phase III studies for alirocumab in terms of the injection-site reactions. And the reason I ask is because when you presented your first Phase III study and you tight traded up from 75 to 150, it seems that your reverse event profile was more favorable than Amgen. And I'm just wondering, going forward, how much detail would you be able to tell us about things like injection-site redness and reactions.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes. I think once we have the data and it's presented at the medical conference, we'll be happy to share all the detail that we have available. It's not been an issue of any significant concern, as far as I'm aware to-date.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Adnan Butt with RBC.
Adnan S. Butt - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: I still have 3 questions, but I'll start with 1 question. So for the alirocumab, for the anti-PCSK9 program, what's the difference that some other competitors think that they may be able to file but there's some uncertainty on the Regeneron Sanofi side? And what's the cost of filing -- potential filing time range in the U.S.? Is that anywhere from 2014 to the end of 2015? Can you say a bit on that?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Sure. Stating when you're going to file and predicting and all that sort of stuff, there may be some stylistic differences between the companies and how we approach things, but there are no regulatory differences between the companies. The bottom line is that we and our partner, Sanofi, plan to be ready for filing, certainly, by the end of the year, in both the United States and the EU. In the U.S., it's gated on the progress of OUTCOMES trials and ongoing discussions with the FDA. And so since these discussions are ongoing, we don't want to give you any precise predictions because they might change, as a result of these discussions. But we have no reason to believe -- in fact, we believe just the opposite, that the U.S. regulatory requirements are going to be consistent for different products across the same class. And if anything, we think we have a much stronger package at this point, in terms of 5,000 patient years of blinded data in the non-OUTCOMES study, which, best to my calculation, might be as many as 2 or 3 times more than the Amgen program has, based on what was presented at the recent meeting. So we have a very robust package, which we will be submitting with. And so we're confident that we'll get the same treatment from the regulators as everybody else.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Barclays.
Ying Huang - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I hate to beat a dead horse, but Bob, can you just quickly comment whether the inventory will go back to normal level of 1 to 2 weeks? Or it will -- or last quarter, 4Q, was actually outlier with greater than 2 weeks. And then also on the status of your Ang2 VEGF program in wet AMD because we knew that Roche just started a Phase I program of their Ang2 and VEGF program.
Robert J. Terifay: Right. So to answer the inventory, as I said earlier, we were above the 1- to 2-week inventory level at the end of Q4. At the end of Q1, we have returned back to the inventory levels below 2. And that is really where we anticipate inventory to be. Although at the end of the year, you do see people buying in, especially the change in commercial dating terms, which led to some people buying a little bit of excess inventory.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Okay. George, do you want to make a comment on the Ang2, that study is for development for us later?
George D. Yancopoulos: Right. So I think the common to the question was about Roche and Roche's bispecifics. And as you guys probably know, I mean, we're very heavily involved in the bispecific space and we have strong views about it. We think that, honestly, it only makes sense to make a bispecific, when you want to actually, for some reason, bring some targets together or join molecularly 2 targets. It doesn't really makes sense. In fact, it's the opposite of making sense to make a single reagent that can block independently 2 things that are better blocked separately. And why do I say that? The odds that you want to have a single agent that's delivered at the same exact levels to attack 2 different natural molecules that they themselves are probably going to be expressed by the body at 2 widely different levels with 2 different affinities and so forth, it just doesn't make any sense. And it's much better, in fact, to be able to have 2 separate blockers, which you can give at the right proportions, at the right ratios, instead of having to be forced to be giving them in the fixed ratio that the bispecific does. So we are actually always designing bispecifics for the right and the rational reasons. And obviously, we have a lot of bispecifics at various stages in development, including one we hope to be putting to the clinic this year. But those, we think, will be rationally designed and guided, based on the fact that it makes sense to make a bispecific for those targets. For this purpose, we're blocking VEGF and Ang2, it makes no sense to have a bispecific. In fact, it's the opposite of making sense. And we are very much more excited to have the 2 independent agents that will be able to be titrating exactly in their perfect ratios that will benefit most the patients, yet still give them the same injection if that need be.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jim Birchenough with BMO.
Nicholas Abbott - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: This is Nick in for Jim this morning. Just to go a little bit back to DME. Can you let us know, about 240,000 patients currently receiving treatment, what proportion of those are receiving an anti-VEGF and within that, the brand, I guess, Lucentis market share? And then, in terms of the biology of the disease here, clearly, differs from AMD. So is this a disease where you think you will need chronic dosing for most patients? And then Protocol T was mentioned before. But when you do your market research, obviously, there's a lot of interest versus laser. But a physician is really interested in getting this head-head data of Avastin versus the 2 branded products.
Leonard S. Schleifer: So let me cover on the numbers. To clarify, there are 600,000 patients with centrally involved DME. 240,000 are treated with an anti-VEGF therapy at the present time. Similar to before EYLEA launched, Avastin has the majority of the DME market at the current time. If you remember, when we launched an AMD, Avastin had about 65% of the market. We were able to not just penetrate the Lucentis market but also penetrate the Avastin market. So that is the opportunity in DME, is to grow the market beyond the 240,000 patients and to take share from both agents, both in the new patient starts, as well the switch patients. I would remind you, in our U.S.-based study, the VISTA study, 42% of the patients were prior anti-VEGF therapy. As we presented at ARVO this week, those patients did equally well as the newly diagnosed patients. In terms of the biology, I'll let George address it, but what we see is the DME is a chronic condition and that there is a long-term opportunity for the products, although dosing may change over time.
George D. Yancopoulos: So let me just make a couple of comments. First of all, I agree with Bob. I think, look, our program is under review, so we don't know what our label is going to be. We don't know if it's going to be -- get approved. But assuming that it does, I mean, and we think we have some nice advantages, at least in the design of that program, highlighting what Bob said, obviously, is we demonstrated that there was a lot of people in that program who had previous exposure to other anti-VEGF agents. And also, it's really the only approved agent, if it gets approved, that would have a direct comparison to laser. Having said that, I do think people will be interested in the Protocol T, which is, for those who are not familiar, is a consortium DRCR-led, a study which compares Avastin and it compares Lucentis at the 0.3-milligram dose. I should remind everybody that one of the other advantages of our drug that we've submitted for is at the same dose, whereas the Lucentis had 2 different doses: 1 for AMD and 1 for DME, a lower dose, in the United States. So all of these should play into the marketplace. But I think maybe we should really wait and respect the process and have a lot more to say about this, if we get the drug approved. So let's wait for that before we say any more.
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan.
Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just on U.S. EYLEA, after the first quarter, the guidance assumes a pretty big step-up in the second half. And so I'm just curious, are there some market dynamics in DME that could accelerate adoption, when you look at things like compounding levels or payment terms or kind of what you guys see as an unmet need by laser or VEGF?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes. I mean, it's complicated, obviously, but -- and we're making some guesses, and so it's obviously a forward-looking guess. But we do feel that based on what happened with the launch in AMD, there will be a reservoir of patients who might be unsatisfied with current therapies and who might consider using EYLEA, if it's approved. And so that reservoir should make for a pretty nice initial uptick, if it goes the same way as AMD went. But, of course, there are other things, and as I said, there are other aspects of this as the lower dose we're is going up against this time as opposed to the -- we have a 2-milligram dose versus their 0.3-milligram dose. We did have data in our study for the Q2 month, so have to see how the labor goes with that. That could be an advantage. Remember, diabetics tend to be younger. Many of them still tend to be working. And so a convenience of -- less of an injection burden could be important. But once again, I don't want to get ahead of ourselves. Let's -- we can have a really robust conversation about this, after the PDUFA date.
George D. Yancopoulos: But Len, I do think there's another important factor. There's another influencer of the forecast in the second half, which is on October 23, we're expecting approval on macular edema following BRVO, if everything goes well.
Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Right. Regulatory authorities.
George D. Yancopoulos: And the BRVO market is 3x the size of the CRVO market. So there are some upside there as well.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Right. And, of course, I would emphasize, Geoff, that this is a global launch and marketplace. And so you might see growth here and more growth overseas, and then you'll see something more growth here and less growth. I just -- we think that the overall product is growing very nicely. Bayer is doing a spectacular job, as you can tell from their numbers. And so we think of this as a pretty big important global franchise. And Mike, do you want to wrap it up?
Michael Aberman: That's great. So thank you, everybody, for participating. Thank you, operator, for helping us with this call. We'll be in our office, if you need anything. Please don't hesitate to reach us via email or by phone. Thanks.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Have a nice day, everyone.

Leonard S. Schleifer: Thank you, Michael, and good morning to everyone. 2013 was another great year for Regeneron. The EYLEA franchise continue to grow steadily in the U.S. and globally our late-stage pipeline made significant progress, we invested in several new R&D initiatives that we hope will position us for the next leg of growth in the future and we expanded our geographic footprint. Starting with EYLEA fourth quarter 2013 EYLEA U.S. net sales were $402 million and full year 2013 EYLEA U.S. net sales were $1.409 billion, representing a growth of approximately 70% from the full year 2012. EYLEA also performed very well outside of the United States with net sales of $184 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 and full year 2013 ex- U.S. EYLEA sales of $472 million.  Bayer HealthCare continues to be strong collaborator and we look forward to their continued execution of EYLEA launch outside the U.S. as countries in Europe, Latin America and Asia start contributing in 2014. As we look forward to the balance of 2014 there are number of potential growth drivers for EYLEA. As we have previously announced, in the U.S. we have granted a PDUFA date of August 18th for the diabetic macular edema or DME indication. Yesterday, we reported positive two year data from the VISTA-DME which George will discuss shortly. We believe that diabetic macular edema could ultimately be a big opportunity as wet AMD based on disease incidence. And we expect our fourth indication Macular Edema following Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion or BRVO to be filed with the FDA by the end of the first quarter. Taking all these factors into consideration we estimate full year 2014 U.S. EYLEA net sales of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion which represents approximately 25% year-over-year growth. We expect that a significant part of that growth will come towards end of the year following potential U.S. regulatory approval of EYLEA and DME. Our 2014 EYLEA guidance does not include any significant change from the compounding environment. Based on the continuous strong uptick of EYLEA in ex-U.S. markets where it's been launched so far, and Bayer HealthCare's ongoing rollout of EYLEA around the world plus expansion to new indications, we anticipate continued growth in ex-U.S. Sales in 2014 as well. You will hear more about the commercial performance of EYLEA from Bob Terifay.  We recognize that EYLEA is a key driver of near-term growth and we are committed to ensuring that this franchise remains strong over the long run as well. To that end, in the first quarter of this year, we initiated clinical development with a combination of EYLEA and an antibody to PlGF receptor in the short co-formulated individual injection and I am happy to report that the first patient has been dosed in this trial. A similar program combining EYLEA with our antibody to ANG2 also in a single individual injection is expected to start by year end.  Turning to research efforts. We have robust and advancing pipeline that include three late stage antibodies, Alirocumab, our PCSK9 antibody in Phase III trial for lowering LDL cholesterol; Sarilumab, our IL6 receptor antibody in Phase III trials for rheumatoid arthritis and a Phase II study in non-infectious Uveitis; and Dupilumab out IL-4 receptor alpha antibody which blocks both the IL-4 and IL-13 pathways and is in clinical development for asthma atopic dermatitis and nasal polyposis. We anticipate starting a Phase III trial with Dupilumab for atopic dermatitis later in 2013. With this late stage pipeline and potential new indications for EYLEA, we could have five major regulatory submissions and/or approvals in the next five years. We have also maintained our focus on our earlier stage pipeline and our R&D initiatives. These include our entry in the field of Immuno-oncology with our bi-specific platform, the commencement of our human genomics initiatives with the launch of Regeneron Genetic Center and our collaboration with Geisinger Health System and our R&D efforts in developing antibody drug conjugates. You will hear more about these programs from George Yancopoulos shortly. In 2013, we undertook some important measures that further expand Regeneron's footprint in New York as well as globally. We are in the process of enlarging our campus at Tarrytown where two new R&D buildings are under construction. We started the expansion of our manufacturing facilities in Rensselaer and we are in the process of expanding our manufacturing capacities into Ireland and optimizing our global supply chain. With that let me turn the call over to George Yancopoulos, Regeneron's Chief Scientific Officer who will discuss our pipeline in greater detail. He will be followed by Bob Terifay, our Senior Vice President of Commercial and then Bob Landry our Chief Financial Officer. George?
George D. Yancopoulos:  Thank you Len and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us today. As Len mentioned, Regeneron's pipeline has been advancing rapidly in the fourth quarter of 2013 witnesses a lot of this progress. Let me begin with EYLEA. As we have previously reported the FDA has accepted for filing our supplemental BLA for EYLEA in the diabetic macular edema or DME indication and we have been granted a PDUFA date of August 2014. Our ex-U.S. partner Bayer HealthCare has also submitted an application for Marketing Authorization Europe in this indication. EYLEA is now approved for two indications, Wet AMD and Macular Edema Following Central Retinal Vein Occlusion or CRVO in the U.S., EU Japan and other countries around the world.  In terms of DME, just yesterday we announced the two year results from the Phase III VISTA DME trial. These results showed that the improvement in vision compared to laser photocoagulation therapy that was seen after one year of treatment with EYLEA 2 milligrams does either monthly or every other month after five initial injections was sustained after two years of treatment.  It is important to emphasize that in this long-term study, EYLEA dose every other month resulted in visual acuity benefit that was similar to that achieved with monthly dosing. It is also worth noting that 43% of the patients in the VISTA study were not treated naïve and in fact had received prior anti-VEGF therapy.  In this trial EYLEA was generally well tolerated with a similar overall incidence of adverse events, ocular serious adverse events and non-ocular serious systemic adverse events, across the EYLEA treatments groups and the laser control group. The types and incidents of adverse events were consistent with what is expected with VEGF inhibition. Additional details from the three years VISTA DME study can be found on our press release that was issued yesterday.  All data will be presented in an upcoming medical conference. In the fourth quarter, we reported positive data from the Phase III VIBRANT trial of EYLEA in macular edema following Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion or BRVO. We expect our supplemental BLA for BRVO to be filed by the FDA by the end of the first quarter. As Len just mentioned our late-stage antibody programs are also progressing well. In terms of alirocumab our antibody for lowering LDL-cholesterol in the fourth quarter we reported positive Phase III results from the ODYSSEY MONO trial which studied alirocumab in the monotherapy study. Additional details from the monostudy will be presented at the upcoming Annual Meeting of the American College of Cardiology. While most of the ODYSSEY program is studying alirocumab dose every other week we have also initiated two studies, ODYSSEY CHOICE I and CHOICE II that explored monthly dosing. As we have said before, we and Sanofi expect to submit an application for alirocumab for regulatory approval in early 2015 outside the U.S. and later in 2015 in U.S. While this is a very competitive space we believe that our robust [vertically] designed Phase III programs distinguishes us.  Our Phase III program is designed to assess the primary efficacy endpoint at 24 weeks, many of the ODYSSEY trials will continue in a double blinded fashion through 12, 18 and 24 months thus creating substantive data exposure in terms of patient years. Specifically the double-blinded exposure active drug in our Phase III ODYSSEY program excluding ODYSSEY outcome will total approximately 5,000 patient years. This patient exposure will allow for robust characterization of the safety and efficacy of alirocumab prior to the outcome study. Our program studies treatment with every other week and monthly dosing regimens with the ability to titrate dosing which will allow healthcare providers to tailor therapy to suit individual patient needs.  The ODYSSEY program is studying treatment with alirocumab in several key patients populations including the first study when patients were confirmed to be statin tolerant, those with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia where we are studying the largest cohort of such patients as well as those hypercholesterolemia patients with poorly controlled LDL cholesterol despite treatment with current standard of care, which are typically statins.  Our studies have been designed to offer important insights in patient populations with high unmet needs. For example our statin tolerance study also includes the statin exposure component designed to further enhance our understanding of this population and ensure that we have appropriately characterized these patients as truly statin intolerant. We look forward to reporting results to these trials starting in mid-2014. Turning to Sarilumab our IL-6 receptor antibody, which is in late stage development in rheumatoid arthritis, we reported positive pipeline data from the Phase II MOBILITY study in the fourth quarter of 2013. This study met all three co-primary endpoints, namely, one an improvement in the symptoms of RA at 24 weeks as measured by the HR20 score. Second an inhibition in the progression of structural damage at week 52 as measured by radiography and three an improvement in physical function as measured by a changing baseline in the [Hack DI] score.  Important patient receiving the higher 200 milligrams dose of Sailumab administered every other week showed a 90% reduction in the progression of joint damage as assessed by radiography. In the MOBILITY trial there was a higher incidence of treatment emerging adverse events leading to withdrawal in the Sarilumab treatment groups compared to placebo and was 13.9% in 2 ml group, 12.9% in 150 ml and 4.7% in the placebo group. Infections were the most frequent reported adverse event and were reported with higher incidence in the Sarilumab group compared to placebo or in combination with methotrexate.  Among patients treated with Sarilumab a dose dependent decrease in mean cancers was observed serious infections were not associated with Grade 3 and Grad 4 neutropenia MOBILITY study. Increases in mean LDL cholesterol and transaminases were observed. These Phase III findings were consistent with those expected from block data via IL-6 pathway. We believe Sarilumab have the potential to be a very competitive product profile with the flexibility of both low dose and high dose subcutaneous regimen couple with every other week dosing which could offer a good option for patients. Despite the advanced that TNF-alpha have made in management of patients with RA, approximately 40% of patients are inadequately control as assessed by [HVR 20 and GAS 28 scores]. We believe that there is a significant need for new therapies for the treatment of RA. We will be reporting full data from the MOBILITY study in an upcoming medical conference. There are also four more Phase III studies of Sarilumab in RA that are ongoing with expected read outs beginning in 2015. Besides RA, we are also exploring Sarilumab in a Phase II trial in non-infectious Uveitis in the statin study. Turning to dupilumab. We reviewed this IL-4 receptor alpha antibody as one of most exciting programs in our pipeline. Based on our clinical data so far locking both Interlupin 4 and Interlupin 13 has impressive effects in a variety of PH2 mediated diseases. In recent years the independence of PH2 mediated disease such as arthritis and atopic dermatitis has increased significantly.  Dupilumab is currently in clinical trials for asthma, atopic dermatitis and nasal polyposis. In 2013 the Phase 2a study of dupilumab in asthma was named the clinical advancement of the year by Scripps and dupilumab is currently in Phase 2b in asthma. We will be presenting data Phase 2a study in atopic dermatitis at the upcoming meeting of the America Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology also known as AAAAI and we expect to see Phase 2b study data in this indication in the second quarter of 2014.  We plan to initiate a Phase 3 trial in atopic dermatitis in 2014 as well. Though not life threatening, a atopic dermatitis can significantly impact the patient's quality of life. It is estimated there are 2 million patients in the United States with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Dupilumab is also currently in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial in nasal polyposis.  I would now like to now spend a few minutes talking about our earlier pipeline and our recent R&D initiatives. In the past months there has been growing interest in the fields of immunotherapy and oncology. We are keenly interested in this area and are exploring use of bio-specific antibody that target tumor antigen and the CD3 receptor on T-cells to harness the oncolytic properties of T-cells. Our first such bio-specific target CD-20 and CD-3 and is expected to enter the clinical later this year. As Len mentioned we are now investing in tremendously expanding opportunities seen in genomic with launch of Regeneron Generic Center in our collaboration with Geisinger Health System. We intent to sequence and genotype a minimum of 1,000 consent patients volunteer samples in the next few years, making this one of the largest sequencing endeavors undertaken. We believe with the state-of-the-art sequencing and informatics tools that are now available, our expertise in mass genomic and access to a broad sample of the identified patient records and samples from patients volunteers we're extremely well positioned to validate the relationship between genetics and human disease.  Our goal is to turn human DNA sequence into medically actionable information. We hope this will transform the way that we conduct drug development from early target discovery through to our late-stage clinical trials. We hope this would help to our collaborators such as Geisinger transform their ability to deliver better healthcare to their patients in a more timely and cost efficient manner. With that, let me now turn the call over to Bob Terifay who will provide further details on the EYLEA commercial landscape.
Robert J. Terifay: Thank you George and good morning everyone. In the United States as Len mentioned earlier, EYLEA or intravitreal aflibercept injection net sales in the fourth quarter of 2013 were $403 million and full year 2013 EYLEA net sales were slightly over $1.4 billion. As we described at a recent investor continue, when we first disclose our 2013 U.S. EYLEA net sales results, the fourth quarter sales based on slowdown for Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays but were also helped by modest inventory build at the end of the year. Now I will provide more detail on the market dynamics. We will be sharing with you some qualitative data from our market research survey that was independently conducted in the fourth quarter. As before this data come from physician-based questionnaires, in this case from 200 representative physicians. I will share with you with you the numbers that were reported in this survey. But I would like to remind you that these numbers of physician reported estimates, based on our survey.  Let me begin with the Wet AMD indication. In the fourth quarter of 2013 according to our surveyed physicians we had approximately half of the branded anti-VEGF market. The branded anti-VEGF market continues to represent about half of the total wet AMD market.  Turning now to the second indication for which EYLEA is approved in the United States, Macular edema following central retinal vein occlusion our data from our market research survey suggest that during the fourth quarter EYLEA achieved over 40% share of the approved anti VEGF products indication.  The branded market represents 45% of the overall macular edema following CRVO indication. As Len and George mentioned earlier the FDA has accepted our supplemental BLA for EYLEA in diabetic macular edema or DME. And we've been granted a PDUFA date of August 18, 2014. DME could be as a big market opportunity as wet AMD.  It is estimated that approximately 600,000 patients are diagnosed annually with clinically significant diabetic macular edema in the United States. Of these patients about 40% are treated with anti-VEGF therapy.  We also expect our supplemental BLA for EYLEA for the treatment of macular edema following branched retinal vein occlusion or BRVO be filed in the United States before the end of first quarter 2014. In 2014 we expect U.S. EYLEA net sales to be between $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion. We anticipate continued net sales growth in the United States from a growing number of patients diagnosed with wet AMD increasing market share of Macular edema following CRVO and a potential launch in diabetic macular edema late August 2014.  Please keep in mind that as Len mentioned given potential inventory normalization in the first half of the year and the potential DME approval in late August the growth in U.S. EYLEA net sales may occur more towards the second half of 2014.  Turning now to the ex-U.S. EYLEA business where we split profits with Bayer HealthCare. Fourth quarter ex-U.S. EYLEA net sales were $184 million. The strong fourth quarter growth is a function of continued ex-U.S. rollout. EYLEA has approximately 40% to 50% of the market in wet AMD in Germany, Australia and Japan, and has recently launched in additional countries in Europe including the UK and France. As of the end of 2013 EYLEA has received regulatory approval for the treatment of wet AMD in over 50 countries. EYLEA is also approved in the EU in macular edema following CRVO indication.  Through the remainder of the year we expect Bayer to embark on additional launches in both of these indications following regulatory and pricing approvals. Let's put the EYLEA opportunity outside the United States in to context.  Bayer HealthCare is still in the early stages of launch. Today EYLEA only accounts for about 17% of the overall branded ex-U.S. anti-VEGF sales. There is a significant opportunity for continued growth outside of the United States. Bayer has also submitted an application for marketing authorization in Europe for DME. With that let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Landry. 
Robert E. Landry: Thank you Bob and good morning to everyone. As Len mentioned in his opening remarks Regeneron experienced strong financial performance throughout 2013. In the fourth quarter we earned $2.24 per diluted share from non-GAAP net income of 259 million and we earned $8.17 per diluted share from non-GAAP net income of $935 million for the full year.  This represents growth in non-GAAP net EPS of 52% for the three months and 75% for the full year 2013 compared to the same period of 2012. As a reminder non-GAAP EPS excludes non-cash share-based compensation expense, non-cash interest expense related to our senior convertible notes and non-cash income tax expense. In 2012 it excluded the release of the valuation allowance. A full reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release.  Total revenues were $610 million in the fourth quarter and $2.1 billion for the full year of 2013 which represented growth of 47% for the three months and 53% for the year ended December 31, 2013. Net product sales of $406 million in the fourth quarter were comprised of $402 million of U.S. EYLEA net sales and $4 million of ARCALYST rilonacept net sales. For the full year 2013 U.S. EYLEA net sales were $1.4 billion and ARCALYST net sales were $17 million.  As Bob mentioned fourth quarter U.S. EYLEA sales benefited from an increase in distributor inventory. Specifically at the end of the fourth quarter 2013 U.S distributors held a little over two weeks of inventory which is higher than the typical range of one to two weeks that has been held by distributors. This increase in inventory may have been in part due to the tightening of commercial terms that went into effect on January 1, 2014. So far this year inventory levels appear to be returning to the more customary one to two week range and if this continues it would impact sales in the first quarter of 2014.  For 2014 we expect full year U.S. EYLEA net sales to be in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. This guidance includes the expected approval of EYLEA for DME in the third quarter of 2014 but does not include any change in the compounding environment.  Ex-U.S. EYLEA sales were a $184 million in the fourth quarter and $472 million for the full year 2013. Product revenue from ex-U.S. EYLEA sales is recorded by Bayer HealthCare. We recognized $44 million in the fourth quarter as our share of net profits from ex-U.S. EYLEA sales which was after repayment of $15 million in development expenses to Bayer HealthCare and $102 million for the full year 2013 after repayment of $58 million.  Bayer HealthCare collaboration revenue was $86 million for the fourth quarter and $220 million for the full year 2013. During the fourth quarter of 2013 Bayer HealthCare collaboration revenue included $25 million in milestone payments comprised of a $10 million milestone related to EYLEA approval in Japan for the treatment of macular edema following CRVO and one sales million payment of $15 million. For the full year 2013 Bayer HealthCare collaboration revenue included a total of $70 million in substantive regulatory and sales milestone payments as compared to $25 million in 2012.  Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was a $111 million for the fourth quarter and $430 million for the full year 2013. Included in the Sanofi collaboration line are three key components, our share of losses in connection with ZALTRAP which was $8 million in the fourth quarter and $31 million for the full year, reimbursement of Regeneron incurred R&D expenses which was a $112 million in the fourth quarter and $459 million for the full year and amortization of upfront and other payments previously received from Sanofi. Global ZALTRAP net sales as reported by Sanofi were $20 million for the fourth quarter and $70 million for the full year 2013.  Turning to expenses non-GAAP R&D expenses were $234 million in the fourth quarter and $743 million for the full year 2013. If we net out R&D reimbursements from our collaborators and our R&D stock-based compensation from our GAAP R&D expense line item our net non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D was a $115 million for the fourth quarter and $263 million for the full year 2013 which is slightly higher than the top range of our guidance for 2013 of $250 million. Please note that in our press release issued this morning we have included all the information required to calculate our unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D numbers.  For 2014 we would like to reiterate our previously provided guidance of non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to be in the range of $425 million to $475 million. Our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D spend is driven by three factors: Our obligation to pay for 20% of the Phase III Alirocumab and sarilumab clinical development expenses following the first positive Phase III results as reported in the fourth quarter 2013 for each of these antibodies and advancing un-partnered pipeline which now includes six antibodies, a variety of new technologies such as antibody drug conjugates and bio-specific antibodies in our recent proprietary R&D initiative such as those in the area of human genomics.  Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $61 million for the fourth quarter and $249 million for the full year 2013. We expect non-GAAP SG&A expense in 2014 to be in the range of $330 million to $380 million. This increase in 2014 is due to an increase in our contribution to independent co-pay foundations that assist qualified patients in satisfying their co-pay requirement and an increase in the branded prescription drug fee that we are assessed as part of the patient protection of Affordable Care Act.  As a reminder non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses excludes non-cash share-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP cost of goods sold was $34 million in the fourth quarter and a $116 million for the full year 2013. This translates into gross margin of approximately 92% of sales for the full year. As a reminder COGS includes royalty expenses in connection with our agreement with Genentech related to U.S. EYLEA sales which we're obligated to pay until the second quarter of 2016. Cost of collaboration manufacturing was $14 million in the fourth quarter and $37 million for the full year 2013.  Turning now to taxes, at the current time we do not expect to pay significant cash taxes for at least mid-2015. As such we expect that our 2014 non-GAAP earnings will continue to exclude any significant income tax provision. It is too early for us to provide specific cash tax guidance for 2015 at this time. Over the long term with the expansion of our international operations we expect to achieve a tax efficient operating model. The foundation of this operating model will be the establishment of a new manufacturing facility in Ireland and the migration of certain intellectual property related to our ex-U.S. EYLEA franchise in our late stage antibody pipeline to Ireland. We currently project that the benefits of our investment in our global operating model will begin to be reflected in our effective tax rate commencing in 2014. You will notice that on a GAAP basis the effective tax rate in the fourth quarter for our GAAP earnings was 51.1% and 40.5% for the full year 2013. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate in 2014 to be similar to that experienced in the fourth quarter 2013. The increase in GAAP effective tax rate is a result of near term expenses incurred outside the U.S. in connection with our expansion of our international operations. Our capital expenditures for the full year 2013 were $156 million which is significantly greater than our capital expenditures of $49 million in 2012 which is primarily driven by our expansion of leased facilities in Tarrytown, New York and our owned facilities in Rensselaer, New York. We expect capital expenditures for 2014 to be $350 million to $425 million as we continue to invest in our Tarrytown and Rensselaer facilities and purchase and commence renovations on a new manufacturing facility in Limerick, Ireland. We ended 2013 with cash and marketable securities totaling approximately $1.1 billion compared to approximately $600 million at the end of 2012. We also have trade accounts receivable of $787 million at the end of 2013.  With that I'd now like to turn the call back over to Len.
Leonard S. Schleifer : Thanks Bob and thank you everybody else. 2014 is a promising year for us. We believe that we have the key elements that are required for long term growth, deepening our existing franchise advancing our broad and active pipeline investing in new technologies such as new initiatives in human genomics and expanding our presence globally. With that I would now turn the call over to Michael.
Michael Aberman : Thank you, Len. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call for Q&A. As we'd like to give many people a chance to ask questions as possible we again request you to limit yourself to one question. Our team will be available in the office after the call for follow up questions. Thank you and operator and if you could please open the call for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). And the first question is from Adnan Butt of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Adnan Butt - RBC Capital Markets: Hi good morning everyone. I will start with a tax question you touched a bit on this but can you give us a bit more on what IP is actually overseas at this time and what IP you intend to take, is it just EYLEA or could it be more than that? And then secondly when does this start to impacting tax and maybe you can give some high level thoughts on what statutory tax rates are and then what they would be with the amounts of things that you are planning to take overseas? Thanks.
Leonard S. Schleifer : Sure. Hi, this is Len. As far as what intellectual property has been migrated we are not going to go into details of that, but I should say that it's not limited to EYLEA and it can be any and all and we are doing that as we view it as appropriate. As far as what the impact on the tax rate I think Bob said is that in 2017 it might began to have an impact but we are not going to get into the details unless Bob do you have anything further you want to add?
Robert E. Landry : Yeah I'll just give you a little bit more color on as you would expect we do have kind of net operating loss carry-forwards going forward of approximately $460 million and then we obviously have federal and state credit tax credits forwards going forward of roughly $120 million. That will allow us not to pay significant tax cash tax through at least mid-2015. I had said obviously this is subject to change based on various factors that may come about, but that's our current position today.  And again as Len said we are kind of taking the right steps as you'd expect a company like us to take going forward and we won't get into specificities of these with regards to the migration of the IP but as Len said you can rest assured it's not just EYLEA and that coupled with kind of our new manufacturing facility that we're getting kind of in the ground in Ireland will allow us to get favorable tax rates beginning in kind of that 2017 year.
Michael Aberman: Right next question?
Operator: The next question is from Ying Huang of Barclays. Your line is open. 
Ying Huang - Barclays Capital: Good morning, guys thanks for taking my question. First I would like to ask you to elaborate your thought on the VISTA data because we saw the arterial and trauma and related events and also the death rate there picking up. I was wondering if you could comment on the regulatory indication for that arm and then what you might see as the positioning in the competition in the DME landscape.  And then secondly it sounds like you guys are seeing somewhat like steady stage market share for EYLEA in wet AMD market. So I was wondering if you have any long-term strategy in growing share in that market. 
Leonard S. Schleifer : First of all, that's two questions. Compound question which would you prefer to have answered. We'll start with the DME -- we're not going to get into the details of our regulatory discussions but other than to say that we've made our submission, the FDA has filed the package and we are on track we think for PDUFA date based on our submissions in August of this year.  In terms of the data we were very pleased with the data George do you want to add anything on that?
George D. Yancopoulos: Yeah, as this is also very highly scrutinized area because of concerns about anti-VEGF agents with regard to systemic adverse events and the so called AT/PT events as well as deaths. And of course we found it very comforting that are systemic, serious systemic adverse events were similar between all groups as was the -- our serious adverse events declined by the AT/PT criteria.  And in terms of death it's very important to point out that the 2 milligram every other month group, which produced data virtually identical to that of the monthly group was numerically very similar to that of the laser control group, the monthly group did have numerically a higher number but that was not even normally significantly different from the laser control group.  So overall we are continuing to wait for the second study but I think that in the field we're pretty comforted by this data. 
Leonard S. Schleifer : All right just to emphasize what George is saying about this, the 2-8 in similar, for the 2-4 in terms of the efficacy that should not be under appreciated that's just exactly how those curves overlap in terms of efficacy between the alternate month group and the monthly group. Bob do you want to have comment about market share?
Robert E. Landry: Yeah, so first of all I would remind you as we pointed out that despite the fact we launched several years after Lucentis we added even market share in wet AMD with Lucentis and we made $1.4 billion last year. So we're very encouraged with the performance of EYLEA. Future growth will come primarily from new patients and we have implemented a number of strategies to try to pick up more new patients to the marketplace.  I think the biggest challenge to growth for both us and Lucentis is the fact that despite the change in the compounding landscape there has been very little change in the use of Avastin in the marketplace. And that's probably the major obstacle for both products at the current time.  So I'll just say and I anticipate a question on the compounding our projections don't assume any significant change in the compounding environment. That is not to say there might not be some of laws rewritten but and the FDA has said that there are no compounding exceptions that are applicable to biologics, the new lower of compounding does not grant these waivers to biologics but how the FDA will enforce that and whether that will change things is yet to be determined.  We wait to see what the FDA will do. Of course our long standing opinion has been we're in favor of choice. We think it's good that patients can choose, they can choose right now between three alternatives, be it Avastin, be it Lucentis and EYLEA we are interested in having choice is good but we would like to have only a single quality standard in terms of the manufacture and preparation of the product. Next question, Michael. 
Operator: The next question is from Chris Raymond of Robert Baird. Your line is open. 
Chris Raymond - Robert Baird & Co.: Yeah, thanks. I was just wondering if you could maybe comment on so you've discussed it with FDA here you have got your -- I am sorry your PDUFA date -set. Any updates on likelihood of a panel in front of that for DME? 
Leonard S. Schleifer : Yeah I mean I think the FDA reserves the right to call a panel if they need one, we've had no indication to-date that there will be one, but it's not too late if they choose to but right now they haven't. I don't know if that's helpful but that's the way it works. 
Chris Raymond - Robert Baird & Co.: Okay. Thanks. 
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Jason Kantor of Crédit Suisse. Your line is open. 
Jason Kantor - Crédit Suisse : Great. You answered my compounding question, so I'll ask another which is on the human genomics effort, this is obviously a very big project and I am just wondering if there will be sort of any interim kind of announceable events where you give progress updates on anything that might be coming out of that or is this something that is going to go somewhat radio silence for years until a drug pops out of this program versus something we can expect updates on? 
Leonard S. Schleifer : Yeah, maybe George can give you some perspective on that. 
George D. Yancopoulos : I think we are viewing a situation where the program can impact every aspect of everything that we do and I can tell you we've already had results that have impacted how we think about, how we design our programs and so forth. So this is the continuous data. We will certainly be taking advantage of it in a continuous fashion of course we hope that there will be some huge breakthroughs that will also lead to important new therapeutics opportunities. And we also anticipate that there will be a lot of publishing going on continuously also not only from our selves but importantly from our collaborators such as Geisinger.
Jason Kantor - Crédit Suisse : Could you expand on what you mean by you've already seen impact to some of your thinking around your programs. What are you referring to? 
George D. Yancopoulos: Yeah, it's probably a bit premature to get into those details, Jason. So but stay tuned this is an exciting area. 
Jason Kantor - Crédit Suisse : Thank you. 
Leonard S. Schleifer : Okay. 
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Robyn Karnauskas of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. 
Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank : Hi, guys thanks for taking my question. So maybe you could frame for us how to think about the data for the IL-4 IL-13 compound given that you are going to have a couple of data sets in the next six months. Just what would be, what is the data set that we should be focused on and what are your thoughts on IL-4 in asthma? Thanks. 
Leonard S. Schleifer : George? 
George D. Yancopoulos : Well, certainly very soon as we announced in the first quarter we will be getting data from our Phase IIB study in atopic dermatitis. We certainly hope that, that data will confirm and extend the data to-date and as we indicated we think that, that is a very large opportunity on itself and it's an earlier program in terms of moving towards the market and towards approval in asthma. In terms of asthma obviously we are going to be doing the Phase IIb and we are going to be anticipating that data in terms of also confirming what we've seen to-date better establishing our dose relationship and going forward into the real cause. 
Leonard S. Schleifer : Yeah, and just to be clear the data coming up at the Quad AI at the end of this month would be the Phase IIa data. And then as George indicated we will be additionally getting Phase IIb data perhaps later this quarter or the second quarter. So lots going on in the atopic dermatitis area and the asthma Phase IIb program is very large study that's well underway in terms of enrollment. So this is a pretty exciting area for us. 
Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank : Okay. Thanks. 
Operator: Thank you. And the next question is from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. 
Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Maybe another on the pipeline front. Was just wondering the EYLEA PDGF co-formulation trial, if you could give us any more insights on the design there, that will include EYLEA control arm, when we might get some data? And then maybe your thoughts on that target and given what we are seeing from the competition out there? Thanks. 
Leonard S. Schleifer : Well in terms of the target we've said many times that it's potentially interesting to combine PDGF and EYLEA. We also think it's potentially interesting and maybe more interesting to combine [inaudible] and EYLEA. And I think other people can speak to their own data but we don't view this as a done deal just yet and I don't George you want to get into it that or not give anything on trial design. 
George D. Yancopoulos:  I don't think we're going to be talking about the details of our trial design at this point. But as Len said we're very excited about the fact that we have the opportunity to combine both of these agents in terms of either the PDGF agent or the anti-agents in the same as intro-vitrial formulation as EYLEA which I think if either of these agents can walk for a substantive advantage I think that would be very attractive and convenient to patients for getting a single injection with both the agents in it.  Okay. Next question. 
Operator: Yes the next question is from Geoff Meacham of JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Carter L. Gould - JPMorgan: Hi this is Carter on for Jeff. Congrats on a good quarter. A question related to the differentiation strategy for sarilumab do you think you can differentiate versus [actamer] strictly in the basis of the reduction of progression in joint damage, in case of pretty comparable -- 
Leonard S. Schleifer : I don't think it's appropriate for us to be doing any cross trial comparisons at this point if at all let's wait until we get our data and then I think the rheumatology community will be able to assess, I think as George indicated in his talk the fact that we have both two different dosing regimens that we've been able to demonstrate I think reasonable data with both may afford a nice choice given subcutaneously et cetera. By the way give regard to Geoff because this is fourth time in all that somebody stood in for him and we hope he's okay. 
George D. Yancopoulos: So I just wanted to add to that we think the field is far from knowing the best way to use biologics as you already heard there is a substantial number of patients who don’t respond best to TNS and I think that it's both an issue of the right trials being done and trial designs and so forth. The best get the best biologic to the best patients and I think that’s going to be important way of expanding the opportunity of anti-VEGF agents in general in this space. 
Operator: The next question is from Yaron Werber of Citi. Your line is open. 
Yaron Werber - Citigroup: Hi everybody and thanks for taking my question. I don't know how you are going to let me sneak in two questions because I know you might not answer the first one. The first on just for Bob the DME market can you give us a sense how much of it is branded now versus sort of Avastin I am trying to get a sense how much is the [inaudible] and then if you don't mind I have a second one. I just don’t understand the biology for you guys may be for George and for Len, -- EYLEA sort of synergies versus PDGF and EYLEA synergy.  I am just trying to get a sense help us understand evaluate it little bit and why may be take - testing them separately and is there even an opportunity to test them all together as a triple, so plenty of questions in there? 
Leonard S. Schleifer : So Yaron those are good questions we'll deal with both of them. First Bob can you comment on the -- so in terms of DME obviously for a number of years it was not an improved product so Avastin was the dominant player in the marketplace since Lucentis has launched they have rapidly penetrated the market. But they are not at the same 50-50 split as in the wet AMD market it's more like 60% of Avastin 40% Lucentis from the survey data that we have.  That said with the launch of Lucentis the anti-VEGF market in DME is growing so we're very encouraged that over time the DME market, as I said only right now only a portion is getting into anti-VEGF therapy. But we expect that to change and especially when you look at the data which indicates patients really should not be receiving laser. If they get laser early on from what we saw in our year two data they never really catch up when they get anti-VEGF therapy. So we believe there is a major opportunity for anti-VEGF therapy to be used earlier in the treatment of clinically significant DME.  Okay. So George you want to comment on relatively pre-clinical or whatever data if you have anything want to say that PDGS and Avastin and whether or not a combination makes any sense at all? 
George D. Yancopoulos: Well right now we view the pre-clinical data is actually stronger for ANG potent II. They both are acting predominantly on the blood vessels as opposed to PDGF which is acting on the smooth muscles. So I guess theoretically there is some rationale a possibility of the three way combination but I think actually first we are going to have to -- as a field to convincingly demonstrate that either agent on top of anti-VEGF have a substantial advantage.  Okay, next question.
Operator: The next question is from Matt Roden of UBS. Your line is open.
Matthew Roden - UBS : Hi, thanks for taking the question and congrats on the progress. I just wanted to ask you about the market share trends here. Can you speak to whether or not the market share in AMD and CRVO you report is representative of what you see if you limited that sample to just patients starting therapy or switching therapy?  And then related as you think about launching into DME, is there anything you can learn from your experience here in AMD and RVO together with the dosing advantages and things like that could result in sort of the super market share gain in DME with EYLEA than you had in the previous indication, thanks.
Leonard S. Schleifer :   Yeah, I would say we were pretty pleased with how quickly we got market share and I am not sure we have much to add on that. Bob do you want to come on that?
Robert J. Terifay: I think I don’t want to split it out our survey data for new versus switched patients, what I would say is that the majority of our business that is not on -- from continuing patients is now on new patients which is very encouraging. We’ve really got that pool of switched patients earlier on and now it’s we’re fighting it out to get new patients, by new patients our share in new patients is greater than our share in switches.  With regard to the DME growth I think that the opportunity is similar to what we saw in with wet AMD, there is a dissatisfied group of patients who will be switched and our real opportunity is to grow the market because quite frankly laser therapy is not appropriate and most patients were set with DME with central vision and we have to get that message out.
Matthew Roden - UBS : Right, obviously that bothers you post the approvals hopefully which is due in August of this year, okay.
Leonard S. Schleifer : Okay, next question.
Operator: Next question is from Joseph Schwartz of Leerink. Your line is open.
Joseph Schwartz - Leerink Swann LLC: Thanks a lot. I was wondering if you could talk about how you've designed your antibody against PDGF and what science supports going after the receptor versus the lag end and PDGF data versus other sub units.
Leonard S. Schleifer : Yeah, I think that's a little bit proprietary so we will have to duck that one. But we will give you another question if you have one.
Joseph Schwartz - Leerink Swann LLC: Thanks, how about are you detecting any potential changes in the way physicians are reimbursed for inter vitrial injections.
Leonard S. Schleifer : Bob, do you have any comment or question about that? 
Robert J. Terifay: Over the short term there are no anticipated changes but right now the whole health care environment is uncertain so I can't talk about what might happen in the future.
Joseph Schwartz - Leerink Swann LLC: Okay, alright, great thanks.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from [Rachel Span] of Bank of America, your line is open. 
Unidentified Analyst: Just two quick ones, just to make sure I understand your guidance for sales in the first quarter and your inventory comments, are you actually guiding for 1Q sales that are lower than the fourth quarter reported sales? And then to follow up on the DME comments, it sounds like that there will be because Roche has already kind of said that the market, if I am interpreting their comments correctly, is around $250 million in sales for DME in U.S. now and I understand it is going to grow. Just sounds like there's overall there is a much smaller pool of patients to switch and we ought to be thinking about DME in the context of your comments. I just want to make sure I understand if it's as big as AMD that’s really several years from now as opposed to in the next two years. Is that so?
Leonard S. Schleifer : Yeah, good question. The second question, in terms of the size of the DME markets you are correct. We are launching into a market that is much less mature than the AMD market that is assuming we get approval we will launching into a market there is much less mature and therefore you are correct the number of actual switches available might be less.  On the other hand our statement that the market could be as large really was a demographic statement relating to the number of patients with DME and the fact that the disease is often bilateral, the number of eyes that could be needed to be treated. And the fact that a significant fraction of the market is now still laser at least according to the several meeting that I have been the people feel that laser user usage will be decreasing dramatically.  In terms of we did not give specific sequential quarterly guidance but you are correct that we were suggesting that there could be a negative effect of on the first quarter of this year based on inventory realignment and plus the growth that we're predicting. As I said it's tilted more towards the second half of the year especially post the approval of DME if it comes in August. 
Robert J. Terifay: So Len I think one thing people need to keep in mind when they're looking at about $250 million number is that Lucentis is dosed at a 0.3 milligram dose in DME. So it's three-fifth of the price in AMD. So you really can't compare AMD and DME numbers. 
Leonard S. Schleifer : Okay, good questions, thanks. So we have time for couple of more I think? 
Michael Aberman: Yes two more questions operator? 
Operator: Yes sir, the next question is from Phil Nadeau from Cowen & Co. Your line is open. 
Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co.: Yeah thanks for taking my question, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a question on Alirocumab, just wondering if you could give us an update on the outcomes trial how's it proceeding and then a related question what is the rate limiting factor to filing Alirocumab in U.S. is it that the outcomes trial has to have a certain percentage of enrollment or are you going to wait for the data from the trial. 
Leonard S. Schleifer : Yeah so I think what we've said is that we're not going to comment on the specifics of our outcome data progress enrolment et cetera because it is a very competitive field. We have indicated that in terms of what's required for filing with the FDA wanted to see some progress and I am not going to get some specifics there but they were looking at progress in terms of the number of events and a blinded setting in one group or the other overall number of events.  So they knew the progress was -- so the progress of the trial was moving along but we don't want to get into the specifics there either because each program they have its own nuances. So hope that helps. Next question. 
Operator: The final question is from Biren Amin of Jefferies. Your line is open. 
Biren Amin - Jefferies & Co., Inc.: Len, a question on your competitors they are working at more and frequent delivery of anti-VEGF could you may be share your thoughts on EYLEA and your efforts on -- around this, thanks. 
Leonard S. Schleifer : Yeah we continue to look at alternative delivery systems whether it would be through genetic approaches whether it would be through delivery devices or what have you as far we know one of our competitors had something in Phase I for quite some time now and we haven't seen that progress. We don't know much more than you do. And we don't have anything in the clinic as yet but I can assure you we look at this area very carefully and we'll see whether or not going to be this combination will make a difference as well. Okay, Michael? 
Michael Aberman: Well, thank you -- thanks everybody we appreciate you participating in our fourth quarter call. We look forward to a great 2014 and with that I would like to close the call. 
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to your host, Dr. Michael Aberman. Please go ahead.
Michael Aberman: Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, and welcome to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Third Quarter 2013 Conference Call. An archive of this webcast will be available on our website under Events and Presentations for 30 days. Joining me on the call today is Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; George Yancopoulos, Founding Scientist, President of Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer; Bob Landry, Chief Financial Officer; and Bob Terifay, Senior Vice President, Commercial. After our prepared remarks, we'll open the call for Q&A. I would also like to remind you that remarks made on this call include forward-looking statements about Regeneron. Such statements may include, but are not limited to, those related to Regeneron and its products and business, sales and expense forecast, financial forecast, development programs, collaborations, finances, regulatory matters, intellectual property and competition. Each forward-looking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected in such statements. A more complete description of these and other material risks can be found in Regeneron's filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission or SEC, including its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, and Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2013, which was filed with the SEC earlier today. Regeneron does not undertake any obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. In addition, please note that GAAP and non-GAAP measures will be discussed on today's call. Information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP are available in our financial results press release, which can be accessed on our website at www.regeneron.com. Once our call concludes, the IR team will be available to answer further questions. With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Thank you, Michael, and good morning to everyone, and thanks for joining us on our third quarter 2013 earnings call. We are pleased to announce another quarter of strong earnings. Our third quarter non-GAAP net income rose to $277 million or $2.40 per diluted share, primarily as a result of continued growth of EYLEA, both in the United States and globally. You will hear more details about our financial performance from Bob Landry, our new Chief Financial Officer, who is participating on his first quarterly conference call. As previously announced, Murray Goldberg, who has served as our Chief Financial Officer for almost 2 decades, has transitioned out of the position as CFO in anticipation of his retirement at the end of 2014. Murray's contribution was vital for the transformation of Regeneron from a development stage biotechnology company to one of the largest biotechnology companies in the world. For that, as well as for his wisdom and friendship, we will be forever grateful. That said, Bob brings with him a strong set of skills and a breadth of domestic and international financial expertise that is critical as we continued to grow as a commercial enterprise, especially as we expand outside the United States. You will be hearing from Bob shortly. Turning to our top line. EYLEA continued to grow in the United States during the third quarter, with net sales of $363 million, a 49% increase from the third quarter of 2012 and a 10% sequential quarter-over-quarter increase. EYLEA also performed well outside the United States, with x U.S. sales in the third quarter of $125 million, which represents sequential quarter-over-quarter growth of about 23%. Bayer HealthCare is still in the early process of rolling out EYLEA around the world, so we can expect continued growth in the x U.S. sales and profit. You will hear more about EYLEA's commercial performance from Bob Terifay. Before turning the call over to my partner and Regeneron's Chief Scientific Officer, George Yancopoulos, who will discuss our pipeline in greater detail, let me make a couple of quick comments about our research accomplishments since last quarter. The last few months have been very productive. On today's call, you will hear from George about our multiple Phase III data readouts and new potential indications for EYLEA, reports of the first Phase III results of alirocumab, our investigational LDL cholesterol-lowering antibody, the progress with our Phase III program with sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody for rheumatoid arthritis, as well as exciting Phase III results with dupilumab, our IL-4 receptor antibody that was currently being studied in asthma, atopic dermatitis and now nasal polyposis. I would specifically like to highlight that we announced today the submission of the supplemental BLA for EYLEA in the diabetic macular edema or DME indication. This substantial progress would not be possible without the efforts of a large number of dedicated and incredibly talented people at Regeneron. That is why I am particularly proud that Science Magazine just announced that Regeneron is once again the #1 place to work in the worldwide biopharmaceutical industry. I would like to take a moment to congratulate my colleagues at Regeneron and thank them for the efforts they have put forth. With that, let me turn the call over to George who will discuss our pipeline in greater detail. He will be followed by Bob Terifay, our Senior Vice President of Commercial; and then Bob Landry, our Chief Financial Officer. George?
George D. Yancopoulos: Thank you, Len, and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us today. As Len said, the R&D team at Regeneron has continued to be very productive. We reported the positive Phase III results for EYLEA from the VISTA and VIVID trials in diabetic macular edema. And as we announced today, we recently submitted the supplemental BLA to the FDA for the DME indication. This submission is approximately one year ahead of our original plans. Outside the United States, our partner, Bayer HealthCare, also expects to submit their application for regulatory approval in DME by year end. We also reported positive Phase III data with EYLEA from the VIBRANT trial in macular edema following branch retinal vein occlusion or BRVO. The VIBRANT trial is the eighth positive Phase III study of EYLEA and was the first study to compare EYLEA against an active laser comparator in this indication. We intend to submit an application for regulatory approval in the BRVO indication in the coming months. If approved in both the DME and BRVO indications, EYLEA will have received regulatory approval in 4 different indications in the United States. Our late-stage pipeline beyond EYLEA has continued to advance. Last month, we reported positive top line data from ODYSSEY MONO, the first Phase III trial of alirocumab, our investigational PCSK9 antibody for lowering LDL or the bad cholesterol. We are developing alirocumab in collaboration with Sanofi. Not only was this the first Phase III study to read out from our overall 23,000-patient ODYSSEY program which consists of 12 trials, but it was also the first Phase III study from this entire class of investigational PCSK9 antibodies to report data. It is very gratifying to us that just as we were the first company to report the first human data for this potentially important new class of antibodies, we were also the first to report Phase III data from this entire class. All the trials in the ODYSSEY program, with the exception of ODYSSEY outcomes and the recently announced ODYSSEY CHOICE 1, are fully enrolled, and we expect to report data from these trials in 2014. As we have said before, together with Sanofi, we are planning the initial launch towards the end of 2015, with a global rollout in 2016 subject to regulatory and pricing approvals. With regards to sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody being developed with Sanofi for rheumatoid arthritis or RA, we now expect to report top line data from the MOBILITY B Phase III trial by year end. In addition to MOBILITY, sarilumab is being studied in 4 other Phase III studies in RA. Apart from RA, we're also exploring the use of sarilumab in non-infectious uveitis and have recently announced a Phase II study of sarilumab, the SATURN study, in this indication. Turning to dupilumab, our IL-4 receptor inhibitor. In October, we presented positive Phase II data in atopic dermatitis at a major medical conference. These data followed the positive Phase II data that we reported in asthma earlier this year. We are collaborating with Sanofi on developing dupilumab, which is now in Phase II clinical trials and 3 indications: Asthma, atopic dermatitis and nasal polyposis. We continue to be excited by this program and look forward to data from these studies in the future. We have a robust antibody pipeline in earlier stages of development. In total, we are now developing 13 fully-human monoclonal antibodies, 7 of which are in collaboration with Sanofi. This quarter, we independently advanced a new antibody combination into the clinic. With that overview, let me now turn the call over to Bob Terifay who will provide further details on the EYLEA commercial landscape in the third quarter.
Robert J. Terifay: Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. In the United States, as Len mentioned earlier, EYLEA net sales to distributors in the third quarter were $363 million. Year-to-date, net EYLEA sales were slightly over $1 billion. We continue to see strong physician usage of EYLEA, and we've raised our full year net sales forecast between $1.35 billion and $1.375 billion. Sales growth was anticipated to be somewhat tempered during the Thanksgiving and end of year holidays when patients are likely to postpone visits to their doctors. Inventory held by distributors remains at the 1- to 2-week range. Although at the end of the third quarter, there was a slight increase in inventory days relative to the second quarter. To help provide more detail on the market dynamics, we will be sharing with you data from our market research survey that we conducted in the third quarter. As before, these data come from physician-based questionnaires, in this case, from 167 representative physicians. I will share with you the numbers as they were reported in the survey, which was conducted in the third quarter. But I'd like to remind you that these numbers are physician-reported estimates based on our survey. Let me begin with the wet AMD indication. In the third quarter, physicians recorded that EYLEA had a 26% market share on wet AMD, with ranibizumab having a 25% share and off-label bevacizumab having a 48% share. Approximately half of the patients treated with EYLEA were patients continuing from prior quarters, 1/4 for patients switching from other anti-VEGF therapies and 1/4 for patients new to therapy. Physicians report that wet AMD patients on EYLEA received treatment with a longer dosing interval compared to ranibizumab and bevacizumab. EYLEA patients received an intravitreal injection on average approximately every 8 weeks compared to patients receiving ranibizumab who were treated with a dosing interval of approximately 6 weeks and patients on bevacizumab who were treated with a dosing interval every 6 weeks. Turning now to the second indication where EYLEA is approved in the United States. Macular edema following central retinal vein occlusion data from our market research survey suggests that during the third quarter, EYLEA achieved a 40% share of the approved anti-VEGF products in this indication. Highlighting that we are gaining momentum in this indication, 32% of our business in this indication came from new patients. Turning now to our x U.S. EYLEA business where we split profits with Bayer HealthCare. Third quarter EYLEA net sales were $125 million. Bayer HealthCare reported that the majority of these sales continue to come from Japan and Australia. As reported by Bayer, EYLEA market share is 48% in Japan and 43% in Australia. At the end of the third -- as of the end of the third quarter, EYLEA has received regulatory approval for the treatment of wet AMD in over 50 countries. EYLEA has also been recommended for approval in the EU in the macular edema following CRVO indication. For the remainder of the year, we expect Bayer HealthCare to embark on additional launches in both of these indications, following regulatory and pricing approvals. Just this week, in fact, EYLEA received pricing approval for wet AMD in France. As Len and George mentioned earlier, we've submitted a supplemental BLA for EYLEA in the diabetic macular edema indication. We reported positive Phase III data from 2 trials earlier this year. We believe the DME market opportunity to be quite significant. There are 570,000 patients in the United States presenting with clinically significant diabetic macular edema each year. Currently, it is estimated that 228,000 patients are treated with anti-VEGF therapy. Our market survey indicates the physicians intend to grow their use of anti-VEGF therapy in DME by 30% over the next year. We've recently also reported positive data for EYLEA from the Phase III VIBRANT trial in macular edema following branch retinal vein occlusion or BRVO. It is estimated that approximately 78,000 patients are treated with anti-VEGF therapy for macular edema following BRVO in the United States each year. Turning to ZALTRAP or ziv-aflibercept, Sanofi reported sales of $18 million for the third quarter. We expect continued x U.S. launches over the course of this year. With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Landry.
Robert E. Landry: Thank you, Bob, and good morning to everyone. It's truly my pleasure to be participating for the first time as Regeneron's CFO. Regeneron is at a very exciting stage in its evolution, and I'm pleased to be a part of it. I look forward to getting to know and working with many of you in the coming weeks, months and years. I'll now talk briefly about our performance in the third quarter, and I'll provide some color on the remainder of 2013. We are very pleased with our third quarter results. We earned $2.40 per diluted share from non-GAAP net income of $277 million, which represents a 27% increase versus the 3 months ended September 30, 2012. Just to remind everyone, non-GAAP EPS excludes noncash share-based compensation expense, noncash interest expense related to our senior convertible notes and noncash income tax expense and is based on approximately 116 million fully diluted outstanding shares. A full reconciliation of all the adjustments to GAAP earnings are set out in our earnings release. Total revenues in the third quarter were $597 million, which represented growth of 40% versus the quarter ended September 30, 2012. Net product sales were comprised of $363 million for U.S. EYLEA sales and $4 million in ARCALYST sales; in total, $367 million for the third quarter of 2013. As Len mentioned, U.S. EYLEA sales grew 10% sequentially quarter-over-quarter and approximately 50% year-over-year. In addition to the sales growth, we were the beneficiary of a slight increase in wholesaler inventories this quarter. X U.S. EYLEA sales were $125 million and represented a 23% improvement versus the quarter ended June 30, 2013. As a reminder, revenue from x U.S. EYLEA sales is recorded by Bayer HealthCare. You may notice a slight difference between what we are reporting as x U.S. EYLEA sales and what Bayer HealthCare previously reported. This is due to Japan where Santen Pharmaceuticals commercializes EYLEA under a co-promotion relationship with a subsidiary of Bayer HealthCare. Our royalty in Japan is based on end use of sales reported by Santen, so we're using an x U.S. sales number that includes Santen's end user sales of EYLEA in Japan. Bayer HealthCare, however, reports their net sales to Santen rather than sales by Santen, so there are going to be differences each quarter between those numbers. Note that on this basis, second quarter x U.S. sales were $120 million -- $102 million compared to $125 million in the third quarter. Our share of a net profit from x U.S. EYLEA sales in the third quarter was $46 million. This includes royalties that we received on EYLEA sales in Japan. After deducting $14 million in the quarter for reimbursement of development expenses at Bayer HealthCare previously funded, EYLEA x U.S. profit contributed $32 million to our Bayer HealthCare collaboration revenue. Adding the cost sharing of ongoing EYLEA development expenses, reimbursement of other Regeneron EYLEA expenses, amortization of upfront and certain milestone payments and $45 million in substantive milestone payments this quarter, total Bayer HealthCare collaboration revenue was $89 million in the third quarter compared to $27 million in the third quarter of last year. As a reminder, during the third quarter of 2012, x U.S. sales of EYLEA had not yet commenced, but there was a $15 million milestone payment. The $45 million of milestone payments that we recognized in the third quarter 2013 consisted of a $15 million milestone related to EYLEA approval in the EU and the CRVO indication and 2 sales milestone payments that were $15 million each, relating to aggregate net EYLEA x U.S. sales. We anticipate earning another $15 million sales milestone payment in the fourth quarter based on continued x U.S.EYLEA sales growth script. Beyond 2013, we could earn up to $90 million in additional x U.S. EYLEA sales milestones, which we expect to earn in full by approximately the end of 2015. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $134 million for the quarter and represents an 8% decrease versus the 3 months ended September 30, 2012, primarily driven by a $50 million substantive milestone payment received in 2012 related to U.S. regulatory approval of ZALTRAP, offset by an increase in R&D and reimbursement for the 3 months ended September 30, 2013. As explained on previous calls and as outlined in our 10-Q, the Sanofi collaboration revenue includes primarily reimbursement of our R&D expenses for pre-clinical and clinical development within our antibody collaboration and amortization of payments previously received from Sanofi, less our share of the losses associated with ZALTRAP. Global ZALTRAP net sales in the third quarter, as reported by Sanofi, were $18 million. We recognize $7 million as our share of the losses in connection with the commercialization of ZALTRAP around the world. Let me reiterate what we have previously said. We are not expecting ZALTRAP to be profitable to Regeneron in the near term due to our obligation to repay Sanofi from our 50% share of ZALTRAP profits for 50% of the cumulative ZALTRAP development expenses that they have funded. Turning to expenses. Non-GAAP cost of goods was $28 million in the third quarter 2013 compared to $20 million in the third quarter 2012. Included in COGS is our royalty obligation to Genentech related to U.S. sales of EYLEA, which remains in place until second quarter 2016. As in prior quarters, COGS continues to average less than 10% of product sales. Cost of collaboration manufacturing, which is relatively new line item in our P&L, came in at $10 million for the 3 months ended September 30, 2013. The cost of collaboration manufacturing includes our manufacturing costs for producing bulk material that our collaborators sell. This line item also comprises royalties that we are obligated to pay, including the Genentech royalties that we will pay until second quarter 2016 on sales of EYLEA that is manufactured in the U.S. but sold outside the U.S. This is not the total manufacturing cost of these products. About half of the cost of collaboration manufacturing is reimbursed to us by Sanofi and Bayer HealthCare through the individual collaboration revenue lines. Non-GAAP SG&A expense for the third quarter 2013 was $80 million compared to $56 million in the second quarter 2013 and $40 million for the third quarter 2012. The increase in non-GAAP SG&A was largely driven by contributions we made for not-for-profit foundations that assist patients' pay for their medications. We are not expecting to see this same G&A expense level in the fourth quarter, but do expect to be on the top end of our previously provided guidance for full year GAAP SG&A expense of $225 million to $250 million. Non-GAAP R&D expense for the third quarter of 2013 was $196 million compared to $160 million in the second quarter, an increase of 23%. During the third quarter, Sanofi and Bayer HealthCare reimbursed us a total of $141 million in R&D expenses. As a reminder, we record the R&D activity incurred in connection with our Sanofi and Bayer arrangements as a component of our R&D expenses, and record their reimbursement to us within the Bayer and Sanofi collaboration revenue line items. The unreimbursed net R&D expenses for the third quarter 2013 after the reimbursement by Bayer and Sanofi were $55 million compared to $46 million in the second quarter. The increase in unreimbursed R&D this quarter was due primarily to higher R&D expenses on unpartnered early-stage antibody programs. We are tightening our full year 2013 non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense guidance to $225 million to $250 million from the previous range of $225 million to $275 million. This full year unreimbursed R&D guidance assumes fourth quarter unreimbursed R&D of $80 million to $105 million, which would be significantly higher than prior quarters. This is primarily due to the terms of our antibody collaboration with Sanofi, which requires that following the first positive Phase III results for an antibody in the collaboration, we are responsible for 20% of the subsequent Phase III development costs for that antibody. Therefore, following the positive results from ODYSSEY MONO, which were reported last month, we are now paying for 20% of the Phase III expense for alirocumab. Additionally, within the fourth quarter, we expect to incur unreimbursed antibody discovery research expenses beyond $160 million per year that is reimbursed by Sanofi. While we are not prepared to provide specific unreimbursed R&D guidance for next year at this time, assuming continued success of the pipeline, including sarilumab and our unpartnered antibodies, we expect the quarterly rate of unreimbursed R&D to continue to grow during 2014. We anticipate providing further financial guidance at the JPMorgan conference in January 2014. As a reminder, non-GAAP SG&A and R&D expenses exclude noncash share-based compensation expense. Turning now to taxes. For GAAP accounting purposes, in the third quarter, we recorded $84 million in income taxes, representing an effective tax rate of approximately 37% for the quarter. As we've stated before, at this current time, we do not expect to pay significant cash taxes through at least 2014, and as such, our non-GAAP earnings currently exclude any income taxes. At the end of the third quarter, we had $775 million in cash and marketable securities and $856 million in trade account receivables, primarily related to EYLEA sales. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Len
Leonard S. Schleifer: Thanks, Bob, and thank you, everyone else. I'd like to close the prepared remarks by highlighting a few things. Our business continues to perform well. We believe that EYLEA has room to grow, both through approval and additional indications, such as DME, BRVO, as well as the continued geographic expansion that is still in the early stages. Over the mid to longer term, we expect our broad pipeline of antibodies, such as alirocumab, sarilumab and dupilumab, to drive continued growth. As Bob Landry mentioned, with the success in our pipeline, including the positive Phase III data with alirocumab, but also our own growing pipeline of wholly-owned antibodies, such as PDGF in ophthalmology, we expect our unreimbursed R&D expenses to increase in the fourth quarter of this year, as well as in 2014. We feel confident in our approach and our broad pipeline that gives us multiple shots on goal. We look forward to discussing new molecules and technologies that are currently in earlier development and that we hope will advance soon. I would like to now turn the call back over to Michael Aberman for questions and answers.
Michael Aberman: Thank you, Len. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] As you know, our team will be available in our office after the call for follow-up questions. Thank you. And operator, if you could please now open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adnan Butt with RBC Capital Markets.
Adnan S. Butt - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: The question I'm getting most frequently, and perhaps you can address this, is on outcomes and data being needed for the alirocumab study. And what gives you confidence that it will not be acquired first? And then can you explain a bit about your labeling strategy? Will it be initial targeted label then going over time? And which region do you expect to [indiscernible] first?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Okay. Thanks [indiscernible]. And then George, do you want to deal with the regulatory question there?
George D. Yancopoulos: Yes. We've had extensive discussions with the FDA. And as we noted, it's our understanding that assuming that the data is robust and that safety data is hopefully quite clear cut that all we'll need to do is to be substantially involved in executing our outcome study to be considered for approval. So we will not need to have an outcome study result at that time.
Robert E. Landry: And as far as your question on the label, we don't have any comment specifically on the label, but we will say that we have a very broad program that we believe covers just about everything one could think of in terms of the types of patients, the relative risk, the relative cholesterol, whether they have familial disorders, whether they've had a previous event and so forth. And we have dosing choices as well and we have a well-controlled, long-term safety aspect of the program, which we think is very important. So we are very pleased with the program as it's designed and how it's being conducted together with Sanofi.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Kantor with Crédit Suisse.
Jason Kantor - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I'm wondering if you could give us a synthetic quantification of the inventory impact in the quarter, either in terms of dollars or days. And in your survey, are you seeing that you are already having current use in DME? And if so, how much of your sales are in the DME indications?
Leonard S. Schleifer: All right. So the second question, we don't track our off-label uses, we don't reward on it. And so we really don't have any information for you on that. In terms of the inventory, we're not going to get into the -- how many minutes, hours, days or what-have-you of extra inventory we have, but it was just a slight increase on a relative magnitude. I think was on the order of slightly less than the increase was in the previous quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Roden with UBS.
Andrew R. Peters - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: This is actually Andrew Peters in for Matt. A quick question on the PCSK9 program. In the Phase II, you guys ran fixed dose studies, but in the Phase III, you're looking at more of an up-titration, 75 up to 150. So it seems like you're looking at optimizing the LDL goal instead of maximizing the reduction. I was wondering if you could just go through the rationale there as it relates to whether you think there's a linear risk reduction with LDL or is it more about just reaching goal.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Well, I think the point is, is that physicians in this area are used to and like options for treating their patients. We have a very robust program which examines both fixed dosing in very large numbers of patients, as well as up-titration strategies. And I think, together, the collection of all of these studies are going to offer physicians and patients a large number of choices to satisfy what the individual patient's needs and what the individual doctors think that, that patient's needs are. So we'll have the ability if that patient needs it to drive the LDL down as quickly and as far as possible. In other settings where -- and that may not be needed, they could have a choice of a lower dose. And in even our program, we can allow for monthly dosing and so forth. So it's all about options and flexibility for the patients.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Raymond with Robert Baird & Co.
Christopher J. Raymond - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Just doing some calculation, looking at your last couple of quarters of DSOs, it looks like the number is leveling off here a bit. I know -- or I think I've heard you guys talk about changing the terms perhaps at the beginning of the year, and I know you don't want to give a lot of detail on that, but can you maybe talk a little bit about when we might start to see that DSO number start to trend down?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes, we don't comment on these commercial terms. It's in the competitive environment, sorry.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Birchenough with BMO Capital.
Jim Birchenough - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Just following up on some market trends. One, wondering if there's anything that you guys are planning to do or already doing to compete against the Lucentis discount program that might be your own discount program or sampling. Just wondering what you can do to eat in to that 24% share that they're retaining. And in DME, wondering how you think about position against the Lucentis 0.3 milligram dose, which is lower priced, and whether you need to discount in DME to gain meaningful market share.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes. Some of those details are obviously part of our competitive strategy that we really don't want to get into. We will say that based on what we've heard presented at medical meetings and the advisory panel, the reason for the lower dose of Lucentis in DME had to do primarily with this question of this dose-dependent safety question around deaths at a higher dose. We don't have a dose-dependent increase in that, and we studied the same doses we had in AMD. So we'll have to see whether or not that provides an advantage to patients or not. We don't have a head-to-head study, so we can't make a comparison about that. As far as the rebate program and things like that, we're not going to get into. I don't know, Bob, if you want to add anything about sampling or anything else you want to...
Robert J. Terifay: No, I think that any discussion of rebates or sampling is competitive situation we won't disclose. I will remind you that in DME, we have every 8-week dosing in our study which is differentiating from the competition which has monthly dosing in their labeling. And that should help offset any cost concerns on an annual basis.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes, that's a great point, Bob. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America.
Steve Byrne - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Yes. A question for Bob Terifay. Your SG&A increased sequentially. I was wondering if you increased the headcount and the sales force in -- for EYLEA.
Robert J. Terifay: No, our sales force has remained consistent since launch.
Operator: Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.
Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Was just wondering if you could give us your take on the current version of the compounding bill that the Senate's poised to vote on this week. It seems that everyone who talks to someone in D.C. has a different interpretation.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes. I mean, you can imagine that we monitor that pretty carefully. And obviously, we believe that a single quality standard for all drug products, whether they're manufactured by companies such as Regeneron, or whether they are repackaged by a compounding pharmacy, patients and the physicians shouldn't have to worry that the drug is not meeting a single high-quality standard. We think that the current draft bill makes important headway in ensuring a more robust regulatory enforcement regime in the area of compounding and repackaging. And it clears the way possible legal impediments, the most important thing from our perspective. It clears away any blockage of the FDA's ability to enforce the law. And the requirement -- we believe that, that may require people to live up to FDA-mandated GMP-type standards when they repackage a drug. It sounds simple, but that process is rather complicated, and it's associated -- also, it's a risk and it needs to be properly regulated. That's our position. We think the current compounding bill will allow the FDA to do that. But of course, the bill hasn't been signed or passed just yet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.
Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: So big picture, now that we've seen some stabilization in the market a little bit that you continue to grow, I was just wondering, do you still think fears around the sequester influencing Avastin's ability to keep share? And do you think that you can actually continue to take share over time from the AMD market, specifically the Avastin segment?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Bob, do you want to comment on that?
Robert J. Terifay: So we have seen a stabilization in Avastin share. Remember, we started when we launched with Avastin having a 65% share of the wet AMD market, that's down to 48%, but it is starting to stabilize as some physicians with the sequester payments have chosen to use Avastin. We still think there is room to grow in wet AMD. There are patients on a continuous basis who have to be switched from their existing therapy, and we believe there's opportunity there. And we will continue to fight it out in the marketplace with the branded molecule as well. We're also quite encouraged by the growth potential in Europe where the pricing approvals are just coming.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ying Huang with Barclays.
Ying Huang - Barclays Capital, Research Division: So first of all, can you tell us exactly what you asked for in the BLA for DME? Did you ask for both every 4-week and every 8-week dosing? And then can you tell me a little bit more about the status for development for the PDGF and NH2 antibody program in AMD?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Sure. It's a little bit premature to be discussing our ask in labeling and what-have-you, but we can remind you what we did study, which usually tracks what one submits obviously. We did study a program that had a fixed dosing that -- and then it went on to every 8-week dosing. So we're obviously going to be discussing our whole data set with the FDA. George, do you want to comment a little bit our thoughts about PDGF, what we think about the program and where it's going?
George D. Yancopoulos: Yes. Well, we are certainly hopeful that PDGF co-therapy will provide an incremental advance for patients. And on top of, of course, the anti-VEGF foundation therapy, and we think, of course, that it's going to be quite a while before we collectively as a community really understand whether it will be providing that sort of advance, that we know better than anyone a few letters difference, even in the 150-patient study, is a little hard to interpret and that you need a lot more data. But in our case, we're moving ahead. We're on schedule with the previous guidance we've given in terms of filing our IND and so forth. And we certainly think that if this co-therapy proves to have value, it'll be tremendously beneficial to the patients to have the opportunity to have a single injection coformulated product which we're hoping to be able to provide if the co-therapy is advantageous.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Good, thank you. Let me just come back to one other question that maybe we were a little bit abrupt in saying we don't comment on the DSO. I guess a point there is that we do expect that to trend down over the course of the next year as we tighten up the terms. But the specific commercial terms and the specific dates, we can't get into at this point.
Operator: Our next question comes from Yaron Werber with Citi.
Christopher Mortko: This is Chris in for Yaron. Had a question on your IL-6 program. Can you comment on how you think your compound is differentiated, given that the IL-6 base is becoming increasingly competitive with Actemra just getting approved subcu recently?
Leonard S. Schleifer: George?
George D. Yancopoulos: Yes. Well, we certainly think that the IL-6 space continues to be a very exciting opportunity. I think a lot of people believe that this target could provide a big opportunity for providing more benefit to patients. In our case, of course, we think that we'll have a convenient subcutaneous regimen that has the opportunity to be very competitive with the Actemra and the data that Actemra is producing subcutaneously. So we think that there's going to be room in this space for multiple agents, agents that will have slightly different profiles. And we're pretty optimistic that we're going to be second in class here for this very large opportunity offering, perhaps certain differentiation and advantages compared to Actemra.
Operator: Our next question comes from Geoffrey Meacham with JPMorgan.
Carter L. Gould - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: This is Carter on for Geoff. My question relates to Pfizer's announcement to move their PCSK9 into Phase III studies. In their comments last week, they mentioned targeting some subsegments of the hypercholesterolemia population. Do you have any comments on this and how your clinical development program maybe addresses these segments or not?
Leonard S. Schleifer: We wish our friends at Pfizer good luck. That's all we have to say about that their program at this point.
George D. Yancopoulos: Well, I think it's worth adding that we do think that our program is as robust and deep and targets as many interesting patient subclasses and does it as robustly as any other program that's being undertaken at this point in time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Raymond with Robert Baird & Co.
Christopher J. Raymond - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Just a question on the shelf. You guys are in a decisively cash flow positive position. Can you maybe talk a little bit about the logic and thinking behind filing the shelf?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Bob? Bob Landry?
Robert E. Landry: Chris, it's Bob Landry. So I mean, the shelf is just kind of good everyday, housekeeping practice that we do. We've had a shelf in place that had expired in October of 2013. And again, I'd don't want anyone a kind to read into anything with regards to our future plans, with regards to the use of it. It's just good housekeeping practice to always have a shelf kind of in place and hence, the filing of that this morning.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes. We have no plans whatsoever to access the capital markets at this time.
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up from Adnan Butt with RBC Capital Markets.
Adnan S. Butt - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: So your friends at Genentech Roche mentioned that they expect completion in DME around midyear. So do you wish them good luck as well? Is this priority of you?
Leonard S. Schleifer: I think they were wishing us good luck. But look, all of this kind of activity, this competitive activity is great for patients. When you bring additional choices of drugs that might make a difference in these terrible diseases, I think having more than one choice and each choice having lots of robust labels is a good thing. We look forward to competing in the marketplace with Lucentis if we're lucky enough to get the drug approved sometime next year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Kantor with Crédit Suisse.
Jason Kantor - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I was hoping that you can give us some sense of the timeline for data releases from some of your earlier-stage programs and the next data release from the PCSK9 program. And on the earlier side, I was interested in the [indiscernible] study and when you might have data from that.
Robert J. Terifay: Yes. We don't have any guidance for you this point on the earlier-stage stuff. We do expect on the PCSK9 lots of data next year. As you know, all of our studies, except the outcomes in the Q4 week are fully enrolled, which means we will be having lots of data and lots of it probably in the first half of next year. It's going to be a busy time for the space. We expect our competition to have lots of data, and I think everybody will be focusing on that. We do expect the additional data before the end of this year on our mid-stage -- first-stage [indiscernible] program with sarilumab. I'm not sure we're expecting any Phase II data this year with the dupilumab at this point. And that's about the status of the data flow. Lots going on, but we'll try and update you from time to time on how some of the early programs are doing, Jason. And we appreciate you paying attention to it.
Michael Aberman: All right, operator, I think that will conclude our call.
Operator: Okay. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today's conference. You may all disconnect, and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Q2 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Dr. Michael Aberman, Vice President Strategy and Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Michael Aberman: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Second Quarter 2013 Conference Call. An archive of this webcast will be available on our website under Events and Presentations for 30 days. Joining me on the call today is Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; Murray Goldberg, Chief Financial Officer; and Robert Terifay, Senior Vice President Commercial. George Yancopoulos, our Founding Scientist, President of Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer unfortunately will not be able to join us on the call today. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A. I would also like to remind you that remarks made on this call that are not historical in nature may be forward-looking statements about Regeneron and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual events and our actual results may differ materially. Such remarks may include, but are not limited to, those related to Regeneron and its products and business, sales and expense forecast, financial forecast, development programs, collaborations, finances, regulatory matters, intellectual property and competition, all of which involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A more complete description of these and other material risks can be found in Regeneron's filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, including its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, and Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2013, which was filed with the SEC earlier today. Regeneron does not undertake any obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless required by law. GAAP and non-GAAP measures will be discussed on today's call. Information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP are available in our financial results press release, which can be accessed on our website. Once this call concludes, myself and Manisha from the IR team will be available to answer further questions. With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Thanks, Michael. Good morning to everyone, and thanks to so many of you who are joining our second quarter 2013 earnings call. Before I turn the call over to Bob Terifay to discuss our commercial operations and Murray to discuss our financial results, let me provide some big picture thoughts, as well as highlight the exciting clinical news and regulatory update that we reported this morning regarding EYLEA in diabetic macular edema or DME. We are very pleased with the global performance of EYLEA, including our sales in the U.S. and our partner, Bayer Healthcare Sales, outside the U.S. U.S. sales were $330 million this quarter, which represents a 70% year-over-year growth. The x U.S. launch continues to do well with net sales of $96 million. Our profit share on these x U.S. sales was $34 million and contributed $19 million to our bottom line after accounting for our repayment obligation to Bayer HealthCare for development expenses. Outside the U.S., many of our launches are under way, and we look forward to the continued roll out across the EU and other countries around the world. Beyond the x U.S. launch, new indications represent the next leg of growth for EYLEA. To that end, we launched into the Central Retinal Vein Occlusion, also known as CRVO market, in the United States in September of last year, and we recently announced that the European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use or the CHMP issued a positive recommendation for EYLEA for macular edema following CRVO. We also reported positive Phase III data for EYLEA in the MYRROR trial in myopic choroidal neovascularization or mCNV, and our partner, Bayer HealthCare, expects to file for regulatory approval in Asia later this year. We also expect to report top line data from the VIBRANT trial of EYLEA in branch retinal vein occlusion, or BRVO, later this year. The most recent news, however, on the indication front for EYLEA, as I'm sure you're all aware, is that this morning, we and Bayer HealthCare announced positive Phase III data from the VISTA and VIVID Phase III trials in diabetic macular edema. We plan to file for regulatory approval in both the U.S. and EU by the end of the year, which is approximately 1 year ahead of schedule in the United States. As we detailed in our press release this morning, both the 2 milligram every 4-week dose and the 2-milligram every 8-week arms of the VISTA and VIVID trials achieved the primary endpoint of improved visual acuity of 1 year compared to laser photocoagulation therapy. Importantly, both EYLEA dosed monthly and dosed every other month following 5 monthly injections demonstrated similar improvements in visual acuity. In the VIVID-DME trial and x .S. trial after 1 year, patients receiving EYLEA 2 milligrams monthly had a mean change from baseline in best corrected visual acuity of 10.5 letters with a P less than 0.0001 and patients receiving EYLEA 2 milligrams every other month after 5 initial monthly injections had a mean change from baseline of best corrected visual acuity of 10.7 letters to be also less than 0.0001, and this was compared to patients receiving photocoagulation, with a mean change from baseline and best corrected visual acuity of only 1.2 letters. In the VISTA-DME trial, a primarily North American trial, after 1 year, patients receiving EYLEA 2 milligrams monthly had a mean change from baseline best corrected visual acuity of 12.5 letters, P less than 0.0001, and patients receiving EYLEA 2 milligrams every other month after 5 initial monthly injections had a mean change from baseline in best corrected visual acuity of 10.7 letters, P also less than 0.0001 compared to patients receiving laser photocoagulation who had a mean change from baseline in best corrected visual acuity of just 0.2 letters. In these trials, EYLEA was generally well-tolerated with a similar overall incidence of adverse events, ocular serious adverse events and non-ocular serious adverse events across the treatment groups and the laser control group. Arterial thromboembolic events, as defined by the Anti-Platelet Trialists' Collaboration, which included nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarctions and vascular deaths, also occurred at similar rates across the treatment groups and the laser control group. Adverse events were typical of those seen in other studies in patients with diabetes receiving intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy. The most frequent ocular treatment emergent adverse events observed in the VIVID and VISTA trials included conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain and vitreous floaters. The most frequent non-ocular treatment emergent adverse events included hypertension and nasopharyngitis, which occurred with similar frequency in the treatment groups and the laser control group. As in wet AMD, we believe that the every-other-month dosing could provide an important potential benefit to patients and physicians. There were a number of secondary endpoints and analyses that were conducted, which strongly support the primary results, and we look forward to presenting a more complete data set at upcoming medical conferences. Now turning to the regulatory aspect. As we indicated in this morning's press release, we now plan to submit applications for regulatory approval both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. later this year. In the U.S., this represents an approximately 1 year acceleration from our previously anticipated submission date. The decision to file for regulatory approval in the U.S. based on a 1-year primary endpoint rather than the typical 2-year primary endpoint was made following extensive discussions with the FDA. DME represents a significant market opportunity, one that many believe could be as large as, if not larger than, the market opportunity in wet AMD, and Bob Terifay will provide additional details on the DME market opportunity. Before turning over to Murray and Bob, I would like to discuss our late-stage pipeline, which we believe will drive long-term growth. On that front, our 2 Phase III programs, alirocumab for hypercholesterolemia and sarilumab for rheumatoid arthritis, have continued to make good progress. ODYSSEY is a broad Phase III program for alirocumab. It includes over 10 clinical studies that are currently ongoing. Today, we announced another Phase III study for alirocumab called ODYSSEY CHOICE, and we intend to initiate for the end of the year. This critical trial will study alirocumab dosed every 4 weeks, all other ODYSSEY trials studied every 2 weeks dosing, and we remain confident that every 2-week dosing will provide the majority of patients with the preferred convenient patient-friendly option. We want, however, to be able to provide patients and physicians a once-monthly dosing regimen if desired. Later this year, we expect to report top line data from the Phase III ODYSSEY MONO trial. It's important to remember, while this will be the first Phase III data to be reported from this class of antibodies with approximately 100 patients, the MONO trial is only a small piece of the ODYSSEY clinical program with the majority of our trials leading out in 2014. Our Phase III sarilumab program is ongoing, and we expect to report initial data earlier next year from the Phase III MOBILITY trial. We also started 2 new Phase III rheumatoid arthritis trials with sarilumab this quarter, the COMPARE and ASCERTAIN trials, and we'll soon initiate our first trial with sarilumab outside of rheumatoid arthritis, the Phase II statin trial of sarilumab in noninfectious uveitis. Turning to our earlier stage pipeline, this quarter saw the presentation and publication of data from our IL-4R inhibitor, dupilumab, in the New England Journal of Medicine. It is not common for a Phase II trial to be published in the New England Journal of Medicine, and we believe this highlights the excitement generated from this potentially novel approach to treat allergic-type disease. We believe that blocking the interleukin 4 and interleukin 13 pathways with dupilumab could be an effective mechanism to treat multiple allergic conditions, and that we may have the ability to impact one of the fundamental drivers that could have applicability in the growing epidemic of allergic diseases. Of course, we need to test this in larger studies, and to that end, we and Sanofi now have 2 Phase IIb trials of dupilumab that are ongoing, one in allergic asthma and the other in atopic dermatitis, and look forward to results in these trials in the future. Turning to our early-stage programs. This quarter, we moved 2 new antibodies both against undisclosed targets into the clinic, and discontinued the development of 1 early-stage antibody. In addition to our 3 marketed products: ARCALYST, EYLEA and ZALTRAP, we now have a total of 12 antibodies in clinical development. We take pride in our science-first approach and the fact that all 12 of our pipeline antibodies have originated from in-house Regeneron research. With that, let me turn the call now over to Bob Terifay, our Senior Vice President of Commercial, who will elaborate on our commercial activities; and finally, Murray Goldberg, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our financial performance during the first quarter of 2013. Bob?
Robert J. Terifay: Thank you, Len, and good morning, everyone. EYLEA sales continue to show strong physician-demand growth both in the United States and outside the United States. In the United States, net sales to distributors in the second quarter were $330 million. Inventory held by distributors remains at the 1- to 2-week range, although there was a modest reduction in inventory in Q2 relative to the first quarter. We continue to see strong physician usage of EYLEA, and we have raised our full year net sales forecast to between $1.3 billion and $1.35 billion. Our qualitative market research, which comes from physician-based questionnaires that was conducted in the second quarter, indicates that in terms of eyes treated, EYLEA now represents almost half of the U.S. wet AMD market for approved products, with approved products accounting for more than half of the overall marketplace. As discussed in our first quarter call, due to the recent sequester-related decrease in Medicare reimbursement for Medicare Part B or buy-and-bill drugs such as anti-VEGF agents, our research suggests financial concerns amongst some retinal specialists, which favors the use of off-label bevacizumab. Once again, based on qualitative market research, in the second quarter, approximately 60% of the EYLEA-treated eyes were continuing on EYLEA from previous months. 18% were switches from bevacizumab and ranibizumab, and 21% were new to anti-VEGF treatment highlighting that the pool of patients available for switching is reaching steady-state levels. New patients represented a larger share than switch patients in EYLEA market share for the first time. In our survey, physicians report positive clinical responses to EYLEA that meet or exceed their expectations in 72% of treated eyes. In the majority of the remaining patients, it's too early to assess response to therapy. From the survey, physicians now estimate that wet AMD patients on average achieve a dosing interval of 7.2 weeks for EYLEA, as compared to 5.4 and 5.9 weeks with ranibizumab and bevacizumab, respectively. In the macular edema following CRVO indication, for which EYLEA has received regulatory approval in the United States, our qualitative market research indicates that during the second quarter, EYLEA achieved a 40% share of the approved anti-VEGF products, with approved products accounting for 45% of the overall marketplace. In our survey, physicians reported positive clinical responses to EYLEA in CRVO that meet or exceed their expectations in 69% of treated eyes. Again, in the majority of the remaining patients, it's too early to assess response to therapy. Turning now to our x U.S. EYLEA business, where we split profits 50-50 with Bayer HealthCare, second quarter EYLEA net sales were $96 million. While at the end of the second quarter, EYLEA was available in 29 countries, second quarter sales were primarily from Japan, Australia and Germany. Bayer reports that current market share is 56% in Japan, 48% in Australia and 22% and growing in Germany. Over the course of 2013, we expect Bayer HealthCare to embark on launches in additional countries as regulatory and pricing approvals for EYLEA wet AMD are achieved. More recently, we're pleased with the positive recommendation and reimbursement decision from the U.K.'s NICE, along with a positive statement from The Royal College of Ophthalmologists, in which they said, "The advantage of EYLEA over existing treatment is its longer duration of action in the eyes, which can lead to fewer intraocular injections." In addition, an application for marketing authorization for EYLEA for the treatment of macular edema following CRVO received a positive opinion for approval by the European CHMP. Additional applications in macular edema following CRVO are pending in Japan and other regions. Furthermore, Bayer HealthCare intends to file x U.S. marketing applications for EYLEA in Myopic CMV before year-end. Let's spend a moment to discuss the DME market opportunity if EYLEA is approved for marketing in that indication. In the United States alone, there are 570,000 patients diagnosed with clinically significant diabetic macular edema. Currently, 40% of these patients are treated with an anti-VEGF agent, which continues to grow each quarter since the launch of ranibizumab for that indication in 2012. Moreover, we expect -- we estimate that almost half of the DME patients may have bilateral disease, therefore, the market opportunity for EYLEA DME could be at least as large as the opportunity in wet AMD. Finally, turning to ZALTRAP or ziv-aflibercept, Sanofi reported sales of $19 million for the quarter, which is up 32% from the first quarter of 2013. This growth is driven primarily by growing sales in the first quarter of full launch in Germany and the United Kingdom. We look forward to continued s U.S. rollouts for launch over the course of 2013. With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Murray Goldberg.
Murray A. Goldberg: Thank you, Bob, and good morning. Len and Bob have already provided the highlights of EYLEA sales in the U.S. and the rest of the world. So I'll go directly to the second quarter P&L. Total revenues in the second quarter were $458 million, including U.S. EYLEA net sales of $330 million and ARCALYST net sales of $4 million. Non-GAAP net income was $198 million or $1.73 per diluted share compared to $1.78 per diluted share in the first quarter of this year. The decrease is primarily due to 2 $10 million license payments we made to Sanofi in May that I'll describe later, and royalty expense related to the Genentech license settlement that we entered into also in May. Bayer HealthCare collaboration revenue was $31 million. This includes $19 million from our share of x U.S. profits, including royalties in the case of Japan on total x U.S. EYLEA sales of $96 million. It is also net of the $15 million payment to Bayer HealthCare in the quarter for reimbursement of development expenses that they previously funded. Bayer HealthCare collaboration revenue also includes cost sharing of ongoing EYLEA development expenses, reimbursement of other Regeneron EYLEA expenses and amortization of upfront and milestone payments. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $86 million for the quarter. This includes reimbursement of our R&D expenses for preclinical and clinical development within our antibody collaboration and amortization of payments previously received from Sanofi, less our share of the losses associated with ZALTRAP. ZALTRAP net sales in the second quarter were $19 million compared to $14 million in the first quarter of 2013. ZALTRAP is now approved in 30 countries around the world, and commercialization activities are underway and commercialization and pre-commercialization expenses are being incurred. Our share of ZALTRAP losses in the quarter was $8 million. As we've said before, we do not expect ZALTRAP to be profitable to Regeneron in the near term due to our obligation to repay Sanofi from our 50% share of ZALTRAP profits for 50% of ZALTRAP development expenses that they have funded. At the end of 2012, that repayment obligation was $419 million. Sanofi collaboration revenue in the second quarter was also reduced by 2 one-time $10 million upfront payments that we made to Sanofi relating to the acquisition of full lines to the PDGFR antibody and to the Ang2 antibody in ophthalmology. Non-GAAP cost of goods sold was $27 million in the second quarter compared to $29 million in the first quarter. Included in COGS is our royalty obligation to Genentech related to U.S. sales of EYLEA. As in prior quarters, COGS continued to average less than 10% of product sales. Let me also highlight a new line in our income statement, cost of collaboration manufacturing. Previously, this have been combined with cost of goods sold because it was not very large. Cost of goods sold is the manufacturing costs, including royalties, of goods that we sell and that are included in our net product sales line, namely, U.S. EYLEA and ARCALYST. Cost of collaboration manufacturing is the manufacturing cost, including royalties, that we directly incur related to goods that we manufacture and that are sold by our collaborators, specifically, ZALTRAP and EYLEA outside the United States. This is not the total manufacturing cost of these products since we only provide the bulk material, and our collaborators incur additional costs such as for finishing and packaging. While cost of collaboration manufacturing includes our manufacturing costs for making both material that our collaborators sell, this line item currently consists primarily of royalties that we are obligated to pay, including the Genentech royalty that we pay until around mid-2016 on sales of EYLEA that is manufactured in the United States, but sold outside the United States. Since we just signed the Genentech royalty agreement relating to x U.S. sales this past May, the second quarter cost of collaboration manufacturing also includes some catch-up royalties for EYLEA sales outside the U.S. prior to the second quarter. Going forward for the next couple years, we expect cost of collaboration manufacturing to average around 7% to 8% of total ZALTRAP and x U.S. EYLEA sales. Approximately half of the cost of collaboration manufacturing is reimbursed to us by our collaborators through the collaboration revenue line. Non-GAAP SG&A expense in the second quarter was $56 million compared to $51 million in the first quarter. We are revising our non-GAAP SG&A expense guidance for 2013 to $225 million to $250 million, up from the previously provided range of $215 million to $235 million. Non-GAAP R&D expense for the second quarter was $160 million compared to $154 million in the first quarter. This included unfunded R&D expenses of $46 million compared to $44 million in the first quarter. As a reminder, unfunded R&D is the difference between our total non-GAAP R&D expense, and the amount that is reimbursed by our collaborators. We expect unfunded R&D expenses to increase in the second half of the year for several reasons, including the potential for us to begin to share Phase III costs for alirocumab and the cost of advancing our own unpartnered programs. That said, we are updating our full year 2013 non-GAAP unfunded R&D expense guidance to $225 million to $275 million, down from the prior $275 million to $325 million. As a reminder, non-GAAP SG&A and R&D expenses exclude non-cash share-based compensation expense. As I mentioned, for the second quarter of 2013, we reported non-GAAP net income of $198 million or $1.73 per fully diluted share. Non-GAAP EPS excludes non-cash share-based compensation expense, non-cash interest expense related to our senior convertible notes and non-cash income tax expense, and is based on approximately 115 million fully diluted outstanding shares. A full reconciliation of all the adjustments to GAAP earnings are set out in our earnings release. Turning now to taxes. For GAAP accounting purposes, in the second quarter, we recorded $60 million in income taxes, representing an effective tax rate of just over 41% for the quarter. For the rest of the year, we expect the GAAP tax rate to also be in the low 40% range. As we've stated before, we do not expect to pay significant cash taxes through at least 2014. At the end of the second quarter, we had $711 million in cash and marketable securities and $768 million in trade account receivable primarily related to EYLEA sales for a total of about $1.5 billion. With that, I would now like to turn the call back over to Len.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Thanks, Murray. The second quarter was another exciting quarter at Regeneron with strong EYLEA growth, driven by the continued growth in the United States and the ongoing successful x U.S. launch. New indications for EYLEA continue to build momentum with the diabetic macular edema data and regulatory update highlighting the future opportunities. And of course, our pipeline continues to march forward with the first Phase III data of alirocumab, our LDL lowering antibody, expected later this year. I would now like to turn the call back over to Michael.
Michael Aberman: Thank you, Len. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Our team will be available in our office after the call for follow-up questions. Thank you, and operator, please open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question is from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs.
Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I just had a question on DME. I guess, can you tell us what percent of patients had vision gain in this study? Or can you say if it was at least as good as Lucentis? And then any commentary on current off-label use of EYLEA for DME?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes, on the second, we really don't have any information. We don't promote, and we don't really even track any off-label use of a product. As far as the first one, the investigators want to present the details of the study at the upcoming scientific meetings. I can say that the endpoints like you're talking about, strongly correlate, obviously, with best corrected visual acuity. So the results are strong, and we look forward to presenting them to -- later this year at a medical conference.
Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Can I ask one follow-up?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes, go ahead.
Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: On PCSK9, I noticed you guys are moving to once-a-month schedule now as well which is on par with Amgen. Just what drove the change in your thinking there? Because I know you guys had focused on the every other week for a while, but just curious what data drove that decision.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes. So if you look at the cholesterol-lowering market historically, you can go to many a cocktail party, and some of these say, why take Lipitor, I take Crestor, I take 10 milligrams, I take 20 milligrams. That tends to individualize therapy and titrate therapy in this area. So we thought that since our drug could perform for many patients on an every monthly dosing regimen, we have that data -- it's not new data. It's based on the data we had from our earlier pre-Phase III work. We thought it made sense to include some of that in our Phase III package, so that overall, doctors and patients would have a good choice of regimen and doses and titrate-ability, et cetera. So nothing really new there. Our drug has always been had -- the same PK as we've always had, obviously, and we expect that we should be able to have Q4 week dosing for many of the patients who would be good, but for those who need more, we'll have the Q2 week.
Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And is that the same formulation? You'll be using the same device?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes, we're not going to get into all the details because this is pretty highly competitive, but we think our delivery systems will be a competitive asset. We have a partner who's delivered lots of products. And they deliver more, injected insulin probably than anybody else in the world, as far as I know, and so this is an important part of our program.
Operator: The next question is from Chris Raymond of Robert Baird.
Christopher J. Raymond - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: So I'm kind of intrigued, Bob mentioned an inventory reduction at distributors, is it possible you could maybe give us a little bit more detail around exactly what that in dollar terms that impact was? And I guess, sort of, should we expect to see a benefit or some impact in Q2 -- or, I'm sorry, in Q3?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes, it's hard to predict how the fluctuations will go from quarter-to-quarter even from week-to-week. I think Bob mentioned that in this particular quarter, we still had inventory that was in the 1- to 2-week range with a modest drawdown of inventory. Can't tell how or what our distributors will do so we really can't predict that.
Christopher J. Raymond - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: And okay, and if you're taking follow-ups, can I ask one?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Go ahead. One follow-up. And Michael?
Michael Aberman: Len's a softy.
Leonard S. Schleifer: I'm easy. I'll take as many questions you like. Michael's tough within the limit, but future questions, it's only one. You can get a follow-up.
Christopher J. Raymond - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Just a quick one here. So despite our calculation, it looks like DSOs actually went up slightly, Q1 to Q2. Can you maybe talk a little bit about -- I know you've been talking about titrating down your terms. Can you maybe give us some color on the dynamics there and when we should expect to see that start to move down?
Murray A. Goldberg: Yes, well, the day sales outstanding going up because we have -- the sales have been going up through the quarter. We did adjust the terms down earlier in the year, and that will start to flow through later in the year. The terms are still a bit long so it'll take a while for that to show up but we -- by the end of the year, the day sales should go down for that reason because of the lower terms.
Operator: Yes, the next question is from Steve Byrne of Bank of America.
Steve Byrne - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: So, Bob, if I understood the data you're provided in your market research correctly, it sounds like Avastin's share of wet AMD is less than 50%, and in the balance, Lucentis still has more share than EYLEA. If I heard that correctly, and we assume Avastin was roughly 2/3 of the market 2 years ago, it would suggest you've taken more share from Avastin than Lucentis, and is that what you would have expected, say, 2 years ago? And what do you think is leading to the stickiness of Lucentis?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Right, so good question. Bob will elaborate on it. But the quick response is that I don't think your premise is quite accurate. If you look even at Roche's call, they show their graph of Lucentis uptake in the United States. And when we came to market, that turned down quite significantly, and they mentioned that only because of DME approval did it turn up. So I would say we took market both from the Avastin market as well as from the Lucentis market. Some of the stickiness with Lucentis, obviously, it's a product that's been around for a while so people are using it. They stick on it. The others, they do have a rebate program, which we don't have, which could be, we think, influencing the marketplace quite seriously. So those are the facts. Bob, anything to add on that?
Robert J. Terifay: No, I'll just say that Len is right on. We actually are basically at a 50-50 split with Lucentis right now. We have taken significant share away from them, but we've also been successful in penetrating the Avastin market, and we expect wet AMD to continue to grow in the United States.
Operator: Yes, the next question is from Jim Birchenough of BMO Capital Markets.
Jim Birchenough - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Just a quick 2 part question. Just to follow-up on the prior question, is there anything that you're considering in your own rebate program trying to get into that other 50% of the Lucentis share? It seems like that's a big part of the stickiness, and now that things are starting to stabilize, I'm wondering if you'd consider a rebate program? And on DME, just wondering if the dynamic that's allowed you to file a year ahead of schedule might also allow for a more rapid review, i.e. a Priority Review?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Right, good question and a good way to get around Michael's ban on 2 questions, ask one 2-part question. I'm all for it, Jim. As far as the first question goes, I don't think it'd be appropriate on this call to discuss our commercial strategies and some of the details on what we're going to do. It's a competitive marketplace out there. As far as the acceleration and the potential for priority review, obviously, Priority Review is something that you apply for at the time of your submission. We did that for age-related macular degeneration. We made our case, and we'll make our case again, of course, but that's up to the reviewers at the FDA so it's a little bit -- it's way too early to speculate. As far as the decision to move from the 2-year endpoint to a 1-year endpoint, that is something that came after substantial discussions with the agency. I must say we've been dealing with the agency -- I've been dealing with them for several decades now, and they continue to demonstrate that they are a science-based and evidence-based agency, and that our discussions with them were working through what's the data, what's the science, what's best for patients. I think they had that same goal in mind as we did, and so that's how we arrived at our decision to file a year early.
Operator: Yes, the next question is from Ying Huang of Barclays.
Ying Huang - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Congratulations on the DME data. So Len, can I ask a 3-parter question here?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Ying, it's okay, with me, Michael...
Michael Aberman: Guys, we have a lot of people who want to get through so be really mindful of your colleagues.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes, there you go.
Ying Huang - Barclays Capital, Research Division: So firstly, I want to ask about the safety here. Obviously, you see a lack of imbalance in the arterial events here, but specifically, what about the CV death? And then how much does that lack of safety signal between the 2 different dosing arms play into the decision of FDA allowing you to file based on 1-year data?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Right. So yes, you're asking for some detail on the APTC deaths, if I heard you, Ying. Well, look, looking at deaths was very important, given the safety findings that were found with the other approved anti-VEGF agents to treat DME, and we did not find any dose-dependent increase in deaths with EYLEA in these results, and specifically, the number of APTC-defined deaths where the same in all arms with 2 APTC deaths in each of the study arms, including the laser pulling the data across the 2 studies. So 2, 2 and 2 APTC deaths. So we're very pleased with that, and so we'll see whether or not that gets us any differentiation or not.
Ying Huang - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And then also, can you outline the opportunity for EYLEA in DME here in terms of, obviously, your growth for your franchise in the U.S. market?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Right. So diabetes is a big problem. There's 25 -- no, there's about 25 million people in the United States who have diabetes and maybe 2 million people are going to be diagnosed each year with that. If you're over age 65, you've got about a 25% chance of having diabetes so diabetes itself is a big problem, and there's probably several million or more people who have diabetic retinopathy and somewhere between the 0.5 million and 1 million people who have diabetic macular edema and many of them need treatment in both eyes. So this could be a very significant market opportunity for us, but more importantly, it's a potential for us to bring a new therapy to patients who really have a need. Diabetic-related eye disease is the most common cause of blindness in young people, and diabetic macular edema is the main cause of blindness in diabetics. So we're thrilled that we might be able to bring something to patients as additional choice for this disease. Bob, do you want add anything there?
Robert J. Terifay: No, I think it's a significant growing market opportunity. About 280,000 patients are treated each year with anti-VEGF agent. That keeps growing quarter-over-quarter. And we're very encouraged by the results of our studies, which indicate that patients can be dosed every other month with this disease where compliance is a challenge and many of the people are still in the workplace, and so this may be a new treatment option that's convenient for patients if it does get approved.
Operator: The next question is from Robert Karnauskas of Deutsche Bank.
Alethia Young - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: This is Alethia Young, in for Robyn. I just want to get a little bit more flavor on we're -- looking at the Avastin and the sequester, do you think there's still an opportunity to take share in Avastin beyond the sequester, and kind of can you talk about that U.S. opportunity there?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes, I think the physicians initially did not understand the adjustments to reimbursement that occurred to the sequester so I think there was some confusion over the previous quarter. People are starting to figure out the reimbursement situation, and there's -- the market research indicates there's still an opportunity to take share from Avastin.
Operator: The next question is from Jason Kantor of Crédit Suisse.
Jason Kantor - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Most of my EYLEA questions have been asked, but I just wanted to see, can you give us any idea about what the indications your new drugs that you put into the clinics are going after. And now that the 1 drug fell out of the clinic, can we learn anything about what that was and what your decision process was to take that out of the clinic?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes. So Jason, we don't like to get into the specifics of a very early-stage pipeline because it really doesn't generate much value in the investment community at this point, but it's important for our long-term strategy, and what targets we choose is a fairly competitive area. I can say that the good news about Regeneron is that we have plenty of drug candidates to put into the clinic, to choose from, and plenty in the clinic to keep us fully occupied. So we're able to make decisions if we see something that doesn't look good, doesn't do what we hoped it might, then we'll kill it. And we, of course, would rather kill these things early, which we can do privately and rather than have public funerals when you're in Phase II or Phase III. So I mean, having a big pipeline and a robust research organization, I mean, George Yancopoulos and his team are perhaps the most prolific research organization in the biotechnology industry by many metrics. So we continue to benefit from that, and we hope to continue over the long haul.
Jason Kantor - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Well, if I can't get you to talk about the undisclosed stuff, can you talk about the rationale from moving sarilumab into non-infectious uveitis and what the timing is there?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Well, I can tell you that the rationale is that non-infectious, meaning it's not caused by infection, inflammation of the eye, primarily uvea, is an important disease that we think could be driven by inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin 6, and we've got some data to support that. And we think we've got a clinical trial that is getting underway that will be able to give us a good answer whether that this is a good area. Remember, uveitis is one of those diseases that you do see -- occasionally, you see it in children, in syndromes associated with rheumatoid arthritis, without it, it could be autoimmune. So there's a pretty good rationale and other data that we have on this.
Operator: The next question is from Adnan Butt of RBC Capital Markets.
Adnan S. Butt - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: And since I like Michael, I will ask one question, but I'll make it a pointed one. So for alirocumab, do you expect less variability in this every 4-week trial and is that enough to get it added to the label or will you need more?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes, I think that, obviously, we're doing the study as we hope that this will be sufficient to get us to the label. There are lots of ways to look at success in treating patients with cholesterol. The endpoint, the area under the curve, how many patients hit their goal, and I think that this is -- this isn't a disease where you have to get it right immediately. It's not like you're treating an acute myocardial infarction, where if you mess up, it's an enormously bad consequences to a patient. Here, you want to get it right, and doctors want to make sure they get the right and the most convenient and the most compliant doses. So I think our strategy's a good one here.
Robert J. Terifay: But Len, there is one thing. We are not abandoning every 2-week dosing regimen. The research shows that every 2 weeks is right now favored by patients and physicians. It's not seen as inconvenient. We just wanted to offer another treatment option with the monthly dosing.
Operator: Yes, the next question mission is from Huron Weber of Citi.
Kumaraguru Raja: This is Kumar, in for Huron. So what is the status of the FDA clinical hold on the anti-NGF antibody? And once the hold is lifted, what are the next steps?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Right. So the only thing we can say at this point is that Pfizer's had a conversation with the FDA that they relayed to the public on their call that suggested after they finish completing some preclinical data, they'll be able to come off clinical hold, and they expect to be in the Phase III program some time, I think, in the first part of next year. We don't have any specific information. We are still on clinical hold at this time, but obviously, we'll keep you advised and how discussions go and what progress we're making in that area.
Operator: Yes, the next question is from Josh Schimmer of Lazard Capital Markets.
Joshua Schimmer - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: For EYLEA in DME, maybe you can discuss reasons to expect either the same or different levels switching from Avastin and Lucentis to EYLEA as compared what you've experienced in the AMD setting?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Well, it's obviously hard to predict. We do hear that patients are not always satisfied with their current treatments. We did have anti-VEGF experienced patients in our trials so we know that you can safely switch, at least, that's what the data to us shows. Obviously, we have to submit all those to the agency, but I imagine that there'll be a pent-up demand for that as well. I think you saw that the launch of Lucentis in DME, notwithstanding the fact that Avastin was treating people, there was very brisk uptake it seemed there based on what you can glean from the Genentech close information. Still, I'm optimistic about that. Bob?
Robert J. Terifay: There are patients, including in our trial, that were not doing well on other therapies that were switched, and seem to have done well, and so I think there will be a marketplace for us when we launch.
Joshua Schimmer - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Is that unmet need comparable between DME and AMD...
Robert J. Terifay: I think it's too early to speculate on that.
Operator: The next question is from John Newman of JMP Securities.
John L. Newman - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division: Most of my questions have been answered, but I just wanted to ask, are you still maintaining the same timing in terms of when you will put your PDGF antibody into the clinic?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes, guidance hasn't changed on that. We hope to get, I think, later this year going on the eye studies with either the Ang2 and/or the PDGF this year.
Operator: The next question is from Matthew Harrison of UBS.
Matthew Harrison - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about compounding and if you're seeing any share shift related to Avastin there, and then maybe your opinion on the bills that are in Congress right now and their potential impact.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes, so there's really -- there's no obvious sea change with people who have massively left Avastin to go to either Lucentis or EYLEA. The -- it seems like the based on surveys, the market share for Avastin has somewhat stabilized at around half the market. As far as predicting what this Congress will do, it's extremely difficult. There are many bills out there, the Senate health bill, there's some House bills. We believe it's been our position that at the end of the day, patients can have a choice. Doctors can have a choice. They should have choices, but there shouldn't be a hidden choice in choosing one product which has a higher quality than another. And that we believe that -- so therefore, all products sold should meet the same FDA-mandated standards in terms of quality. Beyond that, and we hope that that's what the legislation will advance, and that's been our position on this both publicly and in discussions we've had in Washington. So just to state it succinctly, we believe in choice. We have no problem with patients choosing Avastin, choosing Lucentis, choosing EYLEA, but we believe in a single standard so that patients don't have to worry about quality of the product they choose.
Operator: Next question is from Geoff Meacham of JPMorgan.
Anupam Rama - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: This is Anupam Rama, in for Geoff Meacham. I think you mentioned that the dosing interval was 7.2 weeks for EYLEA. Just wondering if you could help us put that into context of what you've been seeing over the last several quarters and how that's impacted sort of quarter-over-quarter growth that you're seeing in the U.S. and what you expect the dosing interval will sort of may trend in the future.
Robert J. Terifay: So we have 2 groups of patients that are treated with EYLEA. One group of patients who were recalcitrant to previous anti-VEGF therapy, those patients are generally started off with the monthly dosing regimen and then the physicians extend the treatment interval over time, hoping to get good efficacy with the reasonable interval. The other group are those patients who were new to the therapy. Patients new to therapy generally are getting dosed closer to the every 8-week language that is in our prescribing information. The 7.2 is very encouraging in that the switch patients seem to be getting out further in the dosing interval week. We started with an interval that was about 6 weeks so we're up 7.2 now. I think you'll see in AMD that, that interval probably will stay in the 7.2- to 8-week range. So obviously, as we've stated all along, as the dosing interval increases, the number of doses per quarter do decline so we're dependent upon getting new patients into the marketplace, and that's where our success have been in this quarter.
Operator: The next question is from Joseph Schwartz of Leerink Swann.
Joseph P. Schwartz - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division: I was wondering, do you expect your PDGF antibody to have any advantages over first-generation agents in terms of things like binding affinity or hitting more receptor subunits? Anything that can compete on use basis similar to what's driven your and Lucentis' strength versus the first-generation anti-VEGFs?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Well, I think we just have a more -- important task first is to establish whether or not anti-PDGF at all works in this setting before we decide which is the best agent. So far, there's been 1 large Phase II trial. But even in our trials, our large Phase III trials, you see several other differences that you can see early on. In trials, you see this all the time. That is you see random fluctuations. In our trial, it's interesting. We were asked about deaths, we saw 2 deaths, APTC and everything. And then in low -- 1 study, 1 low-dose group had 2 cancers, and in another adverse event, they had more of something else, and so you see these differences. And in our study, you'll see when the data comes out, the slight difference between the monthly in one study and the every other month was probably just a difference in the groups because were they were different almost from the beginning before they switched every other month. So what I'm trying to say is that job #1 is to do another robust study and see if PDGF really works. If PDGF really works, then I think the advantage that we'll have is that we hope to be able to combine it in a single syringe so it's one shot. So that's a big difference in having to give 2 shots, in our view, but still a long way to go between whether or not this is actually going to make a difference in patients.
Operator: The next question is from Biren Amin of Jefferies.
Biren Amin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: I guess just from the regulatory filing in the U.S., will FDA be requiring a 2-year update on efficacy and safety from VIVID VISTA?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Well, I don't know. We don't know what they'll require at the end of the day. What we do know is that based on discussions, we think that the 1-year data that we have from these 2 trials will be adequate for them to review our application, and hopefully we'll be able to get it approved. So I think we're intending to keep the studies going, but right now, we're expecting to submit based on the 1-year data and that we hope that, that would be sufficient, based on our discussions, for an approval...
Biren Amin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: I was going to say if I could have a follow-up, what do think are the implications of the DRCR protocol eye trial in DME?
Leonard S. Schleifer: I forgot which one eye is, but eye is the one which has early laser versus late laser. Is that the one you're referring to? I don't know them by number.
Biren Amin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: No, that's one that's comparing all 3 anti-VEGFs...
Leonard S. Schleifer: Right. Well, look, the DRCR has been an extremely good network that's done very high quality work. We work with them. That study has an interesting design to it. It is a head-to-head study that compares Avastin, Lucentis and EYLEA. But given by a regimen that probably will stress the molecules a little bit, all of them, because it's a PRN-based regimen rather than a fixed-dosing interval, so it should be interesting to see whether there are differences in the number of doses or the actual letters gained, and there's nothing like a head-to-head trial to sort that out. We hear that, that trials moving nicely, and we look forward to the results down the road.
Operator: Okay, and the last question comes from Phil Nadeau of Cowen and Company.
Philip Nadeau - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Bob, a question for you the DME market. In the past, we've asked physicians the number of injections for DME they give compared to the number of VEGF injectors they give for wet AMD. We get a really wide range of answers, but the median answer is like 1 DME injection for every 5 wet AMD injections. I'm curious whether in your market research, you've asked the question that way and what data you get for that question?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Phil, we read your notes. I think one of your notes was that -- says that surveys aren't worth looking at. So [indiscernible] even though, you do the men Bob does them, I'm not a big survey guy in terms of how accurate they reflect what doctors say they do versus what they're actually doing. So I think what we're going to -- I just have to wait and try and count up these injections and see what we get. I think the notion that you can treat and you're finished with diabetic macular edema is just not correct, and we just see that in all of our trials. And I think that, that may be wishful thinking out there, but we'll have to see when all the data comes up, but I wouldn't -- I would follow your own advice. I wouldn't pay that much attention to the surveys.
Philip Nadeau - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: I pay attention to Bob's survey.
Robert J. Terifay: All right. So let's go to the science instead of surveys. I would say that DME is much more VEGF-driven than AMD, and so theoretically, you would need more drug to adequately manage DME. I think that's the educational thing that has to be done, is defining the adequate management of DME.
Michael Aberman: Thank you, everybody, for joining us on the call today. Again, Manisha and I are going to be available to make a call. It's probably easiest if you want a follow-up call to shoot myself an email at michael.aberman@regeneron.com or Manisha, which you can find on the press release, and we'll get back to you as soon as we can. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals conference call to discuss the first quarter 2013 financial results. My name is Kevin, and I'll be your coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Michael Aberman, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations for Regeneron. Please proceed, Dr. Aberman.
Michael Aberman: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' First Quarter 2013 Conference Call. An archive of this webcast will be available on our website under Events and Presentations for 30 days. Joining me on the call today is Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; Dr. George Yancopoulos, Founding Scientist, President of Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer; Murray Goldberg, Chief Financial Officer; and Robert Terifay, Senior Vice President, Commercial. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call for a question-and-answer period. I'd also like to remind you that remarks made on this call that are not historical in nature may be forward-looking statements about Regeneron and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual events and our actual results may differ materially. Such remarks may include but are not limited to those related to Regeneron and its products and business, sales and expense forecast, financial forecast, development programs, collaborations, finances, regulatory matters, intellectual property and competition, all of which involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A more complete description of these and other material risks can be found in Regeneron's filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, including its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, and Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2013, which we expect to file with the SEC later today. Regeneron does not undertake any obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless required by law. GAAP and non-GAAP measures will be discussed on today's call. Information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP are available in our financial results press release, which can be accessed on our website. Once our call concludes, the IR team will be available to answer further questions. With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate the opportunity to review the results of the first quarter and also provide our outlook for the rest of the year. Before we get started, however, it feels as though we need to pause and catch our breath. This has not only been quite a year for Regeneron, but quite a week as well. Just in the last few days, we became a newly minted member of the S&P 500 Index; a potential competitor to our EYLEA franchise had a significant setback; we acquired full rights to 2 important pipeline assets to support our goal of expanding and protecting our EYLEA franchise in retinal diseases; we reported strong quarterly results; and our stock price and market capitalization both hit all-time highs. Having paused to recognize the recent milestones, it's also appropriate to remember that the fundamental mission of Regeneron is to use innovative science and technology to bring important new medicines to patients in need. Now before we get into some additional details of this quarter, which will be provided by George, Bob and Murray, it is worth taking a broader perspective of Regeneron as that may help you to better understand why we are so excited about our future prospects. We think of Regeneron in terms of 3 critical aspects of our enterprise: one, our growing global EYLEA franchise; two, our unique business model based upon highly leveraged partnerships; and three, our extraordinarily productive research and development capabilities and associated pipeline that serves as the foundation for everything we accomplish at Regeneron. I would like to briefly highlight some important aspects of each of these 3 critical pillars of Regeneron. First, our global EYLEA franchise represents a strong growth opportunity for Regeneron. We are 18 months into our commercialization of EYLEA in the United States, and we can proudly say that U.S. EYLEA launch is among the most successful in the history of the biopharmaceutical industry. This quarter, we reported U.S. net sales of $314 million, which represented more than a 150% increase from the first quarter of last year and approximately a 14% increase from the prior quarter. As a result, we are increasing our guidance for 2013 U.S. EYLEA net sales to $1.25 billion to $1.325 billion. While there continue to be some headwinds in terms of near-term growth in U.S. EYLEA sales, such as the slight reduction in reimbursement that Medicare provides because of the sequester and a growing percentage of sales coming from existing patients who move to less-frequent dosing, we see several significant growth opportunities for EYLEA in the U.S. and the rest of the world. First, it appears that the market for anti-VEGF therapy in diabetic macular edema, or DME, is large, based upon the initial success of ranibizumab or Lucentis in this indication. We are expecting our first Phase III data later this year in DME, and we are hoping to file for approval in the U.S. in 2014. If we obtain approval, we would expect that EYLEA penetration into the DME market could provide a substantial source of growth in the U.S. Second, the launch of EYLEA outside of the U.S. by our 50-50 partner Bayer HealthCare is going extremely well. First quarter net sales of EYLEA, as announced by Bayer HealthCare, were approximately $65 million, bringing total global EYLEA sales to $379 million in this quarter. Putting this into the context of the overall current market opportunity, the combined global sales of EYLEA and ranibizumab or Lucentis in the first quarter of 2013 totaled approximately $1.4 billion. EYLEA represented only about 27% of the global dollar sales of branded intravitreal anti-VEGF treatments. So we believe EYLEA, over time, has significant room to grow, particularly outside of the U.S., where EYLEA has only about 10% of the total sales reported for ranibizumab and EYLEA combined. X-U.S. sales are already contributing to our bottom line. Our share of the profits from x-U.S. sales was approximately $19 million. After our repayment of $13 million in development expenses initially funded by Bayer HealthCare, we recognized $6 million of profits from x-U.S. EYLEA sales that flowed directly to our earnings. And we expect significant growth of these sales as Bayer HealthCare launches in additional countries outside of the United States. We expect our quarterly repayment obligation to Bayer HealthCare to remain relatively flat for the rest of the year at approximately $13 million. Therefore, as sales and profits hopefully grow outside the U.S., a greater proportion of those profits will flow to our bottom line. Outside the United States, EYLEA is only marketed for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration, or AMD. So additional potential indications such as macular edema following central retinal vein occlusion, or CRVO, and DME, diabetic macular edema, represent additional opportunities for growth of our x-U.S. EYLEA franchise. Finally, as you are aware, there's substantial discussion in Congress about the regulation of compounding pharmacies. Given that compounded Avastin represents nearly 50% of the unit volume in the United States, the possibility exists for substantial expansion of the branded intravitreal market for anti-VEGF therapies should any structural change to the compounding industry result from any new potential legislation or regulations. Regeneron's position on the compounding situation is that we are in favor of patient choice and the fact that retinal specialists have multiple choices to treat their patients. Yet while we support multiple choices, we believe that all those who manufacture or compound intravitreal therapies should be held to a single safety and quality standard and follow good manufacturing practices. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that any legislation will be passed that will change the market dynamics regarding intravitreal anti-VEGF therapies. And to be clear, our updated U.S. net sales forecast does not include any potential structural change in the marketplace that may or may not occur related to the ongoing debate about compounding pharmacies. Now let's turn to the second pillar supporting Regeneron's business, our important collaborations with both Sanofi and Bayer HealthCare. Our collaboration with Sanofi is broad-based and provide us with the capital we needed to invest in our antibody pipeline at a time when we did not have ready access to those resources. As a result, we were able to invest in and develop the strong pipeline that we have today. I would like to add and emphasize that it's not just the capital that we enjoy from Sanofi, rather we value the expertise and commercial reach that Sanofi offers for our partnered programs. Our Bayer HealthCare collaboration also provided capital and development expertise that enabled us to jointly conduct a large EYLEA development program. And now they are proving to be an excellent commercial partner outside the United States. This unique business model allows a greater proportion of our revenue to fall to the bottom line while still advancing a robust pipeline of 13 different clinical programs, including 3 Phase III assets. This quarter, for example, we reported non-GAAP net income of $201 million or $1.78 per diluted share. This translates into 21% non-GAAP earnings per share growth from the fourth quarter of 2012 and almost a fivefold increase compared to the first quarter of last year. As a reminder, non-GAAP net income excludes noncash compensation expense, noncash interest expense and noncash income taxes, which Murray will discuss in further detail. Finally, the fundamental foundation to our entire business is our industry-leading innovative technologies and discovery and development capabilities. Led by George Yancopoulos, my partner at Regeneron since we first opened our labs 25 years ago, Regeneron has built a suite of technologies that has given us a robust pipeline of antibody drug candidates. This includes 3 late-stage with large potential market opportunities, including alirocumab, our PCSK9 inhibitor in a large global Phase III program for treating elevated cholesterol and cardiovascular disease; sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody in a large Phase III program for rheumatoid arthritis; and dupilumab, our IL-4 receptor antibody that will be advancing into Phase IIb testing for allergic asthma and atopic dermatitis later in the year. And innovation keeps on coming. We are equally excited about our earlier-stage pipeline and our novel technologies that we believe have the potential to become the foundation of our future growth. Now let me turn the call over to George Yancopoulos, Regeneron's Chief Scientific Officer, to discuss our pipeline progress in greater detail. George will be followed by Bob Terifay, Senior Vice President of Commercial, who will elaborate on our commercial activities. And finally, Murray Goldberg, our Chief Financial Officer, will discuss our financial performance during the first quarter of this year. George?
George D. Yancopoulos: Thanks, Len, and good morning to everyone. The first quarter of 2013 continued to be a busy time for the research and development teams at Regeneron. Let me begin with EYLEA, which is now approved for 2 indications in the United States, wet AMD and macular edema following CRVO. As you just heard from Len, our partner, Bayer HealthCare, expects to continue filing and receiving x-U.S. approvals for EYLEA in both of these indications in a growing list of countries. A Phase III trial of EYLEA in patients with macular edema following branch retinal vein occlusion, or BRVO, is fully enrolled, as are 2 Phase III trials in DME. We and Bayer HealthCare expect top line 1-year results from the x-U.S. DME trial before year-end. As a reminder, outside the United States, DME approvals have been based on 1-year data, in contrast to the United States, which has required 2-year efficacy data. Our third Phase III trial in DME was initiated early this year in Russia and Asia and is enrolling patients. We and Bayer HealthCare expect to report top line data from our Phase III study in EYLEA in myopic choroidal neovascularization, or mCNV, in the next few months, which could form the basis of regulatory filings outside of the United States. Turning to our Phase III antibody pipeline and starting with, alirocumab, our PCSK9 antibody, which is in clinical development for lowering LDL cholesterol. Our broad Phase III ODYSSEY program is ongoing. And as previously announced, we expect top line results from the first Phase III trial, ODYSSEY MONO, in the third quarter 2013. As a reminder, the ODYSSEY MONO trial is comparing alirocumab monotherapy to ezetimibe in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Data for the majority of the Phase III trials for alirocumab, excluding the ODYSSEY outcomes trial, are expected in 2014. Our Phase III program with sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor inhibitor, is moving along as expected. The mobility Phase III trial in patients who have failed disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, or DMARD, therapy, is fully enrolled and we expect top line data in early 2014. We, along with Sanofi, have also initiated the Phase III target trial, which will evaluate the combination of sarilumab and DMARDs with rheumatoid arthritis patients who are not responsive to or are intolerant of TNF-alpha therapies. This study is intended to establish the utility of sarilumab in TNF-alpha inhibitor failures. Additional Phase III trials for sarilumab are planned to start this quarter. Beyond these Phase III programs, our Phase II pipeline is also advancing. We now have positive data in 2 indications for our IL-4 receptor antibody, dupilumab, formerly known as REGN668. In March, we presented positive data from 2 proof of concept studies of dupilumab in atopic dermatitis at the Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology. Later this month, we will be presenting data at a late breaking session of the Annual Meeting of the American Thoracic Society from a Phase IIa study of dupilumab in patients with moderate to severe persistent asthma with elevated eosinophils. We expect to initiate Phase IIb studies in both these indications later this year. In addition to these later-stage programs, we have 7 other antibodies in Phase I, along with several other exciting antibody programs that are in earlier stages of development. I would like to spend a few minutes on 2 of these earlier-stage antibody programs. As Len mentioned briefly, we have now acquired from Sanofi full rights to our PDGF receptor antibody and our ANG2 antibody for ophthalmology. Both of these pathways play an important role in angiogenesis, and their blockade could potentially add to the clinical benefit seen with anti-VEGF therapy. We expect to submit an IND for a combination trial of our PDGF receptor antibody in EYLEA in the second half of the year. We also expect to submit an IND to develop our ANG2 antibody in the ophthalmic setting later this year. As a reminder, the ANG2 antibody is already in clinical development in oncology in combination with ZALTRAP as part of our Sanofi collaboration. While we will not be providing additional details on these earlier-stage assets at the moment, it's a testament to the power of our research and development expertise to have these 2 programs advancing. It also highlights our commitment to maintain a leadership position in the field of retinal diseases, particularly VEGF-mediated diseases like wet AMD and DME. Finally, I'd like to note that we are excited about some of our emerging new technologies that we hope will soon yield clinical candidates, including bispecific antibodies, longer-acting antibody technologies and antibody-drug conjugates. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Bob to provide an update on the EYLEA launch and market dynamics.
Robert J. Terifay: Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. The EYLEA franchise is not only doing very well but is also well positioned for continued growth, both in the United States and outside the United States. In the first quarter, we continued to witness strength in the uptake of EYLEA in the U.S. wet AMD market, both in terms of patients new to anti-VEGF therapy, as well as those switching from bevacizumab or ranibizumab. As a reminder, we received a permanent J code effective January 1 of this year. Our qualitative market research, which comes from position-based questionnaires and was conducted in the first quarter, indicates that in terms of eyes treated, EYLEA now represents 24% of the U.S. wet AMD market, ranibizumab represents 30%, and bevacizumab represents 46% of the market. This suggests that EYLEA hold a 44% share of the on-label wet AMD market. In the first quarter, 59% of EYLEA-treated eyes were eyes continuing on EYLEA from previous months, 25% were switches from bevacizumab and ranibizumab, and 16% were new to anti-VEGF treatment. Drilling down further, these market research data show that EYLEA, in the first quarter in 2013, garnered 24% of wet AMD eyes which were new to therapy, and 58% of eyes which were switched from previous therapies. Of these switches, 55% were from bevacizumab, and 45% were from ranibizumab. In our survey, physicians report positive clinical responses to EYLEA that meet or exceed their expectations in 70% of treated eyes. In a majority of the remaining patients, it's too early to assess response to therapy. Physicians now estimate that wet AMD, on average, patients -- wet AMD patients, on average, receive 7.5 doses of EYLEA in their first year of therapy, including 3 initial monthly doses, and 5.4 doses in the second year of therapy. In macular edema following CRVO, the second indication for which EYLEA has received approval in the United States, our qualitative market research indicates that during the first quarter, we now have a 21% share of treated eyes. As you've heard, we've updated our EYLEA U.S. net sales forecast to $1.25 billion to $1.325 billion for the year. While we had 14% growth in these sales in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter last year, we expect to see a slower rate of growth for the remainder of the year, as a greater portion of our sales are now coming from existing patients and many of these patients are moving to less-frequent dosing. Lastly, we've recently started to see an impact from the sequester funding cuts on some retinal practices. Specifically, under the sequester, payments for Medicare Part B drugs such as EYLEA were reduced from 106% of the average selling price to 104.3%. This reduction has led some practices to reduce their use of FDA-approved anti-VEGF therapies for retinal diseases. Turning now to the x-U.S. portion of our EYLEA franchise, where we split profits 50-50 with Bayer HealthCare, first quarter net sales were $65 million. While by the end of March, EYLEA was available in over 15 countries, first quarter sales were primarily from Japan and Australia, where Bayer reported market shares of 48% and 42%, respectively. Over the course of 2013, we expect Bayer to embark on launches in additional countries as regulatory and pricing approvals for EYLEA in wet AMD are achieved. In addition, applications for marketing authorization for EYLEA for the treatment of macular edema following CRVO are pending in Europe, Japan and other regions. Bayer has estimated peak sales of EYLEA outside of the United States of EUR 1 billion if approved in the expected indications of wet AMD, CRVO, DME and Myopic CNV. Turning to ZALTRAP or ziv-aflibercept. Sanofi reported sales of $14 million for the quarter, which is down from the fourth quarter of 2012. This decline is largely related to a 50% reduction in the effective net sales price in the United States effective November of 2012. Now that ZALTRAP has been approved in the EU, we look forward to continued x-U.S. launch rollouts over the course of 2013. With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Murray Goldberg.
Murray A. Goldberg: Thank you, Bob, and good morning. I'm very pleased to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of 2013. As you heard from Len earlier on the call, the first quarter of 2013 was another strong quarter, with total revenue of $440 million and non-GAAP net income of $201 million or $1.78 per diluted share compared to $1.47 per share in the fourth quarter last year. The increase in our earnings was primarily driven by strong EYLEA sales performance in the United States. We are also pleased that sales of EYLEA outside the U.S. contributed to our bottom line for the first time. Outside the U.S., we are entitled to 50% of profits on EYLEA sales, except for Japan, where we receive a royalty on sales. As you heard, we reported $314 million in net U.S. EYLEA sales, and Bayer HealthCare reported net x-U.S. EYLEA sales of $65 million for the quarter. For the full year, we now forecast net U.S. sales of $1.25 billion to $1.325 billion. EYLEA inventory levels in the U.S. continue to equal about 1 to 2 weeks of sales. ARCALYST, or rilonacept, net sales in the first quarter were $5 million, similar to sales in prior quarters. Turning to collaboration revenue. Bayer HealthCare collaboration revenue was $15 million for the first quarter. Included in this line are a net profit of $6 million from x-U.S. EYLEA sales after repaying $13 million of development expenses that Bayer HealthCare has previously funded, amortization of upfront and milestone payments and cost sharing of current EYLEA development expenses. All of these will be detailed in our 10-Q that we expect to file later today. Sanofi collaboration revenue was $99 million for the first quarter. This includes reimbursement of our R&D expenses for preclinical and clinical research within our antibody collaboration, amortization of upfront payments and our share of the loss associated with the ongoing launch of ZALTRAP. In the first quarter, Sanofi recorded $14 million of ZALTRAP net sales, and we recognized a net loss of $8 million from ZALTRAP, as we and Sanofi prepared for commercialization in the European Union and other countries. As we have said before, we do not expect a meaningful positive contribution from the commercialization of ZALTRAP in the near term because of our obligation to repay Sanofi from our share of ZALTRAP profits for 50% of the ZALTRAP development expenses that they have funded. Non-GAAP cost of goods sold was $29 million for the first quarter, including royalty expense to Genentech relating to U.S. EYLEA sales. COGS continue to average less than 10% of product sales. Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expense for the first quarter was $51 million. We reiterate our guidance for non-GAAP SG&A expense in 2013 of $215 million to $235 million. Non-GAAP R&D expense for the first quarter was $154 million. This includes unfunded R&D expenses of $44 million compared to $48 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. Unfunded R&D is calculated as the difference between our total R&D expense and the amount that is reimbursed by our collaborators. As we said on our February conference call, we expect unfunded R&D expense to increase in 2013 compared to 2012 for several reasons: increased spending on EYLEA clinical programs, including the Phase III trials in DME and macular edema following BRVO; advancing unpartnered antibody programs through to the proof of concept stage; and increased spending on early-stage technologies, such as antibody-drug conjugates, bispecific antibodies and longer-acting antibody technologies. In addition, if the initial Phase III data for alirocumab are positive later this year, it would trigger the real-time sharing of 20% of subsequent Phase III development expenses for the ODYSSEY program. Given the timing of these R&D expenses, we expect the impact on unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense to be weighted more heavily towards the second half of the year. In addition, we anticipate that, as in 2012, full year discovery preclinical spending under the Sanofi antibody agreement is likely to exceed the amount that Sanofi is obligated to reimburse. Like last year, due to the timing of the reimbursement for discovery research, the difference will fall primarily in the fourth quarter. Our full year 2013 guidance for non-GAAP unfunded R&D remains at $275 million to $325 million. This guidance includes the $20 million in upfront payments that we will pay to Sanofi later this month in connection with our recently announced acquisition of the full rights to antibodies, the PDGFR and ANG2 in ophthalmology. This increase in unfunded R&D spending over the balance of the year will, therefore, impact our quarter results. As a reminder, non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses exclude noncash share-based compensation expense. Turning to the bottom line. We reported non-GAAP net income of $201 million or $1.78 per fully diluted share for the first quarter. This non-GAAP EPS excludes noncash share-based compensation expense, noncash interest expense related to our senior convertible notes and noncash income tax expense and is based on about 114 million non-GAAP fully diluted shares. A full reconciliation of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings are set out in our earnings release. For GAAP purposes, in the first quarter of 2013, we recorded a $43 million income tax expense, representing about a 30% effective tax rate. Because of the timing of passage of the American Taxpayer Relief Act in January 2013, we recognized the full benefit of our 2012 federal research tax credits in the first quarter of 2013. This lowered our effective tax rate for the quarter to about 30%. For the remainder of 2013, we expect a GAAP effective tax rate of about 40-plus percent. However, we do not currently expect to pay any significant cash income taxes through at least 2014. Moreover, as sales of our products and our operations grow outside the United States, we anticipate that our GAAP tax rate will start to decline in a few years. With that, I'll turn the call back to Len.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Thank you, Murray, Bob, George and the rest of the team. We are proud of what we have accomplished so far this year but also recognize that we must keep innovating. With that goal in mind, we will continue to invest in our R&D and our technologies and strive to deliver on our pipeline. We look forward to upcoming commercial, regulatory and clinical milestones in the remainder of this year. Thank you all for joining us this morning. And with that, let me turn the call back to Michael.
Michael Aberman: Thank you, Len. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Our team will be available in our office after the call for follow-up questions. Thank you. And operator, if you could please open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jim Birchenough with BMO Capital.
Jim Birchenough - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Question on the opportunity around potential penetration of the Avastin base. Is there any way you can quantify the number of physicians you'd characterize as Avastin prescribers, what the pace of conversion has been? Maybe describe what you're seeing in terms of any disruption on the increased scrutiny? And if you have any insights into how this legislation or draft legislation might proceed, that would be helpful.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Let me address -- this is Len. Let me address the legislation part first, and then I'll turn the market dynamic question over to Bob. In terms of legislation, all we know, thus far, is that there's been a lot of interest in this area for the obvious reason that many Americans were killed and thousands were put at risk from the problems at compounding pharmacies. And this catastrophe has certainly caught the attention of the FDA and people in Congress. We know recently that the Senate Health Committee seemed to draft a bipartisan bill that will, I'm sure, be marked up and changed, et cetera. But as it stands now, it would seek to regulate compounding pharmacies, including those who would repackage sterile products such as Avastin for distribution around the country to be used in injections. And as I said during my prepared remarks, we feel strongly that choice is fine, multiple choices are good for patients and doctors, but there should only be one standard -- one quality standard for a drug that's going to be injected in a high-risk area like the back of the eye. And that standard should be regulated under GMP, we believe, by the FDA. Bob, any comment? Are you seeing anything on the market dynamics?
Robert J. Terifay: Yes. So in terms of the compounding legislation and its impact on physician prescribing, so far, it has had very little impact on physicians moving away from Avastin. That said, we have seen the market shifting away from Avastin towards the branded products since the launch of EYLEA. And on average, we see about 10 to 12 accounts -- new accounts that come to EYLEA each week that are generally smaller accounts that were using Avastin, were not using Lucentis and now have -- our sales representatives have been working with them, helping them figure out how to deal with the distribution and the carrying costs, et cetera. And so we are seeing an increase in our penetration of the Avastin market, but it is not related to the compounding.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.
Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I guess, first, could you comment a little bit about your announcement today about working on a deal with Sanofi on PDGF and ANG2? And I was just trying to think about, what are your thoughts on potential uses? Are you starting to combine it, create the combined formulation with EYLEA? And then for the EU market, would you have to work out an agreement with Bayer, and how would that occur? What would be the timeline for that occurring?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Thanks for the question, Robyn. Let me just deal with some of the deal-related questions. Both of these antibodies were discoveries that came out of our labs, but they were partnered with, part of our Sanofi relationship. I think Sanofi and Regeneron got together and thought that it made sense, given our EYLEA franchise and the potential of combining these drugs with EYLEA, that we would be able to regain sole rights to those programs for use in ophthalmology. Under our deal that we did with Sanofi, we have the right to partner with anybody, and that would include our partner Bayer, and we don't have anything further to say about that at this time. Now as far as the technical reasons why you want to study these molecules and how you study them, George, do you want to comment on that?
George D. Yancopoulos: Well, there's a lot of very interesting biology behind the notion of combining either of these pathways with anti-VEGF pathways, particularly in the eye and for uses in the eye. And we're very excited about having the ability now to have not only potential best-in-class anti-VEGF therapy but also potential best-in-class anti-PDGF and anti-ANG2 therapies, which we can explore both on their own and also in combination and, if need be, in a rather favorable situation, of being able to combine them in a single formulation. So we're excited about the opportunity. It still is, obviously, early days, but there's a lot of interesting biology here.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Raymond with Robert Baird.
Christopher J. Raymond - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Just kind of curious if you could expand on your comments on the sequester-related sort of headwinds. It seems this dynamic might favor Avastin over the branded therapies. But given the less frequent dosing interval for EYLEA, that should be an advantage for you guys. So maybe some crosswinds, perhaps, there? I wonder if you could maybe describe a little bit more about -- is it really all just something that favors Avastin? Or is there maybe an advantage with respect to EYLEA and Lucentis that you're seeing?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes. I mean, it's a little bit early to really predict this. I think it's difficult. Bob might want to comment about what some individual practices have done, but big trends, we can't speak to yet. Bob?
Robert J. Terifay: Many of the practices feel that they're working on a fairly thin margin in terms of their office staff that has to handle the products, the receivables, et cetera. And so that's really where the concern is, that they're just not making sufficient enough money to cover the costs of using the branded agents. So I think, largely, right now, the physicians are seeing the sequestration as something that will lead to them thinking more about using Avastin.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adnan Butt with RBC Capital Markets.
Adnan S. Butt - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Congrats on the forward-thinking Sanofi deal. On the combination of EYLEA and PDGF, what leads the company to believe that those 2 can be combined together? Is the ANG2 a combination as well? And then for long-acting antibodies, is there anything being thought about for EYLEA to extend its interval? Or is that for future products?
Leonard S. Schleifer: So I don't think we have a comment about EYLEA specifically, but George can comment, and I didn't know whether the question was whether -- what the rationale for combination overall or combination specifically into a single syringe. But maybe he could address the rationale for both. George?
George D. Yancopoulos: Well, as we all know, there's multiple ways that blood vessels can be triggered, can be activated, can be made to leak, can be made to grow. And certainly, there's a lot of preclinical science that implicates the PDGF pathway and the ANG2 pathways in these processes. So I think it's a very attractive position to have these combination capabilities. And certainly, because the proteins that we were talking about combining can be combined, and we have actually done it in preliminary formulation studies, the opportunity is there to combine them into a single formulation to be delivered simultaneously if the science supports that possibility.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America.
Steve Byrne - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Does Bayer need your DME data in the U.S. for them to file in Europe? It would seem that we're coming close to the 1 year anniversary for their trial being fully enrolled, whereas your second year anniversary might be early 2014. Do they need to wait for your data to file?
George D. Yancopoulos: Historically, the EMA has approved Lucentis based on the results of one 1-year study. So it is possible that, based upon the first year of the Bayer study, they may be able to file. But they have not announced anything about their filing plans.
Leonard S. Schleifer: And we'll have that data later this year. And you're correct in terms of the timing, Steve.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Kantor with Crédit Suisse.
Jason Kantor - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I wanted to skip over to dupilumab and just ask how you plan to start Phase IIb trials this year. Can you give us some idea of what those trials might look like, and as well, how you'd think about the overall IL-4 [ph] program? What would the kind of market be in asthma or atopic dermatitis? And are there other indications that are related that you might also go after now that you have proof of concept with the patients?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Right. So Jason, I wouldn't have a comment on trials that haven't been announced yet. It's just -- you just have to wait. I'm sorry. As to other indications, I would say that it is exciting to us that when you take 2 diseases that superficially are not related, atopic dermatitis and, let's say, allergic asthma, and you get a proof of concept with a single drug candidate in both of those, you recognize, of course, that these are related diseases because they're both allergic-type diseases affecting different tissues, one affecting the skin and one affecting the lungs. And obviously, if one drug can have -- seem to have an important effect in both of those, then we will be looking at a lot of other tissues with the same sorts of processes maybe ongoing. So I think your insight there is good. I would just say that this is an area that we are particularly excited about. We think the prospect of fundamentally influencing these pathways is important. George, do you want to add anything about the trends of these diseases or...?
George D. Yancopoulos: Yes. I think -- just to amplify on what Len said, I think we have made a really fundamental potential finding here, which is, as you know -- and it's all over the news, there was just a release from the Center for Disease Control yesterday. Every day, you pick up a newspaper, you hear about the increasing rates of various forms of allergic disease in the world, ranging from asthma to eczema and other type of skin allergies, to food allergies, to an assortment of other diseases that, on some level, suggest that there's some sort of allergic reaction going on. And we've long thought that the interleukin-4, interleukin-13 pathways might be critical drivers of this essentially worldwide shift towards what is known as a TH2-type phenotype. And of course, until you actually produce human data, and as Len said importantly, in not just 1 but 2 of these diseases, do you actually think that maybe it is true that this is a fundamental set of pathways that are driving this epidemic towards too much TH2 disease. And since it works in these 2 settings, we're excited about the fact that this could much broadly address other types of allergic diseases as well. So we think there's a very important potential opportunity.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Okay. And we have to do our presentation at the American Thoracic Society. When is that, Michael?
Michael Aberman: That's May 21.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Okay, great. Thanks for the question, Jason.
Operator: The next question comes from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.
Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Just wondering, now that you have the J code in hand, if you guys are going to plan to tighten your payment terms at all to the physicians given your account receivables balance. And then the second question I had was just any update on the EYLEA litigation with Genentech, both U.S. and x-U.S.?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes, good questions. We probably don't want to anticipate either of those questions with answers. So we'll give you a free pass to ask a different question, Terence, if you like.
Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay, understand. I guess in terms of just the gating steps to getting the PDGF antibody into the clinic, can you guys just walk us through what else is left here and when, kind of a timeframe, to expect that might be?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes, we're at the end of the preclinical phase in preparing for filing of the IND sometime later this year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ying Huang with Barclays.
Ying Huang - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I have a couple here. First of all, can you tell us how many patients do you have to accumulate in the safety database before you can file for the PCSK9 antibody with the FDA? And then secondly, can you help us understand the market opportunity for both atopic dermatitis and also asthma indications here for the IL-4 program?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Right. So it's -- in terms of the number of patients, if you look at our filings, we believe that -- you can find them on ClinicalTrials.gov -- that the aggregate of our trials will provide an adequate database for us to file. I'm not going to give you a specific number that we've discussed just for competitive reasons, but our trial is designed to meet the number and meet the requirements for demonstrating safety and efficacy. In terms of the market size for asthma, resistant asthma, allergic asthma, atopic dermatitis, at this point, we would just say they are very large market opportunities. Sorry about not being able to quantify that at this point.
Operator: The next question comes from Joseph Schwartz with Leerink.
Joseph P. Schwartz - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division: I was wondering, how do you see EYLEA adoption patterns outside the United States comparing to what you've been able to achieve in the U.S.? Bayer obviously achieved pretty hefty market share in Japan and Australia very rapidly. Do you expect that pattern to play out in Europe and elsewhere?
Leonard S. Schleifer: We certainly hope. It's hard to predict how this is going to go. The launch is off to a great start. The IMS market share data in the countries, primarily Australia and Japan that have gotten going first, look great. There's lots of market awareness for the product. I think people are excited for the product, and we're looking forward to a successful launch. Avastin is less of a factor outside of the United States, so we're really in a head-to-head -- rather than a three-way fight, we're in a head-to-head battle with Lucentis, and so far, very good.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Newman with JMP Securities.
John L. Newman - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division: All of my questions have been answered.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Okay, great.
Operator: Our next question comes from Yaron Werber with Citi.
Kumaraguru Raja: This is Kumar Raja in for Yaron Werber. Can please give us a sense of how long it will take for pricing negotiations in Europe? And do you have a sense of what -- how long it took for Lucentis?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes. So these are the questions that are better posed to Bayer. They should be the spokesman for that level of detail, and I'm sure they'll be happy to address them for you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Biren Amin with Jefferies.
Biren Amin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: I guess, I think you provided some pretty good color on dosing for year 1, year 2 for EYLEA. And I just want to -- thinking forward, how should we think about year 3 EYLEA dosing?
Leonard S. Schleifer: It's hard to predict. There's lots of data out there that people have tried -- try all sorts of different dosing paradigms. We kind of hope that people stick to the label. There are some people who are concerned about overtreatment. We're obviously concerned about systematic undertreatment. But I don't know we have any information yet. It's too early in our launch to know how people are going to use EYLEA. Even in the second year, we barely have people, small numbers, so it's a little bit early for that. Sorry.
Operator: The next question comes from Ted Tenthoff with Piper Jaffray.
Edward A. Tenthoff - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Actually, my questions are largely answered, but if I could ask Bob to just repeat what the 1-year injection rate was. And then a kind of housekeeping one for Murray. With respect to the weighted number of shares outstanding, it looked like it decreased a little bit from year-end. Is that just an accounting thing, or how should we be thinking about that?
Robert J. Terifay: Yes, so Ted, we said 7.5 doses in the first year, including the 3 loads, and then 5.4 doses in the second.
Leonard S. Schleifer: That's based on physician estimates, obviously, not actual chart reviews. The technical question about shares outstanding, I think it's you.
Murray A. Goldberg: Ted, really, it is just the accounting calculations on what gets included in dilutive, anti-dilutive in the calculation. Nothing fundamentally changed.
Edward A. Tenthoff - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: What is the fully diluted share count right now?
Murray A. Goldberg: The non-GAAP was 114 million shares. That's what our calculation's done on, 114 million shares.
Operator: Our next question comes from Phil Nadeau with Cowen and Company.
Philip Nadeau - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: It's one for George on dupilumab. George, we've seen other IL-4s that have produced kind of unimpressive data in asthma. What differentiates dupilumab? What are you seeing either preclinically in binding affinity or half-life? Or what have you seen from these initial clinical studies that will -- that gives you confidence that this will work on top of standard of care when some of the other drugs didn't?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Thanks for that question, and we'll let George handle that.
George D. Yancopoulos: All right, Phil. Well, we do think not all inhibitors are made the same, nor do they act the same. And as you know, all these features that you talked about, which are affinity, particularly hitting one receptor and a component of the receptor system that will block essentially with very high affinity, both cytokines, it hits both type 1 and type 2 receptors. There's a lot of differentiation on the biochemistry, which we can't get into the details here. But it's just -- I think it's a testament to the fact that if you create a good antibody with all the right properties, not all antibodies are the same, not all the technologies are the same, you may end up achieving better results in the clinic.
Operator: Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan.
Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: A couple on U.S. EYLEA. For the J code, any impact in the first quarter in terms of what you're seeing from the field, the speed to get reimbursement, how that compares with last year? And then on Avastin use, you guys have talked a lot about the general trend since the launch. But curious if your market research indicated an acceleration of lower Avastin share since the last call, since some of the adverse events were first disclosed.
Leonard S. Schleifer: We'll let Bob take that.
Robert J. Terifay: So Geoff, as you know, we received a temporary Q code in the middle of last year, which really brought us to very fast turnaround times from the Medicare providers. So we haven't seen a dramatic change in turnaround since the J code, since we were already being pretty -- processed as a specified agent in the Medicare system since July. With regards to the Avastin, we have seen a gradual decline since launch. In the launch timeframe, we had -- Avastin had about a 60% to 65% share of eyes. And that has now come down to 46%, so it continues to go down gradually.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Okay, great. Well, let us stop by saying we appreciate your time and interest. We do appreciate this week the work of the selection committee of the S&P 500 people. We're proud to be in that group. And we look forward to continuing to update you through the rest of the year. Thank you, operator.
Operator: You're welcome. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals conference call to discuss the fourth quarter and yearend 2012 financial results. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Michael Aberman, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations for Regeneron. Please proceed, Dr. Aberman.
Michael Aberman: Good morning and welcome to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' fourth quarter and full year 2012 conference call. An archive of this webcast will be available on our website, under events and presentations for 30 days. Joining me on the call today is Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; George Yancopoulos, Founding Scientist, President of Regeneron Labs and Chief Scientific Officer; Murray Goldberg, Chief Financial Officer; and Robert Terifay, Senior Vice President, Commercial. After our prepared remarks, we'll open the call for Q&A. I would also like to remind you that remarks made on this call that are not historical in nature may be forward-looking statements about Regeneron and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual events and our actual results may differ materially. Such remarks may include but are not limited to those related to Regeneron and its products and businesses, sales forecasts, financial forecasts, development programs, collaborations, finances, regulatory matters, intellectual property and competition, all of which involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A more complete description of these and other material risks can be found in Regeneron's filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission or SEC, including its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 which we will be filing with the SEC tomorrow and Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2012. Regeneron does not undertake any obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless required by law. GAAP and non-GAAP measures will be discussed on today's calls. Information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP are available in our financial results press release, which can be accessed on our website. Once our call concludes, the IR team will be available to answer further questions. With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.
Leonard Schleifer: Thank you, Michael, and good morning everyone. 2012 was a good year for Regeneron, as it marked our transformation from a development stage company to a profitable biotech company, driven by the highly successful launch of EYLEA or aflibercept injection, one of the top product launches in the history of our industry. With fourth quarter EYLEA U.S. net sales of $276 million, and 2012 full year U.S. EYLEA net sales reaching $838 million. We are pleased to report that fourth quarter '12 was our fourth consecutive profitable quarter with non-GAAP net income of $171 million or $1.47 per diluted share, and full year non-GAAP net income of $530 million or $4.66 per diluted share. As a reminder, non-GAAP net income excludes non-cash compensation expense, non-cash interest expense and non-cash income taxes, all of which Murray will discuss in greater detail later. The ability to deliver such strong earnings with over $0.5 billion of non-GAAP profit in the first full year that EYLEA was on the market, while continuing to invest in our robust pipeline highlights the unique business model we have created at Regeneron. The EYLEA launch continues to go very well and we expect strong growth in the U.S. in 2013, as Bob Terifay will describe in more detail. As we announced earlier in the year, we estimate full year 2013 EYLEA U.S. net sales will grow approximately 50% to between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion. Outside the U.S., our partner Bayer HealthCare has launched EYLEA across multiple geographies, including Japan, Australia and several countries in Europe and South America. In the fourth quarter, the first quarter of sales, Bayer recorded ex-United States EYLEA net sales of approximately $19 million. We will not comment on the details of the ex-U.S. launch on this call, as that should be left to our partner Bayer HealthCare to discuss. But we can say that we are very pleased with the progress to date. We are also pleased with our regulatory achievements in 2012. We received approval for EYLEA in the United States in the second indication macular edema following central retinal vein occlusion. And our partner Sanofi received U.S. approval in August 2012 for ZALTRAP in combination with FOLFIRI for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer that is resistant to or has progressed following an oxaliplatin regimen. And just last week, Sanofi received approval for ZALTRAP in the European Union. While ZALTRAP will not have the same impact on our net income as EYLEA, because of a smaller market opportunity and our repayment obligations to Sanofi, especially in the early launch years. ZALTRAP U.S. net sales as reported by Sanofi are off to a strong start, with U.S. net sales of $23 million in the fourth quarter of '12 and $32 million from the launch in late August and until the end of last year. Our pipeline also made significant advances in 2012, which George will discuss in a minute. While 2012 was a transformational year, we see a bright future with the ongoing global launch of EYLEA, expansion of EYLEA into new indications, and the additional opportunities in our pipeline. With that, let me turn the call over to George Yancopoulos, my partner and Regeneron's Chief Scientific Officer, to discuss our pipeline in a little more detail. George will be followed by Bob Terifay, Senior Vice President of Commercial, who will elaborate on our commercial activities. And finally, Murray Goldberg, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our financial performance during 2012 and provide some guidance for 2013 expenses. George?
George Yancopoulos: Thanks, Len. 2012 was also a good year for Regeneron's research and development organization, and I will highlight a few accomplishments and upcoming milestones from our pipeline. For EYLEA, as you just heard from Len, we received approval and an additional indication in 2012, macular edema following central retinal vein occlusion. We also initiated an additional trial in patients with macular edema following branch retinal vein occlusion, and we fully enrolled our U.S. and ex-U.S. Phase 3 DME trials. We look forward to getting the topline results from the one-year primary endpoint for the ex-U.S. DME Phase 3 trial, VIVID-DME by the end of the year. As a reminder, for DME in the EU, a one-year primary efficacy endpoint is required for regulatory approvals. While in the U.S. it has been a two-year efficacy endpoint. Turning to Regeneron727, our PCSK9 antibody targeting lowering of LDL cholesterol, for which we have just had the generic name approved alirocumab. In 2012, we presented and published positive Phase 2 data and subsequently initiated a 22,000 patient Phase 3 program ODYSSEY, which includes an 18,000 patient cardiovascular outcomes trial. While the majority of the Phase 2 results will emerge in 2014, we now expect the first Phase 3 trial in the program ODYSSEY MONO to have data available in the third quarter of 2013. While this is a small trial in a monotherapy setting, it will represent the first Phase 3 trials results for PCSK9 program. In 2012, we also fully enrolled the first of our Phase 3 trial for sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody called the SARIL-RA-MOBILITY trial. We initiated an additional Phase 3 trial SARIL-RA-TARGET, and will shortly initiate additional Phase 3 trial in the SARIL-RA program. Just last month, we announced that we have positive proof-of-concept data for our IL-4 receptor antibody, Regeneron668, for which we also have a generic name, dupilumab, in two allergic diseases, atopic dermatitis and allergic asthma. We are particularly excited about this program as these diseases remain areas of a high degree of unmet medical needs and we believe it's locking both the IL-4 and 13 pathways, with our antibody has the potential to be a disease modifying therapy. Obviously, it is still early in terms of drug development, but we look forward to presenting the atopic dermatitis data at the American Academy of Dermatology Meeting in March, in Miami, and the asthma data at a conference later in the year. We anticipate starting Phase 2b trials for both indications in the middle of this year. Before turning the call over to Bob Terifay, I want to also mention that we will focus in our investor calls, in our late-stage pipelines we invest a lot of time and resources to our early-stage pipeline, technology development and our discovery efforts. Therefore, I want to quickly highlight some of these efforts. Specifically, we have made significant progress in our bispecific antibody program, our long-acting antibody program, one that which we call Catch and Release, as well as our antibody-drug conjugant or ADC efforts. We hope to provide more details on these programs as the year progresses. But like our VelocImmune platform, we believe we are developing best-in-class approaches with these next generation antibody like therapeutics. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Bob to provide an update on the EYLEA launch.
Robert Terifay: Thank you, George. We're very pleased with the rapid acceptance of EYLEA and the successful U.S. launch. In fact, according to our calculations EYLEA represents the third most successful launch in the history of the U.S. biopharmaceutical industry. This success is a reflection of the truly differentiated product profile for EYLEA as well as the strong execution by our commercial team, both in the field as well as inside in supporting roles. In the fourth quarter, we continued to see strong uptick for EYLEA, despite some challenges that we face that included Hurricane Sandy on the East Coast and the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. During the fourth quarter, overall penetration of EYLEA into the wet AMD market continue to grow both in terms of newly treated patients as well as those switching from bevacizumab and ranibizumab. Based on the updated qualitative market research surveys that we conducted during the fourth quarter, in terms of unit volume, bevacizumab represented 47% of treated eyes, ranibizumab 30%, and EYLEA captured approximately 22% of the wet AMD market. Of the patients, who were newly treated with EYLEA approximately 65% were new to anti-VEGF therapy and 35% were switches from existing therapy. Importantly, during the fourth quarter we continue to gain new accounts, many of them were previously mainly bevacizumab users. Also during the fourth quarter, we saw the beginning of our penetration into the macular edema following central retinal vein occlusion or CRVO market. Our qualitative market research during the quarter suggest that we gained 10% of the CRVO market at the end of 2012. We hope to continue that momentum in CRVO throughout 2013. As a reminder, our market research is based on position questionnaires, and therefore is qualitative in nature. Patient access remains very important for Regeneron. Our EYLEA 4U program has become a valuable resource for patients, physicians and their practices, to help ensure that patients who need EYLEA have access. As an example of our commitment to patient access, this year we've significantly increased our charitable donations to independent foundations to provide co-pay assistance. Just last month, EYLEA received a permanent reimbursement code or J-Code from Medicare. Since EYLEA is a buy and build product, confidence in reimbursement is an important factor in the prescribing decision for many physicians. We believe that the permanent J-Code will make some physicians more comfortable using EYLEA. We're already seeing faster turnaround times for claims processing from the Medicare carriers. Turning to our guidance for EYLEA U.S. sales for 2013. We considered multiple factors, including on the positive side: one, the carry-over wet AMD patients, who started EYLEA treatment throughout 2012; two, the permanent J-code that we received last month; three, the ongoing launce in macular edema following central retinal vein occlusion; and four, continued share gains from both ranibizumab and bevacizumab in the wet AMD market. This may be partially offset by the slowing and new account acquisition, and an increased duration between injections, as patients move from the initial monthly dosing period. With those factors in mind, you've heard that we forecast U.S. EYLEA sales for 2013 of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, which represents an approximately 50% increase over 2012. Outside of the United States, Bayer has launched EYLEA for the treatment of wet AMD in Japan, Australia, and several European and South American countries. As you may know, the actual market launch in Europe occurs in the staggered fashion, as each country has a different process for obtaining pricing approval. That said, we're pleased with the progress to date and the feedback that we're getting from Bayer, which you'll hopefully hear from them about in the next few weeks, when they do their earnings call. Net U.S. sales reported to us by Bayer for the fourth quarter were $19 million, largely from Japan and Australia, the first countries where the product was launched outside of the United States. I'd now like to turn from ophthalmology to oncology, where we made our first foray in the third quarter of 2012 with the U.S. approval of ZALTRAP, also known as ziv-aflibercept, for the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer was progressed following treatment with an oxaliplatin-containing regimen that could have included bevacizumab. We co-commercialized ZALTRAP with our collaborator Sanofi. Sanofi, however, is currently responsible for the field based selling effort. Interest in the uses of ZALTRAP and its approved medical setting, where historically there was no therapies demonstrated to improve overall survival in combination with the standard of care chemotherapy regimen FOLFIRI continues. This is highlighted by the $23 million in net sales recorded by Sanofi in the fourth quarter of 2012, and $32 million between launch in late August through the end of last year. With the recent approval of ZALTRAP in the EU, we look forward to the launch fallout throughout 2013. With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Office, Murray Goldberg.
Murray Goldberg: Thank you, Bob, and good morning to everyone. I'm very pleased to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2012. As Len noted at the outset of this call, but certainly warrants repeating, the fourth quarter of 2012 was our fourth consecutive profitable quarter with non-GAAP net income of $171 million or $1.47 per diluted share. Full year non-GAAP net income was $530 million or $4.66 per diluted share. This strong bottomline performance was driven by U.S. EYLEA net sales of $276 million in the fourth quarter and $838 million for the full year. EYLEA inventory held by U.S. distributors at the end of the year was consistent with prior quarters at about one to two weeks of sales. Sanofi collaboration revenue was $105 million for the fourth quarter and $424 for the full year. The Sanofi collaboration revenue line includes reimbursement of our R&D expenses for pre-clinical and clinical research within our antibody collaboration and any ZALTRAP R&D expenses, recognition and/or amortization of upfront and milestone payments, and our share of the profit or loss associated with the ongoing launch of ZALTRAP. In the fourth quarter of 2012, Sanofi reported $23 million of ZALTRAP net sales in the U.S., and the Sanofi collaboration revenue line included a $6 million loss for us, associated with global pre-marketing activities and the U.S. launch of ZALTRAP. For the full year 2012, ZALTRAP U.S. net sales were $32 million, and the Sanofi collaboration revenue line included a $26 million loss for us, associated with global pre-marketing activities and commercialization of ZALTRAP. Our share of loss in 2012 was more than offset by a $50 million milestone payment we received in August 2012 related to ZALTRAP approval in the U.S. As a reminder, we do not anticipate a meaningful positive contribution from the commercialization of ZALTRAP in the near-term, because of our obligation to repay Sanofi from our share of ZALTRAP profits, where 50% of the ZALTRAP development expenses that they have funded. Bayer collaboration revenue was $22 million for the fourth quarter and $70 million for the full year. Similar to the Sanofi collaboration revenue line, Bayer collaboration revenue includes cost sharing of EYLEA development expenses that we incurred, recognition and/or amortization of upfront and milestone payments, and our share of net profit from EYLEA sales outside the United States. For the full year 2012, Bayer collaboration revenue included a total of $25 million in milestone payments. A $15 million milestone payment that we received in the third quarter for marketing approval of EYLEA in Japan and a $10 million milestone payment in the fourth quarter for pricing approval of EYLEA in Japan. In the fourth quarter, Bayer reported net sales of EYLEA outside the U.S. of approximately $19 million. As with Sanofi and ZALTRAP, as EYLEA becomes profitable, we are obligated to repay Bayer a 50% of the ex-U.S. EYLEA development expenses that they have funded. Each quarter that repayment is equal to the lesser of 5% of the outstanding repayment obligation or our share of that quarter's ex-U.S. EYLEA profits. During the fourth quarter of 2012, our share of collaboration profit from sales of EYLEA outside the U.S., including royalties on sales in Japan was $4 million. This was fully offset by our repayment obligation to Bayer. At the end of 2012, our remaining repayment obligation to Bayer was approximately $273 million. The components of both the Sanofi and Bayer collaboration revenue lines are detailed in our Form 10-K for 2012, which we expect to file tomorrow and will also be shown in future quarterly filings. Non-GAAP cost of goods sold was $30 million or 10.6% of total net product sales in the fourth quarter, and $83 million or 9.7% of total net product sales for the full year. As a reminder, COGS includes royalty expense in connection with our agreement with Genentech relating to ophthalmic sales of EYLEA in the United States. Turing to R&D, non-GAAP R&D expense was $163 million in the fourth quarter and $572 million for the full year. If we net out R&D reimbursements from our collaborators from our R&D expense line, our net non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense was $48 million for the fourth quarter and $157 million for the full year. Thus, more than 70% of our R&D expense was funded by Sanofi and Bayer. As you may remember, we had guided towards fourth quarter unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense of $50 million to $90 million. Actual unreimbursed R&D expense in 2012 was below guidance, partly because our NGF antibody program remains on clinical hold. So we did not initiate our planned Phase 3 program in 2012. That said, we do expect a significant increase in unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense in 2013 compared to 2012, with expenses of $275 million to $325 million. This increase in non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense is largely due to increased spending on EYLEA clinical programs compared to 2012, including the Phase 3 DME and BRVO trials; advancing unpartnered antibody programs such as Regeneron1400, which targets ErbB3; and three other antibodies to undisclosed targets through to proof-of-concept stage; and increased spending on early stage technologies, such as antibody-drug conjugates, bispecific antibodies and longer-acting antibody technologies. In addition, as George mentioned, we expect results from one of the Phase 3 ODYSSEY trials for Regeneron727 or alirocumab later this year. If these data are positive, it would trigger the real-time sharing of 20% of subsequent Phase 3 development expenses for the ODYSSEY program. Estimates of all these expenses are included in our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D guidance. Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $46 million in the fourth quarter and $172 million for the full year. We expect non-GAAP SG&A expense in 2013 to grow to $215 million to $235 million. This increase is largely due to two items; an increase in our contribution to independent co-pay foundations, as Bob mentioned, and the branded prescription drug fee that was part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. As a reminder, non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense exclude non-cash share-based compensation expense. Turning to taxes. As we discussed in our last quarterly call, even though we have accumulated a large amount of NOLs in tax credits that could offset future taxable income, under GAAP, prior to the fourth quarter of 2012, we had a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets due to outstanding history of operating losses. As a result, we did not include any deferred tax assets on our balance sheet. In the fourth quarter of 2012, in our GAAP earnings, we recognized a non-cash tax benefit of $336 million, primarily as a result of releasing substantially all of valuation allowance associated with our deferred tax assets. The decision to release the valuation allowance in the fourth quarter was made after we determined that it was more likely than not that these deferred tax assets would be realized. One significant factor that influenced this decision was that our cumulative profits over the prior three years turned positive in the fourth quarter of 2012. As this income tax benefit is non-cash, we excluded it from our non-GAAP earnings. Looking forward to 2013 and beyond, despite the significant net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards available to offset future cash tax liabilities, we expect to begin to recognize book income taxes in our GAAP earnings, using an estimated tax rate, which is expected to approximate statutory tax rates of around 40%. That said, given the magnitude of our existing NOL and tax credit carry forwards, plus anticipated additional tax deductions we expect in connection with future employee exercises of stock options, we do not expect to pay any significant cash income taxes through at least 2014. Therefore, for our non-GAAP earnings we will continue to exclude non-cash taxes until we begin paying significant cash income taxes. At that time, we anticipate that we will no longer exclude non-cash income tax expense from our non-GAAP net income. It's worth noting, that as our business operations expand outside of the United States, in a few years we could start to see a downward trend in our GAAP effective tax rate. Turning to the bottomline as I said earlier, we reported non-GAAP net income of $530 million or $4.66 per fully diluted share for the full year 2012. Non-GAAP net income excludes non-cash share-based compensation expense, non-cash interest expense related to our convertible senior notes, and non-cash income tax expense or benefit, including in 2012 the non-cash benefit from releasing substantially all of the valuation allowance associated with our deferred tax assets. Our non-GAAP fully diluted average shares outstanding were approximately 117 million shares in the fourth quarter and approximately 115 million shares for the full year. The full year 2012 non-GAAP fully diluted average shares outstanding include about 16 million shares attributable to stock options, restricted stock and warrants, accounted for using the treasury method, and about 5 million shares associated with our convertible notes, accounted for using the if-converted method. At December 31, 2012, we had approximately $1.2 billion of cash, marketable securities and trade receivable compared to $839 million at the end of 2011. In 2012, this consisted of $588 million of cash and marketable securities and $593 million of trade receivables almost all related EYLEA sales. As you will recall in connection with the launch of EYLEA, we offered our distributors extended payment terms, and they in turn offered physicians extended payment terms of up to six months, to provide ample time for physicians to receive reimbursement for Medicare and other insurance providers for their EYLEA usage. Now that we have a permanent J-Code, we expect these EYLEA payment terms to decrease overtime, and thus the days that our EYLEA trade receivables, our outstanding, will also decrease. Thank you. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Len.
Leonard Schleifer: Thanks, Murray, Bob, George. To wrap it up, 2012 was a great year, but we believe the future will be bright with the expansion of EYLEA globally ahead of us, and a robust product pipeline advancing. With that, let me turn the call back to Michael for the question-and-answer portion of the call.
Michael Aberman: Thank you, Len. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call to Q&A. As we'd like to give as many people a chance to ask questions as possible, we do request you limit yourself to one question. As a reminder, our team will be available in our offices after the call for follow-up questions. Thank you. Operator, you can now open the call for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.
Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank: A question around market trends, you mentioned that Avastin now is about 41% of eyes, EYLEA 22%, I think you said Lucentis 37%. In the previous data set, these were up, there was EYLEA 20%, Avastin 50%, and Lucentis 30%. So I'm trying to understand has there been a shift according to your market research of Avastin to Lucentis, and have you seen any impact from compounding pharmacies in the New Year?
Leonard Schleifer: I can let Bob comment and Robyn thanks for the question. But before he does, just to really emphasize the point, these are qualitative research and they're not really intended to be able to track precisely market share from survey to survey into overtime. And Bob, you want to elaborate on that?
Robert Terifay: Yes, I agree, Len. The way we do the survey is we try to pick a representative sample of 200 retinal specialist but we do vary it as we go out overtime. So it's very hard to trend specific numbers. What I could tell you is that it does seem that Avastin sales are slowly declining with the launch of EYLEA. I don't think you can read that Lucentis is growing from Avastin sales. I think it was just the distribution of physicians that we had in the surgery. In terms of the compounding question, we do see physicians are concerned. There are some safe there where the physicians are having to write prescriptions or spreadsheets with all the patients for whom compounded Avastin is being used but there has been no major market shift as of yet.
Michael Aberman: I just want to make sure. I think you mentioned some of those numbers wrong. So just I want to clarify what our survey results were, it was 47% for bevacizumab, 30% for ranibizumab and 22% for EYLEA.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line Adnan Butt with RBC Capital Markets.
Adnan Butt - RBC Capital Markets: A bit more on guidance, if you can. Can you tell us, what share you expect from wet AMD and CRVO and maybe you can shed some light on CRVO. Do you expect similar dynamics to the wet AMD market there?
Leonard Schleifer: Bob, do you want to take that?
Robert Terifay: Let's start with the CRVO. We expect to see a slower uptick in CRVO. We're not seeing as many switches in the CRVO market and part of that maybe related to our labeling, which calls for monthly dosing in CRVO but we do expect to see continued growth in CRVO, just at a slower pace than wet AMD. In terms of giving market share guidance, we're not doing that at this time.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line Jason Kantor with Credit Suisse.
Jason Kantor - Credit Suisse: One of the things on your guidance, just want to understand your R&D and SG&A expense part of it. You kind of had big step ups in Q4 for both, and I'm wondering if those are sort of new going-forward levels to expect or if there is some aspect of the expense that was increased in Q4? And then if you could also quantify a little bit better on a quarterly or annual basis, what that 20% of the Phase 3 cost of ODYSSEY might look like?
Leonard Schleifer: So Murray will handle some of the guidance questions, which I think he may have covered in his talk and he can elaborate on it. As far as the expense is specifically related to the ODYSSEY trials, we're really not in a position to talk about, that's kind of competitive information.
Murray Goldberg: Also, how much that will cost us really depend on what trials are ongoing and how fast they are enrolling patients and what those costs are. We will try to incorporate some estimates into guidance, but we don't really have specific numbers on that that we can share with you at this point. The reasons for that you are expecting increases in 2013, as I highlighted with EYLEA, now that's a two Phase 3 DME programs are fully enrolled. So those expenses have picked up in the BRVO trial is at Phase 3. That is also moving ahead. And then we have these other antibodies that are earlier stages, that are unpartnered, that will be eating up those expenses on our own as well as some investment and technologies. In terms of the fourth quarter run rate, I indicated that the un-reimbursed R&D was $48 million for the fourth quarter. If you annualize that you'd get to roughly $200 million, but we've actually guided to a full year 2013 of $275 million to $325 million. So we're actually expecting an uptick from what we saw in the fourth quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.
Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs: I was just wondering if you could remind us the DME trials about the design, of the different dosing arms and how we should think about, I guess, the importance of the every other months arms, just given how Roche centers for DME? And then the second question I had was REGN1500, is that the VEGF-antibody that you guys are developing or is it going after a different target?
Michael Aberman: In terms of the trial design for the DME trial, these are trials versus laser and there is two different dosing arms for EYLEA and every four week dosing arm as well as an every eight week dosing after a loading dose. Was your another question regarding the DME? Again, the European trial has a primary endpoint at one-year and U.S. trial was designed with the two-year primary endpoint.
Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs: I guess, just wondering how important, I guess the every eight-week dosing arm is in your opinion given kind of the pricing dynamics in DME with Lucentis?
Leonard Schleifer: Again, I think, we designed the trial to have both arms. Obviously, we demonstrated clinically equivalent efficacy in the wet AMD setting, we'll have to wait and see what the DME data show. I think it is little premature to talk about our strategy there; a, before we see our data; and b, before we launch in that indication. And you had a second follow-up question?
Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs: Regeneron1500?
Leonard Schleifer: No, that's not our PDGF antibody.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Robert Baird.
Chris Raymond - Robert Baird: I know you're probably not going to be interested in going into too much detail on this, but have you had any discussions with Sanofi since the HSR notice. And can you give us any color on what they perhaps might have communicated to you, as what their intensions are going forward?
Leonard Schleifer: And my answer is, I'm not really interested in going into too much detail on that. It might be worth just taking this moment to explain that some of the HSR rules are somewhat outgained. But it might be worth just explaining as we understand and in terms of general, that the basic point is that when you want to acquire a stock in a company, if the stock that you own plus the stock that you want to acquire is over a certain threshold and that threshold is $500 million as adjusted, I believe it's $700 million now, you need to file a pre-action notice with the government and get approval. It's an odd thing, because it doesn't matter the fact that the stock wasn't valued $500 million or $700 million, as the case maybe when they've bought it, even they it we'd appreciate it if they wanted to buy anymore shares, even a single share they needed to file this notice and get approval. I hope that clarifies at least in mechanics.
Chris Raymond - Robert Baird: So I wondered if you could also maybe give us an update on the status of the VEGF, PDGF combo as it relates to with the opt-in rights that Sanofi has on that drug. Where does that stand?
Robert Terifay: I think what we've said, all the antibodies and their collaboration are subject to opt-in we're happy to move forward either with or without Sanofi and depending no matter how that goes?
Leonard Schleifer: They have no rights to EYLEA just to clear.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jim Birchenough with BMO Capital.
Jim Birchenough - BMO Capital: I'm going to push my luck with the two-part question, but just the quick question from your survey. Do you have a sense of what market share you have in the frontline setting for the treatment naïve patients? And then the second part of the two-part is, could you maybe just discuss the competitive landscape as you see it. Your thoughts on the competitive risk from the DARPin, but more broadly, whether you guys are considering any BD activity to try and stay on top of the emerging anti-VEGF therapy that might be competitive?
Leonard Schleifer: Let's take it in reversal. In terms of BD activity, I would say in a global sense, we look at all kinds of activities from discovery and development internally to BD to making sure that we're staying at the front of this obviously very important area. As far as how we view the DARPin's out there, George, you want to comment on that?
George Yancopoulos: Obviously, the DARPins are a long way off and there has been very little real data available on them. I guess, a lot of people were disappointed at this weekend the Angiogenesis meeting at Bascom Palmer that the investigators were allowed to really speak any further beyond the easy published data, but they did review to published data to see whether there was really any evidence in the publications to support the possibility that the anti-VEGF DARPin would have any advantages compared to existing agents. I guess the conclusions that were reached at the presentation at the Angiogenesis meeting is that it didn't seem that they had any advantages, for example, the published data supporting the half life when interpreted by the investigators suggested that if anything, the half life was the same or actually shorter then some of the existing agents out there? And of course, we already know that they had some safety issues in their early studies and until yearend, hundreds if not thousands of patients, one can't really assess the actual safety situation. So as I said, obviously it's very setting. There is a lot of question. We're following it very interested fashion. But as Len said, I mean, we not only have following outside developments, but we believe we have a lot of internal efforts that will keep us state-of-the-art and the leader in this field.
Jim Birchenough - BMO Capital: And now, there was a question on Jim or Bob, do you have any comment on whether or not our frontline market share, we have any information on that, I don't know if we have granularity on that?
Robert Terifay: Yes. So we're very encouraged. Our new business is ticking up quite well. We had a 20% market share in the new segment in the fourth quarter.
George Yancopoulos: Overall, unit volumes including Avastin and Lucentis.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Citi.
Yaron Werber - Citi: I'm going to ask you kind of a two questions. One, Lucentis had a label change, literally just very recently, where they are talking about PRN dosing after three months, but the label does sort of call out to be sub-optimal. What are you hearing from (inaudible) is that in any way probably you think will gain a little traction. And then secondly, just I'm not sure if you can help us understand in the guidance, how many injections you're kind of baking in this year versus last year?
Leonard Schleifer: So I don't think we can give you the specifics on the number of injections that are in our models. So you'll have to fly that, when you sell for your own. In terms of the recent Genentech label, you're correct, that the label, they did get a PRN dosing, that was specifically called out that it was not as effective compared to monthly dosing. And then it required regular assessment. By comparison of course, not that you can't compare a product profiles per se, but you can compare labels. And our label says that you can with every other month dosing after loading those there is no monitoring requirement. And you had clinically equivalent efficacy. So we're very pleased with where our label is.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America.
Steve Byrne - Bank of America: Your Santen partner in Japan has reported the penetration in wet AMD with EYLEA, is I think somewhere in the 25% range, after just a couple of months. Is that pace in line with your expectations? And maybe moreover is it specific to the demographics there or do you think that there is some broader conclusion about markets where you don't have much meaningful off-label of Avastin using the potential for EYLEA to penetrate?
Leonard Schleifer: The only thing I can say that is I'll give you qualitative answer. I know you've kind of asked the semi-quantitative question, but the qualitative answer is that Santen is an extremely good partner for Bayer and Regeneron in Japan. Obviously, they are a top ophthalmology company with a lot of reach to the physicians. So we're excited about how the launch is going and you'll get a little bit more color on that I think from Bayer.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan.
Geoff Meacham - JPMorgan: Just on the PCSK9. I know it's competitive. What your competitors recently talked about not needing outcomes data for approval but needing it for a broader physician adoption. I just wanted to get your guys perspective on that when you think about the opportunity in this market?
Leonard Schleifer: So yes, you're correct and that competition the as well as we have stated that we do not believe the results of an outcome study are required for approval for a cholesterol lowering indications. But you're also correct that if you and you look back to the statins, if you have and if and when you can get in the label outcomes data, obviously that becomes more compelling to physicians in terms of uptake. But I think that there is a sufficient unmet medical need here in terms of the millions of patients who either can't tolerate statins or can't get the goal at statins and who need more cholesterol lowering, that we're excited that this presents a very strong opportunity for our product.
Operator: Our next question comes from Phil Nadeau with Cowen.
Phil Nadeau - Cowen: My question is actually on sarilumab. Could you give us some sense of when we're going to see the Phase 3 data from that compound and what data you think you need to produce in order for it to get good acceptance in what's your relatively product field?
Robert Terifay: As we mentioned the MOBILITY trial is fully enrolled. That's our first Phase 3 trial. I think we expect those data probably towards early '14, is the timeline there. As you know, we've announced initiation of additional trials with sarilumab. We think we have a very robust program. And while it's crowded field, we do believe if you look at how the IL-6 class is doing, I mean we do think the class matters. And recently our competitor Roche reported very great sales from Actemra. I think you'll see these classes is gaining acceptance as a very important treatment paradigm for patient too remove arthritis. So we're excited to unveil our complete Phase 3 program, which you should see relatively soon and at that time we can discuss in more detail what the package will look like.
Operator: Our next question comes from the Ted Tenthoff with Piper Jaffray.
Ted Tenthoff - Piper Jaffray: One quick question and I know we'll see a lot more detail in the K tomorrow, when it comes to recognition of the Bayer overseas sales and the offset, will all of that be included in the collaborative revenue line overall. Is that were all of that's going to tucked in?
George Yancopoulos: Yes, Ted. The sales doesn't show up anywhere in our income statement. Our share of the profits is one of the components of the Bayer collaboration revenue line and we've detailed that as I said in the 10-K and in future quarterly filing. But that's our share of the loss and then in the case of EYLEA our share of the profits, and then from that we subtract our repayment obligation to that particular quarter will be the net profits that we will recognize that will be part of the collaboration revenue line for Bayer and then the detailed and the breakout of that would be in the MD&A.
Ted Tenthoff - Piper Jaffray: And Murray, since I have you, can you repeat what you said about R&D guidance for 2013?
Murray Goldberg: We said that the un-reimbursed R&D expense would range between $275 million to $325 million is our current best estimate.
Operator: Our final question comes from Biren Amin with Jefferies.
Biren Amin - Jefferies: Just wanted to maybe ask you if you could share with us how we should think about the price of EYLEA in the European market?
Leonard Schleifer: That's a question that's not easily answered because it's not one market and there is many geographies and different pricing and discounts and what have you. And it's frankly quite complex, but back to Bayer, when they do their call coming up in not too distant future.
Michael Aberman: So with that let us conclude. Let me once again say, how pleased we were to transform the company to a profitable company and return somewhat value in terms of rewarding our shareholders, but we have a lot of exciting things to look forward to. And we're hard at work trying to continue to execute. So thanks for your time and have a great Valentines Day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does concludes your conference. You all may disconnect and have a good day.

Operator: Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals conference call to discuss the third quarter 2012 financial results. My name is Kevin and I’ll be your coordinator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of this call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Michael Aberman, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations for Regeneron. Please proceed, Dr. Aberman.
Michael Aberman: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning and welcome to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals’ third quarter 2012 conference call. An archive of this webcast will be available on our website in the newsroom page for at least the next 30 days. Joining me on the call today are Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; George Yancopoulos, Founding Scientist, President of Regeneron Labs and Chief Scientific Officer; Murray Goldberg, Chief Financial Officer and Bob Terifay, Senior Vice President, Commercial. After our prepared remarks, we’ll open the call for Q&A. I would also like to remind you that remarks made on this call that are not historical in nature may be forward-looking statements about Regeneron and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual events and our actual results may differ materially. Such remarks may include but are not limited to those related to Regeneron and its products and businesses, development programs, collaborations, finances, taxes, regulatory matters, intellectual property and competition, all of which involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A more complete description of these and other material risks can be found in Regeneron’s filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission or SEC, including its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 and Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2012 which was filed this morning. Regeneron does not undertake any obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless required by law. GAAP and non-GAAP measures will be discussed on today’s calls. Information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP is available in our third quarter 2012 financial results press release, which can be accessed on our website. Once our call concludes, the IR team will be available to answer further questions. With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.
Leonard Schleifer: Thanks, Michael. Good morning to everybody. And thanks for joining us. I am happy to report another successful quarter for Regeneron both in terms of our financial performance as well as our progress in our pipeline. Starting with EYLEA, we reported a US EYLEA net sales of $244 million this quarter representing a 26% growth over the second quarter of this year. Given the EYLEA results and current market trends, we are increasing our full year US EYLEA net sales guidance from our previous range of $700 to $750 million to our new guidance of 790 million to 850 million. Our guidance takes into consideration that the combination of the Thanksgiving and end of year holidays could lead to as much as one less week of potential sales. The strong US EYLEA sales helped deliver our third consecutive profitable quarter with non-GAAP net income of $217 million, which translates into non-GAAP fully diluted earnings per share of $1.89. Murray Goldberg will provide color on our financial performance later in the call.  In the meantime, please note that this quarter's profits included two onetime milestone payments. A $15 million milestone from Sanofi for the US FDA approval ZALTRAP also known as ziv-aflibercept in combination with FOLFIRI for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer that is resistant to or has progressed following an oxaliplatin-containing regimen and a $15 million milestone from Bayer Healthcare for the approval EYLEA in wet AMD in Japan. With the strong results reported today, we can expect our first profitable full year since our inception.  It has also been a busy quarter on both the regulatory and clinical development fronts. In addition to the ZALTRAP approval in the US, we received US FDA approval for EYLEA for the treatment of macular edema following central retinal vein occlusion or CRVO. We are pleased to be able to provide another treatment option for the physicians and patients that are impacted by this condition. This is also an important step towards our goal of driving long term growth for EYLEA through new indications. Outside the United States, our partner Bayer Healthcare has received several regulatory approvals for EYLEA including Japan, Australia, Columbia and most recently Brazil. In addition in Europe the committee for medical products for human use also known as the CHMP recommended that EYLEA be approved for wet AMD and we expect marketing authorization by year end. Bayer Healthcare plans to launch EYLEA in Japan, the EU, Australia and other countries beginning later this year and continuing into 2013. Turning to our antibody pipeline, we announced the initiation of a broad Phase III program for our PCSK9 antibody, REGN727 for lowering LDL cholesterol. We also announced the full enrollment of our first Phase III trial MOBILITY for sarilumab our antibody targeting the IL-6 receptor in rheumatoid arthritis and have also initiated a second trial in the broad SARIL-RA program with sarilumab that we call the target trial. Our earlier stage programs continue to move forward with new antibodies entering the clinic such as our novel oncology antibody targeting OB-3 and we have started a combination trial with our two antibody and ZALTRAP. Let me now hand the call over to our Chief Scientific Officer, George Yancopoulos to give more details on the developments in our pipeline. Following George, we will hear a commercial update from Bob Terifay, a financial update from our Murray Goldberg. And finally, I'll come back to make some concluding remarks before turning the call over to question-and-answers. George?
George Yancopoulos: Thank you, Len. The third quarter has been another busy one for us. This quarter was particularly gratifying with two FDA approvals Len mentioned in the United States. Although, we have enjoyed numerous regulatory approvals over the past year, we certainly appreciate that. In this industry drug approvals are not common place. We're extremely proud of the accomplishment of all the groups of Regeneron who contribute to the success. ZALTRAP also known as ziv-aflibercept was approved in combination with FOLFIRI for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer that is resistant to or has progressed following an oxaliplatin-containing regimen. ZALTRAP is the only anti-VEGF agent approved in this setting. We received approval for ELYEA in the setting of macular edema following Central Retinal Vein Occlusion or CRVO. While the commercial opportunity for CRVO is not as large as wet AMD or diabetic macular edema where we have two fully enrolled phase 3 trails, the vision loss associated with CRVO can be catastrophic to patients. ELYEA demonstrated significant efficacy in our COPERNICUS and GALILEO trials in CRVO patients with 56% and 60% three line gainers for the ELYEA arm versus 12% and 22% for the sham control arm of these trails at week 24, compared with baseline. Mean change in visual acuity improved by 17.3 and 18.2 letters with ELYEA as compare to a four letter loss in COPERNICUS and a 3.3 letter gain in GAILILEO with the sham control arm on over the first 24 weeks of the study. The most common adverse reactions 5% or more reported in patients receiving ELYEA were conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain cataract, vitreous detachment, vitreous floaters and increased intraocular pressure. We believe that ELYEA offers an important new treatment option for patients with this potentially blinding disease. Turning to our late stage R&D pipeline, as we reported in our last conference call, early in the third quarter, Sanofi and Regeneron announced the launch of the 22,000 patients global Phase III program for Regeneron 727, our PCSK9 antibody for lowering LDL cholesterol. This program called Odyssey consists of more than 10 clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Regeneron 727 in a broad range of patients. At the upcoming American Heart Association meeting in Los Angeles, we will present some novel analysis from our Phase II program for Regeneron 727. We along with our partner Sanofi will be hosting a webcast and teleconference for investors on Monday, November 5th from the American Heart Association annual meeting to provide some additional perspective on our Phase III program. Details on that event will follow shortly and will be posted on the Investor Relations section of our website. I am also very pleased to announce today that the global Phase III mobility trial for Sarilumab are subcutaneous IL-6 receptor antibody for rheumatoid arthritis is now fully enrolled. The mobility trial which is part of the global SARIL-RA Phase III program is evaluating Sarilumab in combination with methotrexate in adult who have moderate-to-severe active rheumatoid arthritis with an inadequate response to methotrexate. With enrolment now complete, we expect results from the study in 2014. In addition, we have now initiated another Phase III study in the SARIL-RA program called the TARGET trial. TARGET is now recruiting and will evaluate Sarilumab in combination with non-biological disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, also known as DMARD, in adult patients with moderate-to-severe RA who have an inadequate response to for our intolerant drug or more TNF alpha inhibitors. Patients, who complete the mobility or TARGET studies, will be eligible to enrol in the (inaudible) which is the Phase III long term safety and efficacy study. We will be announcing additional Phase III studies of Sarilumab in 2013. Another pipeline up in advance development is our NGF antibody Regeneron 475. Earlier this year, an FDA advisory committee voted unanimously in favor of providing clinical path forward for developing anti-NGFs for pain associated with osteoarthritis, which we believe represents a significant market opportunity. We are working with the FDA to define the next steps. Turning to our earlier stage programs, we are particularly excited about developments in our oncology pipeline. During the third quarter, we initiated with Sanofi the first clinical trial combining one of our novel anti- angiogenic antibodies with ZALTRAP. In this case, it is our antibody to angiopoietin 2 called Regeneron910. While this is clearly an early first step, we are strong believers in the need to combine different anti-angiogenic modality to improve the impact of angiogenic agents for the treatment of cancer and we are looking forward to testing this and other novel combinations. We also advanced into clinical development another novel oncology antibody that forced outside the Sanofi collaboration. Regeneron 1400 targets ErbB3 an emerging and important target in the epidermal growth factor family.  In addition to on-going trials with EYLEA and ZALTRAP, we now have 10 antibodies in the clinic of which six are partnered with Sanofi. We also have additional earlier stage projects that are advancing towards the clinic and we look forward to updating you as they move forward in development. I’d like to now turn the call over to Bob Terifay, who will provide an update on EYLEA.
Bob Terifay:  Thank you, George. We continue to be proud of the successful launch today of EYLEA or aflibercept injection. And the third quarter was no exception, as evidenced by $244 million in sales.  The overall penetration of EYELA into the wet AMD market continued to grow during the third quarter, both in terms of newly treated patients as well as patients switching for bevacizumab and ranibizumab. Importantly much of this growth came from new retinal practices that appeared to have been bevacizumab only practices in the past.  There are two reasons why physicians reported they are adopting EYELA. First, the convenience of the dosing regimen and secondly, efficacy. Retinal specialist satisfaction with the efficacy of EYLEA was underscored at the recent annual scientific meeting of the American Society of Retinal Surgeons or ASRS, which took place in August. At this meeting there were nine independently prepared presentations from retinal practices around the country that reported their positive initial experiences with EYLEA, specifically in patients switched from ranibizumab for bevacizumab. These data provided additional insight into the differentiated product reception of EYLEA in this specific switch population.  Turning now to reimbursement, remember that EYLEA is a buy and build product and it’s not successful reimbursement is key. We continue to witness successful reimbursement in wet AMD from all the regional Medicare carriers, secondary and supplemental insurers and commercial and private payers. All targeted commercial payers are now covering EYLEA with many of them now having published coverage policies.  As I mentioned last quarter, as of July 1st we were given the temporary Q-code which will be followed by permanent J-code which we expect in January of 2013. As you know, the Q-code facilitates an automated reimbursement. In our experience so far, there has been a streamlining of the reimbursement process following the Q-code. Since the Q-code is issued, physicians indicate that the average time for reimbursement of Medicare claims has improved. We remain very pleased with the growth of EYLEA and wet AMD to-date. As you know another avenue of growth for EYLEA is expansion into other indications. And we’re happy to report that in the third quarter EYLEA received approval for the treatment of macular edema following CRVO in the US Given that EYLEA was only approved for five working days in the third quarter it’s too early launch of the macular edema following CRVO indication to gauge impact on sales. What I share with you is as of today all Medicare carriers have reported that they are reimbursing for EYLEA in this new indication. Turning to our guidance for EYLEA net sales for the remainder of the year, we’re cognizant in with a couple of important factors. As you know we’ve now penetrated the vast majority of accounts that have been identified as ranibizumab accounts. We also have several hundred accounts now purchasing EYLEA that were not identified as ranibizumab account. The numbers of accounts that treat wet AMD and have not yet purchased EYLEA are limited. Second, we see the patients continuing EYLEA therapy are moving towards less frequent dosing. Importantly for the coming quarter, we also expect some seasonality with the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays in the quarter, as we expect many practices to be closed for the last week of the year and some patients will likely delay injections until after the holidays. Beyond the US we see tremendous opportunity for EYLEA. The ex-US wet AMD market is just as big if not bigger than the US market. In the third quarter, we along with our ex-US partner Bayer HealthCare announced that EYLEA had received a positive opinion for the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use to the EU. Bayer launched EYLEA for the treatment of wet AMD in various Europe territories following approval, which is expected later this year. EYLEA has also been approved for the treatment of wet AMD in Australia, Japan, Columbia and Brazil with launches anticipated beginning late this year. I would now like to turn for ophthalmology to oncology, what we made our first foray in the third quarter with the approval of ZALTRAP also known as ziv-aflibercept. We co-commercialized ZALTRAP with our partners Sanofi. Interest in the use of ZALTRAP in its approved medical setting for historically there was no therapy demonstrated to improve overall survival in combination with the standard of care chemotherapy regimen Folfiri, it’s highlighted by the $8.3 million in net sales recorded by Sanofi in the United States from August 20th to September 30th. With that, let me turn the call over to Murray Goldberg.
Murray Goldberg: Thank you, Bob and good morning to everyone. I’m very pleased to discuss our financial results for the third quarter of 2012, which was the third consecutive quarter of profitability for Regeneron. Total revenue this quarter was $428 million, which included EYLEA net sales of $244 million and ARCALYST net sale of $5 million. As Len already mentioned, the revenue for the quarter included a $50 million milestone from Sanofi and a $15 million milestone from Bayer which I’ll discuss in a moment.  In terms of EYLEA, net sales have now grown from a $124 million in the first quarter to a $194 million in the second quarter to $244 million this past quarter. We now forecast full year US EYLEA net sales of $790 to $815 million. EYLEA inventory held by distributors in the third quarter was consistent with prior quarters at about one to two weeks of sales. Sanofi collaboration revenue for the third quarter was $145 million and has a number of components, including reimbursement of our R&D expenses for preclinical and clinical research within our antibody collaboration, as well as our share of the loss associated with preparing for commercialization of ZALTRAP and then launch in August, plus the ZALTRAP milestone payment. As you heard from Bob, we’re very pleased with the $8 million that ZALTRAP net sales in the third quarter, representing about six weeks of initial sales. During the initial launch period, we expect ZALTRAP to operate at a loss. In this quarter our share of that loss was about $7.5 million. Looking forward, we expect this loss to increase, as Sanofi launches ZALTRAP around the world, following approval in each country. The case impact of these early losses on us is litigated by the $50 million approval milestone that we received in the third quarter. Note also, that even after ZALTRAP turns profitable, we’re obligated to begin to repay Sanofi for our share of development costs. So, we do not expect to show profits from ZALTRAP on our income statements for at least the next couple of years. For the third quarter, Bayer Healthcare collaboration revenue was $27 million and represent Bayer’s reimbursement for their share of EYLEA development expenses that we incurred. It also includes the $15 million milestone that we received for the approval of EYLEA in Japan. As Bayer launches EYLEA in each country outside the US, we will start to share commercialization expenses and profits and losses from commercialization in these countries, except for Japan where we receive a royalty on sales. We also expected $10 million milestone in the fourth quarter from Bayer Healthcare upon pricing approval of commercialization of EYLEA outside the US. Cost of goods sold in the third quarter was $20 million or 8.1% of total net product sales consistent with our prior guidance of cost of goods sold, averaging less than 10%. As a reminder, this includes royalty expense in connection with our agreement with Genentech relating to ophthalmic sales of EYLEA in the US. Turning to R&D, non-GAAP R&D expense was $145 million compared to $120 million in the third quarter last year. If we net out R&D reimbursements from our collaborators, from our R&D expense line, our net non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense for the third quarter 2012 was $38 million similar to the $37 million in the second quarter this year. We expect total unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense for the full year to range between $160 million to $200 million which implies a fourth quarter unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense of $50 to $90 million. This potential substantial increase in the fourth quarter is primarily due to the fact that we expect full year discovery pre-clinical spending under the Sanofi antibody agreement to exceed the amount that Sanofi is obligated to reimburse. The difference will all fall into the fourth quarter. Therefore fourth quarter unreimbursed R&D expenses should not be extrapolated as a run rate for 2013. With respect to SG&A, our non-GAAP SG&A expense for the third quarter was approximately $40 million compared to $28 million in the same quarter of 2011. We now expect our full year 2012 non-GAAP SG&A expense to be in the $160 to $180 million range below our prior guidance of $180 to $210 million. As a reminder, non-GAAP R&D and non-GAAP SG&A expenses exclude non-cash share based compensation expense. Turning now to the bottom line, we reported non-GAAP net income of $217 million for the third quarter which translates into non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of $0.89. Non-GAAP EPS excludes non-cash share-based compensation expense and non-cash interest expense related to our senior convertible notes. On a GAAP basis, we reported net income of $191 million and fully diluted EPS of $0.72. Included in both the GAAP and non-GAAP EPS are the two onetime milestones totaling $65 million that went directly to the bottom line. Now that we have reported three consecutive quarters of profitability, it seems appropriate to begin discussing and looking ahead to book and cash income taxes. We currently have significant net operating loss carry-forwards and tax credit carry-forwards available to offset future taxable income. In fact, given the magnitude of our existing NOL and tax credit carry-forwards, plus significant additional tax deductions we expect in connection with future employee exercises of stock options, we do not expect to pay any significant cash income taxes through at least 2014. On a book basis, things are more complicated. Even though we have a large amount of NOLs in tax credits that are available to offset future taxable income, under GAAP, we are not allowed to show a deferred tax asset on our balance sheet due to our outstanding history of operating losses, prior to 2012. Rather, we fully offset our deferred tax assets with what is called evaluation allowance. In each of the past three quarters, when we reported net income, consistent with GAAP, we released enough of this evaluation allowance to offset that net income so that there was no need to provide for any book taxes on that income.  Once we have a sustained history of quarterly profitability, we would be required to release a significant portion or all of the valuation allowance. In that quarter, we will recognize a large onetime, non-cash income tax benefit on our income statement. Since this is a onetime, non-cash benefit, we expect to exclude it from our non-GAAP earnings in that quarter. From then on, consistent with GAAP, we will provide for book taxes on our net income each quarter using our estimated corporate tax rates which we expect to initially be around 40%. As our business continues to grow and we optimize business and financial management strategies, we anticipate that this tax rate will decline overtime. It bears repeating that even though we may begin to report book income taxes on our financial statements, we do not expect to pay any significant cash income taxes in the near future. We have not yet determined whether to include cash taxes or book taxes in our non-GAAP earnings calculation at the time we begin to report book taxes. Our non-GAAP fully diluted shares in the third quarter were approximately a $116 million and include 16 million shares attributable to stock options, restrictive stock and warrants and 4.7 million shares attributable to our convertible notes, accounted for using the 'if converted' method. At September 30th, we have $583 million of cash, restricted cash in marketable securities. In addition, our trade receivables continue to increase and we're $507 million at the end of the quarter which is a reflection of our growing EYLEA sales and long commercial terms. Thank you and with that I'll turn the call over to Len. 
Leonard Schleifer: Thanks Murray, Bob, George, the rest of the Regeneron team for delivering a great quarter. This marks our third quarter of profitability in a row as well as a strong quarter of revenue and earnings growth. We hope this is indicative of what we strive to deliver over the long term, strong top and bottom line growth. In order for us to fulfill this promise we have to continue to continue to invest in R&D and deliver with our pipeline. As always, we thank the patients and their families who use our medicines and enroll in our clinical trials. Let me close by saying that we have always believed that Regeneron’s success is due to its outstanding group of talented and dedicated employees. Thus we are particularly proud that during this quarter, these employees and others recognize Regeneron as the best place to work in the industry as reflected by Science Magazine’s recent ranking of Regeneron as the world's number one Bio Pharmaceutical employer. With that, let me turn the call back over to Michael and open up the call for questions-and-answers. 
Michael Aberman: Thank you, Len. Kevin if you could now open the call for Q&A period.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.
Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank: I guess first question, you have given in the past the percentage of sales of new patients versus previously treated, could you update that? And second on PCSK9, what would be the first trial you think to roll and read out? And how do we think about timelines for data read outs for PCSK9? Thanks.
Michael: Okay. So let me take the second question first, as far as PCSK9 goes, we're going to have an event at the American Heart Association with Sanofi and so that’s probably a better form to give you guidance on the various aspects of the program, it's coming up not too long Robyn, so if you can hold on till early part next month, you get your answers I hope. As far as the specific movement whether the patients are coming from switches, how many switches, whether they're bad and whether they're Lucentis, we really aren’t going to get into that much detail. Bob can you give some general color on where we stand on market share and reiterate that?
Aberman: Okay. So let me take the second question first, as far as PCSK9 goes, we're going to have an event at the American Heart Association with Sanofi and so that’s probably a better form to give you guidance on the various aspects of the program, it's coming up not too long Robyn, so if you can hold on till early part next month, you get your answers I hope. As far as the specific movement whether the patients are coming from switches, how many switches, whether they're bad and whether they're Lucentis, we really aren’t going to get into that much detail. Bob can you give some general color on where we stand on market share and reiterate that?
Bob Terifay: Sure. In the past we've given you information from physician surveys. We’d like to try to get more focus on the actual numbers. So I think what we can tell you is that it best and has about 15% of the overall market at the present time. Among the two products that are specifically approved for use in retinal diseases, total sales were $636 million. Our share of those sales is about 40%. So overall what you can look at is, in the marketplace for anti-VEG-F therapies used in the eye, we have about a 20% market share. Now I remind you that Lucentis is approved but BRVO, CRVO and DME. So part of those sales are for other uses. So, our share is at least 40% or 20% of the AMD market. The other thing I can tell you from our surveys with retinal specialist which is a good indicator of where things are going is that our share of new patients is currently similar to that for Lucentis. So, we are gaining ground and things look very good for the future.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Raymond with Robert Baird & Company. 
Chris Raymond - Robert Baird & Company: Just, one of the dynamics that has kind of hit the news, since the quarter closed is this issue around the meningitis outbreak with compounding pharmacies. Understanding that you don’t want to perhaps give too much color on the quarter, I know you talked about the holidays being hit, but can you maybe talk about the initial reaction you’re hearing from docs in terms of this news item as it relates to Avastin use? And is there anything we should know about that? 
Leonard Schleifer: Thanks for that question Chris. You know, of course at Regeneron like most ethical pharmaceutical companies, our concerned for patients is always paramount and obviously our thoughts go out to all who affected by this tragedy and it really is a tragedy, it’s a bit of a black mark on the US drugs supply system which here therefore we’ve had a really, I’d say excellent track record. It’s worth noting that when all of us think about FDA approvals, that it tempting to think only in terms of the safety and efficacy of the product as measured in clinical trials but there is much more to it. And an important part of the approval process includes inspection of the facilities where the drug will be manufactured and therefore it covers not just the drug but the entire supply chain including manufacture and distribution. In addition, the FDA also has well specified guidelines and recommendations on the ongoing pharmacovigilance with management. So, you know that has not being the case based on the newspaper reports in the compounding pharmacy industry. So I think that there is value to using an FDA approved product. We recognize that there are cost differentials between the off label use of Avastin and the branded products. But nevertheless, we do think that the branded products have important attributes to offer. As to whether or not there will be a structural change in the use of Avastin based on any regulatory or new regulations or laws that may emerge, I think it’s just too early to tell whether there will be a psychological change over from Avastin to wanting people want to use an FDA product, we think that’s possible. People give you all sorts of opinions on that, but we just don’t have any data yet. But I think, over the next quarter or two we should be able to give you a little bit more information. Obviously, we’re going to monitor very carefully what’s going on in Washington and what’s going on in the marketplace. Next question, please? 
Operator: Our next question comes from Joseph Schwartz with Leerink Swann.
Joseph Schwartz - Leerink Swann:  I was wondering regarding the compounded Avastin theme, how much Avastin uses for patients that might have good insurance coverage for EYLEA, but lining up that reimbursement takes time, so physicians might start the patient on Avastin while they wait for payers to approve the patients Is there anything that you can do to encourage more uptake of EYLEA, now you’re your reps have a good story to tell versus just few of the unknown? 
Bob Terifay: So we do have a program in place that will cover practices if they do use EYLEA in a patient and then the patient turns out not to have insurance coverage. So that has not deterred physicians from using EYLEA at the initial dosing. Most of the Avastin use quite frankly is in patients who do have insurance, who could benefit from both EYLEA and Lucentis, but the physicians have chosen to use Avastin because of its price. So, that’s a surprising point. We might have thought if you’re already going into this the Avastin was being reserved only for patients who can afford a branded product, but that is clearly not the case. So there is an opportunity to be able to convert patients and we are seeing, we have been, even before this episode switching from Avastin to our products.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Birchenough with BMO Capital. 
Jim Birchenough - BMO Capital: Congratulations on the strong performance. Couple of questions, just following up on the line of inquiry on Avastin. When you look at Avastin practices that have this concern about financial risk, do you have a sense of what proportion are just not set up in terms of having sophisticated reimbursement, people onsite and what proportion do you have the sophistication to be able to build for EYLEA. So that’s the first question.  Second question, just on dose frequency, any sense of what the trends are there in terms of whether we’re starting to see dose and extend having some impact, some of the headwinds you talk about before? And then a quick question for Murray, at the point where we exhaust the NOLs Murray, and you actually start paying cash income taxes, where do you think that 40% rate will have following to? Thanks.
Leonard Schleifer: So Bob do you want to deal with the issue of whether these practices can and cannot set up for reimbursement in the issuing dosing?
Bob Terifay: So Jim that was a good observation. We’re actually picking up these practices that were all advanced and who are smaller practices, who just didn’t have the infrastructure to ensure that they had the reimbursement to stay profitable and early on with the launch of the Lucentis, they had actually lost money. So we do have our reimbursement people spending time with the smaller practices to make them comfortable with how to manage their inventory so that they don’t lose money on the anti-VEG-F agents. However, there are some larger practices that historically for one reason or another chose to be Avastin only practices, that do have the capabilities, but again, we are starting to see making inroads in those practices and we picked up quite bit of our business from Avastin.
Jim Birchenough - BMO Capital: And dosing?
Bob Terifay: In terms of the dosing again, I don’t give the specifics of a physician surveys, but I can tell you that dosing interval is increasing overtime as physicians move from the three loading doses and we are seeing more and more that physicians are moving towards the every eight week dosing interval.
Murray Goldberg: On the tax side Jim, it’s too early to be able to forecast that. Firstly, we don’t really know when we’ll start paying cash taxes, part of that depends on how quickly we generate profits, cumulative profits and what additional NOLs we generate going forward. So we don’t the timing of when that is. And therefore, we don’t really know at that point how far we’ll have advanced and what we have been able to do in order to bring our tax rate down, but certainly it’s an important goal for us to bring our book tax rate down from that and our cash tax rate down from that 40% level.
Jim Birchenough - BMO Capital: Murray, you meant generate not NOLs in the future but income tax credits so right from…
Murray Goldberg: The options are both okay. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.
Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs: I guess one additional follow-up on the injection frequency, I was wondering if you have any survey data regarding injection frequency in the refractory patients, I know at ASRS it seems like the physician reports were kind of variable in terms of the dosing frequency and schedule they’re using those patients. So I was just wondering what your surveys have picked up out there in the market and then second question on the SG&A front, was impressed the leverage again this quarter and I was wondering, if this is the level we should think about as we go into our years here. 
Leonard Schleifer:  Murray do you want to deal with the SG&A leverage at this point? I mean I don’t think there’s much new here. We know that this is an efficient product to sell and…
Murray Goldberg:  The leverage we get is because we’re based in to the same sales force, six sales force, and as Bob indicated, we’re covering just about all the retinal specialist and their practices so that we can expand sales even both for went AMD and additional indications without having to significantly expand our commercial expenses.
Bob Terifay: In terms of refractory patients, if you go back to some of those presentations at ASRS, the physicians have reported that they were frequently dosing Lucentis or Avastin even on less than a monthly dosing intervals. Some of them were dosing every two weeks for example. What we see with EYLEA, is their first goal is to try to alleviate the ongoing retinal edema that existed in those patients and then they do try to increase the interval overtime and we are seeing that they are able to move the interval off and out from two weeks to four weeks or from four weeks to six weeks and over time, they are trying to stretch that. So, we do see that there is a longer interval in the refractory patients with EYLEA, but again, the more important factor that doctors have focused on is to alleviate that retinal edema and hopefully improve vision.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America.
Steve Byrne - Bank of America: I wanted to ask you little bit more about this switchers, in general for those physicians that switch a patient from either Avastin or Lucentis over to EYLEA, do they in general, move right into the every other months, dose frequency or do they go to the loading dose?
Bob Terifay: So again, this ties back to part of what we’re talking about refractor patients, many of the switches of people that were inadequately controlled with Avastin or Lucentis, so most of those patients are giving loading doses to start. There are some patients who’ve asked to be switched to EYLEA because of living far away from the retinal practice or because of their travel schedules. In some of those patients, they get the three loads, in some cases they switch over to every eight weeks, but the majority of our switches currently do get three loading doses.
Steve Byrne - Bank of America: And are you finding physicians moving to as needed or PRN dosing with EYLEA to the same level they were with Lucentis or Avastin?
Bob Terifay: It’s a mixed bag, there are some physicians who have chosen to go to a more predictable dosing schedule. So we actually have practices that have moved all their patients to every eight week dosing on a schedule and feel that they are getting very good results and that really is the strength of the product. If you can get to a predictable schedule we don’t have to bring them in for monitoring in between, that saves the practice money, saves the healthcare system money and it is much more convenient for the patient. There are other physicians who I wouldn’t call it a PRN dosing schedule but they are using a treat extend dosing schedule which is, they try to extend out the dosing interval by checking on the patient’s vision on a regular schedule and then move it out in two week increments overtime and we do see the interval increasing as we go out in time.
Steve Byrne - Bank of America: And one more for you Bob, if a physician were to treat a patient with EYLEA for DME, is it your observation that they can’t get reimbursement coverage for it?
Bob Terifay: So first of all, we do not promote EYLEA for any use other than the labeled indications of whether AMD and macular edema following CRVO. For the most part, payers are reimbursing specifically for those two indications on select basis, if a physician selects to go to payer and try to get reimbursement for DME, it may be possible. But again, we’re focused on our labeled indications.
Operator: Our next question comes from Yaron Werber with Citigroup.
Yaron Werber - Citigroup: Nice quarter. So, question for Bob and a question for Murray. Just Bob, in terms of CRVO, may be help us understand a little bit the market, how it’s different from AMD. It’s more of a fixed number of injections market. I am just trying to get a sense. How do you kind of think about the rapidity of the uptake or is this kind of a more of a new patient market i.e. maybe even a faster penetration? And then I have a follow-up to Murray.
Bob Terifay: Sure. So, the CRVO market first of all is relatively small compared to the AMD market, about 10% in terms of the patients. In terms of its management, historically people looked at CRVO as a disease that they manage for a six months to a year and then, well first of all, there were no therapies historically, so they did watchful waiting and unfortunately some people lost their vision permanently. But they did think of it as an acute condition that once the clot resolves, that they wouldn't need therapy anymore.  What we've seen in some of the longer term follow up studies from the Lucentis trials, specifically the horizon RVO trial is that, CRVO is a chronic disease. Patients may need anti-VEG-F therapy for several years and we do see the duration of therapy increasing for CRVO. I also think CRVO has been undermanaged in the past, because watchful waiting was the norm, we saw people delaying therapy. What we can tell you from our own trial is that patients who delay treatment for more than two months after they experience the initial incident of CRVO, did not do as well as those who received immediate anti-VEG-F therapy. So we think there's an educational opportunity on RVO. We are focusing our medical specialists on working with physicians to identify more CRVO patients and treat them early, aggressively and chronically. So it may end up being a larger market than 10% over time and it may follow more the AMD dynamics. 
Yaron Werber - Citigroup: And just Murray, for you, when they look at your SG&A currently, I mean you're running around, Q1 was high and even pretty stable Q2 and Q3. I'm just trying to get a sense, is that kind of a good run rate as we think about your base spending from now on. And then R&D aside from this one time pop, I guess my question, is this going to be a onetime pop or is this going to be something that recurs at the end of every year, as you might just decide to spend more than Sanofi is reimbursing. 
Murray Goldberg: Two good questions. In terms of the SG&A, I think as I mentioned earlier, we don't see a need around the EYLEA program for there to be a big increment in commercial expenses in and of itself. I think in terms of G&A you will see some secular trends obviously as the company is growing a lot of those expenses grow with it and the infrastructure necessary to support it, not only the commercial operations but the expansion of our R&D efforts also grows. I think you will see some small increases consistent what you've seen the past aside from the big jump in commercial expenses related to EYLEA. In terms of your other question, on R&D, we focused on the fourth quarter and the fact of the mechanics of how this is going to work in terms of the Sanofi reimbursement. So whether that will happen in each fourth quarter will depend as you point out how much we spend in terms of our discovery research and how that compares to what's reimbursed. So it's hard to predict that but we’ll try to give you a heads up as we did in this third quarter. But beyond that, in terms of the total amount aside of this quirkiness of the Sanofi expanding and reimbursement, the overall amount of what's going to happen unreimbursed R&D will also depend on other things like the progress of our NGF program which is not parted if and when that gets up and running those expenses will be unreimbursed R&D. and some of our investment in other antibodies that are not part of Sanofi collaborations such as George talked about ErbB3 which is first coming on board and other antibodies that are already advancing in Phase I. So we may see some additional spending for those and for as we pursued new technology opportunities also coming out of our own expense. So the overall level of what the unreimbursed R&D would depend on some of these other factors NGF perhaps being a large one of that. So it's an early until we get some feedback from the FDA to talk about when and how much that might be.
Yaron Werber - Citigroup: So we should think about Q4 as 120 base that which was last which was one Q3 plus the additional 50 to 90?
Murray Goldberg: 120 plus the 50, that we gave you our full year guidance of 160 to 200, we know that’s a relatively large range, but we wouldn’t take that fourth quarter rate to 50 to 90 and just automatically assume that's going to be the same thing in the first quarter next year.
Yaron Werber - Citigroup: No, no, no of course, but you kind of back into a fourth quarter 170 to 210 would be the range for the fourth quarter in R&D, just trying to bracket that a little bit all in?
Leonard Schleifer: Yes, we can certainly help you if it's still confusing, following our conference call.
Murray Goldberg: And we’ll update this guidance as we get greater clarity in terms of what we’ll be doing with some of the non-Sanofi programs moving into 2013.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Kantor with Credit Suisse.
Jason Kantor - Credit Suisse: Most of my questions have been asked and answered but I was wondering if you could talk about the potential for the ex-U.S. launch of EYLEA, what you've learned from the U.S. launch? And how you think about, how that drug could be taken up in other countries? What are the factors that could make it move more or less quickly than the U.S.?
Murray Goldberg: Right. So, I think those kind of detailed questions are better left for Bayer, who’s got the rolling more on this one but you can look at the uptake of our product relative to Lucentis’ first four years in the U.S. and you can take a look at the first four years of Lucentis outside the U.S. and then make your own relative guesses on how we’ll do. But if you want more details, I would suggest you talk with our colleagues at Bayer at this point. Just caution to remember of course, it’s not a monolith outside the United States, you don’t get reimbursement in every jurisdiction. These are multiple roll outs, so it’s not like the United States where we rolled out, even though the market size is probably as large outside the United States as it is in the United States, it’s not as easy to address that market as quickly.
Jason Kantor - Credit Suisse:  And then if I could ask another question on the US market, the people that are still using Lucentis predominantly, why are they still doing that? And what are you learning and how can you continue to penetrate those people who maybe who are not early adopters, what is the reason for their sticking with Lucentis versus switching?
Bob Terifay:  So, first of all if somebody is doing well on Lucentis, unless they want to be switched for convenience, the physician is not going to switch them off of a therapy that is working. Remember AMD is a chronic disease. So there are a number of patients on continuing Lucentis therapy that aren’t going to be moved. In terms, of new patients, Lucentis does offer a rebate to high volume accounts and that does influence the decision making in certain accounts.
Operator:  Our next question from (inaudible) with RBC Capital Markets.
Unidentified Analyst: A high level question for you, Lucentis sales were pretty stable this quarter and EYLEA strongly, so can say a bit more about market dynamics that we’re seeing out there. And if you can then specifically, is there some of bolus of patients that are hard to treat, that you think working through and then in terms of future development time for EYLEA, would you do a formal study yourself for the investigator sponsor study in that particular setting, are you good enough and then trials in combination with other agent cancer dose. Thanks.
Leonard Schleifer: I just didn’t hear the last question.
Unidentified Analyst: The second part was that if you can form a big picture then specifically, is there some of bolus of patients that is being worked through, that are hard to treat, would you do a hard to treat study yourself or are the IST good enough? And then lastly combination to studies, if any with EYLEA?
Leonard Schleifer: Well, I think, we’re going to look at the, whether or not it make sense to do a registration study based upon what it would cost, how much it would influence the market, what the endpoints would be. George, want to add anything to that?
George Yancopoulos: Well, certainly this as we’ve already heard a lot of emerging data on these hard to treat patients and we’re certainly seeing how that data matures over time and taken that into consideration as one set in terms of going forward.
Leonard Schleifer: In terms of the first part of your question, I would remind you that Lucentis is relatively stable in sales, but they do have three indications beyond wet AMD. Beyond CRVO, which we share in common with them, they are approved for macular edema following branch, retinal vein occlusion which is a market that is about a third of the AMD market size. And they also are the only product to approve the treatment of diabetic macular edema where there is significant unmet medical need and so there are part of those Lucentis sales, are those uses which has offset the decline in the AMD.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Then if I can just ask on the bolus to you, the condition of bolus? 
Leonard Schleifer:  There are constantly patients who the physician determines are refractory or inadequately controlled with other therapies. Not everyone gets to a dry retina especially on a predictable dosing schedule. So we continue to see switches, but the number of switches or the numbers of switch available patients is lower than when we first launched. 
Bob Terifay:  So remember this will constantly be a sort of a very dynamic and cycling market. You have patients who will stop therapy, these are the elderly patients. Right now we’re only getting approximately half of the branded market going in and therefore a quarter of the overall market and therefore the 75% of the market that are potential bolus patients if you will, that will accumulate as they continue to go. If we gather more and more of the frontend new patients, then obviously that would go down. So it’s very hard to model per-se, to take. If you’ve got a great model, send it along to us. 
Unidentified Analyst: Can I speak on sarilumab since nobody seems to ask on that?
Bob Terifay:  We’re getting very late in time and we have a few more question, and sorry, so we’re going to take two more questions, operator. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Philip Nadeau with Cowen and Company.
Philip Nadeau - Cowen and Company: Just to first, just looking for an update on your PDGFF efforts, when can that enter the clinic and when can we see data? And then second on ZALTRAP pricing, there was a prominent cancer institution here in New York City that recently made some noise about ZALTRAP’s pricing. So, it’s really been clear to me how many refractory patients used low-dose Avastin versus high-dose. Could you give us some sense of how you think ZALTRAP is actually priced relative to the actual Avastin dose that’s being used in refractory patients? Thanks.
Bob Terifay: As part of the pricing and all that issue, we should really have only one spokesperson for that and that’s been Sanofi’s. People are more than happy to discuss those issues with you. If you need a contact, we’ll give you a contact there. In terms of PDGF, George, you want to make any comments about that?
George Yancopoulos:
Bob Terifay: So we hope next year to be in the clinic. Good, Michael, turn it back over to you we have one more.
Michael Aberman: Actually given the time, it’s already 9:30, I think we’re going to wrap it up here. I apologize to anybody who didn’t make it on the call obviously. We will be available immediately following this call to answer any further questions. So again, operator this concludes our third quarter call. Thank you everybody for participating.
Operator: So ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.

Operator:  Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals conference call to discuss the second quarter 2012 financial results. My name is Kevin and I’ll be your coordinator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question and answer session towards the end of this conference call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Michael Aberman, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations for Regeneron. Please proceed, Dr. Aberman.
Dr. Michael Aberman: Thank you, Operator, and good morning and welcome to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals’ second quarter 2012 conference call. An archive of this webcast will be available under Events and Presentations for 30 days. Joining me on the call today is Dr. Leonard Schleifer, the Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; George Yancopoulos, Executive Vice President, Chief Scientific Officer and President of Regeneron Research Labs; Murray Goldberg, Chief Financial Officer, and Robert Terifay, Senior Vice President, Commercial. After our prepared remarks, we’ll open the call for Q&A. I would also like to remind you that remarks made on this call that are not historical in nature may be forward-looking statements about Regeneron and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual events and our actual results may differ materially. Such remarks may include but are not limited to those related to Regeneron and its products and business, sales forecasts, financial forecasts, development programs, collaborations, finances, regulatory matters, intellectual property and competition, all of which involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A more complete description of these and other material risks can be found in Regeneron’s filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, including its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 and Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2012 which we filed this morning. Regeneron does not undertake any obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless required by law.  GAAP and non-GAAP measures will be discussed on today’s call. Information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP are available in our financial results press release, which can be accessed on our website. Once our call concludes, myself and the IR team will be available to answer further questions. With me, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: Thanks, Michael. Good morning to everyone. In terms of the agenda for today, following my brief introductory remarks, George Yancopoulos, Chief Scientific Officer, will provide an update on our pipeline. Bob Terifay, Senior Vice President of Commercial, will then provide an update on the EYLEA launch, and Murray Goldberg, our Chief Financial Officer will wrap up with financial highlights before I offer some concluding remarks and we open the call for questions and answers. Today we are happy to report a very successful quarter as our team continues to execute on the ongoing launch of EYLEA, also known as intravitreal aflibercept injection. We saw strong quarter-over-quarter growth with U.S. net sales of $194 million, representing a 57% increase over the last quarter. Given the trajectory of the launch to date, tempered by the potential for less frequent dosing as doctors increase the interval between injections of EYLEA, we are increasing our full-year U.S. EYLEA net sales forecast to between 700 and 750 million from a prior 500 to 550 million. If we achieve this new forecast, EYLEA will become one of the best drug launches in the history of the biotechnology industry. In a few minutes, Bob Terifay will go into some more details on the launch. Importantly, the strong EYLEA sales growth translated into even stronger earnings growth where we saw non-GAAP net income rise more than 2.5-fold from $40 million last quarter to slightly over $100 million in the second quarter of 2012, which translated into non-GAAP fully diluted earnings per share of $0.90. Obviously we are pleased by both the performance of EYLEA as well as its ability to fuel the Company’s earnings. The ability to translate sales growth into strong earnings growth while still investing heavily in our robust and internally discovered pipeline that includes 10 antibodies into addition to our three traps, highlights our relatively unique business model. Our PDUFA date in the U.S. for our SBLA for EYLEA for CRVO is September 23, and an approval would further expand the EYLEA opportunity. As a reminder, the strong commercial results for EYLEA only reflect the launch of EYLEA in the U.S. Outside the United States, our partner Bayer Healthcare has already receiving marketing approval in two countries – Australia and Colombia – and we are awaiting regulatory decisions in the EU, Japan, and other countries. We expect the global launch to start toward the end of the year. To that end, during the second quarter Bayer Healthcare consummated an agreement with Santen, the market-leading ophthalmology company in Japan to co-promote EYLEA in Japan. We think this will accelerate the launch and further bolster the opportunity in Japan. Beyond EYLEA, we await FDA action on our application to market Zaltrap or aflibercept injection for intravenous infusion in combination with a Folfiri chemotherapy regimen for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer that was previously treated with an oxalplatin-containing regimen. We are also advancing our robust pipeline, including our late stage Phase III programs: sarilumab targeting the IL6 receptor, and Regeneron 727 targeting PCSK9. Let me highlight PCSK9 briefly because that is a program that is generating a lot of excitement, not only within Regeneron but within the clinical community and pharmaceutical industry. Surely, we have a lot of competitors but we believe we are in the lead and are committed to trying to stay in front. We and our partner, Sanofi, just announced that we have initiated our broad 22,000 patient Phase III program known as Odyssey. In addition, Sanofi has formed a dedicated development unit for the program, emphasizing their commitment to this important investigational agent. With that, let me turn to our Chief Scientific Officer, George Yancopoulos, to highlight some of the important achievements in our pipeline during the second quarter.
George Yancopoulos: Thanks, Len. Our clinical and regulatory teams continue to be extremely busy with three BLAs currently under review at the FDA and regulatory decisions expected in the next few months. First, Zaltrap for the treatment of previously treatment metastatic colorectal cancer has a PDUFA date of August 4. We are only a few days away from the PDUFA date and are hopeful for a timely approval. While we do have a substantial development cost repayment obligation to Sanofi that will limit our recognition of any profits for Zaltrap for some time, Zaltrap potentially represents our first commercial foray into oncology. As a reminder, we have been pioneers in the field of angiogenesis, so it is particularly satisfying to be able to look forward to making Zaltrap, our VEGF trap, available to patients. Moreover, in our clinical pipeline are two antibodies to novel angiogenesis targets – angiopoieten 2 and Dll4 – that have the potential to improve upon VEG-F inhibition alone.  Second, we had previously submitted our SBLA for EYLEA for the treatment of central retinal vein occlusion, or CRVO, which has a September 23 PDUFA date. We also will be following the upcoming FDA advisory committee meeting on anti VEG-F therapy for DME very closely as both of our Phase III trials for EYLEA in DME, Vista DME and Vivid DME, are fully enrolled. As a reminder, outside the U.S. approval in DME can come within one year of efficacy data while in the U.S. current FDA guidance requires two years.  We have also started enrollment in a Phase III trial for branch retinal vein occlusion, or BRVO; and finally, we are less optimistic for the supplemental BLA for ARCALYST, or rilonacept, for the prevention of gout flares in patients initiating uric acid lowering therapy, which has a PDUFA date of July 30. As most of you know, an arthritis advisory committee convened by the FDA voted against approval of ARCALYST in this indication. While the advisory committee’s decision is not binding on the FDA, we have low expectations for an approval in this indication at this time and are working to determine the appropriate path forward. We continue to market ARCALYST for the treatment of CAS.  Turning to our antibody pipeline, we now have advanced two antibodies from a broad antibody collaboration with Sanofi into Phase III testing – Regeneron 727 for cholesterol lowering, and sarilumab for rheumatoid arthritis. As Len mentioned, Regeneron 727 is our cholesterol lowering PCSK9 antibody which continues to garner a great amount of interest from the clinical community as a potential first-in-class new treatment for high cholesterol. During the second quarter, we presented positive Phase II data at a late-breaking session of the European Atherosclerosis Society and also announced publication of these data in The Lancet. Our Phase II program as a whole showed that Regeneron 727 can significantly reduce LDL cholesterol, also known as the bad cholesterol, up to more than 70% in a variety of settings, including in patients who are not at goal on maximum doses of other background lipid lowering therapies such as high dose statins. In the Phase II program, injection site reactions were the most common adverse event, and rare cases of hypersensitivity reaction were also reported. With that in mind, Sanofi and Regeneron announced just a few days ago the launch of the 22,000 patient global Phase III program for PCSK9, called Odyssey, which will consist of more than 10 clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Regeneron 727 in a broad range of patients. This will be the first Phase III program evaluating a PCSK9 targeted therapy. As described in our press release last Friday, the Phase III program will test the efficacy and safety of Regeneron 727 in a variety of patients with high unmet medical needs, such as patients with familial hypercholesterolemia and those with elevated cardiovascular risk who cannot reach their LDL cholesterol goals with current standard lipid lowering therapies. The market opportunity is large, with 10 million patients in the U.S. alone who are not at goal despite being on existing therapies. LDL cholesterol lowering remains the primary objective for the management of hypercholesterolemia, and this has been supported by a large body of data. Based on our end of Phase II discussions with the U.S. and European regulatory authorities during the second quarter, we expect LDL cholesterol to be the primary endpoint for our regulatory filings and the basis for our initial approval. Obviously, this depends on an acceptable safety profile in the Phase III studies and no sea change in the regulatory view around LDL as a valid surrogate endpoint. The Odyssey program includes a large cardiovascular outcomes trial that will enroll approximately 18,000 patients and will start later this year. We expect this trial to be well underway at the time of the BLA filing for Regeneron 727, but we do not anticipate that the final results of that trial will be a prerequisite for filing. Sarilumab, our subcutaneous IL6 receptor antibody for rheumatoid arthritis continues to enroll patients in the Phase III mobility trial. There is growing excitement about the IL6 class of drugs, given data recently presented for ACTEMRA, or tocilizumab, an approved IL6 antibody, in a head-to-head study versus Humira, or adalimumab, the leading anti-TNF for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. There are 2.7 million patients treating worldwide for RA each year. We look forward to initiating additional sarilumab Phase III studies with our partner, Sanofi, later this year. Another positive development for our pipeline, as we mentioned on our last call, was an FDA advisory committee’s unanimous vote in favor of a role for the ongoing development of anti-nerve growth factor – anti-NGF – agents for pain associated with osteoarthritis. Pain represents an enormous unmet need and it is estimated that 25 million patients worldwide suffer from moderate to severe osteoarthritis, and about 4 million of them are intolerant to or poorly responsive to existing therapies. We also can report that we have had discussions with the FDA and look forward to updating you on the clinical development plans for our anti-NGF antibody, Regeneron 475, once they are finalized. As a reminder, we have full sole rights to Regeneron 475.  I’d like to now turn the call over to Bob Terifay to provide an update on the EYLEA launch.
Robert Terifay: Thank you, George. Our commercial organization is thrilled with the reception that EYLEA has received in the wet AMD market, as evidenced by the 56% growth in our net product sales for the second quarter to $194 million. We believe that there are several factors that have contributed to the huge strength of our launch. Our market research suggests that EYLEA enjoys an increasing level of market awareness. This market awareness, combined with the fact that EYLEA offers clinically equivalent efficacy to monthly Lucentis, or ranibizumab, with the convenience of less than monthly dosing; and secondly, that many doctors continue to switch patients from Lucentis and off-label Avastin, or bevacizumab, to EYLEA has allowed to establish what we believe is a very strong foothold in the wet AMD market.  Based on qualitative market research surveys that we conducted towards the end of June of 2012, EYLEA has now been used in approximately 90% of all accounts where Lucentis has been used, up from the 70% that was reported in the first quarter. Clearly, this indicates that some of our growth this past quarter came from an increase in the number of accounts that are using EYLEA. In terms of penetration and/or market share within these accounts, our market research suggests that EYLEA has now captured approximately 14% of the overall wet AMD anti-VEGF market by volume. This is an increase from the 10% market share that we estimated on our first quarter earnings call. Based on qualitative market research survey results, we estimate at the time of our survey, patients continuing on EYLEA represent approximately 40% of our sales. Thirty-five percent comes from wet AMD patients new to anti-VEGF therapy, and the remaining 25% come from patients switching from other anti-VEGF therapies. In terms of our switches, our new market research indicates that about half of the switches are coming from Avastin. Both efficacy and the convenience of less than monthly dosing are cited as the key drivers for starting our naïve patient and switching a patient to EYLEA from either Avastin or Lucentis.  In order to better understand the dynamics of this market, including the reason why patients switch to EYLEA, we look forward to the upcoming American Society of Retinal Surgeons meeting in Las Vegas in August where there will be a special session devoted to independently prepared presentations from several retinal practices around the country reporting on their initial experiences with EYLEA in this specific patient population of switches.  There are several factors that influence a successful drug launch. One of the key drivers for a buy and bill product such as EYLEA is successful reimbursement. To this end, we’ve made an effort to streamline and facilitate the reimbursement process. We continue to see successful reimbursement from all of the regional Medicare carriers, secondary and supplemental insurers, and commercial and private payors. All targeted commercial payors are now covering EYLEA with several commercial payors now have published coverage policies. We have also seen broad adoption by hospital formularies. We expect to receive our permanent J-code in January of 2013 and anticipate that this will further streamline the automated EYLEA claims process and provide an additional degree of comfort to those accounts who might have been sitting on the sidelines, awaiting confirmation that reimbursement would not be an issue for them. In the meantime, on July 1 our temporary Q-code for EYLEA went into effect. A Q-code is a temporary but specific code for EYLEA that results in automated reimbursement. To ensure as seamless a transition as possible to the Q-code from the miscellaneous J-code, we have in place a team of regional business managers who are working closely with physician office managers to facilitate reimbursement. We’ve already seen that certain Medicare carriers who had slow processing turnaround times for claims submitted using a miscellaneous J-code have already processed claims more quickly using the EYLEA-specific Q-code that only became available on July 1. While these sales metrics are reassuring and we expect continued growth in EYLEA usage, we are mindful that it is unrealistic to expect this pace of growth to continue for the remaining two quarters of the year. With more and more of our sales coming from patients continuing on EYLEA treatment, we do expect an impact on patients moving from the monthly loading dose phase to less monthly dosing regimens, including the every-other-month dosing regimen recommended in the EYLEA prescribing information. We also expect to see a decline in the number of patients available in each practice to be switched to EYLEA from other VEG-F inhibitors. In addition, since we’ve now penetrated about 90% of the accounts that are known to have used Lucentis, we expect a slowdown in the rate of new account growth. On the other hand, as doctors gain experience with EYLEA in both naïve patients and switches, we also expect further share gains in both of these segments. Bottom line is that we expect continued growth for EYLEA but at a slower rate in the second half of the year.  As a result, we are increasing our full-year EYLEA U.S. net sales forecast to 700 to $750 million. If our new forecast is achieved, it would make EYLEA one of the top biopharmaceutical product launches of all time. Turning outside the United States, which we expect to be a significant contributor to EYLEA growth in 2013 and beyond, EYLEA was recently approved for the treatment of wet AMD in both Australia and Colombia. In addition, our partner Bayer Healthcare has filed for the wet AMD indication in Europe and Japan and we anticipate approval and launches on a country-by-country basis in Europe and Japan starting at the end of this year and continuing throughout 2013. Bayer has also announced that they plan to submit a filing and CVRO indication shortly following ex-U.S. wet AMD approvals. As Len mentioned earlier, Bayer entered into a co-promotion agreement with Santen in Japan. We and Bayer expect this agreement will allow EYLEA to have broader and faster reach into the Japanese ophthalmology community. As part of this agreement, we’ve converted our profit split in Japan into a tiered royalty of between 33.5 and 40% on EYLEA net sales in Japan. While the EYLEA launch is only just the beginning, its initial early success increases our confidence that EYLEA can continue not only to deliver near-term growth through the continued launch in wet AMD in the United States and shortly outside the United States, but also long-term revenue growth through expansion into new indications globally.  Now let me turn it back to Len.
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: Thanks, Bob. Before moving to Murray to review the financial results, let me take a moment to address the competitive landscape in wet AMD and our long-term vision for Regeneron and ophthalmology. EYLEA represents the culmination of years of internal research and development for Regeneron in the field of angiogenesis, where we were early pioneers and made seminal discoveries. We were not the first anti-VEGF to reach the market for the treatment of eye diseases; in fact, EYLEA is the third approved anti-VEGF product after Macugen and then Lucentis. However, our goal is for EYLEA to become the global market leader. Given this history, we are very aware that research and innovation will not stop at EYLEA, and patients and physicians will be looking for the next innovation in the treatment of wet AMD. Thus, we continue to invest in research to not only find ways to improve EYLEA but also to find novel approaches and targets to treat wet AMD and other eye diseases. For example, in the Sanofi collaboration we are developing an angiopoieten 2 antibody for cancer that, based on preclinical data, may also have potential to be developed for the treatment of diseases of the eye. Over the last several years, our scientists have also been exploring the role of platelet-derived growth factor, or PDGF, in angiogenesis. We currently have a high affinity PDGF antibody in pre-clinical development that we expect to be in the clinic in 2013. As a reminder, Sanofi has certain option rights to our antibodies. It is important to note that a blocking PDGF does provide an added benefit over VEG-F inhibition alone in diseases of the eye. We believe it is important to try and develop a potent inhibitor, combine it with the best VEG-F blocker, and attempt to develop it as a single co-formulated injection if possible. Importantly, we know firsthand how long and difficult the road to the market can be, as it took approximately four years from the first patient enrolled in our Phase III EYLEA program to our initial launch in the U.S. As such, from what we see in the competitive landscape now, we don’t expect any new entrants to the wet AMD market before the 2017-2018 time frame. That said, we are committed to investing to maintain our leadership position through continued innovation. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Murray, who will review our second quarter financial results.
Murray Goldberg: Thank you, Len, and good morning to everyone. I’m very pleased to discuss our financial results for the second quarter of 2012 which brought Regeneron to a new milestone with over $100 million of non-GAAP profit in a quarter. Total revenues in the second quarter were $304 million. This included $194 million of EYLEA net sales and about $6 million of ARCALYST net sales. The gross to net adjustment for EYLEA sales was similar to last quarter at approximately 7.5%. For EYLEA, this quarter’s distributor inventory remained consistent with prior quarters at about one to two weeks of inventory on hand. As a result, EYLEA net sales included a modest increase in distributor inventory of about $10 million. Collaboration revenue was $98 million in the second quarter. This primarily included Sanofi’s reimbursement to us of $92 million for antibody and Zaltrap R&D expenses that we incurred, offset by approximately $8 million in pre-commercialization expenses for Zaltrap that Sanofi incurred and that we reimbursed them for. Our reimbursement to Sanofi is accounted for as contra-revenue.  Looking forward in 2012, this line will include growing pre-commercialization expenses for Zaltrap in preparation for potential launch in a variety of countries at the end of this year and next year. Our share of these pre-commercialization expenses would potentially be at least partially offset by an approval milestone of $50 million if we were to receive regulatory approval from the FDA.  Bayer Healthcare collaboration revenue was about $9 million in the second quarter and primarily represents Bayer’s cost-sharing of some of the EYLEA development expenses that we incurred. As EYLEA launches globally, Bayer Healthcare collaboration revenue will also include our share of the pre-commercialization expenses and our share of the profits and losses from commercialization outside the United States, as well as potential approval and sales milestones from Bayer. Cost of goods sold in the second quarter was $22 million or 10.9% of net product sales overall and about 10.5% for EYLEA. This includes royalty expense in connection with our Genentech license agreement relating to ophthalmic sales of EYLEA in the U.S. It also includes inventory write-offs and reserves of approximately $6.5 million that increased cost of goods sold for the quarter. Non-GAAP R&D expense was $136 million for the second quarter this year, about the same as in the second quarter last year. If we back out R&D reimbursements from our partners during the quarter from our R&D line, our net non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense for the second quarter was $37 million compared to $34 million in the first quarter. We anticipate that this net R&D expense will continue to trend upward through the remainder of 2012 and would increase much faster if antibodies outside the Sanofi collaboration, such as our NGF antibody Regeneron 475, move into advanced stage clinical trials. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $40 million for the second quarter this year compared to $20 million in the second quarter last year. The increase in SG&A expense versus last year is primarily due to the fully-burdened cost of the EYLEA field force and other EYLEA commercialization-related expenses. In April, we provided full-year non-GAAP SG&A expense guidance of 180 to $210 million. In the event that the FDA does not grant approval for ARCALYST for the prevention of gout flares in patients initiating uric acid lowering therapy, which is what we currently expect, our non-GAAP SG&A would be on the lower end of that range. As a reminder, non-GAAP R&D and non-GAAP SG&A expenses exclude non-cash share-based compensation expense. Turning to the bottom line, we reported non-GAAP net income of $102 million for the second quarter which is equivalent to non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of $0.90. Non-GAAP net income excludes non-cash share-based compensation expense and non-cash interest expense related to our convertible senior notes. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $77 million or $0.70 per diluted share. For the full year, we expect to be profitable on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. As you will note, despite turning profitable for the quarter, we have not provided for a tax liability as we have released a portion of our full valuation allowance against our large balance of net operating loss carry-forwards and other tax credits. When we transition into showing consistent profits, we’ll provide more guidance on the accounting treatment of these NOLs and tax credits. On a cash basis, we do not anticipate that we will have a cash tax liability for at least several years. Our non-GAAP fully diluted average shares outstanding in the second quarter were approximately 115 million shares and include about 16 million shares attributable to stock options, restricted stock, and warrants accounted for using the treasury method, and about 5 million shares associated with our convertible notes accounted for using the if-converted method.  At June 30, we had $597 million of cash and marketable securities compared to 811 million at year-end 2011. The decrease is primarily attributable to the extended payment terms on EYLEA sales. As you will recall, in connection with the launch of EYLEA, we offered our distributors extended payment terms and they in turn offered physicians extended payment terms of up to six months to provide ample time for physicians to receive reimbursement from Medicare and other insurance providers for their EYLEA usage. At June 30, our trade receivables totaled about $350 million, almost all related to EYLEA sales. Now that we are in the ninth month of launch, those receivables have begun to be paid down though the account balance continues to increase because of our growing EYLEA sales. For the second half of this year, we currently expect to be cash positive. Thank you, and with that I’ll turn the call back to Len.
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: Thanks Murray, Bob, George. This was truly another great quarter for Regeneron. Let me conclude today’s call by making a few comments about the bigger picture for Regeneron. This quarter marks another step forward towards our goal of becoming a leading biopharmaceutical company, as well as a long-term growth company for investors both in terms of revenue and earnings. At a time when many large pharmaceutical companies are cutting back their research, shutting down major research centers and looking externally for innovative science and product opportunities, we are investing in research, investing in our people, and expanding our manufacturing capacity. We are also seeing our past investments and collaborations bear fruit with a robust pipeline that has multiple BLAs under review at the FDA, 10 antibodies in the clinic, two of which are in Phase III, and additional new antibodies expected to enter the clinic by the end of this year and each year thereafter.  All of these products and product candidates were invented at Regeneron by Regeneron scientists and Regeneron Laboratories, led by George Yancopoulos, our Chief Scientific Officer and my partner since the founding of the company over 20 years ago. This is an exciting time for Regeneron, and I want to again thank our dedicated employees who have helped us achieve our goals, the many investors who have stuck with us for a long time, patiently waiting to see us reach this point, and all the patients, their family members and physicians who have participated in our clinical trials and will continue to contribute to our future. With that, let me turn the call back over to Michael for questions.
Dr. Michael Aberman: Thank you, Len. That concludes our prepared remarks. We’d now like to open the call for Q&A. As we’d like to give as many people a chance to ask questions as possible, we do request that you limit yourself to one question. The IR team will be available in our office after the call for follow-up questions. Thank you, and Operator, if you could please open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America.
Steve Byrne – Bank of America: Hi. I wanted to drill into your survey results a little bit more, Bob. You mentioned 14% share of wet AMD by volume. I assume that’s by patients. I was wondering if out of that 35% that is for patients naïve to anti-VEGF, can you comment on what your share is of that pool of patients, what portion of those are being treated with EYLEA relative to alternative VEG-Fs?
Robert Terifay:  So Steve, to clarify, the way we have calculated our share is based upon eyes, so the equivalent of that would be a vial of drug. In terms of market share, I just need to remind you – these were market shares projected by physicians in a qualitative survey in June. It is not based on a chart audit or anything, so it’s physician perceptions. Now, what they’ve reported is that the market share overall, as well as the new patient market share, are fairly similar at about 14%; but again, it’s qualitative. It’s not a chart audit.
Steve Byrne – Bank of America: And one geographic region I didn’t hear mentioned about was Brazil. Is Bayer looking into the opportunity in that country?
Robert Terifay: Bayer is looking globally. We haven’t discussed filing strategies outside of EU and Japan as of yet.
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: But you can be sure that over time they’ll be in every significant market.
Dr. Michael Aberman: Great. Next question, please?
Operator: The next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank. 
Alethia Young – Deutsche Bank: This is Alethia on behalf of Robyn. Congrats, guys, on a strong quarter, not only in rev but in earnings, too. Can you just talk about what you’ve learned in the U.S. that would be applicable around the doctors for the global launch of EYLEA, please?
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: Yeah, it’s a good question. When we launched the product, of course, we were very pleased that we had what you would say is a front-line label – that it’s indicated for the treatment of wet AMD. But of course, doctors tend to try a new drug in their most difficult patients, and what we learned is that that turns out to be a great strategy for us because they were very pleased with how that turned out, whether it was switches or people who weren’t getting adequate response or still wet, and you’ll hear more about that in the presentations, I think, from some of these practices in the retinal meetings in August in Las Vegas. But I would say that the big thing to remember is that the EU and the rest of the world are not one market like the United States is, so you don’t know exactly how things are going to play; and this may play great in one place and in another place it may be driven solely by negotiating price, and someplace else it may be just driven by how well the sales people there are ready. But I think that if there’s one overriding thing that we’ve learned and I think Bayer obviously has learned is that the docs like the product, so the more we can get doctors to start using the product, that becomes our best selling effort.
Dr. Michael Aberman: Next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Raymond with Robert Baird and Company.
Chris Raymond – Robert W. Baird: Thanks. You know, I’m not sure I caught all the detail that you had on your developmental efforts with the anti-PDGF and the angiopoieten 2. Could you maybe just go back and give a little bit more detail – is it your plan to develop a co-formulated VEG-F PDGF therapy, or is this separate? And are these two agents – PDGF and angiopoieten – are you going to pursue these in parallel? Can you maybe just give us a little bit more detail on that, please?
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: Right. I don’t want to get into the details of our development plans and strategy, because this is a competitive area. But let me just make another comment or a reiterated comment I made when we presented our opening remarks, which is that the effect that’s been reported to date with a PDGF aptamer was a rather modest effect of about four letters difference between Lucentis alone, and it took two different injections to get that. What we think the lesson there is, is that (a) there should be caution, and if there’s more questions we can drill down why there should be caution, of whether or not that is going to repeat in further studies; second, we believe that a modest effect size like that would best be delivered to the marketplace if you had a co-formulated – that is, you could inject once into the eye. And finally, we believe that if you’re going to go down this path, you want to go down the path with the best PDGF blocker that you can, and the aptamer—we don’t think that the aptamer necessarily—like anything else, the first one may or may not be necessarily the best one.
Dr. Michael Aberman: Next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.
Terence Flynn – Goldman Sachs: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Congrats on another solid quarter. I guess I had two – one is on the guidance front. If you can just maybe give us your thoughts on where you see the greatest uncertainty in your guidance. Is it either at the front end so that new patients coming on, or is it at the back end in terms of the transition from induction to maintenance dosing? And then just a follow-up on the PDGF front – can you tell us, maybe walk us through some of the challenges of potentially including two antibodies in one injection? And that’s it for me, thanks.
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: So Bob, if you want to deal with the first question, and then we can deal, George, with the second one.
Robert Terifay: Sure. So we are encouraged by the survey results that indicate that we have an annuity of patients at this time; the continuing patient segment is growing. Now remember, the dosing for patients is three initial monthly doses followed by dosing every eight weeks, and we do see that in both the naïve as well as the switch patients, that the dosing interval is expanding beyond that four weeks after the initial loading dose period. So we’ll see fewer injections in those continuing patients once they get past the initial monthly loading dose phase. However, we do see growth in new patients, which is exactly where we expect to get our revenues from; and as you would expect, there was a pool of patients ready for switching that is not drying up but decreasing because there was some pent-up demand. So I think what you’ll see is fewer injections in the continuing, decreased overall number of switches, and we’ll have continued growth in the new.
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: How that equation gets solved obviously creates the uncertainty in the marketplace. George, do you want to address the issues of co-formulation and things like that?
George Yancopoulos: Well the good news about trying to combine or co-formulate two very similar types of biologics is that the technical or scientific hurdles are relatively minor, so there really aren’t too many technical hurdles with co-formulation. Of course, there will be regulatory issues, and probably the most difficult issue is of course trying to get the dose and the regimens correct. Obviously, I’m sure you’re all aware, that’s the most complicated thing about this, and it’s going to take a large number of studies and attempts and so forth to figure out if there is a benefit to adding a second agent, how best to dose, and interval and frequent that second type of an agent. It’s going to be obviously very challenging for the whole field, including for us, to do that.
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: George, could you address the reproducibility of small effects and what we’ve learned in that?
George Yancopoulos: Right. I guess what Len is referring to is in the existing Phase II data with the PDGF agent, there was an apparent difference of about four letters with the double dosing, giving two injections of both the PDGF agent as well as an anti-VEGF agent. And obviously these results are very interesting and exciting, and they suggest that there may be a combination benefit. On the other hand, reason for concern and caution is simply that obviously in small studies like these, the relative differences between two dose groups, even if in a particular study it may appear statistically significant, are not necessarily always reproduced when done again.  So just to give you a very simple example, two dosing groups that look in our integrated analysis to be no different, two different dosing regimens that we tried in our large Phase III program where each study was more than twice as large as the reported PDGF study, in one study the relative difference between agents was four letters, and then in the other study the relative difference between the two agents went two letters in the opposite direction, meaning that there was a six-letter swing between the two studies, which as I said each one was more than twice as large as the Phase II studies just reported for the PDGF agent. So though there’s reason to be excited, and we’ve certainly been pursuing this pathway for many years, and as Len said we think we may have a top candidate for combination type studies, there’s a lot of reason for caution about whether there really is a benefit; and even if there is, I think there’s going to be a lot of effort required to figure out how to optimize such a co-therapy.
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: Good, George, and I think we’ll go on to the next question. One last point before we go on on that issue is that one has to be careful also about how selective these patients were, how generalizable it is. You don’t know if diabetics were treated and there were other restrictions. So I think there’s a lot of time and things to be done and learned. We’re clearly paying close attention. Next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Birchenough with BMO Capital.
Jim Birchenough – BMO Capital: Hey guys. Let me add my congratulations. Just on the market dynamics and trying to anticipate what proportion of patients might go from induction to maintenance dosing, right now as you look at patients on EYLEA, what proportion are getting monthly dosing versus every two month dosing? And then just wondering if you can help size the treatment-naïve market in AMD, how many new patients do you see coming on each quarter and what’s the share—if you can remind us, what’s the share there in the naïve patients? Thanks.
Dr. Leonard Schleifer:  Bob?
Robert Terifay: So I’ll start with the naïve patient. New patients in the wet AMD market coming in are roughly 25 to 30% of the overall market. In terms of where things are settling out on the dosing, it’s really too early because we constantly—as you saw, we have people who are just staring EYLEA, a fairly large group that are, even when they are switched, are generally being started on a monthly loading dose, period. So we’re seeing the dosing interval go out over time. I think we’ll have a better sense in future earnings calls, but it would be premature to give you a specific time right now.
Operator: The next question comes from Yaron Werber with Citi.
Yaron Werber – Citi: Hey, congrats also. Great quarter. If you don’t mind, I just have kind of two questions. One, just help us understand the timing in Europe for approval. It was filed back in June last year, so we’re now kind of almost 14 months into it. So why would the approval be all the way at the end of the year and not earlier than that, and I’m just talking about the approval, not the actual reimbursement approval. And then secondly just as a follow-up to the discussion on the aptamer PDGF, if you look at the previous data – again, admittedly small patient numbers, but very interesting data. It showed really a remarkable ability to dry the eyes. I think one of the concerns is the total number of injections will go down over time as people do treat and extend and they’re using OCT. So what are your thoughts on that?
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: So on the first one regarding the timing, I think Bayer is in charge of that and the timing is what they’ve said. You can pursue that further with them. As far as the PDGF and the drying of the eye, you know, you might recall—you have to remember what it’s being compared to. Lucentis, from our studies, our own head-to-head, had less dry eyes than EYLEA did, and so you’re talking about eyes that are not completely dry as it is under anti-VEGF therapy. And you should also, obviously, remember that there is not a perfect correlation between drying of an eye and visual acuity.  Next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from Biren Amin with Jefferies.
Biren Amin – Jefferies:  Yeah, thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to maybe focus on the EYLEA DME ongoing Phase III program, and after the briefing documents released yesterday, it seems FDA prefers proportion of patients gaining three lines over a three-year period, and given the (audio interference) is designed for visual acuity changes at two years at baseline, would you expect to revise Vista trial design based on FDA commentary?
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: I think we’ve had a pretty good discussion with the FDA about our trials, and if after the results of this advisory committee meeting, if there’s anything to do, obviously we’re going to watch it carefully. The FDA accepts both types of endpoints as long as there’s a certain magnitude of effect, and I believe our trial design is also a little bit different. We have an active control of laser versus they had rescue, so the trials are not exactly analogous but we feel comfortable right now with our trial design. But of course, we’ll look at it in light of what gets discussed. Next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from Mani Mohindru with ThinkEquity
Mani Mohindru – ThinkEquity: Hi, thanks for taking my questions, and my congrats to your team as well. I just wanted to get a better sense of your guidance. You know, you keep coming and surprising us, so trying to see what your thought process is in your updated guidance. Are you including any CRVO estimates there, and are you also taking into account some impact of the newly implemented Q-code that just went into effect earlier this month? Trying to get a sense if those two things are playing into your new guidance. And on the Q-code front, I know it’s very early, but have you seen any kind of impact in the few weeks that it’s been on? Thanks.
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: So two points – we never plan or project or incent based on anything but the proved indication, so that estimate is based solely on our view of the approved marketplace. But we can’t be sure, of course. We don’t always get the data to be sure of what it’s doing, so it’s our best guess, okay? And you say we’re surprising you – we get surprised as well, and so it really is our best estimate. The other question you had is whether the Q-code has seen any effect. I think in Bob’s opening remarks, he said that we’ve already seen just since July 1 claims getting paid based on Q-codes. That obviously only took a few weeks, because we’re only a few weeks into July, to get paid, which is a large decrease in the time to pay compared to—prior to the Q-code in some cases. Bob, you want to amplify on that?
Robert Terifay: So as Len said with regards to the CRVO, we’ll wait and see when the claim comes; but I’d just remind everyone, CRVO, although it’s an important indication to add to our breadth of claims for EYLEA, CRVO in terms of the number of patients eligible for anti-VEGF therapy is about 10% of the wet AMD patient population. So CRVO is going to be a fairly small marketplace, but it does expand the utility of EYLEA if we get that claim.
Dr. Michael Aberman: Okay, next question? 
Operator: Our next question comes from Joseph Schwartz with Leerink Swann.
Joseph Schwartz – Leerink Swann: Thanks very much, and congratulations on the outstanding performance. I was wondering, just to follow up on your last statement, why did you not pursue branch retinal vein occlusion when you did the central RVO studies? Thank you.
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: In fact we are pursuing it; it’s just a matter of there’s a lot going on. We had AMD, DME, CRVO, and BRVO is enrolling as we speak. Next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from Ted Tenthoff of Piper Jaffray.
Ted Tenthoff – Piper Jaffray: Great, thank you very much, and my congrats too. Just as you come and look to the upcoming PDUFA dates, in particular with respect to Zaltrap, what are your preparations with Sanofi for potential launch there, and what else should we be expecting from that program over the next 12 to 18 months?
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: Right, so I think that Sanofi is a highly experienced player in the oncology marketplace. They’re taking the rowing oar on that. Obviously, we work with them and we meet communities and all that, but we’re going to rely heavily on their really outstanding experience in this area. In terms of what’s to come over the next month, I think that either George or I mentioned that this is the beginning, we hope, of our entry into oncology, and clearly we would like to make the effects of anti-VEGF therapy even better for patients. While there is clearly a survival effect in our studies, we would like to have seen a bigger effect and we think perhaps by combining it in a clever way with several, one or more of our anti-angiogenesis agents that are already in the clinic or trying to identify patients who might do better or not have side effects of what have you, we certainly are trying to amplify those effects. Next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from Phil Nadeau with Cowen & Company
Phil Nadeau – Cowen & Company: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions, and let me add my congratulations on the quarter. Just a couple of follow-up questions on the—
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: I missed that. Sorry, go ahead. You broke up here.
Phil Nadeau – Cowen & Company: Oh, sorry. I just said let me add my congratulations on the quarter. Just some follow-up questions on the Q-code. Could you tell us from a physician or patient perspective how much easier this makes the logistics of prescribing EYLEA? Is there any less paperwork, or is it just that claims get paid back faster? And then related to that, if claims are getting paid back faster, can you give us some sense of how much longer you’re going to keep your extended payment terms?
Robert Terifay: Yeah, so many of the carriers required under a period where we had a miscellaneous J-code additional paperwork such as copies of the approval letter, documentation of the claim, the use for wet AMD, and that did require extra paperwork for the offices and oftentimes there’s been a changeover in the computer systems that process claims, and there’s been a slowdown especially on these manual-type claims. So with the Q-code, many of the carriers have said they don’t’ require that documentation upfront any more because there is now a specific code for EYLEA, so it is easier for many offices to file. And as we’ve said, we have seen in some of the carriers around the country that were slow on claims processing because of these manual procedures, that—we only got the Q-code on July 1 and we’re seeing claims come through already in some of those practices, so it’s very encouraging.
Dr. Michael Aberman: I think we have time for one more question, Operator. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with JP Morgan 
Geoff Meacham – JP Morgan : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just a few on the PDGF – so you guys are in Phase I next year, but just curious if you’ve actually selected a single antibody candidate so far, and maybe anything you can tell us about what you’ve seen I models in combination with EYLEA. And then the third part to this is—I guess, should we infer from the PDGF that your bias is to develop one organically and to not partner? Thanks.
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: All great questions, but I think we probably have said more than we are comfortable saying, frankly. We don’t want to get into much more detail since it’s a pretty competitive space, Geoff.
Dr. Michael Adler: All right, so that wraps up the call for today. I want to thank everyone for participating and everyone for calling in, and we look forward to working with you in the coming quarters.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' Conference Call to discuss the first quarter 2012 financial results. My name is Kevin and I will be your coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Michael Aberman, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations for Regeneron. Please proceed, Dr. Aberman.
Michael Aberman: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, and welcome to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' First Quarter 2012 Conference Call. An archive of this webcast will be available on our website under the Events and Presentations page for 30 days. Joining me on the call today is Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; George Yancopoulos, Chief Scientific Officer and President of Regeneron Research Labs; Murray Goldberg, Chief Financial Officer; and Robert Terifay, Senior Vice President, Commercial. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A.  I would also like to remind you that remarks made on this call that are not historical in nature may be forward-looking statements about Regeneron and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual events and our actual results may differ materially. Such remarks may include but are not limited to those related to Regeneron and its products and business, sales forecast, financial forecast, development programs, collaborations, finances, regulatory matters, intellectual property and competition. All of which involve a number of risks and uncertainties.  A more complete description of these and other material risks can be found in Regeneron's filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission or SEC, including its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, and Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2012, which we filed this morning. Regeneron does not undertake any obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise unless required by law. GAAP and non-GAAP measures will be discussed on today's call. Information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP are available in our financial results press release, which can be accessed on our website. Once our call concludes, the IR team will be available to answer further questions.  With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Leonard Schleifer.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Thanks, Michael, and good morning to everyone. Before I get to the meat of today's call, on the occasion of today's milestone for Regeneron, I would like to say a few thank yous, as surely many thanks are owed to many, many people. I offer these thanks on behalf of both me and my good friend George Yancopolous. As most of you know, George is the lead inventor of EYLEA and is in fact responsible for our entire pipeline of technologies.  George and I embarked on this professional partnership and exciting journal -- journey together many years ago with the firm belief that good science would lead to good drugs. I believe we were right although predicting the exact timing of things, as you well know, can be rather challenging. In any case, we owe great depths of gratitude to all of our colleagues over the years who have dedicated themselves to bringing drugs to patients, as well as the thousands and thousands of patients who have volunteered for our clinical studies.  We also are greatly indebted to the physicians in the medical community for helping us with all of our clinical trials and for the partnership we have had with the FDA as we navigated the development process. Finally, thanks to our partners and all of our shareholders who have believed in us and help finance our efforts.  Now back to business. Today, we are happy to report a very successful quarter and a true milestone for Regeneron as it was the first quarter in our history that we achieved profitability, both on the GAAP and non-GAAP basis as a result of product sales.  This achievement was driven by the continued strong launch of EYLEA in the United States. EYLEA's unique product profile, as the only FDA-approved treatment for wet AMD labeled for less than monthly dosing that showed clinically equivalent efficacy to monthly ranibizumab, continues to resonate with patients and their caregivers, physicians and payers.  As a result of this strong launch and first quarter sales of $124 million, we are increasing our full year U.S. EYLEA net sales forecast to between $500 million and $550 million. Meeting of this forecast would place EYLEA among the most successful biotech product launches. Given this new forecast, as well as our strong profit margin and the terms of our agreements with collaborators who fund a large portion of our R&D expenses, we also now believe we will achieve non-GAAP profitability for the full year 2012.  Before we get into some of the details behind the launch and our updated forecast, let me highlight some other important accomplishments during this quarter. Turning first to our late-stage assets, the FDA recently granted priority review status to the ZALTRAP BLA for the treatment of previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer. We now expect 3 FDA decisions for our drug candidates in the second half of this year. ARCALYST for the prevention of gout flares in patients initiating uric acid lowering therapy, which has a PDUFA date of July 30; ZALTRAP for the treatment of previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer, which has a PDUFA date of August 4; and EYLEA for the treatment of central retinal vein occlusion or CRVO, which has a PDUFA date of September 23. Our regulatory department has never been busier with the FDA on these applications, as well as preparing for the upcoming ARCALYST Advisory Committee Meeting scheduled for May 8.  Turning to our antibody pipeline, we have seen significant interest in the scientific and clinical communities in our potentially first-in-class lipid-lowering PCSK9 antibody, REGN727, which is part of our collaboration with Sanofi. During the quarter, we saw a Phase I data published in the New England Journal of Medicine and Phase II data presented at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology, including during a late-breaking clinical trial session. The data, which showed up to a 72% decrease in LDL cholesterol or bad cholesterol when adding REGN727 on top of existing statin therapy was encouraging to us and to many of the expert cardiologists who are seeing the data for the first time.  This high level of interest was also evident in the broad media coverage of these publications and presentations. As we have discussed previously, Regeneron 727 demonstrated acceptable profile in these studies, acceptable safety profile in these studies. Now there's much -- still much work to be done in our anti-PCSK9 program as the data we presented were from Phase II trials. As such, we and Sanofi look forward to initiating our full Phase III program to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of 727 later in the second quarter, following feedback from U.S. and European regulatory agencies. Another positive development from our pipeline this quarter was the FDA Advisory Committee's unanimous vote in favor of the ongoing development of anti-nerve growth factor, anti-NGF, agents in pain associated with osteoarthritis. We believe it could be an important role for these agents in the treatment of this pain and we hope to be able to provide an update on the development plans for our NGF antibody REGN475 in the next few months after discussions with the FDA.  As a reminder, Regeneron now has sole rights to REGN475 with a royalty obligation to Sanofi. With that, let me turn back to the EYLEA launch, which, we can report, continues to exceed expectations. Net product sales to our distributors for the first quarter 2012 were $124 million, which includes a modest increase in our distributors' inventory of about $10 million. This implies approximately $114 million in sales to healthcare providers.  Market research suggests the strong launch have been driven by several factors, including the high market awareness of EYLEA; physician and patient's belief in the value of achieving clinically equivalent efficacy to monthly ranibizumab, with less than monthly dosing; and their experience with EYLEA since the launch; also, the favorable perception of Regeneron as a pharmaceutical company; the belief that we are a different kind of company; that we listen to and deal openly and candidly, that the patient physician and payer communities is an important factor.  As we've reported before, another important factor contributing to the strong EYLEA uptake is that we are penetrating both the community of patients who are initiating therapy for wet AMD for the first time, as well as patients switching from existing therapies, as I will describe in a moment.  So let me turn to some of the metrics that we can share about the launch. Our market research has been relatively consistent with what we have seen from survey work done outside the company, such as the never-ending surveys reported by the investment community.  Specifically, our survey data suggested approximately 40% of EYLEA patients are new to anti-VEGF therapy. This means that about 60% of EYLEA use has come from patients switching from other therapies. Importantly, prior Lucentis users account for the majority of switches at roughly 60%, but prior Avastin users are an important contributor at roughly 40%.  The most common reason physicians report for why they switch patients to EYLEA are continued retinal edema despite treatment with Lucentis or Avastin and non-optic [ph] response to existing therapy and a desire to have less frequent injections and/or office visits. In terms of our field force, we've been very pleased by the effectiveness and the reception they have received from the retinal community.  As expected at this stage in the launch, we have seen rapid growth in the number of retinal practices ordering EYLEA and our distributors have now shipped EYLEA to more than 70% of the practices known to us to have used Lucentis in the past. While the launch is going well, reimbursement concerns remain an issue for many doctors, particularly while we wait for a permanent J code, which we expect to be assigned in January 2013. Meanwhile, extended terms are available to physicians' offices to allow ample time for them to receive reimbursement for EYLEA.  We also expect reimbursement concerns to be alleviated by 2 recent developments. Since April 1, hospital outpatient facilities have been able to use a temporary C code for EYLEA, which automates the reimbursement process for this group of users. In addition, EYLEA has been assigned a Q code that goes into effect this July. A Q code is a temporary but specific code for EYLEA that can be used more broadly than the C code and which results in automated reimbursement. We believe that this will help streamline reimbursement process as we await the assignment of a permanent J code.  As we've said before, we have seen reimbursement for more of the regional Medicaid carriers, secondary and supplemental insurers, commercial payers and private payers. We have also seen broad adoption by hospital formularies.  As indicated in EYLEA we are increasing our full year 2012 EYLEA net sales forecast from $250 million to $300 million to $500 million to $550 million. So let me spend a few moments on this updated forecast.  There 3 types of patients that will influence our continued sales and growth. The first is the new patients who are naïve to therapy, the second is new patients to EYLEA who are switching from existing anti-VEGF therapy and the third are patients who have already been started on EYLEA or continuing patients. For the first group, new naïve patients, we expect continued growth as some practices who have only started trying EYLEA expand into more patients, as well as continued growth in the early adopters. Here, reimbursement issues will remain a tempering factor.  For the second group, new switches, we expect continued growth but there is some uncertainty as to how big this patient population is. For both of these new patient groups, given a 70% level of penetration of physicians' offices, we can also now expect a slowdown in the rate of new account growth.  Lastly, other patients who are already switched and started on EYLEA. Our market research suggests that the majority of these patients will be treated with 3 initial monthly doses followed by less frequent dosing regimens.  On the one hand, continued patient use of EYLEA provides an ongoing source of revenue but the switch to last week of dosing and potential discontinuations may moderate growth. The bottom line is that it's important to remember that EYLEA has been on the market for less than 6 months so we are really still in the early stages of this product launch with many uncertainties. In the first quarter, our surveys suggest that EYLEA is capturing approximately 10% of the anti-VEGF market for wet AMD, including off-label Avastin, which accounts for approximately 60% of that market.  We believe there is room for continued growth as many of the practices that have ordered EYLEA have ordered only limited quantities and could increase the use as they gain experience and are reassured that there will be no major reimbursement issues. That said, there are factors, such as the switch by existing EYLEA users to less frequent dosing regimens, as I discussed a moment ago, that could moderate growth.  Beyond the wet AMD launch in the United States, later this year, we expect an FDA decision on our supplemental BLA to expand the use of EYLEA to CRVO and by the healthcare plans to launch EYLEA into international market.  With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Murray Goldberg, our Chief Financial Officer, who will review our first quarter financial results.
Murray A. Goldberg: Thank you, Len, and good morning, everyone. As you might imagine, I'm particularly pleased to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of 2012, the first time in Regeneron's history that we reported a profitable quarter on an operational basis.  Total revenues in the first quarter were $232 million. This includes $124 million of EYLEA net sales and $4 million of ARCALYST sales. The gross-to-net adjustment for EYLEA sales were similar to last quarter at approximately 7.4%. Sanofi collaboration revenue was $85 million for the first quarter of 2012, which was similar to the first quarter last year. This item includes Sanofi's reimbursement to us for antibody and ZALTRAP R&D expenses that we incurred, offset by approximately $4 million in pre-commercialization expenses for ZALTRAP that Sanofi incurred and that we reimbursed them for. Our reimbursement at Sanofi is accounted for as contra revenue.  Looking forward in 2012, this line will include growing pre-commercial expenses for ZALTRAP in preparation for a potential launch in a variety of countries at the end of this year and next year. Our share of these pre-commercialization expenses will potentially be at least partially offset by an approval milestone. Bayer collaboration revenue was about $12.5 million in the first quarter, and represents Bayer's cost sharing of some of the EYLEA development expenses that we incurred.  As EYLEA launches globally, this item will also include our share of the profits and losses from commercialization outside the United States, as well as potential approval and sales milestones from Bayer. Cost of goods sold in the first quarter was $12.3 million or about 9.6% of net product sales. This includes an accrual for royalties payable to Genentech under the license and partial settlement agreement that we signed in December relating to ophthalmic sales of EYLEA in the United States.  Non-GAAP research and development expense was $128 million for the first quarter this year compared to $122 million in the first quarter last year. The increase in R&D spending was driven primarily by higher R&D headcount and activities, partly related to our antibody collaboration with Sanofi and partly related to our own internal R&D efforts. To provide some perspective on the amount that we spend on internal R&D program expense, which excludes non-cash compensation expense, Sanofi reimbursed $84 million of this expense and Bayer reimbursed another $10 million.  So our first quarter net R&D expense was $34 million this year compared to $31 million last year, that almost 75% of our R&D expense in the first quarter was reimbursed by our collaborators. A similar percentage was reimbursed for all of 2011. Our net R&D expense primarily represents spending on ARCALYST, on antibodies not in the Sanofi collaboration, some EYLEA clinical costs and investment in new discovery technologies. We anticipate that this net R&D expense will trend upward through the remainder of 2012 and could increase even faster as antibodies outside the Sanofi collaboration, such as our NGF antibody Regeneron 475, moved into advanced stage clinical trials.  Let me also point out that not reflected in the $128 million total R&D number is the considerable spending by Sanofi and Bayer on our collaboration programs that does not flow through our income statement. In 2011, that averaged around $50 million a quarter. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $46 million for the first quarter. These SG&A expenses include the fully burdened cost of the EYLEA field force. While we do not expect EYLEA selling expenses to vary significantly quarter-to-quarter this year, in the event that ARCALYST is approved for the prevention of gout flares and patients initiating of uric acid lowering therapy, we anticipate that SG&A expenses could increase by $20 million to $30 million in the second half of the year to support the launch. This would bring full year non-GAAP SG&A to $180 million to $210 million, with the higher end of that guidance reflecting the potential ARCALYST launch in gout.  As a reminder, non-GAAP R&D and non-GAAP SG&A expenses exclude non-cash share-based compensation expense. Turning with some delight to the bottom line, we reported non-GAAP net income of $40 million or $0.37 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2012. Non-GAAP net income excludes non-cash share-based compensation expense and non-cash interest expense related to our convertible notes. On a GAAP basis, we also had a profitable quarter with net income of $12 million or $0.11 per diluted share.  As you will note, despite turning profitable for the quarter, we have not provided for a tax liability as we have released a portion of our full valuation allowance against our large balance of net operating loss carryforwards and other tax credits. When we transition into showing consistent profits, we will provide more guidance on the accounting treatment of these NOLs and tax credits.  On a cash basis, we do not anticipate that we will have a cash tax liability for at least several years. Our non-GAAP fully diluted average shares outstanding in the first quarter were approximately 112.5 million shares and include about 14 million shares attributable to stock options and restricted stock that are accounted for using the treasury methods and about 5 million shares associated with our convertible notes that are accounted for using the if-converted method.  With that, I'll turn the call back to Michael.
Michael Aberman: Thank you, Murray. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call to Q&A. I would like to give as many people a chance to ask questions as possible. [Operator Instructions] Our team will be available in our office after the call for follow-up questions. Thank you, and Kevin, if you could now please open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robyn Karnauskas of Deutsche Bank.
Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I guess, the key question I have for you is you talked a lot about the 70% penetration into new physician offices. But it really implies that you're really being used in a fraction of patients. Can you give some color on where you think EYLEA is being used amongst the doctor community? Is it in more large practices or the community practice is starting to use EYLEA more? And where do you think the growth will come from?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Bob, do you want to comment on that?
Robert J. Terifay: So we're actually seeing a very good distribution of EYLEA use in all types of practices. The large volume practices, the academic practices, as well as a number of practices who don't broadly use Lucentis who have used and have switched from Avastin to EYLEA. So we're very encouraged about the use. As Len pointed out, what we're still waiting to see, and reimbursement is one of those hurdles, physicians are holding back a little bit on how much EYLEA they use, but we do have very good penetration in all segments.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Kantor with RBC Capital Markets.
Jason Kantor - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Can you give us some sense of how you're thinking now that you've done this AMD launch, how you're thinking about the CRVO launch and how much is that is built into your guidance and how you're thinking about that relative to the rapid uptake in AMD?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Right. So just on the guidance, our guidance, I think, should be viewed, for the most part, as our wet AMD guidance. Bob, do you want to comment about the launch of CRVO, if we were to get it labeled this year?
Robert J. Terifay: The CRVO is a much smaller market than the wet AMD market. It's -- about 30,000 patients in the United States have central retinal vein occlusion. The length of treatment of patients with CRVO could be much shorter. Some patients stop treatment at 6 months, although recent studies have shown that there are patients who will continue to benefit from anti-VEGF therapy for over a year. So we see the CRVO opportunity as an opportunity to broaden the label, to have the product more firmly established on formularies. Clearly the product will offer benefit to those patients who need it in CRVO but the real market opportunity will continue to be wet AMD.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Raymond of Robert Baird.
Christopher J. Raymond - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Just another question on the launch, and maybe launch. Just curious if you have any visibility into the dynamics of patients transitioning from the Q4 week dosing, the loading dose, to the Q8 week dose. I'm sure you know some have -- worried about sort of hitting a wall of sorts. Our checks kind of indicate that maybe that's already started and maybe well underway. I wonder if you could maybe give some color as to what you're seeing.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes. We don't have patient level information on dosing. From surveys, what we hear is that the majority of docs use the 3 loading doses and then switch over to some less frequent regimen. Many will use the label, we hope, which is Q8 weeks but some continue to use on their own PRN or treat and extend. Obviously, the more difficult patients that start, who -- for example, some who might not have been able to even get by with monthly dosing of the anti-VEGF as some of these patients may stay on monthly dosing of our drug, which is of course also in our label. I think some of our highest utilization is in more rural areas where people have to travel far for their appointments and so the 2 -- the every 8 week dosing is appealing in those types of settings.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Birchenough with BMO Capital.
Jim Birchenough - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: I wanted to drill down on the switch business and I'm just wondering if you have any metrics on what the switch opportunity is, if you think about the type of patients that are being switched, which the feedback we're getting is patients that have persistent fluid on monthly Lucentis and Avastin, and if you think about what's the proportion of the market that could be switched and when you think about what's already been switched. I'm trying to get a sense of what's in front of us in terms of new switch, if you could maybe give us some detail on that.
Leonard S. Schleifer: So maybe I'll ask George to comment on what's known from the data in terms of -- in some of the larger trials where a fraction of people still have fluid at the end of a treatment.
George D. Yancopoulos: So it seems from the large studies that even with monthly Lucentis use, up to 30% to 40% of the patients do not achieve complete anatomical control and correction. And the numbers actually from the CATT are even far higher for Avastin. So it seems as if there are a substantial proportion of the patients who might be able to benefit from a more potent anti-VEGF agent.
Jim Birchenough - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: If I could, can I follow up on that?
George D. Yancopoulos: Yes, go ahead, Jim.
Jim Birchenough - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Yes, I'm just trying to understand these buckets, new naïve, new switch, already switched and just get a sense of what's the new naïve patient pool, what's the new switch patient pool and what's the already switched patient pool, just so we can get a sense of what's in front of us in terms of growth opportunity.
George D. Yancopoulos: Yes, I might tell you that it, yes, in most surveys and most prescription audits, will show that in any given month, about 25% of eyes are new to anti-VEGF therapy. So 75% are continuing on anti-VEGF therapy. It's important that when we think about the switch market, there was a pent-up demand. There were a number of people who were coming in even more frequently than monthly due to edema and those patients were switched to EYLEA very, very quickly. So that's one of the reasons we’re being cautious and not overestimating what the switch potential for the rest of the year is. We're encouraged by the switches we've seen, but there was a group of patients that were waiting for something new. We could tell you that of our switches, 60% of them came from Lucentis and importantly, 40% of them came from Avastin. We anticipate to continue to see switches. We just don't know at what rate.
Operator: Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.
Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Just wondering if you can comment at all on monthly trends, March relative to February and then maybe anything in April relative to March that you're seeing, because as I run through the numbers, it seems like you saw a decent acceleration in March and I was wondering if there's anything that's driving that or if that's accurate.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes, we don't -- we're not able to comment on week-to-week, month-to-month beyond the quarter trends. We have to leave up that -- you'll have to figure that one out on -- by yourself. Even if we have data available for you today, the reliability early in the launch of all of this is -- you see fluctuations and I don't want to comment on what we're actually seeing, other than to say that I think we've taken a pretty careful look and try to model this in a number of different ways. We try to take into account the switches, the dosing reductions, we've tried to take into account discontinuations, share of new patients, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. And you can build very complicated models or we can -- or you try to make more simplified models. But however we do it, we think that our guidance of $500 million to $550 million is the best bet one can make with the data we have on hand.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America.
Steve Byrne - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I think I'll switch over to one of the development projects. Can you talk about why you think Sanofi would've elected not to codevelop 475 right ahead of the Adcom?
Leonard S. Schleifer: I think that's probably a question that's better directed to Sanofi. I wouldn't presume to speak for them.
Steve Byrne - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And the other 2 antibodies that you have in development that they have also elected not to codevelop, was there -- do you have plans to continue with those or are the data just somewhat underwhelming?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes. So none of the discontinuations, as far as I recall, have anything to do with a safety concern or certainly our view of the data. They have a very deep and broad pipeline. They're going to make decisions on what they want to develop and what they don't want to develop, what it fits into what they're up to. Nobody gets all these decisions right. Obviously, I think Regeneron is in a strong enough position with its pipeline, with more than 10 different things ongoing and multiple things going in the clinic each year that we certainly don't have to continue anything that George and his team feel don't make the cut, either in terms of likelihood of technical success, safety concerns or market opportunity.
Operator: Our next question comes from Biren Amin of Jefferies.
Biren Amin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Is your assessment that doctors are prescribing EYLEA in Medicare patients only with supplemental insurance? And would co-pay assistance by the company potentially help increase penetration in patients without supplemental insurance?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Bob, you can comment on that, but I'll say that direct co-pay insurance to Medicare patients is something that we cannot do. Bob?
Robert J. Terifay: So we have actually -- we've seen physicians use the product in all market segments, Medicare without a supplement, Medicare with a supplement, and we have seen significant commercial payer uptake. There are additional delays in reimbursement, often that is paperwork that's not filled out appropriately, there's also an ongoing, which in the Medicare computer database, which delays payments. But we're seeing use across-the-board. In terms of co-pay, as Len pointed out, anyone that is on a government pay program, it is not -- the companies cannot provide direct co-pay assistance. We can refer those patients to foundations, independent foundations who can help them. The company does work nongovernmental patients in states where it's allowed have a co-pay assistance program and we have seen some use of that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mani Mohindru with ThinkEquity.
Mani Mohindru - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division: So I just wanted to drill down a little bit more on practices that were heavy -- that are heavy users of Avastin. What sort of is your ongoing market research and feedback from your field force suggesting in terms of physicians who are traditionally used to using more Avastin? How are they viewing Lucentis -- I'm sorry, EYLEA, now that it's in the market? Are you seeing that they're also using the higher adoption in those practices as well?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes. The interesting thing is that the switch rate from our switch patients is not -- it's less, that's 40% of our switches on Avastin, 60% are Lucentis. But it's not drastically less and especially because of the fact that you would imagine that there are some people, but not as many as you might have thought, are on Avastin because of the financial inability to afford Lucentis or afford the co-pay, but there are many who are on it for other reasons, patient and doctor choices. And obviously, we view those as a potential source for us to grow our market share as doctors get familiar with the product and I think we are seeing that. We are definitely seeing people who we -- primarily Avastin users using switches and new patients with our product. But it's still early going and as I said, our overall penetration in the entire market is only in the approximately 10% range so we have lots of opportunity. But the Avastin market is clearly something. Since it's the majority of the market, it's clearly something we are focusing our attention on. Obviously, early on in the launch, as Bob told you on our last call, we focused on calling on the people who are were using branded therapy and were high users of Lucentis and as I've said, we've penetrated about 70% of those that were known to us. But still, now there's an opportunity to continue to push not only those, but obviously the Avastin.
Operator: Our next question comes from Yaron Werber with Citigroup.
Kumaraguru Raja: This is Kumar Raja taking in for Yaron Werber. Earlier in the year, you said that approximately 20,000 vials were shipped to the docs in 5 to 6 weeks at the quarter. Can you tell us what this number was in the last [indiscernible] March 31?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Yes. We're not going to get into the -- I'm sorry, we're not going to get into the weekly or monthly or beginning of the quarter, end of the quarter shipments.
Operator: Our next question comes from Phil Nadeau with Cowen and Company.
Philip Nadeau - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Len, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the market dynamics, looking at what Lucentis posted, which was more or less flat sales and then the big growth that you guys put out. But it does seem like the market is growing and it's still kind of unclear where are those patients coming from. Were there patients who were off therapy because Avastin and Lucentis weren't working for them or is it more rural patients who didn't want to go on Avastin and Lucentis are now coming to use EYLEA? Could you talk a little bit about what's going on in the market so much?
Leonard S. Schleifer: Sure. Well, if you do the math, about a quarter of our sales came from people who would switch from Avastin as a loss of the sales to Lucentis and it would reflect a growth of the market. Frankly, we really appreciate your surveys because we find them to be very consonant with our surveys so they serve as a nice check. But all of the work is still -- I just want to emphasize, your work, our work is still survey data and what doctors actually do, what they're going to do, what they did, that doesn’t necessarily come through entirely accurately in the surveys, so we caution everybody, just be careful with that and the most reliable information obviously is the sales number for the quarter that we've given you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham of JPMorgan.
Michael E. Ulz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: This is actually Mike in for Geoff. Just had a quick question on the EYLEA launch. Just wondering if you guys have a sense of what the discontinuation rate was in 1Q?
George D. Yancopoulos: I don't have that information available, but I'm just guessing -- frankly, I'm guessing that is pretty low because it's -- people usually try it for several months before they make a continuation or discontinuation decision, that's just a guess.
Michael E. Ulz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Got it. And then if I can ask a quick follow-up, just curious what percentage of docs have been formerly reimbursed so far in 1Q?
George D. Yancopoulos: We -- I don't have that information available.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jim Birchenough of BMO Capital Markets.
Jim Birchenough - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Just 2 quick ones, I guess. You mentioned 10% share of anti-VEGF therapy, what's your share of VEGF naïve patients? And then the second part was just, I was wondering if you can give us an update on timelines for the DME Phase III trials.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Right. So the survey -- remember, this is survey responses. It's about the same. The 10% is about the same of new patients and old -- as well as treatment experienced patients. Is that correct, Bob?
Robert J. Terifay: Yes, that's correct.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Okay. So survey -- that's survey data. As far as DME, that's going along very nicely. As I said, our first -- as I've said in the past, our first study is already enrolled, our U.S. study and our ex-U.S. study. I don't have the latest update, but if it's not completely enrolled, it's all but enrolled at this point.
Michael E. Ulz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And just as a follow-up. Do you guys have any insight into what the implications of the recent Medcak [ph] meeting might be for reimbursement for the category and whether there might be some prospect for EYLEA or reimbursement in DME in advance of data? I know you can't promote to it, but any insights on the Medcak panel implications?
Leonard S. Schleifer: So I'll turn it over to Bob to give a little bit of back ground on this Medcak meeting and what implications he thinks it could have for reimbursement.
Robert J. Terifay: Well, first of all, as you pointed out, even if reimbursement was offered, we would not be able to or would not promote EYLEA for DME until we got FDA approval of the indication. The Medcak sort of left things with uncertainty. They went back and they're going to continue to examine the possibilities. There was no clear path decision. So right now, the individual carriers are making decisions as to what they reimburse or don't reimburse in DME. I have -- from what we've been hearing, this is probably going to be continued discussions and no firm conclusions for quite a while.
Jim Birchenough - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Have you seen any carrier decisions where they didn't include EYLEA reimbursement in DME?
Robert J. Terifay: At the present time, EYLEA is reimbursed by carriers for AMD only.
Operator: Our last question comes from Mani Mohindru with ThinkEquity.
Mani Mohindru - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division: Maybe just switching gears here and talking about ARCALYST heading into the panel on May 8. What are your expectations going into the panel in terms of outcomes and in terms of what happens with canakinumab, completely acknowledging that it's not an apples-to-apples comparison, but just wanted to get your comparison.
Leonard S. Schleifer: Right. So I think it would be inappropriate at best to lay down our expectations of how our panel is going to act, that's really their business. I know that George and the team are working hard to prepare for this. And we think we have a strong package and we think our package is distinguished, both in its indication and the -- as well as the contents of our package compared to canakinumab, but I think that the Advisory Committee is coming up in a little over a week, so we'll get to see pretty soon.
Michael Aberman: Okay. Well, thank you, operator and thank you, everyone for participating in today's call. As mentioned earlier, myself and some others from the Investor Relations team will be available for follow-up calls if you have any further questions.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.

Operator:  Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Conference Call to discuss the fourth quarter and full-year 2011 financial results. My name is Latoya and I’ll be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question and answer session towards the end of the call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Aberman, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations for Regeneron. Please proceed, Dr. Aberman.
Dr. Michael Aberman:  Thank you very much. Good morning and welcome to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals’ Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2011 conference call. An archive of this webcast will be available on our website under Events and Presentations for 30 days. Joining me on the call today is Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; Murray Goldberg, Chief Financial Officer; and Robert Terifay, Senior Vice President, Commercial. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions and answers. I would like to also remind you that remarks made on this call that are not of historical nature may be forward-looking statements about Regeneron and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual events and our actual results may differ materially. Such remarks may include but are not limited to those related to Regeneron and it’s products and business, sales forecasts, development programs, collaborations, finances, regulatory matters, intellectual property and competition, all of which involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A more complete description of these and other material risks can be found in Regeneron’s filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, including it’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 and Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2011. Regeneron does not undertake any obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless required by law.  GAAP and non-GAAP measures will be discussed on today’s call. Information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP is available in our financial results press release, which can be accessed on our website. Once our call concludes, the IR team will be available to answer further questions. With that, let me turn it over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: Thank you, Michael, and good morning to everyone. I apologize in advance – I have a cold and a cough, and there’s been nothing coming from the labs to deal with it. I want to state that this is our very first quarterly conference call. Some of you may say it’s about time, but we think now it’s time we start as we transform ourselves into a commercial company to start having these calls. 2011 was truly a transformational year for us. It was the year when we advanced our vision of becoming not only a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company, or a FIBCO, but also hopefully a long-term biopharmaceutical growth company. We submitted three BLAs in the U.S. and celebrated the approval and launch of a potentially major product, EYLEA. We also reported positive Phase II results for two antibodies in our collaboration with Sanofi which are now in Phase III testing. In a survey conducted by the Journal of Science, we were voted the second best biopharmaceutical company to work for. As we look forward to 2012, we see another exciting year ahead of us with the continued launch of EYLEA for wet AMD in the U.S. and the potential for FDA approval for our products or product candidates in three new indications: EYLEA for central retinal vein occlusion, ZALTRAP for previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer, and ARCALYST for the prevention of gout flares. Beyond the U.S., we see potential approvals and launches across the globe for both EYLEA and ZALTRAP with our partners, Bayer Healthcare and Sanofi. Turning to the launch of EYLEA for wet AMD in the U.S., we are pleased to report that the launch continues to go extraordinary well and exceeds our expectations on many fronts. Only a relatively short time ago in early January, we reported that our fourth quarter 2011 EYLEA sales were 24.8 million, which was many-fold higher than most analysts were predicting for the six weeks of sales at that time. We also provided a preliminary forecast for 2012 EYLEA U.S. sales of 140 to 160 million. As we said back then, this forecast was based on only six weeks of sales data. With another six weeks of EYLEA sales results, we have some added confidence in the EYLEA sales trends. In the first six weeks of 2012, we have seen an increase in weekly demand from a large number of doctors and practices, good repeat ordering trends, favorably reimbursement trends, and positive feedback from physicians. In fact, we have now shipped over 30,000 vials to physicians offices since our launch in November. As a result, we are increasing our 2012 EYLEA net sales forecast from 140 to 160 million, up to 250 to 300 million. To be clear, while we have an additional six weeks of information, the launch is still early and therefore this is significant uncertainty inherent in this forecast.  The benefit of less than monthly dosing with efficacy that is clinically equivalent to monthly ranibizumab appears to have resonated strongly with the AMD community, as has our pricing. We believe that EYLEA with its less frequent dosing offers an attractive new treatment option and provides an important alternative to wet AMD patients and physicians. With over 30,000 vials shipped to physicians, we are also gathering our post-market safety data to file our first post-marketing safety report with the FDA. In doing that, we can report that there have been no new adverse events not seen in our clinical trials described in our label or that were inconsistent with the known risks of intravitreal injection. As many of you know, intravitreal injections with anti-VEGF therapy are associated with known complications, particularly ocular complications such as endophthalmitis and retinal detachments.  Post-injection intraocular inflammation, such as sterile endophthalmitis, is a known risk following intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF agents and triamcinolone, incidence rates that are reported in the literature and can vary from 0.02 to 0.3% and has also been reported to occur in clusters. There have been approximately 14 cases of adverse events consistent with sterile endophthalmitis and a single isolated case of culture-positive endophthalmitis reported to Regeneron with the use of EYLEA since launch. This translates to a rate of 0.05% per injection, similar to that which we’ve seen in our clinical trials and within the range that has been reported with other anti-VEGF agents. Eleven out of the 14 cases of sterile endophthalmitis were reported by a single group practice of six retinal specialists, and 9 of these 11 cases were accounted for by a single physician within the practice. The cases could not be traced to a single lot of drug nor a single delivery of commercial vials. Vials from the same lot have been used widely throughout the country, including the other physicians in this practice.  Excluding this one practice, the rate of intraocular inflammation reported to Regeneron following EYLEA was approximately 0.01%, or 1 in 10,000. We are working closely with the practice involved to better understand this cluster and in the process of disseminating the information we have learned to retinal physicians. We have informed the FDA as per the normal course. To be clear, we do not believe that the data available indicates that EYLEA is responsible for this cluster.  In terms of reimbursement, the comprehensive program that we have rolled out, including EYLEA 4U and extended commercial terms, have been very well received. We have now received parts of reimbursement from all of the regional Medicare administrative contractors, giving us confidence that payors do understand the important of EYLEA as an option for patients with wet AMD. We have also seen positive responses in reimbursement from many of the commercial payors. This is not to say that we don’t have more work to do and do not face continued reimbursement hurdles, until we receive a permanent J code, which is expected in January 2013. While EYLEA and wet AMD is the focus in the near term, we view EYLEA as a pipeline within a product and are working diligently towards advancing EYLEA in other indications, namely central retinal vein occlusion where we have filed a supplementary BLA and have been granted a PDUFA date of September 23, and diabetic macular edema where we have two Phase III studies that are ongoing, one of which – the U.S. study – is fully enrolled. We plan on initiating shortly a Phase III study in branched retinal vein occlusion. Our ex-U.S. collaborator, Bayer Healthcare, has submitted regulatory applications for EYLEA in wet AMD in Europe, Japan and other countries, and we expect approval in these territories beginning in the second half of this year. Bayer has also started a Phase III trial in wet AMD in China in the fourth quarter of 2011. We believe that this is an important market as evidenced by the fact that in 2010 there were approximately 540,000 newly diagnosed wet AMD patients over the age of 50 in China. EYLEA is a driver of both near-term and long-term value to the Company and its shareholders, but Regeneron is more than just about EYLEA. We firmly believe that we have the key elements that are fundamental to achieving sustained long-term growth, namely near and long-term revenue drivers, a pathway to profitability that is driven by the profit margins of our products and product candidates and the attractive terms of our collaboration agreements, a wide, strong and rapidly advancing pipeline, and our solid infrastructure of people and manufacturing capabilities.  Our commitment to transform science into medicine is reflected in our robust and rapidly advancing pipeline. In 2011, we filed a supplemental BLA for ARCALYST for the prevention of gout flares in patients initiating uric acid lowering therapies and have been granted a PDUFA date of July 30 of this year. We also initiated UPSURGE, a long-term safety study of ARCALYST. We, along with our partner Sanofi, have submitted a BLA for ZALTRAP for previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer for which we expect a regulatory decision in 2012. Sanofi has also filed a marketing application for ZALTRAP in the EU.  We also reported positive Phase II data from two late stage antibodies in our pipeline, PCSK9 in hypercholesterolemia, and sarilumab, our anti-IL6 receptor in rheumatoid arthritis and have advanced two new antibodies into the clinic. Both the PCSK9 and the sarilumab programs are continuing to advance to Phase III this year. Both programs address significant market opportunities. We look forward to presenting results from two of the Phase II PCSK9 trials at the upcoming American College of Cardiology meeting where one of the trials will be presented in a later-breaker session. Our pipeline now has a total of 10 antibodies in the clinic, eight of which are being developed in collaboration with Sanofi. At Regeneron, we have always believed that good science wins out and the approval of EYLEA was proof of the validity of this belief. We are well positioned to continue to make important advances in therapeutic areas where there is unmet need and significant commercial opportunity. With that, I would like to now turn the call over to Murray Goldberg, our Chief Financial Officer, who will review our fourth quarter and full-year financial results. 
Murray Goldberg: Thank you, Len, and good morning to everyone. This morning we reported total revenues in 2011 of about $446 million for the full year and $123 million for the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, this includes net product sales of $24.8 million for EYLEA and $5 million for ARCALYST. Our gross to net adjustment for EYLEA was 7.3%.  Cost of goods sold in the fourth quarter was $3 million or about 10% of net product sales. This includes an accrual for royalties payable to Genentech under the license and partial settlement agreement that we signed in December relating to ophthalmic sales of EYLEA in the United States. From a cash perspective, we’re not obligated to make any payments to Genentech until cumulative U.S. sales reach $400 million; then, we’ll make a one-time payment of $60 million. Thereafter we’ll pay royalties until May 7 of 2016 of 4.75% on cumulative sales between $400 million and $3 billion, and 5.5% on cumulative sales over $3 billion. In terms of accounting for these payments, we are accruing royalty expense as we recognize sales of EYLEA using a blended mid-single digit royalty rate that reflects both the $60 million payment and royalty obligations based on our estimate of cumulative sales through May 7, 2016. Non-GAAP research and development expenses rose 6.4% in 2011 to about $497 million, principally in connection with our Sanofi antibody collaboration. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses doubled in 2011 to $94 million, primarily related to the commercialization of EYLEA. We expect further increases in SG&A expenses in 2012 as we prepare for the launch of ARCALYST for the treatment of gout flares. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses exclude non-cash share-based compensation expense.  We reported a non-GAAP net loss of $34 million or $0.37 per share for the fourth quarter, and a non-GAAP net loss of $161.7 million or $1.79 per share for the full-year 2011. Non-GAAP net loss excludes non-cash share-based compensation expense and non-cash interest expense related to our convertible senior notes.  For the fourth quarter, we reported a GAAP net loss of $53.4 million or $0.58 per share. For the full-year 2011, we reported a GAAP net loss of $221.8 million or $2.45 per share compared to a net loss of $104.5 million or $1.26 per share for the full-year 2010. All these per-share values are for both basic and diluted per-share calculations. In October 2011, we completed a private offering of $400 million aggregate principal amount of 1 7/8ths% convertible senior notes. Following this, we ended 2011 with approximately $811 million in cash and securities. We believe that financially we’re in a comfortable position to support the required investment, not only for the continued commercial launch of EYLEA but also for the launch of ARCALYST in gout and ZALTRAP in colorectal cancer, as well as for advancing our pipeline and driving us toward profitability.  In terms of financial guidance, as you heard from Len, we’re updating our EYLEA net sales forecast from the previous 140 to $160 million to a new range of 250 to $300 million. We continue to expect COGS for EYLEA, including royalty expense, to be under 10% of net sales. Thank you, and with that I will turn the call back to Michael.
Dr. Michael Aberman:  Thank you, Murray, and thank you Len. That concludes our prepared remarks. We’d now like to open the call to Q&A. As we’d like to give as many people a chance to ask a question as possible, we request that you limit yourself to one question and our team will be available in our office after the call for follow-up questions.  Thank you, and Operator, can you please give instructions and open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you have a question, please press star then one on your touchtone telephone. If your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, you may press the pound key. Once again, if you have a question, please press star then one. Our first question is from Jim Birchenough of BMO Capital. Your line is open.
Jim Birchenough – BMO Capital: Hi guys. Congratulations on the strong launch. I just wanted to follow up on the sterile endophthalmitis clustering at that one center. Is there any working hypothesis on what might be underlying that, and I’m interested in particular if whether these cases were in treatment-naive patients or in switch patients, and maybe just a bit more detail on that would be helpful. Thanks.
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: Thanks, Jim. What we know – there is no firm hypothesis at this point. We’re looking at everything. We do know that these patients, we believe they were switched from both Avastin or Lucentis. The doctors there are experienced, so we’re not sure what’s different. We do know that they’re using a different needle than the one that we supply. We don’t know if that’s the issue. Frankly, these clusters occur and sometimes you just never figure it out, but we’re continuing to do this. They were also in naïve patients and well.  I’d say this and remind you, that when you give 30,000 injections, you expect to get some rate of sterile intraocular inflammation as just a fact of intravitreal injections, and these things tend to occur in clusters. Sometimes people figure it out. You’ll see in our letter to the FDA that one person figured out it was—one group figured out it was a needle; another group could never figure out what it was. So we’re going to continue to try and figure this one out as well.
Jim Birchenough – BMO Capital: Okay, thanks Len.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Kantor of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Jason Kantor – RBC Capital Markets: Thank you and congratulations as well. Just a couple questions on the launch and how you’re tracking it. I’m wondering as you’re doing your guidance, what are your assumptions for the drop-off in the rate of injection going from once a month for three months, then dropping off – are you assuming that there’s a flattening or even a down quarter at any point this year? And I guess when you’re looking at what patients are coming on the drug, how many of these are switching versus newly diagnosed or naïve patients, and is the market actually growing with the introduction of EYLEA because more people are coming back onto therapy?
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: So Jason, thanks for your question. You’ve asked all the questions that I’ve been asking. Unfortunately, I haven’t been getting answers because we don’t really have the answers. We are seeing a significant amount of switching, so we don’t know for those patients how many doses they’ll actually get. We are seeing new patients. We don’t know what the practice pattern will be out there. We have modeled this in a variety of ways; and as I said, these forecasts have inherent uncertainty in them. I wish I could give you more specifics; we just don’t have them.
Jason Kantor – RBC Capital Markets: So you don’t have any sense of what percentage of your patients are coming from—are switching from other drugs, or--?
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: My guess is that the majority are coming from switches, and we’ve heard lots of comments that people are switching even their more difficult patients; but we don’t have any formal data yet.
Jason Kantor – RBC Capital Markets: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Josh Schimmer of Leerink. Your line is open.
Josh Schimmer – Leerink Swann: Thanks for taking the question, and congrats as well on the strong launch. Maybe you can give us a little bit of color in terms of the reimbursement process, what hiccups, if any, are out there, if you’re expecting that to improve over the course of the year, and what feedback you have from specialists in terms of their comfort level at this point with reimbursement and whether that’s going to improve over the year as well. Thanks.
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: Thanks for your questions, Josh. I’ll turn that to Bob Terifay, our head of commercial to answer that, please.
Robert Terifay: Yes, so as Len pointed out in the conference call, the Medicare carriers are all now reimbursing for EYLEA, and as you know, the vast majority of these patients are covered by Medicare. We also do have reports of commercial coverage. The real concern that offices have before they widely adopt the product is to ensure that not only is the 80% covered by Medicare reimbursed but also that the patient co-pay is covered, and we are seeing the co-pays work through although the insurers that cover co-pays don’t move as quickly to change their systems, so that is resulting in offices going slowly up front to make sure that they’re going to get reimbursed. That will be the situation over the next several months until all the coverage settles out.  As I say, the Medicare carriers are covering. We are seeing more and more commercial payors coming on board, and thus far the offices are beginning to see the payments come in, so actually things are where we would have expected at this point in a launch with a temporary J code.
Josh Schimmer – Leerink Swann: And does your guidance assume growing comfort with the reimbursement, or are you just still kind of waiting to see how that goes as well?
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: Our guidance tries to take into account all of those factors, Josh; but as you can imagine, there’s so many unknowns, certainly there is some impediment to this launch because of the lack of a permanent J code and some of these reimbursement issues, co-pays and what have you. Nevertheless, the launch is going pretty well; but a lot of uncertainties in terms of dose, number of doses, how many people are going to be loaded, will doctors hopefully file the label or will they do a treatment extend or some other paradigm. We’ve tried our best to model all this, and that’s how we came up with the new guidance for you.
Josh Schimmer – Leerink Swann:  Got it. Thanks so much.
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: Thank you. Our next question is from Robyn Karnauskas of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Alethia Young – Deutsche Bank:  Hey there, it’s Alethia in for Robyn today. Congrats on the great guidance. Just a couple questions on the specifics behind EYLEA. The run rate looks very strong, but how penetrated is the drug in the community versus bigger stars, and just similar, how big a factor was stocking in doctors’ offices and what’s your expectations on that?
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: So maybe I’ll cover the second, and Bob will cover the first. In terms of stocking, our estimate is that doctors don’t keep much supply at all, perhaps a week at most. The distributors, maybe one to two weeks at most, I would say. Now, in terms of the other part of your question in terms of—Bob, you want to deal with that?
Robert Terifay: So in terms of penetration into practices, what we do know is that approximately 38% of practices that buy Lucentis have bought EYLEA, so we have penetrated the offices pretty well and we do see a good distribution of our usage across practices.
Alethia Young – Deutsche Bank: Great, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Raymond of Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.
Chris Raymond – Robert W. Baird: Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to make sure I understand the math a little bit here, and I jumped on a little bit late, so if you guys covered this already. But if I count 30,000 vials that you’ve shipped so far and you back out the last six weeks of 2011, are we talking 20,000 vials through mid-February? Is that kind of the way the math goes?
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: Yeah, 30 minus 10 is 20, correct. We’ll go with that.
Chris Raymond – Robert W. Baird: Thank you. And so are we thinking that—so your numbers, if you think about gross to net adjustments, et cetera, that you’re talking roughly 34 million for the first six weeks of the year?
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: You know, I’ll let you do the math because I don’t want to be nailed down to specifics, et cetera, et cetera. But I think you’re basically on the right track.
Chris Raymond – Robert W. Baird: And was there any dynamic between weekly numbers beginning of the year to, say, mid-February?
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: Yeah, that I can’t tell you; but I can tell you from the first six weeks to the last six weeks, so before the new year to after the new year, there was definitely a pick-up after the new year. And not surprising because a lot of docs—first of all, it was a brand-new launch, and second of all coverage tends to change for patients around the end of the year, and so a lot of doctors actually waited until after the new year so once they started treatment, they knew their coverage wouldn’t be changing out from underneath the patient. So we definitely saw an uptick, an increase in the rate from pre-new year to post-new year.
Chris Raymond – Robert W. Baird: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Your line is open.
Steve Byrne – Bank of America: Hi. Len, you mentioned the incidence of wet AMD in China. When you consider just total prevalence in that country and taking into consideration government and/or private payor coverage in those larger cities, how would you estimate the market opportunity in China, say versus Europe?
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: Yeah, that’s a great question. I don’t really know how to do that one, and I haven’t been focused on it because this is something that Bayer takes the rowing oar on for us in our partnership. While we split the profits 50/50 outside the United States and we are obviously very interested, they do the mechanics out there and they’re much more in touch with these markets. We can try and ask them and get back to you, Steve. I don’t know the answer.
Steve Byrne – Bank of America:  And just a follow-on to that, do you view that 300 patient study in China as being sufficient for approval?
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: I think also we should defer that question to Bayer. I’ll find out. I think that the goal would be that when you combine it with our other studies and you have a Phase III study there, that we would hope we could get approval.
Steve Byrne – Bank of America: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Biren Amin of Jefferies. Your line is open.
Biren Amin – Jefferies: Yeah, thanks for taking my questions, and congratulations on the quarter. I was curious – what dynamics are driving the switching from Lucentis to EYLEA, and also have any Medicare plans denied reimbursement to date that you know of? Thanks.
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: Right. So as far as the switching goes, I imagine – and we’ve been to several of the medical meetings where we’ve heard this – that the patients who do not get what the doctors consider an adequate response to either Lucentis or Avastin, because there’s been switches to both, are looking to try something that might give the patients an opportunity to do better. That’s a fairly typical dynamic when a new product comes to the marketplace – many doctors will look at their difficult to treat or patients they don’t think are doing optimally well. And I want to say this – we see this both in Lucentis and Avastin patients, so I would have to say that that dynamic is definitely at play here. Bob, do you want to address the other question about reimbursement?
Robert Terifay: Yes, in terms of any rejections, in the presence of a miscellaneous J code, there are two potential codes that can be processed on the paperwork for a given insurer, and sometimes if somebody marks down one of them, that particular insurer will not process the paperwork. So what we have seen is the claims have been sent back to offices and then we work through the appeals process, so it seems to be primarily paperwork-oriented. We have had no outright rejections of EYLEA at the current time.
Biren Amin – Jefferies: Fantastic. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mani Mohindru of ThinkEquity. Your line is open.
Mani Mohindru – ThinkEquity: Thanks for taking this call and a great first call. Quick question – I saw that you mentioned that you’re expanding into BRVO. Could you elaborate a little bit more on the opportunity in the BRVO market?
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: Bob, you want to address just in terms of the number of patients and things like that – approximately, do we have that?
Mani Mohindru – ThinkEquity: Or on the (inaudible) doing there, and what kind of a market it opens up for you beyond wet AMD and the end CRVO?
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: So I’ll give you a broad—BRVO in terms of market size falls in between the size of the CRVO market and the AMD market. So it will add a fairly substantial additional market opportunity for EYLEA. As you mentioned, Lucentis is now approved in branch retinal vein occlusion, and physicians are responding very well to the use of anti-VEGFs in that setting.
Mani Mohindru – ThinkEquity: Thank you. I’ll step back in the queue.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Yaron Werber of Citigroup. Your line is open.
Yaron Werber – Citigroup: Yeah, great. Thanks so much and congrats – very nice launch. If you don’t mind, I’m going to sneak in two quick questions. AMD and DME, I’m not sure if you can answer at all, are you seeing any usage yet off-label in that setting? And then I had a question about expenses, if you don’t mind.
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: As far as we know, the predominant use of the product is in AMD; and it’s cost, we don’t discuss that, we don’t promote it, so we really wouldn’t even be in a position to get feedback if they were using it. But from what we hear spontaneously at the conferences and what have you, the discussion is centered virtually completely around AMD, as it should. Now, I didn’t hear your second question?
Yaron Werber – Citigroup: Depending on what we model—I mean, if you look at the model, the two biggest questions – number one, what’s EYLEA going to sell, but you’ve given us great color there. If we can kind of start thinking about what are you going to record from the collaboration revenue with Sanofi and then kind of what your expenses are going to be, but I guess where I’m going with this is there any scenario by which you could be profitable this year?
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: Murray?
Murray Goldberg: Let me first comment in terms of your question about R&D, which is obviously the largest expense item on our income statement. For the most part at this point, those expenses are related to the antibody collaboration and those are reimbursed by Sanofi, so they’re two big numbers – the R&D expense and the reimbursement from Sanofi – but for the most part, they offset to the extent they’re related to the antibody collaboration. Is there a scenario in which we could be profitable this year? There is, depending obviously on how big EYLEA’s sales are. As we pointed out earlier, the gross margin on EYLEA sales is quite high – 90% of so – and so depending on how large EYLEA’s sales were, we could be there. But in terms of the forecast sales that we’ve provided today of 250 to $300 million, we do not believe that that would get us there, with the usual caveats of depending on what happens to other R&D expenses that are not reimbursed, et cetera.
Yaron Werber – Citigroup: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Geoff Meacham of JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Geoff Meacham – JP Morgan : Hi guys, thanks for taking the question. Just one on the intraocular inflammation – I guess it seems like a fairly common A for the class, but it would be helpful to get a history here. Was this something that you guys picked up from the field on your own, or just something that the FDA saw on the AERS database that kind of prompted you guys? And I have a quick follow-up.
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: No, we picked this up through reporting—reports that come directly to the Company, and we’ve been in contact with our medical affairs people with this specific practice as we saw this cluster beginning to emerge.  You had a second question?
Geoff Meacham – JP Morgan: Yeah, second question just is anything else that you’ve seen beyond the intraocular inflammation that is different from the Phase III’s, just on the adverse event side?
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: No, there’s no new signals at all, Geoff; and even this intraocular inflammation is something that if you look at the letter we sent off to the Agency, you can see we gave the history there that we’ve seen intraocular inflammation in our trials, and frankly it’s been well reported in the literature; and you talk to experienced retinal physicians, they all tell you they see it on occasion.
Geoff Meacham – JP Morgan: Fantastic. Okay, thanks.
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: You’re welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Phil Nadeau of Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
Phil Nadeau – Cowen & Company: Good morning. Let me add my congratulations on the launch. Question on 727 and the PCSK9 class. There’s a potential competitor of yours out there who is saying that the FDA sent letters to all the PCSK9 developers, and this competitors characterizes the letters as basically requiring event studies for approval. I was curious whether you or Sanofi has received such a letter, and whether you’d characterize it the same way? Do you think that event studies will be necessary?
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: No, I think you may be mixing up two things. The only letter that we know has been circulated is some general comments that a preclinical review had largely based on pre-clinical theoretical data of what happens if you lower cholesterol too much, and suggesting some preclinical experiments that we should use to address them; and if we didn’t, that that would be a labeling-type issue. As far as outcome studies, we have not received any communication and I don’t believe any other competitor has said publicly that we’re aware of that they’ve received a communication that an outcome study will be required prior to approval. As for our working assumption now based on our conversations, but obviously these things can change, our working assumption is that we would have a large Phase III safety and efficacy database, and at the time of our submission and obviously approval, we would be well underway for an outcome study, but that outcome study would not be required prior to approval. Of course, if the FDA sees something in the safety database that raises questions, then they could switch appropriately so to require an outcome study. But as of now, we don’t believe that’s going to be necessary prior to the initial approval.
Phil Nadeau – Cowen & Company: Okay, great. Thanks for answering my question.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jim Birchenough of BMO Capital.
Dr. Michael Aberman: And Operator, this is going to be the last question. 
Jim Birchenough – BMO Capital:  Hi guys. Thanks for letting me get back in with a follow-up. Maybe for Bob, just trying to get an understanding of potentially the tail here, and that would be hospital formularies where you’re trying to get EYLEA on formulary. It doesn’t happen immediately. We’re hearing about some centers that are finally getting EYLEA on formulary. Can you give us a sense of what penetration you have there, Bob?
Robert Terifay: As you pointed out, Jim, we are starting to see the major eye centers come on board with formulary approvals, but several institutions take several months; so I can’t quantify the percent of hospital formularies but I can tell you that some of the major centers have come on within the last few weeks. 
Jim Birchenough – BMO Capital: All right, thanks guys.
Dr. Leonard Schleifer: Okay. Operator, I think we’re going to conclude the call with that.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2011 Q1  (2011-12-05 20:16:33) =====
Executives:  Leonard S. Schleifer - President and Chief Executive Officer Michael Aberman – Vice President, Investor Relations
Moderator : Thanks for joining us. So thank you all for joining in and listening. For those of you who are on the webcast, next we have Regeneron Pharmaceuticals with the CEO, Leonard Schleifer as well as Michael Aberman from Investor relations. For those of you who are in the audience, just raise your hand. We have mics, we can bring them over to you. For those of you who have figured out how to use the Internet, well there is a website and an app where we are sort of letting people ask questions completely anonymously. If you post it on the wall basically you can ask a question without me knowing who you are and there is also a poll question. We would like more people to poll sort of figuring out like why you own Regeneron and whether or not you think they are going to beat, miss or have consensus, probably (inaudible), whether you think they’ll beat, miss or come in line next year (inaudible) and also email me at (inaudible) with any anonymous questions.  And with that, Len, to start with you, Len, so you had some great data this morning that you released which created a lot of controversy for the day. Maybe talk a little bit about your point of view, maybe just summarize for those – the people in the room who don’t know the data and then maybe give your point of view of what are the key points of the data. What are people missing who are responding negatively?
Leonard Schleifer: Sure. But before we begin let me just give you our forward-looking statement quickly because remarks that are not historical in nature may be forward-looking about Regeneron and subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, our actual results may differ materially. Such remarks may include, but are not limited to those related to Regeneron and its products, development programs, finances, business including EYLEA, all of which involve a number of risks and uncertainties and a complete descriptions of all those risks and uncertainties can be found in our filings with the SEC including our 10-K for December 31st, 2010 and in our Form 10-Q for September 30th. And we don’t undertake any obligation to update any public forward-looking statements.  Now also since we have in the middle of launching a product, EYLEA, I want to point out that we’ll be discussing data for EYLEA, including some of the two year data you just asked me about and that - those data have not been reviewed by the FDA, they are not in our approved label. As a reminder, EYLEA is approved in the US for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration at a recommended dose of two milligrams administered by intravitreal injection every four weeks or monthly for the first 12 weeks or three months and followed by two milligrams, once every eight weeks or two months thereafter and I’d direct you to the full prescribing information which is available on regeneron.com for important safety information and risks associated with the use of EYLEA. Okay. Now having gone through that, let’s talk a little bit about the data that we released this morning which is the two year data from our VIEW studies. Just to remind everybody, the VIEW studies were designed to test the hypothesis that every other month dosing of EYLEA, Regeneron’s anti-VEGF product for intravitreal administration, when after a loading dose and then given every other month, could be found to be non inferior in the clinical trial with the gold standard at the time which was Lucentis given a half a milligram every month. Those data, we released about a year ago and those were the basis of our priority review and ultimately approval by the FDA and the study reached its primary endpoint by demonstrating that a similar safety pattern as well as clinically equivalent efficacy with our drug given every other month compared to Lucentis given monthly.  When we designed the trial, we had to figure out well, we needed – we know we needed to follow these patients for longer, to see how they did over time, whether these effects were sustainable and the question is what to do with the patients in the second year? At the time, we didn’t know for sure although we had a high degree of confidence that our every other month would work, but we needed to come up with alternatives, including testing for example, some less frequent dosing such as PRN, because everybody wanted something that could - who was designed in the trial that could relieve the monthly burden. So sort of like a backup plan, if every other month didn’t work, then we’d go to PRN in the second year.  So the study, because of its design has many limitations. Some limitations are that all the primary and secondary endpoints were done at the end of year one, so everything at year two was technically an exploratory endpoint. Second of all, there was no comparison; there was no continuation of the every other month. Everybody switched to PRN. Now the PRN allowed for two things. One is you had to have very careful monthly monitoring. So all the patients were seen monthly and could be treated as frequently as monthly as opposed to what was in the case in the first year of the study where they only could be treated every other month. Being able to be treated every month was based on criteria such as – the standard criteria in these trials, if your vision was getting worse, if you had flu, if you were gaining thickness in your retina, etcetera. In addition, we – to this PRN regimen, we put in what’s called a capped PRN, which is the minimum number of injections, in this study was three injections a month every three months and just by the time of the trial, that minimum would be three injections. So every group got at least three injections and by trial that was done by a protocol mandated because nobody really knew, there was some feeling that if you didn’t do that that PRN and you can see from other studies, the PRN may not be as good frankly as every other month. So when you look at all the data, now that you understand a little bit about the design, I think it’s safe to say that we are very glad that we set up an every other month regimen the first year and we won on that.  What can we learn from the second year data that we saw in this study? Well first of all, we saw that the visual acuity was sustained, both for the monthly Lucentis group out to the end of the second year, as well as the every other month EYLEA group. They both lost about seven or eight-tenths or nine-tenths of the latter. Some was like that; they lost about the same in fact, almost exactly the same over the course of the second year.  So it looked like we don’t know how they continued on monthly or every other month because there would have been some gain and so PRN certainly didn’t maintain 100%, but it maintained quite a bit of the visual effect and it was certainly sustainable over the second year. Well then the question becomes, was there any difference in the number of injections that could be – that you needed to maintain the vision? And overall there was a half of an injection less in the EYLEA group than in the Lucentis group. People have asked, what is the p- value? Is it statistically significant etcetera? As I said, because these are exploratory studies, exploratory analysis, because all the primary and secondary endpoints of the trial occurred at the end of a year, you can’t use the words statistically significant, it wouldn’t be proper. But if you look at the p- values, the p- values were extremely small, and so what we call normal p- value was a very small number suggesting that probably those differences were real.  Now where were the differences coming from? It seemed that in the study, those people who needed a lot of injections, there were many more of them who needed a lot of injections in the Lucentis group than in the EYLEA group. For example, the number of patients who needed six or more injections, which would be like more than every other month, was only about 15% to 16% in the EYLEA group and about 26%, 27% in the Lucentis group. So those people who the doctors determined needed more, what I would call the high users if you will, they were almost twice as many of those in Lucentis than there were who needed that high use in EYLEA.  What about the average number of injections? Where did the difference come from? Well, it turns out that if you look at the patients and you will see all these at our upcoming conference, but just to give some flavor for this, if you divide the patients into two groups which is each group in half, those who needed less than the mean number of injections and median number of injections than those who needed more, what you found is that in both groups although slightly more in the EYLEA group had the minimum - about half the people had the minimum number of injections. That was pretty close to half in the EYLEA group, a little less than half in the Lucentis group.  And what did that mean? That meant that those patients would be uninformative for the question of was there a difference in how many injections you needed because some of those patients may have needed two injections, they may have needed one and half on average. Whatever it was, but you couldn’t tell that because they got a minimum number of injections per protocol. But, if you looked at the half and slightly more than half of patients in Lucentis who needed more than the minimum, it turns out that there was a full injection difference. That is an actual one more injection in half the patients was needed in Lucentis group than was needed in the EYLEA group to maintain the visual acuity. And one more injection is we think in that trial is the meaningful number of injections difference and it made sense that the more VEGF blockade demand was, so if you looked in the – not just the top half, you looked in the top quartile, it was almost one and a half injections. So I think that what you see in this study when you step back is that a drug could be used and should be used as it’s labeled every other month following a loading dose and the data from this trial, once again not in a label and nothing that we can promote on or Genentech can make any comparative statements etcetera, but for the purposes of understanding the scientific data, we can look at this data and see a clear indication that our drug lasted longer as reflected in the fact it needed less injections and in those people who tended to need lots of injections, there were a few of them in the EYLEA group. Question-and-Answer Session
Moderator: That was helpful. So help us understand why PRN , say for the capped trial because you only had a loading dose or then PRN versus here you have 12 months versus PRN. Is the difference or the better data that we have appear in Lucentis just because you’ve got a full month or 12 months of Lucentis?
Leonard Schleifer: Speculation, you can make a reasonable guess, that’s a reasonable hypothesis. What I am saying is, the PRN is doing so well with Lucentis because they had 12 solid injections before they went to PRN. That’s a possibility. Obviously we did equally well in this study and we had half as many injections overall. Remember we had every other month after the loading dose versus them in every month. The other possibilities is that there is differences from trial to trial, and remember every PRN therapy isn’t well, I think you are going to need less so come in when you think you need it or I think you need it, it’s very careful, arduous monitoring of the patients every month, making them come to the doc, they are getting sophisticated tests. So I think that you could imagine that those criteria could be applied differently from trial to trial and certainly I would imagine wouldn’t be as applied as rigorously out in the practice world as they would be in a trial world.
Moderator: Do you think that doctors will put that in context most PRN data with Lucentis’ outlook over time; it looks like the patient will go blind over time. Will they look at this stage and think any differently of Lucentis or?
Leonard Schleifer: I mean the big question is whether or not – I think you are asking the bigger context is will docs be shift – want to shift over to a regimen that’s not dependent upon a patient showing up every month and getting an assessment and somebody making a decision. And I think that’s what one thing that EYLEA offers, that’s the only drug that’s labeled that can be used less frequently than monthly and still have clinically equivalent efficacy outcome. Clinically equivalent efficacy outcome in a label used less than monthly, it’s the only product that has that. Might doctors get there another way with PRN? I don’t think they can get there without monthly monitoring, I’ll say that, although some people would try treating extent, how are they going to get there? Doctors are going to do what obliviously they think is best for patients, but we are offering them a very, clear cut alternative. It’s labeled, it’s approved, it’s simple, patients don’t have to – they’re not required to show up every month for the monitoring. So I think that is a differentiated product. 
Moderator: Do you think though this data will change anyone’s mind on Lucentis less frequently?
Leonard Schleifer: It’s a funny thing. When the CAT data came out, if you talked to people who believed in Avastin, they thought this was the greatest data in the world and it showed that Avastin could be substituted for Lucentis. And if you talk to people who believed in Lucentis, they saw the data and they said what are you talking about? Lucentis was better than Avastin. Avastin didn’t even meet the criteria of non-inferiority when given PRN. So this is really a case where beauty may be in the eyes of the beholder, but I don’t think it’s going to – for sure it’s not going to be binary. This is not a binary outcome for anybody that is – someone is going to say I must do this. I must switch to regimens every other month or I have to continue with PRN. It’s not everybody is going to go that and I think that we would hope that practice would evolve over time to what’s a pretty convenient and straight-forward approach to treating patients. 
Moderator: So a couple – several investor questions. One, what was the proportion of patients with absence of fluid in eyes, or tears in each arm.
Leonard Schleifer: Yeah. I don’t have those data for you today but we should have those in the – I can’t remember, hope – we’re presenting this sometime in the early part of next year and those data should be available then. 
Moderator: Then this is sort of similar to what we are asking, but they’re asking about the real world significance of this data. This is sort of getting to where I - do you think a 0.5 injection difference will play a different role in the markets? I mean the key question here is when we go to the Retina meeting and we are in the audience …
Leonard Schleifer:  How are the dots going to react?
Moderator:  What are they going to say?
Leonard Schleifer: Well, think about it this way. If you think about our data, and you say well, 25% of people needed from these data in this study, and you can’t generalize, it hasn’t been approved by the FDA, but in this study, one and half, approximately 1.4 more injections Lucentis and the top half of the people need on average one injection. The problem is that when you start treating a new patient, you don’t know which patients they are. Are they going to be a high requirer or a low requirer? I would imagine – and I don’t know this, that docs who are really committed to the PRN approach would prefer to use a drug that appears to be able to deliver across the spectrum at least in this trial the data that we saw. I would prefer that, if it were up to me, and I don’t dictate practice obviously, but if it were up to us, people would follow the labels and rely on what’s been carefully vetted and carefully tested and reviewed by the FDA and in our case, once again it’s the only label that says you can use it less frequently than monthly and get clinically equivalent efficacy. I think we haven’t – I mean you guys are always a little bit maybe avant-garde. You’re always looking at – what’s the next thing…
Moderator: Crazy.
Leonard Schleifer: .I don’t want to say crazy, you invited me to your conference and I appreciate that, but the truth of the matter is that I read a data that the basis of approval has to be digested, understood and applied. Let alone the data that hasn’t been approved but these data, I think the data in this study surely favored EYLEA as a lone reacting agent in this study.
Moderator: Another question. What proportion – I think you sort of answered this I just want to make sure we have the answer right. How many patients in the EYLEA and Lucentis arm needed protocol mandate minimum injections? Is it about 50%?
Leonard Schleifer: Right. It was very close to 50% for the EYLEA group and somewhat lower than that – I think it was in the neighborhood of about, not quite 20% on a percentage based basis, somewhere in the low 40s, got the minimum with Lucentis. So no matter how we looked at it, how many people got the minimum, how many people needed – if you are at the high end, how many injections you needed, what was the average number of injections across all the patients, cutting the patients in half, there basically seems to be a shift in the requirement for a greater requirement of treatment with Lucentis. When you spread it across an entire trial where about half the patients are uninformative because they are getting the minimum, you only see about a half an injection difference. When you look in the part of the trial where there is a potential to do better, there was a full injection. A full injection in a one year period is a meaningful amount in a clinical trial. 
Moderator: That’s helpful. Well, let’s think about the less – the good data with less frequent dosing of EYLEA. Do you think that will influence the real world dosing frequency of EYLEA? You could have after a loading dose, six doses a year, I think we modeled five. What do you think the people – doctors are really going to do?
Leonard Schleifer: Once again, I don’t know the answer to that. I hope, I wish that they would follow the label. Obviously not everybody is going to do it exactly as it’s labeled, but the label offers a very straightforward answer.  You can get on average, the clinically equivalent results that you can get with monthly Lucentis. That’s a pretty powerful statement that the FDA has put in our label and I think you can try and do better by seeing the patients monthly, but I’m not sure what you’d actually accomplish rather than just using the drug the way I think it was recommended for use.
Moderator: Great. Okay, and more questions, a lot of questions from clients.
Leonard Schleifer: Okay.
Moderator: I’m going to wait for that one. That one is on PC SK9; we’ll save that for later.
Leonard Schleifer: Okay.
Moderator: Maybe you can talk a little bit about your initial feedback on the launch of EYLEA.
Leonard Schleifer: Right.
Moderator: What is the initial feedback on the price and what is the initial feedback on sort of your strategy?
Leonard Schleifer: Right. So let’s talk a little bit about the price. We believe that it was possible to deliver a price that was fair to payers…
Moderator: Can you hold on one moment?
Leonard Schleifer: Yes.
Moderator: I think we’re having a problem with the feed. Probably they are going to get me your…
Leonard Schleifer: There’s my…
Moderator: Switch mics.
Leonard Schleifer: I hope we didn’t lose all of that. How is that? Is that a little better?
Moderator: Whoever wrote this on the iPad...
Leonard Schleifer: How is that, better?
Moderator: All right, keep going.
Leonard Schleifer: So, you asked me about price and how the launch is going. So let me talk to you first about the price. I really believe that we tried to find the price that was fair to patients, fair to the healthcare payers and fair to our shareholders, and solving that equation, our normal approach – what I wanted to do is chop the country up into four quadrants and try a whole bunch of prices from very low to right where we were to a little higher to a lot higher to see how it would have worked and would have felt better about it. But you don’t get to do that. You get to price the product and we had to pick a price. The feedback we got was very positive. The key opinion leaders who we work with, they felt that we listened and we did listen to them and they had a big influence on us and the patients and payers and doctors influenced us to price this and so we listened, we did what they asked. We came in somewhat modestly below the per-injection cost of Lucentis.  Of course if you look on a label basis we’re substantially less expensive because you’re talking about not having to do monitoring every month and you’re talking about not having to do injection fees every month and you’re not talking about monthly injections. So we’re less expensive on a per injection basis. We’re less expensive on a use basis comparing label to label. But some people would say well, are you – you’re less good. Is that why you’re less expensive? That’s the old paradigm I think in pharma. Don’t ever come in a little bit lower because people will say that you’re not as good. We don’t believe that. We actually believe that you can come in a little bit lower and still have a product that offers advantages to patients. So of course the proof of the pudding in all this is how the launch going. So I desperately want to…
Moderator: Would you like to go at the first week of sales?
Leonard Schleifer: I desperately want to pay out first six stage of sales volume but nobody around the company thought that was a good idea. But we’ve only had a few selling days obviously, but we’re very pleased on how the launch is going. We’re very pleased on the reception. We’re pleased on the ordering etcetera, but once – we can’t get into anything quantitative until we have some real world experience over a longer time. But I’m very pleased.
Moderator: And has there been any changes with competitive pricing or how has the competition responded to your price point?
Leonard Schleifer: We haven’t heard anything on that front yet.
Moderator: Are you seeing uptake in - initial uptake in any – or any physicians where they get volume based discounts on Lucentis where they are getting more discounts on Lucentis than maybe some…?
Leonard Schleifer: Right, I don’t have that kind of segmentation from seven days of selling, but I can tell you that we don’t see that approach. That approach was not particularly well received. Maybe it meets the legalities and I assume that it does, but the approach of giving volume-based discounts was not well received by this – the retinal community and we wanted to be responsive to that. You can lose goodwill pretty quickly and it takes a lot to earn it. We’d like to earn that and stick with it. 
Moderator: Okay. One of the things everyone’s focused on for Regeneron is consensus numbers. And you guys gratefully put out updated consensus number of $100 million for next year roughly. When you think about the market, current sales of Lucentis is about $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion. What percentage of those are really AMD?
Leonard Schleifer: I think the vast majority of those sales are AMD. I don’t have a specific number for you, but certainly the vast majority of AMD and I want to point out by the way, we didn’t put out consensus numbers.
Moderator: Right, compiled.
Leonard Schleifer: They were compiled. You guys asked for it. We don’t stand behind them, they are not our estimates. We’re not going to – don’t interpret that as any guidance from us. Good, better and different.
Moderator: So when you think about what $100 million means, that may be less than 10% of the market. If you looked at Lucentis during the launch, they got to $300 million. What is realistic in this day and age for launches and how much market share?
Leonard Schleifer: Right. So I don’t want to get into quantitative and you can – some people have made the point that if you assume - if every single patient were to go on a branded therapy, it’s a $5 billion market in the United States and maybe somewhat significantly higher than that globally, but obviously that isn’t the case. There’s only $2 billion, but if you just sort of market share points obviously, then each market share point is somewhere in the neighborhood of $50 million in revenues. We’re going to see how we go, but I do want to point out that – just to be a little bit critical of you and your friends on – not you personally but Wall Street that is the notion, I’ve heard this so many times, Len, forget about it, your launch isn’t going to go well. No launches go well. It’s like the industries can - never sold anything and we’re going to show at the launch.  I don’t really pay that much attention to this, but I do want to point out one thing. We are not – we don’t have the burden of launching a product where we have to teach the doctors that we have something that’s worthwhile for their patients. We don’t have to explain to them that the pricing is fair. We’re going to a market where the anti-VEGF may be one of the most important drugs in the entire pharmaceutical industry. And by the way it’s important not only for eye, but it’s obviously important for cancer. And before I forget I just want to mention that – and we may or not get to it – our ZALTRAP which is our cancer product has been filed. We’ve gotten very solid second line colorectal data. We’ve seen the top line data of our first line study which was a small underpowered study, but we were able to see – we saw what we expected in terms of the same kinds of side effects when you combine with FOLFOX6, there’s no statistical differences in the outcome in the small study.  But we’re enthusiastic about moving forward in second line colorectal. We’re looking forward to getting the data from our prostate study which should be coming up in the first part of next year and we really would like to advance in anti-VEGF therapy and cancer because in the eye, anti-VEGF therapy is damn good. There’s no doubt about it and this is the Holy Grail. As a physician, if you can take a patient who can’t read and you can make them read, that’s giving sight to the blind. That’s a great space to be in but and I want to come back to that. Of course the cancer outcomes are not so great. You talk about does it really matter another month or two of living? Well, yes, it matters, it matters a lot to a lot of people. But on the other hand wouldn’t it be great if we can do a lot better than that and we’ve got some ideas that with our partner sanofi where we think that if we can combine our drug with some of our other anti-angiogenic agents, whether it be ANG2 or Dll4, we might be able to push the efficacy bosses, the anti-VEGF therapy or anti anti-angiogenic therapy in cancer can do more akin to what in cancer patients as it maybe surely does for eye patients.  Now, coming back to the eye patients, I’d have to say that we’re not trying to create a market here. The market exists. We’re not trying to justify even the price because we’ve come in lower based on the total number of injections you need and even on the price per injection. So what we have to do is we have to go out and sell our label. We have to convince docs that there’s – that yes, great spaces - there’s a multibillion dollar space here. We’re offering an important alternative and here is an alternative. Look at the label, look at the comparative studies in our label and you decide with your patients, have the conversation with your patients. Would you rather use Lucentis the way it’s used on the label, monthly, or would you rather use something that you don’t have to come in about every other month? And imagine if you’re a patient or you’re taking your elderly parent in, for sure I think that there will be people. For sure there are people who will find that an important differentiating factor. Are we going to get 100% of the market? I don’t think so. Will we get our fair share? I believe so.
Moderator: Okay. I guess those of you who are listening to the webcast and didn’t hear what Leonard said earlier, about half the patients needed probably around one more injection with Lucentis versus EYLEA.
Leonard Schleifer: So just to rephrase that very quickly if it wasn’t – didn’t come through in the webcast. Let me say it again. If you look at the study there was a minimum effect, so about half the patients on EYLEA, just a hair under 50% and just a little bit over 40% on Lucentis, required the minimum number of injections. But if you divided the patients into the median for each group, what you found is that those patients in the lower number of injections, you couldn’t do any better because you had a minimum number of injections. But those patients in the top half, you actually did a full injection better. One full injection better and if you looked at the more demanding ones, it was 1.4 injections better. So it’s clear that this data and this study indicate that Lucentis required more treatment, more intense treatment than EYLEA did, and so that was good. We didn’t design the study to exactly test all this. Once again if you didn’t hear it it’s not in the label and we suggest and recommend that you follow the label if you’re out there listening because we really believe that we have a well differentiated label that can make a difference.
Moderator: So going to that point of there are some patients who need a lot of injections. The Retina meeting last year there was a lot of talk about some people getting Lucentis twice a month even. What is the percentage of patients in the real world who really are not responding to on label Lucentis very well, need a lot more injections?
Leonard Schleifer: Right. Well, on label Lucentis – that’s…
Moderator: I know. Those are two questions there. On label with…
Leonard Schleifer: Yes, so two questions, on label Lucentis, most people do – the vast majority of people seem to do quite well and we can get clinically equivalent efficacy with every other month injection compared to on label. Now, off label use, which I’m not a believer in and I’m not a promoter of, certainly not in our product and nor Genentech’s products, I would say that in our trial those people who needed more than – needed six or more injections which would be basically more than every other month, was a full quarter of the patients on Lucentis, 26% or 27% and only about 16%, so, nearly half as many on EYLEA needed more than that six month injection. So I think what that says is, (inaudible) it kind of says we’ve got the study right in the first year and we did – our scientists did a really good job of picking what is the right interval and it seems to be every other month after loading dose as is in our label.
Moderator: Do you think it may be 10% of the patients that are not responding ideally to (inaudible) or doctors having trouble, is the vision (inaudible)?
Leonard Schleifer: I don’t know the answer to that. I can only tell you from our study there were 25% of patients, 27% of patients who were requiring more then, more than every other month therapy.
Moderator: Okay. Do you have any - does anyone have any questions in the audience on EYLEA before I turn quickly to the antibody business? To turn to the antibody business, the part of the business that people are not very focused on and there’s debate about like how much value you can assign now. When do you think people are going to get the antibody business? And the issue really comes from a lack of news flows. I get your PC SK9, that’s still in Phase 2, you’re a long way away from Pjhase3.
Leonard Schleifer: I’ve seen Phase 2 assets recently valued pretty highly in our industry.
Moderator: That’s true.
Leonard Schleifer: And so – but let’s talk a little bit about PC SK9 and why we’re excited about it and then let’s talk about the relationship overall with sanofi. Maybe I’ll start with the latter. Remember we have a very broad based relationship with sanofi and what that involves is about $160 million a year in discovery funding as well as funding for the development of our antibody pipeline to those molecules that they opt into. What’s important about that? Well if you’re a new company and all you had was EYLEA, you’d have to spend an awful lot of money to build the pipeline, an awful lot of money, and you’d eat up all your profits pretty damn quickly if you were doing anything close to what we’re doing, except we don’t eat up our profits because we’ve got this partnership with sanofi that leverages us and provides us all these resources. It allows us to keep just a little under 50% of the profit split with sanofi.  So that’s one thing that I think people – you say maybe people get it or they don’t get it. I think they will get it when they start to see how much we can continue to spend on the pipeline on one hand, but not have to eat up all the profits which we’ve worked so hard to deliver we hope to our shareholders with EYLEA for example. Now, what’s in that pipeline? Let’s talk about there’s a lot of things in there. I mentioned ANG2, potentially anti-ANG2, anti-Dll4 and there’s anti-IL-4 receptor. There’s a number of molecules in there, but let’s talk about PC SK9 because PC SK9 may be viewed as the most exciting one. But mind you, these things change and that’s the beauty of having a half a dozen or so of these things and constantly adding more that are percolating through. PC SK9 is probably one of the hottest targets in biotech. There are a lot of big companies that are going after it. There’s Amgen for sure has got announced program, there’s Pfizer and there’s probably others. Best we can tell, sanofi and Regeneron appear to be in the lead. We’ve already announced that got a little bit lost in our – while people were waiting for EYLEA to be approved, nobody paid as much attention I think as they should have to the fact that our PC SK9 phase two data were rather – I thought were rather exciting. We had two studies, one was in heterozygous patients, with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and the other was in patients who were already on a dose of statin and they could be changed to a higher dose of statin or a higher dose plus our drug and the bottom line of all this, when you add it all up, on top of high dose statins, you can still get with an injection, an infrequent injection of our product, you can still get another 65% lowering approximately of LDL, the bad cholesterol.  No other product class I’m aware of can come close to that. Certainly there’s any – none of these products can deliver and in fact, even if you go from 10 to 80 of LIPITOR you get another 17% or 20% or something of that nature. We’re talking about a 65% lowering. That’s a very meaningful, large amount of lowering and it means that we can start to get people towards a goal that they have never been able to get to with current treatments available. That’s very exciting. Obviously that’s why we’re at it, that’s why the competition is at it. It’s a big space. There’s probably 10 million people in the United States or thereabouts who can’t get to their goal with currently available therapy. So I would encourage people to look at this a little bit more carefully.
Moderator: I think we’re actually out of time.
Leonard Schleifer: Well, we can’t be out of time. We’ve got six more programs that we…
Moderator: I know. I know. I don’t think (inaudible).
Leonard Schleifer: If you invite us back next year we can continue this conversation. Thank you very much.
