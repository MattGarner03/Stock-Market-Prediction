===== 2025 Q1  (2025-04-30 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to Regency Centers Corporation First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Christy McElroy. Thank you. You may begin.
Christy McElroy: Good morning, and welcome to Regency Centers' first quarter 2025 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Lisa Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Mas, Chief Financial Officer; Alan Roth, East Region President and Chief Operating Officer; and Nick Wibbenmeyer, West Region President and Chief Investment Officer. As a reminder, today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements about the Company's views of future business and financial performance, including forward earnings guidance and future market conditions. These are based on management's current beliefs and expectations and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. It's possible that actual results may differ materially from those suggested by these forward-looking statements we may make. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements may be included in our presentation today and are described in more detail in our filings with the SEC, specifically in our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filings. In our discussion today, we will also reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. The comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this quarter's earnings materials, which are posted on our Investor Relations website. Please note that we have also posted a presentation on our website with additional information, including disclosures related to forward earnings guidance. Our caution on forward-looking statements also applies to these presentation materials. As a reminder, given the number of participants we have on the call today, we respectfully ask that you limit your questions to one and then rejoin the queue if you have additional follow-up questions. Lisa?
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Christy, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with another quarter of outstanding results, highlighted by strong same property NOI growth and earnings growth. Our results are reflective of continued robust operating fundamentals within our trade areas and at our shopping centers, amplified by the commencement of leases within our S&O pipeline and accretion from investments, including our ground up development, redevelopment and acquisitions. Positive trends and activity continued into April and the conversations that we've had with our tenants over the last few weeks have indicated no impact on sales or shifts in consumer behavior. Within our portfolio, we've seen growth in foot traffic accelerate in April from Q1 levels. And for the remainder of the year, our lease commencement plans are largely committed, supported by a strong pipeline of leases already executed and awaiting rent commencement and our lease negotiation pipeline remains full. Our tenants are healthy and continue to look long term, planning for space needs years ahead of time amid a scarcity of high-quality available space. In addition, external growth remains visible, largely driven by in process development and redevelopment projects coming online. Additional acquisitions in 2025 would be opportunistic and additive to our plan. As we look longer term, I'll highlight, as I often do, the competitive advantages that make Regency unique across the REIT sector peers and why we believe we are positioned to outperform across cycles. Our grocery anchored neighborhood and community centers serve the essential non-discretionary needs of our shoppers within a format that caters to service, convenience and value. The trade areas in which we operate are supported by strong demographics with above average income and employment, while the retailers within our centers are predominantly in the top tiers of performance across their chains. As a result, our tenant base is on the whole more insulated from the impacts of potential inflation and volatility in the macro backdrop. We are also in a great position to continue growing opportunistically, supported by our substantial liquidity and access to low-cost capital. In closing, we acknowledge the elevated volatility and macro uncertainty in the economy today. But importantly, we continue to feel really good about how Regency is positioned as we are built to thrive across changing economic cycles. We hold our long-term playbook and strategic objectives firm, maintaining our focus on driving growth and we remain confident in our competitive edge with the unique combination of our strategic advantages. Alan?
Alan Roth: Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results were again marked by solid leasing activity and continued success growing NOI and particularly base rent. We made significant progress delivering on as well as further building our leasing pipelines with strong demand from various tenant categories including grocers, restaurants, health and wellness and off-price retailers. Activity in the quarter was led by continued strength in shop leasing, where we were able to drive another 10 basis points of growth in leased occupancy on top of our 60 basis point increase last year. Notably, our same property metrics now include the former Urstadt Biddle Properties, which entered the pool this year. We also made meaningful progress commencing new leases representing approximately $10 million of ABR, while driving the same property percent commenced rate up another 20 basis points in the quarter. While we've been actively rent commencing pre-leased space, the value of our S&O pipeline is up to $46 million of incremental base rent as we continue to replenish the pipeline with newly signed leases, providing further support for future commenced occupancy. Cash rent spreads were 8% in Q1, while GAAP rent spreads were nearly 19%, positively impacted by achieving higher average embedded rent steps in our executed leases given a greater mix of shop space in the quarter. I am proud of our team delivering these exceptional operating results, reflected in same property NOI growth of 4.3%, primarily driven by growth in base rent. As Lisa mentioned, we acknowledge the macro uncertainty, but as we've moved through April, our leasing activity, foot traffic and rent collection trends within our portfolio remain highly favorable. We are well positioned due to the quality and location of our assets, durability of occupancy within our neighborhood and community center format, manageable exposure to watch list retailers and a strong tenant health profile including top performing grocers. Nick?
Nick Wibbenmeyer: Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. We had another active quarter of accretive investment activity, including closing on a large high-quality acquisition, continued successful execution of our in-process development projects on time and on budget and further progress sourcing new projects to drive growth in our future pipeline. During the quarter, we acquired Brentwood Place in Brentwood, Tennessee, one of the most desirable submarkets in Nashville. Brentwood Place is a 320,000 square foot community center with best-in-class retailers including national anchors that perform well above their chain averages. Furthermore, the future mark-to-market leasing opportunities give us clear visibility to significant growth in coming years at this prominent center. Additionally, we have a high-quality grocery anchored shopping center under contract within our joint venture platform located in the Northeast. We expect to close in the second quarter and look forward to sharing more details at a later time. Pivoting to development, I'm really proud of our team's execution on our $500 million of in-process development and redevelopment projects. Leasing activity remains strong and we are managing costs in line with our underwriting. Roundup development remains a key component of our strategy and a unique differentiator for Regency, especially in an environment with limited new retail supply and capital constraints for other developers. We believe our development platform combined with accretive redevelopments within our existing portfolio continues to be the best use of our levered free cash flow with blended returns exceeding 9%. The vast majority of our projects involve partnering with leading grocers where we continue to see significant demand for space as they further expand their footprints and reach. Our team remains highly engaged sourcing and underwriting investment opportunities and we continue to have confidence in maintaining an annual plan pace of $250 million of project starts. Mike?
Mike Mas: Good morning, everyone. Piling on the comments from Lisa, Alan and Nick, we are certainly gratified with our strong first quarter results, evidenced across our same property NOI, core operating earnings and NAREIT FFO metrics. This is a testament of our team's ability to drive both occupancy and rent growth within our portfolio, amplified by astute capital allocation, including execution within our value-add development and redevelopment platform in addition to sourcing accretive acquisitions. We are reaffirming our 2025 earnings outlook, which implies growth in NAREIT FFO of nearly 6% and growth in same property NOI of 3.6%, each at the midpoint of our guidance ranges. This includes maintaining our credit loss guidance of 75 to 100 basis points, which combines the expected impact of both uncollectible lease income and lost revenues from bankruptcy related move outs. One item to point out within same property NOI growth. We do expect a modestly elevated growth rate in the second quarter, driven primarily by the timing of percentage rent and other income. These items will not affect base rent growth, which we expect to remain fairly consistent quarter to quarter. As a reminder, core operating earnings accretion from our Q1 acquisition of Brentwood Place was previously included within guidance. This quarter and with the closing behind us, you'll see within the guidance slides of our earnings presentation that we made a few adjustments for non-cash items related to the below market leases and below market debt associated with that acquisition, which were a wash for NAREIT FFO. These small tweaks comprise the only changes to our earnings outlook for 2025. Moving to the balance sheet, in February, S&P upgraded Regency's credit rating to A-. This follows our upgrade to an A3 rating by Moody's approximately one year ago. We now hold the only A credit ratings from either Moody's or from S&P in the shopping center REIT sector. We are extremely proud of this accomplishment and the validation from the agencies reflecting the strength of our business and appreciation for our balance sheet strategy. Our balance sheet strength and liquidity remain key advantages with leverage well within our target range of 5x to 5.5x, strong annual free cash flow generation and plentiful availability on our credit facility. From this position of strength, we will remain opportunistic, investing accretively and driving earnings growth and shareholder value over the long term and through economic cycles. With that, we look forward to your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Goldsmith: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. The question is on the watchlist and bad debt. Clearly, the market is concerned about the impact of tariffs and the potential pressured consumers that may follow-up from that. So as you're looking at your tenant base, have you made any changes to the watch list or has there been anything noticeable from your perspective in terms of accounts receivable or in the small shop? Are you expecting anything? And with that, can you remind us of your Rite Aid exposure?
Alan Roth: Michael, good morning. This is Alan. That was a loaded -- lot of questions in there. So let me see if I can unpack these one at a time. So from the watch list perspective, we are constantly evaluating and updating that watch list. But from an exposure perspective, it stays consistent with where it's been in the past. And so we feel really good about how we are proactively approaching our watch list tenant. From a Rite Aid exposure, we have 30 basis points of ABR that is out there. And again, the teams not just from a Rite Aid perspective, but the totality of the watchlist standpoint, we are aggressively out in front of proactively what we call leasing occupied space where appropriate. And from an AR perspective, I would just tell you it remains below historic levels. And I think that addressed your questions, Michael.
Michael Goldsmith: Really ask because I know you can handle it. Thank you very much.
Alan Roth: I appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Samir Khanal with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Samir Khanal: Thank you and good morning, everybody. I guess, Lisa, just maybe expanding on your opening remarks there. Maybe post sort of April to talk about kind of how leasing discussions have been going, how activity sort of has been trending. I mean, even for your existing tenants, right? I mean, there's certainly going to I mean, if this tariff situation doesn't get resolved to a certain degree, the more this lingers, How are you sort of approaching these conversations given the higher cost that they'll have to incur? Thanks.
Lisa Palmer: Appreciate the question, Samir. I'll start, but I think it might be best to have Alan, address the specific conversations with tenants. I will again just reiterate that, and you've said this in your question, the kind of reality, the scale, the impact from tariffs is so unknown right now and uncertain. And we acknowledge that. I'm speaking many of you know Hap, I speak with Hap earlier this week and it's like our eyes are wide open and do not want anyone to think that they're not. But I want to remind you and just reiterate what I did say in my prepared remarks and that is our sector, our product type, we really do cater to essential nondiscretionary service convenience value. That's the product that our centers offer to our shoppers. And we are not immune -- we know we're not immune, but we are much more resistant as a result of that and able to kind of absorb economic uncertainty and cycles. Recession is what would impact us. It's when people lose their jobs and when there's a lack of -- when they don't have income coming in when they really cut back on spending. But again, remind you of the trade areas in which we operate much more well positioned to absorb those pressures. So if you think historically, because I've been at the company for quite some time now, have lived through different cycles, there were really two major economic downturns that impacted us. And I'll say they only impacted us by 200 basis points to 250 basis points of occupancy and they were severe. And that was the GFC and COVID. I don't have a crystal ball. I have no idea where we're going. I'd be surprised if we have something that severe. So I feel really good about the strength and quality of our tenant base. As you just heard Alan say about ARs, they're healthy. The quality of our tenants, they're able to navigate and get through challenges and also again emphasizing service, convenience, value, essential goods. So no, we're not immune, but I feel really good about how well positioned we are to perform through and even outperform and thrive in economic downturns.
Alan Roth: Samir, I thought that was such a well-articulated answer. I'm not going to add anything to that.
Samir Khanal: No. Thank you so much for that.
Lisa Palmer: Thanks, Samir.
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig Mailman with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Craig Mailman: Hey, good morning. Lisa, appreciate the comments that you just made and kind of in that vein with pretty decent conviction here that you guys are a little bit more immune, at least in the near term. You guys talked also about the balance sheet capacity and you've been opportunistic, you bought the Nashville asset. Just kind of how are you thinking about keeping powder dry until things maybe we get better visibility on what ultimately plays out from a tariff perspective versus looking at opportunity today and how much you would want to kind of put to work if you think that maybe this is less of an issue and there's some dislocation in the market and you can find some opportunities?
Lisa Palmer: I appreciate the question and I also appreciate the recognition of the strength of the balance sheet and strategically, it is not by accident that we're the only A rated company in the sector. We intentionally keep balance sheet capacity so that we can play offense again through all cycles and so that we can take advantage of and capitalize on opportunities. Our best use of our free cash flow and we said this often is our development program today and that's because it gives us the best return on our invested capital and that will continue to be the case. So we will always evaluate opportunities as they're presented to us. And if it's compelling enough, which gets to your question about using it now versus saving it. We'll know if it's compelling. And if it's compelling, we'll act and we have the capacity to act. And so again in my prepared remarks, I made the comment about the playbook and our objectives remain firm and that's the case and we will continue to operate that way.
Operator: Our next question comes from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Todd Thomas: Hi, good morning. I just wanted to dig in a little bit and follow-up on Samir's question. Just curious, has there been any change at all in the timeline to get lease deals done? Whether you're seeing any slowdown at all in the decision-making process? Or whether there's any pushback at all, on new lease deal conversations regarding rent escalators or move in rents, given what might be a little bit more of an uncertain outlook for tenants trying to budget sales at a new location?
Alan Roth: Todd, good morning. Thank you for the question. So we always closely monitor lease activity, foot traffic, collections, pipeline and quality of the pipeline. And simply put, as we look at April post quarter close, we're simply just not seeing any translation from this volatility in our April results. Activity was really solid in April. In fact, 2025 new activity exceeded the April 2024 new activity. Foot traffic for the first three weeks was up 7% year-over-year. As I mentioned in Michael's question, AR remains well below our historical averages and our pipeline still remains strong with quality operators. We're going to continue to stand tall as Lisa said with our eyes wide open and our antenna up, but April was another really good month for us and nothing has transitioned.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Ronald Kamdem: Hey, just on the construction side, development side, if you will, just any sort of quick early indications of how much construction costs are up and how are you guys thinking about sort of the evolution of the yields that you're targeting sort of in this post tariff environment? Thanks so much.
Nick Wibbenmeyer: Ronald, appreciate the question. This is Nick and good morning. So yes, we're obviously very closely monitoring construction cost. And as you all can appreciate the last four or five years have been a challenging time to do that for a host of reasons. And so with the new volatility, our team is digging in as they always do to really make sure we understand every line item. And as you can see in our in-process, the team continued to do an amazing job. We really do derisk these projects significantly before we even start construction. So our in-process continue to perform really, really well. And then as we look forward to our projects that have not yet started construction, same thing, the team is digging in line item by line item. And yes, these proposed tariffs could impact some of those line items without a doubt. The good news is though other line items we have seen some pullback in cost. Steel prices are down year-over-year, crude prices are down year over year. And so net-net, we still feel really good that we can deliver the projects that are in our pipeline at a budget and a return that we think is appropriate. And to your question on return, you can see where we have our eyesight as we've always articulated our development program. We want a spread above what we think those assets are worth post being built. And so we're looking at 150 basis point spread and we continue to achieve that and then some. And so feel really good about in-process and feel really comfortable with what we have planned to start as we move forward this year next.
Operator: Thanks so much. Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Juan Sanabria: Hi, good morning. Just hoping you could talk a little bit about the transactions market, how higher temps have changed? Are there more or less players looking to acquire in the space? And kind of where you see cap rates trending? Have you seen any diminution of foreign investors looking at the U.S.? Thank you.
Nick Wibbenmeyer: Thank you for the question, Juan. The reality is we're in early innings from the volatility, so let me say that. And sometimes the transaction market is a little backwards looking. But every data point we're looking at, we continue to see cap rates in the 5% to 6% range for high quality gross shrink and assets, the type of assets we're pursuing. And in recent conversations anecdotally, it does seem like there's been a little pullback in the public and international markets compared to the private market. And so it does appear deals that are on the market right now continue to have a lot of interest from private capital and are still pricing aggressively.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Griffin with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Griffin: Great, thanks. Maybe sticking in the acquisition vein, just wanted to get some more color and context on the Brentwood deal. It looks like a going in cap rate of call it the mid-5s, but it seems like there is some opportunity to realize mark-to-market as those leases roll. I'm curious, number one, how quickly do you think you can realize that mark to market within the center? And then what are you looking at on sort of a stabilized cap rate basis from that acquisition?
Nick Wibbenmeyer: Appreciate the question, Michael. So a couple of things. One is, we do feel really good about those mark-to-market opportunities. And so as you articulated, we're comfortable with the going in yield and how that project was financed, especially with the low market debt, but we're even more excited about the future growth potential of that asset. And so in that initial 10-year hold, our eyesight is really at a high single digit IRR. And so we feel good about the ability to achieve that IRR. But then what's even more exciting about that asset is we have visibility beyond even that initial 10-year hold of future material mark-to-market opportunities. And so that asset based on the quality of that market, the quality of the asset within that market and the quality of the income stream on a go forward basis, we're extremely excited to bring that one into the mix.
Michael Griffin: Great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Greg McGinnis with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.
Greg McGinnis: Hello. This is Victor Fedio on with Greg McGinnis. And let's stick with acquisitions. I'd like to kind of understand your forward-looking thinking. So essentially, you've doubled your Tennessee exposure with this acquisition and obviously great asset. But what are your future plans? Are you planning to kind of expand in this market, your footprint or which markets are your areas of interest as of now?
Nick Wibbenmeyer: Sure. Appreciate the question. As we've talked about before and as Lisa has alluded to a couple of times on just this call, the good news in our business plan is we don't have to acquire to meet our business objectives. And so let me state that first and foremost. But that being said, we are very, very focused on growing our exposure in high-quality markets across the country. And so every one of our 22 plus offices is waking up every day trying to figure out what are the opportunities within that market to own a best-in-class retail that we feel like has appropriate growth profile. And so Nashville has been on that list for quite some time. It's a very tight market and so there's no doubt not a lot trades in that market. We continue to be focused on Nashville, but I'll tell you we are also focused on the other great markets we operate around the country. And so feel good that we'll win more than our fair share of these opportunities as they present themselves.
Greg McGinnis: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Jamie Feldman: Great. Thank you for taking the question. I guess sticking with tariffs a little bit, I mean, have you are you able to provide any color from conversations with tenants or even your own math in terms of just tariffs as proposed, what they would do to cost of goods sold for your tenants, what it could mean for credit coverage, just anything you can kind of quantify from either work you've done or conversations you're having with tenants. And then along those lines, President is going to be in office for four more years, maybe more, but we'll see. Does it change at all your view on the types of tenants you want, types of categories you want in the portfolio or even where you want to own assets longer term?
Lisa Palmer: I'll start and again I'll have Alan add if he so desires. I'm just going to go ahead and reiterate that holding our playbook firm, our strategy firm and we really like it, right. It's why that we're in this business. The format that we own neighborhood, community shopping centers, mostly grocery anchored, catering to essential needs, catering to service convenience and value. I do not expect that to change. We feel really good about it. We feel really good about the sustainability of cash flows and the ability to sustain growth in those cash flows as a result of the offering that we have to both our customers, which are people we're leasing space to and the customers of those merchants, the shoppers. Reiterate once again, foot traffic is up year over year. It was up in April over Q1. We feel really good about the positioning and the ability to perform through cycles because there will always be cycles. And we have proven that we can and will perform.
Alan Roth: And Jamie, I would just add as we think about categories and again we don't know, but apparel, luxury, hobby, home improvement, variety stores, largely discretionary type retailers and that's a very small part of our portfolio and those that could be impacted, we certainly have the very well capitalized operators that are top in their sector and are time tested really knowing how to operate through uncertain times. And so as we think about our approach to leasing, I would say it's not going to change. It has been and it will always be very intentional, very deliberate, as we think about how to qualify operators based on their experience, based on their balance sheet and we're just not filling space to fill space.
Lisa Palmer: And I will remind you that the retail world is always changing. And you will always have -- you're going to have operators that cannot navigate challenges, changes in their kind of environment and they'll fail. Really interesting, I was telling some of the people that I work with that I went back and did a quick reread of Good to Great. And one of the companies that they highlight is Circuit City as a great company. And we all know what happened with Circuit City. So it's just an example of -- doesn't mean that we're going to be perfect. It doesn't mean that we're going to have 100% batting average or is that over 1000% batting average, that there will always be failures in our business. We plan for those. We expect those, but we also manage it really proactively. And as a result of that, the impacts in our portfolio tend to be pretty small and pretty immaterial and insignificant and we manage through it.
Jamie Feldman: All right. Thanks for your thoughts.
Operator: Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.
Haendel St. Juste: Hi, good morning. This is Ravi Vaidyan on the line for Haendel. Hope you guys are doing well. Just trying to do the math here on Page nine of the presentation. Looking at the timing of commencements and contributions to the snow pipeline, how should we think about rent recognition either being pulled forward or pushed back in the current environment? Thank you.
Mike Mas: Hey, Ravi. That's a good question. So the slide that just to position everybody, we get some details on our S&O pipeline and the delivery of the same. So again, just the level set, 80% of our S&O pipeline is set to commence in 2025. However, only about a third of that will be recognized as income this year. And what that really says to us is that, that positions us for continued positive momentum and tailwind going into 2026 as we'll continue to deliver upon the really strong leasing efforts of the team. The variability on these line items from a commencement perspective is rather small. I mean, we tend to on the vast majority of our leases embed contractual rental rate increase dates, commencement dates. So the tenant is obligated to commence rent as the earlier when they open or a date certain. So we know we have tremendous amount of visibility into that certainty of that income stream. Our ability to pull that forward and accelerate that opening to commence rent is what this team is about and what this team has been doing a great job, accelerating build outs to get that rent commencing sooner. So the risk would be in the difference between that ability and the contractual increase, which I would characterize as relatively small.
Haendel St. Juste: Got it. That's really helpful. Just one more here. In terms of your leasing pipeline, how forward..
Christy McElroy: Hi, Ravi. We limited to one question. If you could re queue, that would be great.
Haendel St. Juste: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Ki Bin Kim: Thank you. So just going back to your comments about April being better than last April, I'm guessing the dentist probably isn't too impacted by tariffs. So if you looked at some of the tenant categories that might be more impacted, is that the same case or are some of those tenants a lot more impacted? Thank you.
Alan Roth: Ki Bin, so I'm not sure I 100% follow that question, to be honest. I feel bad about that. But let me just say a few things. So QSR and medical were our top categories in the first quarter in terms of who we transacted with. And then there were a lot of tenants that we did multiple deals with that are aggressively out there expanding. Shake Shack, a remarkable QSR operator, Paris Baguette, Warby Parker, Great Cliffs. Those are just a few that come to mind that we did multiple transactions with. And we're constantly doing portfolio reviews and continued one off deals with a lot of nationals as well who still remain committed. And I think importantly as Lisa mentioned looking long term, right? And it's certainly multiple grocers that are out there off price, financial services, vet clinics, to name a few. And so things are still really good and really active and really active and I hope that addressed your question.
Mike Mas: We haven't seen a shift in the character of our leasing activity in April versus Q1. Yes. And it's the same talent's point that we're working with a lot of the same tenants who are looking to expand their businesses. Similarly, the impact of heavier tariffs impact tenants is small. Therefore, it is not as materially representing our leasing activity. So as of today, Ki Bin, we're just not seeing anything in the numbers.
Lisa Palmer: And anecdotally – reiterating what I said in my remarks, the conversations, I think getting a little bit more direct to your question Ki Bin, the conversations we have had with our tenants have not indicated any shifts in consumer sort of behavior. And the fact that we did see overall foot traffic accelerate from Q1, I think just reinforces that.
Ki Bin Kim: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Gorman with BTIG. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Gorman: Yes, thanks. Good morning. Maybe just going back to the transactions market for a minute here. Can you -- and I know there's more details to come, but can you maybe give a little bit of background on the grocer anchored asset that's under contract for the JV platform, kind of what drove that into the JV platform versus wholly owned and kind of maybe the appetite that you see out there for institutional capital still coming into the space, given some of the recent market volatility? Thanks.
Nick Wibbenmeyer: Sure. Appreciate the question, Michael. So let me start with a little more clarity on the assets. So again, once we close, we'll share all of the details. But what I will share at this point is it's a phenomenal grocery anchored shopping center and a great submarket. And I'll keep it as simple as that as it relates to the specifics on the transaction. But it's definitely right in line with other great assets we own in the Northeast and so very excited about the opportunity. And then in terms of the structure with the joint venture, it's a long-term institutional JV partner we've had for years and years that is still very bullish on the sector for the same reasons we are. And so we do have a program rotation with them to offer them opportunities as we have the ability to acquire them. And the hit rate is very high when we say we want to buy an asset, they are usually hand in hand with us. And this is just the case in this scenario of they're taking their opportunity within the rotation to partner with us on this asset.
Operator: Our next question comes from Floris Van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please proceed with your question.
Floris Van Dijkum: Hey, thanks for taking my question. So I believe that Brentwood had something like 4.3 million visits last year. Where would that rank in your portfolio? And how many assets do you have that actually do more than where Brentwood gets in terms of annual visitors? I'm sure you have that data somewhere, Nick. I'd love to get your perspective on that.
Nick Wibbenmeyer: I'm laughing because I love the question. Talk about a detailed question. To your point, it is a phenomenal asset and it is heavily trafficked. I have to admit off the top of my head, I don't know where it ranks in our portfolio. We can circle back with you and give you that specific answer, but it's definitely on the top end. But again, as you can appreciate, Floris, the size matters. And so it's a larger asset. And so by default, traffic counts are going to be higher. And so not only do we look at total volume, we also look at traffic based on GLA as well, which also gives us a really accurate prediction on volumes and success for our retailers. And so we can circle back with you on the exact on that one, but I think your assumption is correct that it's at the higher end of our portfolio.
Operator: Our next question comes from Paulina Rojas with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.
Paulina Rojas: Good morning. Regarding developments, I had a follow-up to a prior question. You were looking for a spread over the value or the cap rates the property would sell for. But I imagine cap rates are likely becoming less of a certain thing in this environment. So I wonder how you're navigating that uncertainty. And then second, as you continue to evaluate new development projects, are you seeing any consistent pattern in the types of projects that are emerging? And who are other developers that you are seeing in the market today?
Nick Wibbenmeyer: Sure. Pauline, let me take your first question first related to yields and spreads. And so you're right, as I articulated before, we definitely are looking to get a spread above what we think the value of that asset would be stabilized. But it's not because we anticipate selling that asset. It really is to make sure we're getting an appropriate risk adjusted return. And as you've heard Lisa mentioned even several times on this call, that is our best use of capital. And so when you look at the yields, we're getting on our development program in comparison to what acquisitions would be, there's no question it's a better source, a better use of our capital in terms of what that long term return is. And then I would just stress, yes, we want that spread because of the risk of that transaction, but we do a phenomenal job derisking these development opportunities. The team is highly focused on getting entitlements in hand, significant pre-leasing construction bids and drawings in hand before we close, which is why you've seen usually right after closing, we are starting construction. And so when you combine that going in yield compared to what an acquisition would be and how well these assets are derisked and I think our track record shows we do a very good job of delivering these projects on time and on budget. That really is why our eyesight continues to be focused on development. But we are continuing to monitor those yields and we'll continue to push development yields to the best of our ability to be as high as we can get. Look, it's to our benefit to build to as high yields as we can achieve. And so feel good about that business plan and you're starting to see the impact of that come through. And then in relation to what we're seeing in terms of competition and the type of developments, it's really what we've talked about the last couple of years, which is the grocery side of the business. And so at our scale, we have phenomenal relationships with all of the key grocers in every major market in the country. And they continue to invest right now in their brick-and-mortar side of the business. They know stores are a critical component to driving their top line and we're there to partner with them and help them execute on that side of the business. And so the vast majority of the opportunities we're looking at are with our tremendous grocery partners.
Lisa Palmer: I feel it's a great opportunity for me to jump in and just remind everyone development is something that we have been committed to for as long as we have been a company and certainly as long as we've been a public company for decades. And the combination of factors are what really allow us to have such success. And it's why, it is the best use of our capital because it does provide us the best returns on our invested capital. And that is -- so you can't turn it on and off. You've heard me say that and you can't build it in a year. So it has been decades of this. So we have the experience of our team is second to none and the talent with that goes along with that experience, the relationships with the grocers and the retailers and the master plan community developers and then our cost of capital. And you combine those things and we will remain committed to it and we will develop through cycles and it will enhance our growth rate.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Mike Mueller: Yes. Hi. I guess for the full year bad debt guide, it looks like what you booked in the first quarter was extremely low, but you maintained the full year guidance. I guess is it just conservatism given the world or is there some known kind of chunky fallout coming down the pike soon?
Mike Mas: Hey, Mike. I appreciate the question. Remember, we gave guidance not even three months ago, so two, two and a half months ago. We had a pretty good indication at the time that the first quarter would come in light. And we still provided an annual guidance range on credit loss of 75 to 100 basis points. And the reason for the first quarter being light is the health of the tenant base, as Alan articulated, we knew that our cash basis tenancy collection rate on some annual reconciliations would be high that would be recognized in the third quarter. And what you're seeing is a result of that, right? So kind of a detailed way of articulating, we understood that this would be a first half to second half story where the first half would be a little bit higher from a run rate perspective than the second on the growth. But nothing was out of the ordinary, nothing was beyond our expectations. So I wouldn't go as far to call it out of conservatism, but an in line quarter to our expectations and our outlook remaining the same given that the current conditions that we're seeing haven't changed.
Mike Mueller: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Linda Tsai: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. On foot traffic being up 7% the first three weeks in April, how much do you think that came from pull forward demand? And then just any color on variances in traffic by region?
Lisa Palmer: I'll take the first part and I'll let Alan address the regions. But I've read the same things that you have and I've seen the data come through that of some kind of forward front loading and spending. But I have to think about when you think about again our tenant types, they're just -- there wouldn't be a lot of that. People are not going grocery shopping for months in advance and when they go out to eat, they're going out to eat for that day. So I would doubt that there's much of that at our centers.
Alan Roth: Yes, Linda, I would just add that there was marginal differences around the country on traffic count, but importantly every single region was up. So I think that's really the way I would answer the question. And so, there really was no read through from a foot traffic perspective as we tried to bifurcate the region.
Linda Tsai: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Floris Van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please proceed with your question.
Floris Van Dijkum: Hey, Lisa, a question for you. I think you're in good position to comment on this. As retailers are going to have margin pressure because of tariffs and etc., what do you think the impact is on the store and owners like yourselves, in particular owners with high-quality real estate?
Lisa Palmer: Appreciate the question. And I think it's possible we've spoken about this. Retailers have been feeling margin pressures over the past five years and I am on the Board of Trustees with ICSC. So I do have the opportunity to sit with many of them and I have said this often. It's got to be a win-win. We want our tenants to be successful and be productive so that we can continue to raise and increase our cash flows which comes from rent. And there's no question that there continues to be tailwinds despite all of these headwinds that we've focused on this call, there's also tailwinds in our industry due to the limited new supply that has come online over the last decade really plus 15 years. And as a result, and I said this in my prepared remarks, there's still a scarcity of quality space available. And retailers are going to want to continue to grow and they're going to want to continue to grow in the best locations and where they're going to have the opportunity to produce the best sales, which will then help them with margin pressures that they're facing. So again, to say that we're immune to any impacts of inflation or recessions, I know we're not. I feel really good about the quality of our trade areas, the quality of the locations within those trade areas and the quality of the retailers in which we do business. And I think that we will manage through that and we will continue to grow same property NOI for the years ahead.
Floris Van Dijkum: Thanks, Lisa.
Operator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Lisa Palmer for closing comments.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you all for your time. Appreciate the questions and have a great rest of your day. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Closing Remarks].

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-07 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to Regency Centers Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are on a listen-only mode. A brief question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Christy McElroy. Thank you. You may begin. Good morning.
Christy McElroy: And welcome to Regency Centers Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2024 earnings conference call.

Finally, as a reminder, given the number of participants we have on the call today, we kindly and respectfully ask that you limit your questions to one and then rejoin the queue if you have additional follow-up questions. Lisa?
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Christy, and good morning, everyone. We are proud to report another quarter and year of exceptional performance and execution of our strategy. Same property NOI and earnings growth were strong, reflective of continued robust tenant demand, and opportunities for us to drive value. This was evident in the strength of our base rent growth, the size of our leasing pipeline driving new record high lease rates, the activity within our expanding development program, and continued growth in our dividend, which we increased another 5% in the fourth quarter. Our operating fundamentals continue to benefit in part from a relative lack of new supply in our sector over the last fifteen or so years. At the same time, while supply growth has remained muted, Regency has found opportunities to create meaningful value through development. We had another great year of project starts, hitting our target of $250 million or more for the second straight year, with nearly half in new ground-up developments. We have close to $500 million of projects in process today and are having a lot of success continuing to build our shadow pipeline for future growth. Our development platform is and will continue to be a meaningful differentiator for us. And as I've said before, we have the best national development platform in the business. Our accretive investment activity totaled more than $500 million in 2024 with the funding of this growing development pipeline combined with our high-quality acquisitions, and our opportunistic share repurchases all while maintaining the strength of our balance sheet. In closing, I'm so appreciative of all the hard work of our team to generate this impressive performance and I'm even more excited about continued strong momentum as we look ahead. We believe the positive trends and tailwinds we are experiencing in our high-quality shopping centers combined with our sector-leading balance sheet and liquidity position, will continue to serve as a strong foundation for the long-term success of our business. Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone.
Alan Roth: Regency's 2024 operating results were highlighted by robust same property NOI and base rent growth, which was driven by record leasing activity, strong rent spreads and embedded rent steps, and success with accelerating rent commencement dates. The tenant demand environment remains very strong with activity consistent across all regions and driven by several key categories, including groceries, restaurants, health and wellness, personal services, and off-price. Our leasing team has been extraordinarily busy. And I am so proud of their success in executing nearly 2,000 leases this past year, comprised of more than 9.4 million square feet of space. This is a significant number of deals and a record high volume for Regency. We also set new record highs for our same property leased rate ending the year at 96.7% and our shop occupancy lease rate ending the year at 94.1%. Our same property commence rate was up another 100 basis points in Q4 with continued progress getting tenants in the SNO pipeline open and rent commenced while also replenishing the pipeline with newly signed leases. Our executed lease pipeline currently reflects 300 basis points of occupancy and $44 million of incremental base rent supporting momentum for upcoming rent-paying commencement. We also continue to have success pushing rent growth, reflected in the upward trajectory in cash rent spreads throughout 2024, finishing the year with spreads at approximately 11% in the fourth quarter. Our renewal rent spreads were nearly 9% for the year, our highest annual rate for renewals in more than fifteen years. We achieved GAAP rent spreads of almost 20% for the year, reflecting our team's ability to capture the mark to market while also achieving record levels of rent steps and new shop lease activity, indicative of the strong environment and the health of our tenants. Same property NOI growth excluding term fees and COVID period reserve collections came in at 4% for the quarter and 3.6% for the full year. In addition to our success driving rent growth and accelerating rent commencements, same property NOI also benefited from an improvement in our expense recovery rate. As Mike will discuss, our credit loss forecast for 2025 is in line with our historical average, which is impressive if you consider the level of retail tenant bankruptcies we've seen in the last few months. Our exposure to credit risk tenants is very manageable, a direct result of our deliberate long-term approach to strategic merchandising and intense asset management. In closing, our fantastic results are attributed to continued strength in the fundamentals of our business, combined with the hard work of our talented team. A thriving retail demand environment, coupled with limited new supply, sets Regency up well for continued success. Nick?
Nick Wibbenmeyer: Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. We had another active quarter of accretive investment activity to cap off a very successful year. In 2024, we started nearly $260 million of development and redevelopment projects, including $35 million in the fourth quarter. These investments encompass 24 distinct value-add projects in 14 markets around the country with blended yields exceeding 10%. This was the highest level of annual starts in nearly two decades and nearly half of that was in new ground-up developments. It was also a very productive year for project completions. As we are starting to see a more significant direct benefit from our team's efforts in expanding our pipeline over the last few years, we completed more than $230 million of projects during 2024, including seven projects in the fourth quarter totaling more than $150 million. Notably, this included Buckhead Landing in Atlanta, where Publix celebrated a long-awaited and highly successful grand opening in December, evident in the nearly 50% increase in foot traffic compared to before the project's commencement. At year-end, we had nearly $500 million of development and redevelopment projects in process, with blended returns of more than 9%. The team continues to make great progress executing on lease-up amid exceptional tenant demand as we are currently more than 94% leased within the pipeline. To reiterate Lisa's comments, our development platform remains a key differentiator for Regency. There is no doubt business is challenging, and each project presents its own unique set of complexities, but our unequaled combination of expertise, proven track record, deep industry relationships, and access to capital has enabled us to strategically build our pipeline and execute on numerous attractive projects in recent years. Looking ahead, we remain highly optimistic about our opportunity set. We expect demand for high-quality space, and the markets and trade areas where we operate to continue to support attractive returns driving meaningful accretion and growth on a risk-adjusted basis. Shifting to acquisitions, we continue to see an uptick in activity in the transaction market and our team is actively underwriting opportunities around the country. As previously disclosed, we acquired University Commons, an HEB-anchored center in Austin, within a long-standing institutional joint venture partnership, and also currently have a center under contract in Nashville, which will further enhance our presence in a market where we've been looking to expand for some time. This high-quality center is in a desirable trade area located in close proximity to existing Regency assets and we look forward to providing additional details on the transaction in the coming months. In closing, we believe the success and momentum within our investments platform, especially the growth in our development and redevelopment pipeline over the last few years, positions Regency well for the future, providing clear visibility into the drivers of our earnings growth in the years ahead. Mike?
Mike Mas: Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. As Lisa, Alan, and Nick have described, we reported another strong quarter to complete an exceptional full year of results, generating core operating earnings growth of just over 5% excluding the impact of prior year collections. Our high-quality portfolio produced same property NOI growth excluding term fees and COVID period collections, up 3.6% for the year, primarily driven by base rent growth. We are looking forward to continuing this positive momentum, but let's now turn to our 2025 earnings guidance. As usual, I'll refer you to some helpful details on pages five and six of our earnings presentation, including a roll forward of 2024 results to the midpoint of our current year outlook. We are guiding to a NAREIT FFO range of $4.52 to $4.58 per share, which reflects nearly 6% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. The largest contributor to our earnings growth is same property NOI, which we expect to grow in a range of 3.2% to 4%. Just as a quick reminder, that we are about a year and a half past our merger date with our set bill, those properties have now entered our same property pool as of January first of this year. We expect base rents will continue as the primary driver of same property NOI growth generated from contractual rent, continued strength in releasing spreads, and higher average commenced occupancy, including redevelopment contributions. Even with the uptick in recent bankruptcy filings that Alan referenced, our credit loss outlook is unchanged from our indication a quarter ago, at a range of 75 to 100 basis points of total revenues, in line with our historical averages. Tenant failures and move-outs simply said, Avon will always be part of this business. But Regency's low and manageable exposure to tenant credit risk speaks to the quality of our portfolio as well as our merchandising discipline. Moving to the balance sheet, in the fourth quarter, we raised $100 million of equity on a forward basis through our ATM at an average price of $74.66 per share. This issuance adds to our liquidity and balance sheet capacity as we work to invest growth capital. We have twelve months to settle in order to best match fund sources and uses. Our liquidity position is further supported by our strong free cash flow generation and access to debt capital. We have more than $1.4 billion available on our unsecured line of credit. We have no unsecured bond maturities until late this year, and our leverage remains within our targeted range of 5 to 5.5 times debt to EBITDA. We believe that our balance sheet position, ready access to low-cost capital, and ample liquidity will continue to provide us with the flexibility to be opportunistic, drive growth, and create shareholder value. With that, we look forward to your questions. Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question and answer session. If you'd like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, we ask that you please limit to one question and if you have a follow-up please return to the question queue. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star two if you like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. One moment please while we poll for questions. My first question comes from Andrew Reale with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Andrew Reale: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. $250 million of development and redevelopment spend this year. Could you just share more detail on what you plan to start in 2025 and what types of projects you see as adding the most value going forward? Then I believe the blended yield on in-process did tick up to 9% in 2024. So is this kind of the level you expect to deliver over the long term, or are you finding new opportunities to maybe even push that a little bit further? Thanks.
Nick Wibbenmeyer: Morning, Andrew. This is Nick. Really appreciate the question. So let's start with your spend question, the $250 million. So the spend side of the equation is we have clear visibility to that. So that's just forecasting the project we've already started. That will continue to fund through 2025. And so feel really good about those projects we started in 2023 and 2024 and as they continue to progress. In addition to that, we do still anticipate finding another $250 million of opportunities for development or redevelopment spend as we move into 2025 our starts. And so continue to be excited about that pipeline and the progress the team continues to make related to that. In terms of yield, as you can see, they've been pretty, I've called, steady. In terms of our starts. To your point, they've increased on the margin. Feel really comfortable about our ground-up development yields being 7% plus and we continue to solve for returns in that range. And then on the redevelopment side, as you know, those can come in a little bit of waves, but we have been in the low double digits and we would expect that to continue. So on a blended basis, high single digit when you combine the two. And so excited about what we've done today and excited about 2025 adding to that list.
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig Mailman with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Craig Mailman: Thanks. It's Nick Joseph here with Craig. I was hoping you could run through what the drivers of earnings are that drove kind of guidance now above what was previously discussed in terms of the considerations for year-over-year FFO growth and same-store growth.
Mike Mas: Sure. And, again, I'll reference you to page six of the supplemental materials that we provided, which I think the story pretty cleanly. But it's foundationally driven by our same property NOI growth. Right? So 3.2% to 4% is driving the majority of the earnings. Outlook for 2025. And then you add to that accretive capital allocation, which is both transactions that occurred in 2024, you know, our net acquisition activity, the contribution to Nick's point of delivering some developments here that have been building on our pipeline. To this point, and that will only increase even beyond 2025. And then the net impact of our share repurchases last year is also do have some headwinds in the growth outlook for 2025, primarily on the interest rate line item. And that is to be expected. That's largely or about half of that, and we note nine cents a headwind here, about half of that is due to the bond that we already placed in 2024. So a full year impact of that refinance. And the balance of that interest expense line item is actually attributed to that accretive cap allocation activity. So that's continuing to invest capital accretively going forward. Lastly, and I may just take this opportunity to identify the G&A expense line item, you will see a positive contribution from G&A. That is unusual. But, again, this stems back to this opportunity to continue to capitalize overhead as a result and directly as a result of our success in growing that development business. So with added starts, added spend, that's an increasing our capitalization. It's also helpful to share that's topping out. The growth rate in that component of our P&L is topping out in 2025. It should grow at a more reasonable rate from this point forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Goldsmith: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Can you walk through the thought process around the credit loss reserve of 75 to 100 basis points? And within that, can you quantify any pressure from tenants you felt in the fourth quarter and anything you have visibility or are watching for in 2025?
Mike Mas: Yeah. Let me start with the guidance component, and then Alan can talk about specifics. So maybe just to reiterate how we think about credit loss and we've been very clear about this, it's really a combination of two items. Right? So it's uncollectible lease income, classic bad debt expense, rolling through your P&L on that line item. Our historical average is about plus or minus 50 basis points. Actually, in 2024, we did better than that. We ended the year at about 30 basis points. We are planning for a more historically average year going forward. Then you add to that the second component, which is lost base rent as a result of bankruptcy filings. Sorry. So for that, that will fill out the balance of our range. So 25 to 50 basis points. This is where it's more speculative. And we do have some clarity, however, given what's all the filings that occurred over the holidays, but timing is an input. We still have to learn what's gonna happen to these bankruptcy filings, and Alan can color that up. Is that combination is supporting our current range of 75 to 100 basis points?
Alan Roth: Yeah. And Michael, good morning. I would just again reiterate as I said in the remarks too that we do have very limited and manageable known exposure and I think that that certainly is a testament to our deliberate approach in terms of how we manage our assets and the durability of our occupancy. But I would bring this back also to tenant health. Where our ARs are low, sales and traffic do continue to trend up. Our pipeline remains strong. Supply is limited. And many retailers are having a hard time meeting their growth objective. And so in that instance where we are gonna get that space back, great retailers are anxious to secure great real estate, and we believe we have great real estate.
Operator: Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Dori Kesten with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Dori Kesten: Thanks. Good morning. The same store NOI range for the year was better than expected, but it was also slightly wider versus last year's guide. I know you've definitely walked through the pieces a bit, but I guess I'm just wondering on the spread I guess, what is driving it's starting off wider.
Mike Mas: Hey, Dori. Thank you. You know, historic number one, your first comment, it is slightly better than our than our head down. I'm sorry. Is there some feedback there? Okay. Okay. We're good. Dori, 3.6% midpoint of our current guidance that does compare to it to the outlook head nod we gave last quarter plus minus 3.5. So feel like we're in line with that. Slightly positive given the great fourth quarter we had from a leasing perspective. On the range, we've our in our history, we've we've had various ranges in initial guidance. As tight as 50 basis points is why it's 100 basis points. This is 80. So I feel like it's kinda consistent with how we've handled in the past. The biggest factor is going to be move-outs and credit loss. Right? So where you where you end up in the year from a timing perspective on both of and volumes on both of those is going is largely gonna dictate where we where we finish?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.
Greg McGinniss: Hey. Good afternoon. Given ground-up development pipeline, could you just instead discuss your view on the transaction market and whether you're seeing any opportunities to acquire, how that compares to recent years, and cap rates more broadly. And if you could also disclose where you think the ground-up developments might trade after completion so we can have some idea on value creation. Would be appreciated as well.
Lisa Palmer: Before and I know Nick's gonna jump in and answer this. Before he does, I just a lot of the wanted to reiterate that our investments playbook hasn't changed. We saw a lot of notes overnight asking about kind of the increased focus on acquisitions given our acquisitions guidance and as as has been the case, development and redevelopment is our is our number one priority Nick's already addressed that and, you know, and and will more right now. But we've always acted on and will continue to act on compelling acquisition opportunities when it meets all of our objectives. And as we've always said, that could be single property, could be a portfolio, a small portfolio property, or it could be M&A, which we've also done. So just wanna make sure there is that there's nothing that's changed here investments playbook is the same. Our strategy is to remain disciplined in investing our capital accretively. And I'll let I'll let Nick actually more directly answer your questions.
Nick Wibbenmeyer: Absolutely. No. Thank you, Lisa. Thank you, Greg. There there's no question. Investor appetite right now is extremely healthy for the centers we're pursuing. Grocery anchored neighborhood and community centers. And so as Lisa just said, first and foremost, we're funding our development and redevelopment program and we feel really good about that. But we are still very active in the transactions market, and so as we've said before, when we can find an opportunity that we believe is equal to our quality and our future growth profile, and that we can fund it creatively, we are gonna lean that we've been successful in doing that as you can see, and in 2024, we had success and now as we've given you guidance in 2025, we feel good about some of those opportunities we're now pursuing. And again, the one in Nashville will talk in more detail next quarter after we announce it, but feel really really good about again checking those boxes, funding it accretively, and feel really good about its future growth profile given the mark to market opportunities. Then to your question related to cap rates, yeah, as I mentioned on a previous question, we are solving on ground up to north of a 7% yield. And again, when you look at what we're buying and what the market is buying in terms of core grocery anchored assets, feel really good about getting our 150 basis point plus spread. And so you can solve to a, you know, mid five and a half to six on the deals worth developing, and so feel really good about that value creation straight out of the gate, and so that's why we are prioritizing that capital.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Floris van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please proceed with your question.
Floris van Dijkum: Good morning, guys. For taking my question. So on capital allocation, it it appears like the development the ground-up development you're doing is is not necessarily in the first ring suburbs. Cheshire and and Oakley are a little farther away. But the redevelopment presumably is is more and where you're getting your your really juicy returns is is more in the infill first ring locations. Could you touch on could you just talk talk about the you know, how big of a shadow pipeline of of redevelopment potentially do you have in that first ring suburb portfolio? And then maybe talk about your mixed-use entitlements if you're pursuing any of those and presumably you would be looking to offload those to to third parties to actually develop you know, mixed-use on your assets. But maybe you can talk about some of the you know, projects or or the the scope of of accretive recycling that you potentially could do by by offloading some of that mixed-use to to third parties.
Nick Wibbenmeyer: Sure. So, Floris, this is Nick again. Good morning. I'll start I'll start with your first question, which is really about the development of read it and so I I would tell you we're active in all aspects of our geographic territory. And so as you've alluded, some of our redevelopments are in fill summer first or second ring suburbs. And so we are hyper-focused on continuing to pull that lever at all opportunities. And so I wouldn't I wouldn't articulate redevelopments are more infill than our developments necessarily. We have some development progress development opportunities we are currently working on that. I think you'll see in the future, we announce until to some of our core markets and so continue to feel good about our entire geographic territory related to developments and redevelopments. And then in terms of your mixed-use question, as you are aware, we have we have been very loud and we are not focused on complicated mixed-use projects. Projects that we do think the highest and best use may be something different than retail, we will bring in a partner, but I would tell you those are a small component. As you look at our redevelopment program moving forward, we're hyper-focused on the core retail. Aspect of our business. I would tell you the mixed-use comes into play a little bit more on the potential ground-ups where there may be some horizontal mixed-use. Components where we will bring in a partner, which is which is what we've done for years, so that's no different. Than how we've handled those large developments over the last decade or so.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Juan Sanabria: Hi. Good morning. Just a question on the builder economic occupancy and how much you'd expect to be able to to capture in 2025 and maybe if you could just comment what would be kind of the the same store versus the the redep potential there. And then as a part b, there was a comment to I I don't know if it was G&A, but I think it's just something like the growth rate was topping out in 2025. So just wanted to see if that was in reference to, like, the capitalized interest portion that was helping to you offset some G&A pressures that would like, inflationary pressures?
Mike Mas: Hey, Juan. I think I'll take most of these. So from an occupancy kinda guidance perspective, we're at as we mentioned, we're hitting peak occupancy on the top line. Right? So to and and to think about the likelihood of losing some tenants through credit loss and normal churn activity, I'm not gonna guide to a higher level of overall percent leased, although I'm I'm we're all encouraging the team to continue to lease our space, and we have and we have great centers great demand. Rent paying occupancy, which is really the driver of both same property growth and earnings growth, are anticipating to make meaningful headway in 2025. We thought we've been forecasting this year in subsequent in in previous quarters on these calls, think we have the opportunity to move a rent paying occupancy by 75 basis points, maybe even more in 2025. On an average basis. Think about, you know, that average basis, and and in fact, I think we can hit to that hit to that average number pretty quickly in the year. And have the benefit of that higher run rate going forward. So that is a that is a meaningful component of our growth outlook on a same property basis going forward. Will reiterate that the redevelopment impact to our same property group rate is expected to be north of 100 basis points. We've been forecasting that for about a year now. And those developments have largely delivered, and there's really good visibility into that. Lastly, kinda pivoting to your to your G&A question. Number one, interest expenses in G&A, but capitalized overhead is and it is a component of that. So what I was trying to make clear is we've been benefiting pretty significantly, and you can see it in our results because we highlight in our P&L. Of this growing development business that we've invested in for for a long time, and that pipeline has grown meaningfully over the last two to three years. And that has resulted in increases in capitalized overhead. That those increases will continue in meaning more meaningfully into 2025. And then we should top off. We're we're kind of topping off and hitting our from a growth rate perspective, we're hitting our limits, so to speak, and our team is operating at full capacity and we are and we are hopefully gonna continue to deliver you know, strategically targeted centers in the $250 million plus range of starts. But we're kind of leveling off on all aspects of that.
Lisa Palmer: I think let me just maybe the easy way to think about it is if we're able to continue to which we expect that we will be, $150 million of starts on a sustainable basis. Then the capitalized overhead growth rate will mirror our normal G&A growth rate. Right. Because it's the people that are working within Regency that we're we're capitalized. That's probably the best way to think about it. It's not that will stop growing, 'll just grow along with a normal increase in G&A year to year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Todd Thomas: Hi, thanks. Good morning. You touched on renewal spreads in the quarter and leasing spreads in general, which have been elevated. As you work through 2025 lease expirations and particularly with the portfolio's lease rate at 96.7, do you see any material changes in spreads, either newer renewal spreads and perhaps you can provide you know, some color on how that that they might trend throughout the year relative to 2024. And then can you also talk about expectations around tenant retention in 2025, whether you see any changes there?
Alan Roth: Todd. Thank you for the question. This is Alan. So, I'll start with, you know, strong sales. Coupled with limited supply certainly drives rent as as we all know, and we are in an environment where we continue to see that positive momentum both with spreads and with rent steps. And you know, I mentioned in the opening remarks, new leasing spreads of 16%, which was a significant increase to prior quarters. But we've always said let's bring that back to Gap rent, which is what we really like them for emphasize as a better measure. Of total rent growth. And we had north of 30% in gap spreads for new transactions this quarter, which really is emphasizing that contribution to sustainable growth through the success team's having both in in the spreads and in the steps. So I feel really good about that and the momentum that that stays behind that. To your retention question, I wouldn't necessarily guide to a number per se, but I would say we are historically 70, 75 ish percent from a retention perspective. And I'm very comfortable with that. You know, at the end of the day, that gives us the opportunity to keep those retailers that are thriving within our portfolio, but also stay relevant and intentionally as part of the deliberate strategy, cycle through the deals that that are important for us to replace.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Gorman with BTIG. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Gorman: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to turn back to the development side for a minute here and maybe ask about competition. Heard some conversations about construction costs moderating a little bit. Obviously, retailer demand is is still quite robust. And and with institutional capital also looking at the space more aggressive of any merchant developer activity come back into the space? Obviously, you've got great tenant relationships that's driving the opportunities, but I'm just curious if if even at the margin, there's more competition on these development. Thanks.
Nick Wibbenmeyer: Appreciate the question, Michael. This is Nick. And very very astute question, definitively. And so I'd say, look, first and foremost, of our biggest competition is our customers, and so there's no question HEB, Publix, Kroger, they continue to be very active in their own self-development program. And so the good news is we have very close and good working relationships to find opportunities to work with them. And we'll continue to do that. On the margin to your point, our our real comp we is really really astute and good local owners and operators and developers. And so they continue to be active and we do a very thorough study every year of where developments happened, which ones we were involved with, which ones we weren't, year in and year out, there are a lot of very small local developers that have successfully done a project or two in their backyard. And I would tell you over the last six or nine months, they have gotten a little more pep in their step than they did eighteen months ago. But they continue to have real challenges as you articulated. You have to have the relationship you have to have the expertise, and you have to have the capital. And those are three puzzle pieces that are hard for even the locals put together. So that's why we continue even with on the margin, the increase in competition locally. We feel really good about getting more of our fair share of that opportunity set moving forward.
Lisa Palmer: Yeah. Very well said, Nick. I think the when you think about our industry and our sector, it's really fragmented. And that's true for the operating as Nick said, that's true for the operating portfolio, as well as for development. And it is why we feel really good about how well positioned we are because of our national platform, because there are true real benefits of that scale. That we're able to, you know, bring to both the operating portfolio as well as to the development program.
Operator: Great. Thank you. Please proceed with your question. Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with Baird.
Wes Golladay: Hey, everyone. Just wanna stick to the development. I I guess, you know, we'll look at the size of the pipeline. Been growing $500 million. Where could that go over the next two to three years? Is there a governor from a risk perspective from your your end? It seems like it's about 2.5% of the enterprise value. Is it opportunity set driven? What what's driving it from going higher?
Lisa Palmer: I'll I'll jump in, and Nick and color it up if he likes. At this we've been working really hard to continue, you know, focusing on our grocery anchored you know, bread and butter development program and building that to a sustainable $150 million a year. And the team has done exceptional work in getting us to this point where we've now done it for the second consecutive year. And I expect to continue to see that for us to meet that objective going forward. But and it's not easy, as Nick has said. It's taken a lot of work to do that. So at this point, I would say it has been opportunity opportunity set has been the limiting factor. To the extent that we see the opportunity set, grow significantly then we have the balance sheet and we have we are so well positioned to continue to capitalize on increasing that. And we can certainly work through the human capital resource. Resource challenge that that would be. So to this point, it's been opportunity set driven. And if that changes, trust me, you'll hear us talk about it.
Nick Wibbenmeyer: I have nothing to add. Thank you.
Operator: Alright. Thanks. Thank you both. That's a good answer, Lisa. Thank you both. Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.
Manoj: Hey. This is Manoj on for Steve. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to quickly circle back on the credit loss assumptions. I know you touched on this before. With the question and also outlined that call it, there's a 25-50 basis points allowance for loss base rent from bankruptcies included in that credit loss assumption. I just wanted to get a better understanding how conservative or, like, what the base assumption is that's going into forming this specific number? Are you can you share any color on what the assumption is in terms of how many stores you receive assuming the base case to get back that you have to backfill or just help us understand much room there is given the exposure you have. That would be super helpful. Thank you.
Mike Mas: I'll do what I can. I don't know if it'll be characterized as super helpful, but it's a ground-up. Assumption process. So we are we're taking a look at our other rent roll. We're identifying where we see risk, where we know risk exists. And we're handicapping our the likelihood and potential of those of those sites to be rejected through bankruptcy court. And and and we're not we're not assuming that all are are necessarily rejected. We're making space by space, tenant by tenant assumptions. We're capturing all the tenants that are that are are very well known to everyone on this call. In that analysis. And we're trying to put forth what we believe to be a practical outlook and reality of how we think we'll end the year. I hope we I hope we do better than that. But a lot of this component of the plan, frankly, is out of our control.
Manoj: I appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: Sure. Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Ki Bin Kim: Thank you. Good morning. So looking at your same store operating expenses year over year for the full year, it only grew not even 1%. So I was just curious. Is there a comp issue going on or maybe you can provide some details on if there's any initiatives that are that you're working on that are keeping a lid on some of your operating expenses? Thank you.
Mike Mas: Yeah. Ki Bin. I really appreciate you noticing that because and I know the team will be very appreciative of that. It's just good hard work. By our operations team. Little bit of scale advantages, I I will say that. We we do have the benefit to Lisa's point. From a contract negotiation perspective. But it's just good, hard, diligent work know, in a rising price environment over the last several years, to calibrate our levels of service at the property level to ensure that we're delivering high service to our our tenants, to our to our end consumers. While also managing the the the P&L. It's as simple as that.
Ki Bin Kim: I'm sure your tenants appreciate it too. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Paulina Roxas with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.
Paulina Roxas: Good morning. And my question is really big picture. And today, there is significant uncertainty around immigration policies and tariffs. So how sensitive do you see your business and the retail sector in general? To the to the direction is policy. This policy state. I mean, I'm not asking for a position a specific position on the topic. I would certainly don't have much clarity on what could finally implemented? I'm more interested on your thoughts really around, one, how it impactful it could be for Regency and to what variables do you think are more relevant to monitor, whether it's construction cost, retailer profitability for a specific tenant category, any other factor?
Lisa Palmer: I appreciate the question, Paulina, and I'm glad that you asked not for the position or for a prediction, because if I could predict and more than likely wouldn't be sitting in the seat that I'm sitting in today. I'd be doing something I'd be doing something different. But, you know, similar to past recessions and economic cycles, I think that the way we think about it is that we do not expect there to be a material impact to the Regency portfolio. And that is because we are so well positioned. You know, if you take the trade areas in which we operate, so one, that the consumer in those trade areas is very resilient. And, it it has been able to you know, even in the past inflationary very high inflationary years, absorb price increases. You think about the quality of our centers themselves and then therefore merchandising mix, the focus on necessity service, value, those categories tend to perform better in inflationary environments in in through economic cycles, and because of the quality of our portfolio, we tend to have those operating units within larger scale, you know, portfolios of our tenants are producing better sales. And if you're producing higher sales, you can afford to pay the rent and the consumers continue to come in. So I will never say that we are immune to economic cycles, impacts from tariffs, neither will our will our tenants be. But I don't believe that at this time, with what we are looking forward to, that the impact would be material. I mean, the other thing too is think about how resilient and adaptive and flexible our our tenants have been. They have operated through some really difficult times, and they have survived. Even if there's even if their margins are being squeezed, they continue to grow their sales and they continue to make money and they continue to pay rent. It's a win-win. If they grow sales, we collect rent, and we can grow that rent. So I do not expect for it to be that significant. On immigration side and the supply the labor supply potential impacts. Anytime construction costs go up, again, it's something it's a challenge for us and it's something that we have dealt with. We've dealt with it for the past four years, and we've been very successful and still achieving our development goals and achieving our development returns. So again, could it could there be an impact or could? And I expect we'll continue to have success.
Paulina Roxas: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Linda Tsai: Yes. Hi. On developments being north of the 7% yield and getting a hundred tips plus spread over acquisitions. How stable is that yield or spread if you look out one to two years just given the rising cost of labor and construction.
Nick Wibbenmeyer: Linda. Linda, it's Nick. Appreciate the question. Now, as Lisa just alluded to, we're we're hyper focused on doing our best to maintain those yields. And even in environments when costs are a little more unpredictable, and so we take that into account in our underwriting on those transactions. And so I hope we don't see in the next couple of years what we saw looking over our shoulder the last several years, but as you can look at our in-process, pipeline and what the team's been able to deliver, more times than not on the margin, we've actually outperformed even in the face of those cost increase over the last several years and that's because our team does a really, really thoughtful job project by project of one, derisking these transactions as much as we can. So while we have control of the real estate before we close, before we start construction, we spend significant time and effort and money on diligence and drawings and getting bids in hand. And where there is inputs that we don't have perfect visibility to, we appropriately underwrite what we believe are acceptable cost increases going forward. And so as Lisa just said, we we had to do that a lot over the last several years. We're likely gonna have to do it going forward in our our teams have done a really nice job of delivering those results.
Operator: Thank you. We have reached the end of the question and answer session. At this point, I'd like to turn the call back over to Lisa Palmer for closing comments. Like we have one more person in the queue, I think.
Lisa Palmer: K.
Operator: Yes. Okay. Our next question, it jumped into the queue. Sure, is from Mike Mueller. With JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Mike Mueller: Yeah. Hi. Just a quickie here. At 94.1% leased, can you squeeze any more occupancy out of the small shops, or is that essentially full?
Alan Roth: Can I just say yes? Ahead, Ellen. I was gonna I was gonna crack a similar comment. I I do appreciate the question. And we have said quarter after quarter after quarter records are meant to be broken. So we stopped thinking about where that can go. Our teams are hyper-focused. They are gonna lease as much space as they can. They're gonna continue to take advantage of the quality of the real estate and the quality of the environment that we're in. So we are gonna keep pushing for our shareholders and for the portfolio.
Lisa Palmer: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Bye.
Operator: Yeah. There are no further questions at this time. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Lisa Palmer for closing comments.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you. And since Alan just ended with that comment, before I say thank you to all of you, I would say thank you to the entire Regency team for these exceptional results, and looking forward to an even better 2025. Thank you all for your time. Appreciate it. Thanks.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation. And you may disconnect your lines at this time. Goodbye.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-29 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Regency Centers Corporation Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Christy McElroy. Thank you, and over to you.
Christy McElroy: Good morning, and welcome to Regency Centers' third quarter 2024 earnings conference call.

This will allow everyone who'd like to ask a question an opportunity to do so. Lisa?
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Christy. Good morning, everyone. We are proud to report another really great quarter of results driven by the hard work of our team and continued robust operating fundamentals, including sustained strength in tenant demand. This is evident in our strong rent growth, our sizable leasing pipeline, our same-property leased occupancy rate, which we've now posted above 96%, another record high for shop occupancy and accelerating same-property NOI growth. As a result, we are raising current year guidance and now expect same property NOI growth of 3.5% and core operating earnings per share growth of nearly 5%. We've also continued to be very active on the investment side, especially through our development platform. Nick will go into more detail, but we've had another strong year of development and redevelopment starts and we've already achieved our annual target of $200 million to $250 million of project starts for the second consecutive year. This success in sourcing new opportunities is a product of the team's expertise, relationships and the strong tenant demand we are experiencing across our portfolio, and it is supported by our cost of capital and strength of our balance sheet. As our grocery partners and other tenants look to further expand their footprints, high-quality space in top trade areas is hard to come by, creating an opportunity for us to leverage our platform. And as we further grow our ground-up development pipeline, it will increasingly be a significant and unequaled differentiator for Regency across the peer group, amplifying total NOI growth beyond the impacts of our same property portfolio. In addition to our development pipeline, in 2024, we've deployed nearly $300 million of capital into accretive transactions, including shopping center acquisitions and the repurchase of our own shares. Overall, we had an exceptional quarter driving both strong organic growth within our current portfolio and creating meaningful value through our investments for the future. Yes, the operating fundamentals are robust in our sector today, but more importantly, our results reflect the talent of our team and quality of our portfolio, positioning Regency to thrive in the current environment as well as through economic cycles. Our assets are intentionally located in strong suburban trade areas benefiting from limited new supply. Our grocery-anchored neighborhood and community centers represent what we believe is the optimal retail format to serve consumers looking for necessity, service, convenience and value. And we believe the high quality of our centers with careful attention to merchandising mix, placemaking and connecting with our communities provides our centers with superior competitive positioning in the marketplace. In summary, I am so grateful for and proud of the efforts of our team in driving our strong performance and delivering exceptional results quarter after quarter. I really look forward to what we can achieve heading into 2025. Alan?
Alan Roth: Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. We had a tremendous quarter of operating and leasing results evidenced in our strong base rent and same-property NOI growth. This was largely driven by robust leasing activity, accelerated rent commencement timing, higher shop tenant retention, lower credit loss and favorable impact to expense recoveries due to higher occupancy. With regard to our occupancy, we ended the quarter above 96% leased for the first time since 2018 within our same property portfolio, up another 20 basis points. We achieved yet another new milestone in our shop occupancy rate, ending the quarter at a record high of 93.7%. Our ability to move the occupancy needle higher is reflective of continued robust demand from both anchor and shop tenants in a wide range of categories, including grocers, restaurants, health and wellness, off-price and personal services. Our same property commenced rate was up 40 basis points this quarter as we saw great progress accelerating rent commencement dates for the signed leases in our SNO pipeline, with earlier move in a credit to the hard work and collaboration between the tenants and our local teams. But even as we've gotten many tenants open and rent commencing, we've further replenished our SNO pipeline through our continued leasing success. It remains substantial today at 340 basis points and nearly $50 million of incremental base rent, representing a significant runway to commence occupancy and a tailwind to NOI growth looking ahead. We achieved strong blended cash rent spreads of more than 9% in the third quarter and GAAP rent spreads exceeding 20% further demonstrating our ability not only to drive high rent increases when we are marking our leases to market, but also to embed meaningful contractual rent steps. Our retention rate remains above our historical average at over 85% in the quarter, while we also generated above-average renewal rent spreads of 9%. These positive renewal trends are reflective of the quality of our centers and the strong performance that our tenants are experiencing. Due to the great success we've had increasing occupancy, achieving strong rent spreads, embedding annual rent steps and retaining tenants, our same property NOI growth, excluding term fees and COVID period reserve collections, was ahead of our expectations for the quarter at 4.9%, with the majority of that growth coming from base rent contribution of 2.7%. We also had positive contribution from lower bad debt, which is indicative of the strong health and credit position of our tenant base. On the expense side, our team has had success in managing our operating expenses and we've also seen an improvement in our expense recovery rate due primarily to higher shop occupancy and reflective of our ability to maximize the value of our lease contracts. In closing, I am proud of the great work from our team in delivering exceptional results, and we are energized for the opportunities to further drive NOI growth in 2025. Nick?
Nick Wibbenmeyer: Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone. We had another very active quarter of accretive investment activity, further building our value creation pipeline, including the start of 2 ground-up development projects, great execution on our in-process projects and additional acquisitions of high-quality grocery-anchored shopping centers. Year-to-date, we've started more than $220 million of new development and redevelopment projects at blended yields exceeding 10%. For the second consecutive year, we anticipate starting more than $250 million of projects with roughly half of those costs associated with ground up developments in 2024. In the third quarter alone, we started nine projects totaling over $100 million, including two new ground-up developments. One of those we discussed on last quarter's call, a 160,000 square foot H-E-B anchored development in Houston called Jordan Ranch, which will serve as the retail component of a new driving master plan community. The second is an 80,000 square foot Safeway anchored ground-up project in the Bay Area called Oakley Shops that we started in August. This project will serve as the primary retail destination in this attractive suburban trade area. We also continued to make great progress executing our in-process pipeline, which now totals over $600 million. Leasing activity of both development and the redevelopment projects remained robust with the projects currently more than 90% leased on average with blended returns exceeding 9%. This quarter, we completed the Glenwood Green ground-up development in Old Bridge, New Jersey. We've seen strong community reception to this targeted ShopRite-anchored project now over 95% leased with tenants performing extremely well. In fact, we've meaningfully outperformed our underwriting expectations due to the strong leasing demand, enhancing the IRR and resulting in a 50 basis point increase to our estimated stabilized yield. As Lisa discussed earlier, our ground-up development program is a key differentiator for Regency across the peer group. We fully expect it to be an increasingly additive component to total NOI growth in coming years as we bring many of these projects online. The strong momentum and success of our sector-leading development program continues to be supported by the macro tailwinds within the shopping center industry as well as the hard work of Regency's experienced development team, which I believe to be the best in the business. Our talent and relationships, combined with our flexible balance sheet and free cash flow provide us with an unequaled advantage in the shopping center development business today, particularly with ground-up opportunities. In addition to our $220 million of project starts and $200 million of share repurchases this year, we've also successfully completed the acquisition of more than $90 million of shopping centers, bringing our year-to-date investment activity to more than $500 million. In August, we acquired a neighborhood center in a strong suburban trade area in East Greenidge, Rhode Island, anchored by a market-leading grocery. Subsequent to quarter end, we acquired an HEB-anchored center located in the prime retail node in the Austin suburb of Round Rock. Our team continues to be actively engaged sourcing and underwriting additional deals that fit our investment criteria. In closing, our entire investment team is engaged and excited about our opportunity set. We look forward to not only seeing the growing benefits of our larger value creation pipeline, but also continued success sourcing new projects and accretive acquisitions. Mike?
Mike Mas: Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. We reported strong third quarter results, outpacing our expectations primarily driven by fundamental operating performance. Results include Nareit FFO of $1.07 per share and core operating earnings of $1.03 per share for the quarter. Same-property NOI growth was 4.9%, excluding term fees and COVID period reserve collections, with the majority of that growth coming from base rents. As a result of this outperformance and continued higher expectations for the rest of the year, we're raising our current year guidance ranges. I'll refer you to the detail on Slides 5 and 6 in our earnings presentation, while highlighting some key changes. The primary driver to our elevated earnings outlook is an increase in our same-property NOI growth by 100 basis points from the prior midpoint, now to 3.5%, excluding term fees and COVID period reserve collections. We now expect to maintain a higher average commenced occupancy rate this year due to a combination of accelerated rent commencement as we deliver our SNO pipeline and higher shop retention rates, reducing downtime impacts. Credit loss was also coming in lower than we had originally planned given favorable uncollectible lease income rates or lower bad debt and positive bankruptcy outcomes. Notably, we now expect a credit loss range of 50 to 75 basis points this year, down from our previous range of 75 to 100 basis points. And lastly, following these higher levels of commenced occupancy, same-property NOI is also benefiting from higher net expense recoveries. We increased both our Nareit FFO and core operating earnings ranges by $0.05 per share at the midpoint primarily driven by the increase to our same-property NOI growth outlook I just described. The new midpoint of our core operating earnings range represents nearly 5% year-over-year growth. Looking ahead to next year, while we have not yet provided our full suite of earnings guidance as we will do that in February with our Q4 results, today, we want to provide some initial color to help with future expectations. For 2025, we expect same-property NOI growth to be very similar to our recently increased expectation for this year in the 3.5% area. And for Nareit FFO, we expect 2025 growth of at least 5%. As for a couple of reminders, in 2025, we will absorb the full-year impact from this year's debt refinancing activity and we also know that this year's merger-related expenses of approximately $7 million will not repeat. Moving to our balance sheet. We completed a $325 million bond issuance in August at a 5.1% coupon which was used to pay down the balance of our line of credit. Following this transaction, we remain within our target leverage range of 5x to 5.5x debt to EBITDA and we expect to generate free cash flow of more than $160 million this year, fueling the growth of our development pipeline. We continue to be very proud of our balance sheet and liquidity position, providing Regency with a cost of capital advantage and the ability to create value when accretive opportunities arise. With that, we look forward to your questions.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now be conducting our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Jeffrey Spector with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Andrew Reale: Hi. This is Andrew Reale on for Jeff. Thanks for taking our question. Just on the balance sheet, you received the credit rating upgrade from Moody's this year, no significant refi needs until late 2025. And given you're now at the low end of your target leverage range, just wondering what your appetite is for levering up to fund growth? And has the reversal in interest rates changed your financing plans at all?
Mike Mas: I'll take that, Andrew. I appreciate the question. I would characterize our position within our ranges at the midpoint. And I think we're very comfortable kind of floating between that 5x and 5.5x debt-to-EBITDA range. As we've demonstrated this year, we will lean into balance sheet capacity when we have it and when we see compelling opportunities. This year, in fact, we did that through the repurchase of our own stock. And I think it's important to remind everyone and consider that as we look at external growth comparisons across the peer group, that for us, that was an allocation of our capital on an accretive basis, providing about $0.01 of earnings accretion this year and another $0.01 looking out into the future. To the extent we see compelling opportunities going forward, we'll continue to use our free cash on a – leverage free cash flow on our balance sheet capacity. And if we see something that's accretive to our internal rate of growth and consistent with our quality, we might even take that up to the upper end of our range. But we are committed to operating within the 5 to 5.5x area, and we'll continue to do so going forward.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please go ahead.
Michael Goldsmith: Good morning. You took the same property NOI growth expectation for 2024 to 3.5%. You're pointing to a similar number for 2025 and this represents an acceleration from what you experienced in the first half of this year. So I guess what has changed? Is it the strength of the leasing environment and the market that's kind of like caught up and now you're starting to reap the benefit of that and accelerating the same property NOI? Or are there some other factors that come into play, I guess, just trying to understand what has changed that makes you feel more comfortable about this higher level of growth and that is sustainable?
Mike Mas: I can start, if the team would like and I'll let Alan opine on the changes. But just from a numbers and sense perspective, Michael, nothing has really changed from our perspective. We've been pretty loud and confident over the past couple of quarters about our projections for future potential NOI growth and earnings growth following on. We knew coming into the year that we would have a bit of a trough in our average commenced occupancy, but we are also emboldened by the SNO pipeline that the team continued to build and replenish as we commence rent. One thing that has changed this year and especially invalidated through the third quarter, is that we've accelerated rents coming out of that SNO pipeline into productivity that has had a tag-along impact from a recovery percentage and it's really that timing of that kind of launch of our growth profile that we thought would be – originally thought would be a fourth quarter event going into 2025. We started that process earlier through the third quarter results, really as a testament to the team's hard work, as a testament to the continued tailwinds we're seeing in the market.
Alan Roth: Yes, I'm happy to jump in, Michael. I appreciate the question. As Mike said, we've been at it for a number of quarters now in terms of really focused on the rent commencement date acceleration and creativity is paying off, and there's also great partnerships with our tenants. And we are proactively white boxing spaces where appropriate. We are getting tenants to start plans before leases are signed, in many cases, something that was not a norm many, many months ago, ordering the right equipment in advance and negotiating favorable lease terms. And interestingly, the permitting and supply chain is really normalizing now, and it's allowing us to be more aggressive on defaults when tenants aren't prosecuting their plans and their permits. And collectively, we're starting to see it really pay off in terms of acceleration of rent commencement days.
Lisa Palmer: Let's make a trifecta if you don't mind, Michael. I think we began talking about the growth that we expected and how good we felt about 2025 two quarters ago. And as Alan and Mike both said, we're starting to see the fruits of all the hard work and the quality of our portfolio and the quality of the team come through a little bit sooner. And the good thing is the 2025 growth is still there. And I know you're really familiar with our business model as most people are on the call. We really do believe, again, with the quality of our portfolio, the quality of our team and the redevelopment platform that we have will enable us on a stable occupancy basis to deliver same property NOI growth, that's, say, close to 3% on a sustainable steady basis. And while we're increasing occupancy, it's going to be higher. And that's what we're seeing. And the team continues to set the bar higher and higher for what we're able to achieve. So we feel really good about our results, and I'm really proud of the team.
Michael Goldsmith: Appreciate all the perspectives.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Craig Mailman with Citi. Please go ahead.
Craig Mailman: Hey, good morning. Maybe on the capital deployment front, you guys are getting the money out there on the redevelopment side, and you put the $300 million out to acquisitions and share repurchases this year. But as you look at the acquisition market, do you feel like there's an opportunity for transactions one-off to accelerate above that $90 million as we head into 2025? And does it make sense from a funding perspective to kind of take the win on the share repurchase? Could that be a source of proceeds going forward to kind of reissue now that you're at or above kind of at least our NAV?
Nick Wibbenmeyer: Craig, this is Nick. Good morning. Appreciate the question. I'll take the first part and then have Mike maybe weigh in on the second part. But as you've indicated, we've really been active across all fronts. And so as we've said in the past, we will continue to prioritize our free cash flow and our capacity to our development and redevelopment program. And as I indicated in our prepared remarks, we have every indication we'll end this year, again, north of $250 million in that program, similar to last year. And then as Mike alluded to earlier in the call, we have additional capacity to lean into when we find other opportunities that meet our criteria. And so as we look at one-off acquisitions, as we've talked about, if we find things that are consistent with our quality and our growth profile, we do have the capacity to lean in, especially when we identify ones that we can fund accretively. And so you can see throughout the year, we've found those opportunities, and as we continue to identify those whether it's in 2024 or 2025, the great news is we do have the ability and capacity to execute on this.
Mike Mas: Hey, Craig, let me follow up there. Thank you, Nick. From a capital sourcing perspective, we're going to be disciplined. We're very proud of our capital allocation track record. We have access to many forms of capital. We'll be very cognizant around our understanding of our incremental cost of capital when we deploy it. And we'll use equity when and if that makes sense. But we have the balance sheet capacity. We have access to equity. Let me also throw in the acquisition we closed just after quarter end was with our partnership with Oregon. That's another new form of capital or a newly expanded form of capital that we have access to with a recommitment to that 25-year-old vehicle of another $150 million of equity from Oregon. So we have multiple sources of capital. We'll use it very – on a disciplined basis with a mindset of growing earnings per share going forward.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
Greg McGinniss: Hey. Good morning. Mike, it's obviously a fairly substantial same-store NOI increase this late in the year. Would you be able to maybe rank out in terms of contributing to that increase the items listed? So the higher commenced occupancy and associated recoveries, the retention rate or just on the bad debt side. And just trying to get an understanding as to which of those factors you think maybe kind of long-term contributors in terms of how leasing and business is going or in terms of how you're handling tenants?
Mike Mas: Yes. Greg, I appreciate it. You got the categories right. So higher retention rates, accelerated commencements out of that F&O pipeline all leading to and translate into higher recoveries. I would say roughly 40% of the increase is from credit loss improvement, and that would be both a combination of ULI of bad debt expense, down from our expectations back in August on the margin. And I'd say they're running – our run rate year-to-date is 40 basis points. That's – as we've talked about in the past, that's below our historical averages. Our outcomes on bankruptcies is part of that 40% component. The balance is roughly split evenly between accelerated commencements, higher retention and higher recoveries as a result. So that's how we compartmentalize the change.
Greg McGinniss: From a news flow perspective, it sounds like we're hearing about more retailers under risk or more store closures and especially more restaurant closures. As we're looking forward into 2025, for now at least, not looking for guidance, but is the expectation for kind of a normalization on the bad debt side? Or is there anything in particular about the portfolio or what you're seeing from the consumer maybe making you a bit more bullish on that front?
Mike Mas: Yes. We're going to be short of offering a full suite of guidance at this point in time. But I do think it's fair to indicate that we would plan for a roughly historical average level of bad debt and credit loss next year. So recall that bad debt expense and bankruptcy output, that's basically a 75 to 100 basis point credit loss provision. So I would plan for that level next year. From a color's perspective, Alan, if there's anything you want to share?
Alan Roth: Yes. I mean, Greg, I would just say that we're always intensely managing the portfolio. And one comment I made last quarter as I identified some of those bankruptcy filings that you had noted, Conn's, we had zero locations, Eastern Mountain Sports through 21 and Red Lobster, we had one with all three of them. And so was that an anomaly in Q2? I think as you look at the Q3 filings now, a similar thing has happened, Buca di Beppo has filed, Roti has filed, Big Lots has filed and we have one location with all three of those as well. And so I think that's just a testament to really the team staying committed to quality merchandising and really our qualification process. And we feel good about the strength of the sales, as Lisa mentioned, the strength of the portfolio and the markets that we're operating in right now, but we're certainly always keeping a watchful eye on it.
Christy McElroy: And just as a reminder, we are limiting to one question. We have a lot of people in the queue. Thanks, Greg.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Todd Thomas: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to ask about UBP and the guidance increase this quarter was mostly attributable to the same-store, and that's where the majority of the discussion has been. But two questions around that. Can you just remind us when that portfolio will enter the same-store pool? And how we should think about maybe that impacting 2025 growth? And then can you provide an update on sort of the opportunities for upside that you see within that portfolio as it stands today?
Mike Mas: Yes. Hey, Todd. Welcome to the party by the way. I will take the first and I'll let Alan maybe comment on activity within the portfolio. We will officially move those assets into same property effective with Q1 of next year. So we'll come out of the gates next year with UBP assets as part of our same-store portfolio. My comments around growth next year would include those assets. So 3.5% – in the area of 3.5% growth next year would include performance from UBP. Honestly, we don't see a material difference between the performance of those assets and Regency's at this point in time. And that was all consistent with the outlook we had going into the merger to begin with.
Alan Roth: Hey, Todd. This is Alan. I would just say we are thrilled with the expanded platform, more thrilled with the integration of some really great people. But things are going well. We signed over 200 leases year-to-date in the portfolio, and we've got runway to continue to grow that percent lease. And that is the one thing we've been saying since the acquisition is it's really a hyper focus on lease, lease, lease. From a redevelopment perspective as you asked, we do think there's going to be some opportunity there, but it's in sort of a smaller mindset on the front end, had some pad creations in the parking lot, a couple of renovations and mid to long-term, we'll evaluate some bigger redevelopments. But I would use our Danbury Square as a good example. At the time of the merger, it was 50% leased and through a really great leasing by the team, we are at 96% now. So that's sort of the mindset within the portfolio, and that's where we're focused.
Lisa Palmer: And if you are new to the party, it has performed, as Alan said, as we'd expected, if not slightly above our expectations, exactly what we thought. And at the time when we did announce the merger, we did comment that it is very consistent with our quality. There weren't a ton of redevelopment opportunities, and it was going to be a leasing exercise that we underwrote and anticipated spending a little bit more capital because of the amount of leasing that we're going to do performing exactly as we expected. And so when we rolled in the same-property percent leased, it's still not as well leased as you will call legacy Regency. So we still have some opportunity there. And that is really what you'll see when we roll it in the same property.
Christy McElroy: Thanks, Todd.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Juan Sanabria: Hi. Good morning. Just hoping you could talk a bit about 2024 performance obviously has been better than you'd expected and your early thoughts on 2025. Is the earlier-than-expected rent commencement, is that pulling forward growth that you otherwise would have thought would have come next year? And should we think of the 3.5% is kind of the floor on growth next year? I recognize this is a little bit of a sensitive question, just but any color you can give on how we should be thinking about the puts and takes would be helpful? Thank you.
Mike Mas: Yes. I appreciate the question, Juan, and you'll appreciate the response. The 3.5% area is what we're indicating for next year. I think that's enough to share at this point in time. Listen, we're still working on the finer edges of our plan for next year, and we'll put out a full suite of guidance next quarter, and we'll give you, as we customarily do, a lot of transparency into the support for that. But no, to your first question, I don't feel like it's pull-forward. I feel like this is a launching point. And we've been talking about this for some time, anticipating the launch point of growth to be late 2024 and into 2025. And I think we've just launched sooner. Importantly, as you think about our SNO pipeline, it was $50 million last quarter, $50 million again this quarter roughly. But that doesn't tell the story. We've replenished $14 million of ABR in that portfolio. So we've delivered $14 million a little sooner than we anticipated on average, but we filled it right back up. And that's what's kind of raising our eye level or the kind of water level for us in 2024 and then compounding that into 2025.
Christy McElroy: Thanks, Juan.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Dori Kesten with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Dori Kesten: Thanks. Good morning. It looks like some of the legacy Urstadt office building sales were pushed into 2025 in your disposition guide. Can you just remind us if there's any other non-core, non-long-term assets from Urstadt that remain beyond those?
Mike Mas: I got – let me talk about the guidance. And Nick, if you'd like to color it up, please do so. Dori, it was just a bit of a change in, as you mentioned, we had three or four Urstadt Biddle kind of very small office buildings that we would like to move. They're non-core, non-strategic assets. I think in total, we're talking $15 million or so of proceeds. We've moved that out of this year and more to come on our disposition guidance next year. We are going to withhold that until next quarter. I want to remind you of what we said at the time of the merger. There is nothing disproportionate about the quality of the Urstadt Biddle assets as we merge them into Regency and they won't result in a disproportionate kind of disposition program going forward.
Christy McElroy: Thanks, Dori.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. May we request you to unmute your mic and go ahead with your question, please?
Haendel St. Juste: Yes. Rookie mistake. So I appreciate the color on 2025 the initial kind of guide posts. I guess my question is on the debt maturities here. You've got $300 million or so of debt maturing next year with three handles on them. So I guess I'm curious what's your plan? What you're thinking there? Perhaps timing? And is that refinancing kind of embedded within that 5% FFO growth outlook for next year? Thanks.
Mike Mas: Yes. The Nareit FFO head NOD would include the impacts from the debt changes both in 2024 and in 2025. So importantly, the largest impact actually has to do with what we financed this year, which, as you know, was all effected basically right at the midpoint of the year in June. So we need to capture a full-year of that in 2025, but we do have a very late 2025 maturity that we have incorporated into that head NOD. We're going to – it's at a favorable rate, as you mentioned, we're going to use that capital and that cost of capital as long as we can. We're going to be very tactical with our windows selection as we work in the capital markets next year, and we will refinance that bond into the public market at the right time.
Christy McElroy: Thanks, Haendel.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Matt on for Ron. You guys mentioned that tenant demand was very strong this quarter, and you could see that in the same-property shop percent lease number. How should we be thinking about that going forward over the next 12 to 24 months?
Alan Roth: Hey, Matt. Thank you for the question. This is Alan. Demand is strong. And I would say we set a recent record high on shop leasing at 93.7%. But we're not pulling the troops off right now. They're staying focused. We are seeing a lot of tenants still willing to engage, not just on vacant spaces, but on spaces that are occupied right now. And Sephora, J.Crew, EverBank, Mendocino Farms, they're all looking at spaces that are occupied not just signing leases in 2025, and I'm just naming a few but also signing leases in 2026. So we would expect to continue pushing forward. I don't have my sight set on a particular number as part of that process, but we're focused on continuing to drive the shops, and we're focused on our anchor side as well, trying to get that back to our peak levels of roughly 98.5%. So we believe there's runway and the team is committed.
Lisa Palmer: I'm disappointed that Alan didn't say it for like the third consecutive quarter.
Alan Roth: Records are meant to be broken, Lisa.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you.
Alan Roth: Matt, thanks for the question.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you, guys.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Samir Khanal with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Samir Khanal: Hey, Mike. On the 3.5% for next year, I just want to understand because I think the expectation is for the group and not only Regency but the group to accelerate growth next year. So look, maybe you're being conservative here, but I get the rent commencements, the higher occupancy. But is there something that's sort of putting a lid on better growth next year? I just want to make sure that I'm not missing anything there? Thanks.
Mike Mas: I don't think you're missing anything, Samir. And I actually – I mean, as Lisa's point that she was making earlier in the call, this is above-trend growth. This is 3.5% two consecutive years is on a stabilized basis that would be considered exceptional. We are benefiting from occupancy gains. I wanted to – from Matt's question and yours, I would encourage people to take a look at Page 7 in the earnings deck that we put out. And that really frames for everyone the opportunity set to move percent commenced. I will share with you that as we – as a supporting element of that 3.5% head NOD in the next year, we are anticipating move in commenced by – in the area of 75 to 100 basis points north, which if you study the history of that page, you'll see moving commenced occupancy by 100 basis points is about as good as we – and about as fast as we can run. And the teams are pushing the pace on that every single day, and we're very proud of them. But that's a – 75, 100 basis points, a very healthy change in percent commence. So to answer your question directly, what's the headwind, frankly, it's just time. We've got to lease the space. We've got to build out those space. We've got to deliver that space. And we're doing that as well as we possibly can right now. I'm very proud of the team.
Christy McElroy: Thanks, Samir.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Floris van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please go ahead.
Floris van Dijkum: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. You have one of the highest percentages of ABR coming from shop space in the sector, I think, at 58%. But as you look at this SNO pipeline and typically – which I think is around 57% shop, but shop rents are double the typical anchor rent. I mean is there a scenario here over the next 18 to 24 months where you're going to have more than 60% of your ABR coming from shop space?
Lisa Palmer: Floris, I'm not going to get into necessary specifics. I hope that we continue to lease and bring and commence our anchors as well as shop space. But when you think about just our investment strategy, our portfolio quality for as long as I can remember, even at a time when there were some of our competitors that were talking about accumulating shop space and making them into anchors, we have not been afraid of shop space. We like shop space. Clearly, you just pointed to the fact that the rents are higher. We typically get better contractual rent steps, the growth is better. But at the same time, it's a balance. We also very much appreciate and acknowledge the steadiness, the sustainability of the cash flows that we get from our anchors. I remind you, it's been, what, almost four or five years now. But because of the quality of the cash flow and the NOI stream that our shopping centers, we didn't need to cut our dividend during COVID. And I think that that's really – it's a really important factor, and we balance it. But we lean in the shop space, we like shop space, we like the format of our existing portfolio. We really – and we intend to continue to grow in that sector.
Floris van Dijkum: Thanks, Lisa.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Floris.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Linda Tsai: Hi. Thank you. In terms of building and replenishing the SNO pipeline, you said you replenished with $14 million this year, do you think that stays elevated or compresses next year?
Mike Mas: Well, it's a blessing and a curse, right? We want to continue to elevate. We want to continue to lease more space and absorb and set new records, as Alan indicated, but we're also going to commence rent, right? Linda, I do think from a trajectory perspective, we will commence that SNO pipeline over time and into 2025. As we – because we're just running out of – we're hitting kind of top ends of percent leased.
Lisa Palmer: [Less space storage].
Mike Mas: You should expect us to compress that going forward as our outlook for material move-outs isn't significantly high either. So I do anticipate us compressing that going forward. It won't compress to historical averages in one year. We have – and we're on the same page internally here. We have more than one year of growth ahead of us in a disproportionate manner because of increases in rent paying occupancy.
Linda Tsai: Thank you.
Lisa Palmer: Thanks, Linda.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Alec Feygin with Baird. Please go ahead.
Alec Feygin: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. One on the development pipeline, it looks like it's currently at $237 million. I'm curious how big that pipeline can get in the next year?
Nick Wibbenmeyer: Yes. I appreciate the question, Alec. So as you alluded, our total in-process development and redevelopment right now is over $600 million. So the team has just done an exceptional job of continuing to bring projects online but also continuing to execute on. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, Glenwood Green, the project we just completed, a ground-up project Old Bridge, New Jersey team did a phenomenal job of bringing that online. And so as we've indicated, we expect to start over $200 million a year. 2023, we started $250 million. This year, we expect just another $250 million of projects. And we're very bullish on the future pipeline as they move into future years of continuing to start and ultimately deliver over $200 million of projects year in and year out. We love the platform, and we're going to continue to lean into it.
Alec Feygin: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Michael Mueller: Yes. Hi. How does what you're expecting today for new development stabilization timeframes compare to what you saw, say, between the GFC and COVID?
Nick Wibbenmeyer: Yes, it's a great question, Mike. I would tell you, similar to what Alan's remarks were about what we're doing in terms of the operating portfolio and bringing tenants online aggressively. We're seeing the same thing on the development end. We are starting to see permitting, supply chain, bidding processes, I would call it, stabilized. And so I would expect our ground-up developments to – from commencement to – from commencement and construction to coming online, be in the two to three-year range, depending on the size of the project, the scale of the project and the construction timeline. But again, I'd point to Old Bridge a really good example of that. The team did a really nice job starting that and bringing it online, not only on time, actually a little ahead of schedule and ahead of budget as it relates to NOI. And so we have confidence in our ability right now to start these projects and deliver them on time and on budget.
Christy McElroy: Thank you, Mike.
Michael Mueller: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities. Please go head.
Ki Bin Kim: Thanks. Just a couple of follow-ups here. What drove other property rental income higher? And I'm curious if that's a more sustainable level?
Mike Mas: Hi, Ki Bin. Yes, real quick. So as you can see in the disclosure, we differentiate between other lease income and other property income. And just for everyone's benefit, lease-related other income items are in the lease line items, so think storage, signage, ATMs, temporary tenants, et cetera. Other property income is the ancillary income streams that our shopping centers can generate because of their quality in nature, but they're not contractual, right? So insurance settlements, fees, parking, et cetera, items like that. There was a planned higher level of other property income in the settlements area in the insurance settlements area that did come into fruition in the third quarter. Importantly, it was part of our initial plan coming into the year, so it is not a contributing factor to our outlook increase for the year. And it is onetime in nature, but so is everything within that category. What we know when we zoom out is that we will consistently drive other income in our portfolio because of its location qualities.
Ki Bin Kim: Okay. Thanks. And just going back to that 3.5% same-store NOI commentary on 2025, just trying to better understand some of the detracting elements. Are you at all watching any kind of larger leases that may not renew that might be causing some cushion into that same-store NOI number?
Mike Mas: We're highly – I mean, we're doing a bottom-up plan, Ki Bin. We're very aware of the needle mover leases. 2024 was a unique set of circumstances. So we – to the extent we have any big pluses or minuses from big anchor leases, those would be captured in that number. I do want to remind everyone, credit loss in 2024 in the 50 to 75 basis point area as a revised – on a revised basis. And in my comments earlier in the call, we will plan for more of a historical average year next year. So that is a touch of a headwind. And remember, historical averages are 75 to 100 basis points.
Ki Bin Kim: Okay. Thank you, Mike.
Mike Mas: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. As there are no further questions, I would now like to hand the conference over to Lisa Palmer for closing remarks.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you all for your time. I appreciate your interest in Regency, and we will see, hopefully, many of you in, I think, just a few weeks at Nareit. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to Regency Center Corporation's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Christy McElroy. Thank you. You may begin.
Christy McElroy: Good morning, and welcome to Regency Centers' Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Lisa Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Mas, Chief Financial Officer; Alan Roth, East Region President and Chief Operating Officer; and Nick Wibbenmeyer, West Region President and Chief Investment Officer. As a reminder, today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements about the company's views of future business and financial performance, including forward earnings guidance and future market conditions. These are based on management's current beliefs and expectations and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. It's possible that actual results may differ materially from those suggested by these forward-looking statements we may make. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements may be included in our presentation today and are described in more detail in our filings with the SEC, specifically in our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filings. In our discussion today, we will also reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. The comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this quarter's earnings materials, which are posted on our Investor Relations website. Please note that we have also posted a presentation on our website with additional information, including disclosures related to forward earnings guidance. Our caution on forward-looking statements also apply to these presentation materials. Finally, given the number of participants we have on the call today, we kindly and respectfully ask that you limit your questions to one and then rejoin the queue if you have any additional follow-up questions. This will allow everyone who'd like to ask a question an opportunity to do so. Lisa?
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Christy, and good morning, everyone. We had another great quarter driven by continued strong operating fundamentals and active and prudent capital allocation. While we recognize that the macro environment remains uncertain with mixed economic signals and inflationary pressures on consumers, our business continues to show strength. Consumers may be shopping with a new level of price awareness but that can be a benefit to our high-quality centers and our high-quality tenants given a focus on necessity, service, convenience and value. Sales and traffic trends remained steady and leasing demand continues to be strong. We are taking advantage of the solid and consistent tenant demand to drive rent growth and leasing activity with strong new and existing tenants. This is evidenced in our record shop lease rate and our sizable SNO pipeline. This will provide momentum and lease commencement into 2025. Our continued leasing success is a testament to the strength of Regency's high-quality grocery-anchored centers and strong suburban trade areas with limited new and available supply. Our value creation pipeline also supported by the strong tenant demand and focus on high-quality assets in demographically compelling areas is one of the most exciting aspects of our business today and one that truly sets or Regency apart. Our team continues to make meaningful progress sourcing new projects with another $250 million of expected starts in 2024 as well as executing on and delivering our existing pipeline. The strength of Regency's platform and ability to self-fund our program with free cash flow, have enabled our long track record of success. We also continue to acquire shopping centers when able to that are accretive to our quality growth and earnings. As previously disclosed, we acquired Compo Shopping Center in Westport, Connecticut in May, and we are currently under contract to purchase an additional asset in the Northeast. I can't stress enough the importance of our balance sheet strength and liquidity position, and providing us with an ability to be opportunistic across the spectrum of capital allocation strategies, which is why in addition to sourcing select high-quality, high-growth acquisition opportunities at upper single-digit IRRs, we were also able to take advantage of a meaningful disconnect and public and private market values this past quarter with the execution of a $200 million share repurchase. As many of you are well aware, along with our standards of quality and balance sheet strength, corporate responsibility is also a foundational strategy for Regency. This past quarter, we published our annual corporate responsibility report, highlighting our 2023 achievements as well as our future goals and strategy. Our best-in-class program is evident in the progress we've made toward our goals but also in the recognition we receive from third parties, including ranking sixth overall and first in the real estate industry for Newsweek's most responsible companies list and our continued recognition by GRESB for sustainability and disclosure leadership in our sector. I appreciate the efforts of all Regency team members in helping us achieve these important accomplishments. In closing, now that we are more than halfway through the year, with the strength in leasing activity and results that we've seen thus far, we are raising our eye level and our full year guidance range. Mike will go into more detail, but we've been able to move the needle on several fronts, including same property NOI, development activity and accretive capital allocation. I want to reiterate the importance of Regency's strategic competitive advantages, which position us favorably to continue to outperform over the long term as we have historically. These advantages include our high-quality assets and strong trade areas with favorable demographics, the strength of our operating platform and experience and talent of our people, a value-creation pipeline that gives us more leverage to drive growth and the balance sheet strength that allows us to opportunistically allocate capital, which we did very strategically in the second quarter. Alan?
Alan Roth: Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. We continue to have great leasing and operating success, reflecting the positive tenant demand environment for high-quality shopping centers in strong trade areas. We're seeing this robust demand from both new and existing tenants in a wide array of categories, including grocers, restaurants, health and wellness, off-price and personal services. Our success is evident in the continued depth and momentum in our leasing pipeline as well as in our ability to drive rents and occupancy higher and improve our expense recovery rate, all while still maintaining judicious capital spend. During the quarter, we held our same-property percent leased at 95.8%, while increasing our same-property percent commenced by 10 basis points to 92.3%. Our SNO pipeline sits at 350 basis points and represents approximately $49 million of incremental base rent. As we've discussed previously, the timing and commencement of this pipeline will largely impact the fourth quarter of 2024 and into 2025. Notably, beyond our signed pipeline of exciting retailers, we have another 1.3 million square feet of leases in negotiation. In the quarter, we were also able to drive strong blended cash rent spreads of more than 9%. GAAP and net effective rent spreads were in the upper teens, demonstrating our ability not only to drive strong mark-to-market increases but also continued success, negotiated embedded contractual rent step in nearly 100% of our leases. Our average rent steps on all leasing activity in the quarter was 2%. But importantly, we achieved a record high of 2.7% rent steps in new lease transactions. Collectively, these efforts drove same-property NOI growth of 3.3% in the second quarter, excluding term fees and COVID period reserve collections, while our base rent growth contribution remained very healthy at 2.9%. Before turning the call over to Nick, I wanted to address the recent Kroger and Albertsons announcement regarding the 579 stores they intend to divest to C&S Wholesale Grocers if a merger occurs. Regency has 11 owned locations on the C&S list out of the 104 combined Kroger and Albertsons locations in our portfolio. Further detail will be provided as we learn more, but regardless of the outcome of the proposed merger, we are very comfortable with the underlying lease obligations, and we continue to feel great about the quality of our real estate for all of these locations. In closing, as our portfolio occupancy approaches prior peak levels, combined with limited new high-quality supply and the strong trade areas in which we operate, our space is becoming more valuable. The strength in our leasing pipeline remains unabated, driven by continued appetite from retailers to expand. Our leasing and operating teams are firing on all cylinders, leveraging the current environment to deliver what we believe will be long-term sustainable performance in the years ahead. Nick?
Nick Wibbenmeyer: Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone. We remain very active growing and executing on our value creation pipeline, starting $40 million of new redevelopment projects in the second quarter and yields exceeding 10%. Additionally, subsequent to quarter end, we started an exciting new ground-up development project in Houston called the Jordan Ranch. This 160,000 square foot HEB-anchored center will serve as the retail component with that thriving master plan community. We are developing the center in a joint venture with the master plan developer, with Regency's investments being approximately $23 million, bringing our year-to-date starts to more than $140 million. As we've discussed on prior calls, master plan developers continue to appreciate the value and benefits of bringing Regency, an experienced developer, owner and operator of high-quality retail centers into their project. At the same time, we and our tenants recognize the benefits of developing our groceries and shopping centers directly adjacent to new, high-quality suburban residential communities. We also continue to make great progress executing on our in-process pipeline, which now totals nearly $580 million. Leasing activity remains robust with projects currently more than 90% leased at blended returns exceeding 9%. Turning to transactions. We have seen a recent pickup in activity in the private markets as well as deeper bidding pools. Our teams are actively underwriting opportunities that fit our investment strategy as well as return, growth and accretion requirements. In May, we closed on the purchase of Compo Shopping Center in Westport, Connecticut, which is adjacent to our Trader Joe's anchored Compo Acres Center. We also currently have a grocery-anchored center in the Northeast region under contract, which you'll note we've included in our updated acquisition guidance and on which we look forward to sharing more details post-closing. While cap rates have remained relatively low for high-quality centers and compelling opportunities at high single-digit IRRs are a limited opportunity set in today's market, we have been able to source these select assets where we believe we can drive accretion both to earnings as well as to our long-term growth rate. Looking ahead, our teams remain focused on continuing to source high-quality incremental investment opportunities, including accretive acquisitions like these as well as further building our value creation pipeline. It's true that it is difficult to find and execute new ground-up development opportunities at accretive returns, but this is where we believe our ability to create value is a meaningful differentiator for Regency. Our national platform and deep relationships, combined with our low cost of capital, liquidity and balance sheet strength enable us to be one of the only developers right now who can fund projects and execute at scale. You've heard us talk about our objective of starting more than $1 billion of development and redevelopment projects over the next five years. With $250 million of projects started in 2023, and another $250 million planned to start in 2024, we are confident in our visibility to achieving this goal. Mike?
Mike Mas: Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, we reported NAREIT FFO of $1.06 per share, core operating earnings of $1.02 per share and same-property NOI growth, excluding term fees and COVID period reserve collections of 3.3%. During the quarter, recognizing the meaningful disconnect between public and private market pricing, we executed on the opportunity to repurchase approximately 3.3 million shares for $200 million, representing an average price of just over $60 per share. We bought our shares at an implied cap rate of roughly 7% compared to where we are seeing private market values today for high-quality grocery-anchored centers in the 5.5% to 6.5% range, sometimes even in the low 5s. This opportunistic investment was accretive to earnings, and was afforded to us by our strong balance sheet and liquidity position. Importantly, we remain well within our strategic leverage range with an expectation to end the year around the midpoint of our 5 to 5.5 times net debt and preferred to EBITDA target. We also maintain flexibility to continue sourcing new accretive investment opportunities, including redevelopments, new ground-up developments and acquisitions. Turning to our forward guidance. I'll refer you to the details on Slides 5 through 6 in our earnings presentation and highlight some key changes. We increased our core operating earnings midpoint by $0.03 per share, which now implies close to 4% growth this year at the midpoint, excluding the COVID period reserve collections in 2023. As we show on Slide 6 in the presentation, this increase is driven in effectively equal parts by a 25 basis point increase in our same-property NOI growth range, now at 2.25% 2.75% an increase in expectations of non-same-property NOI, largely related to accelerated contributions from ground-up developments and the positive impact of capital allocation activity, net of financing including the share repurchases I've discussed previously. We also increased our NAREIT FFO range by $0.05 per share at the midpoint or an incremental $0.02 above our core operating earnings revision, matching the increase in our guidance for non-cash items. As a reminder, for modeling purposes, as you think about the mechanics of our interest expense and interest income for the balance of the year, recall that much of the proceeds from our January bond offering were parked in similar yielding deposit accounts as we awaited the $250 million June maturity date. Therefore, the impact of refinancing this debt at a higher rate will come through earnings in the second half of this year. Looking beyond year-end, we continue to point to the embedded growth elements we see over the next 18 to 24 months, coming from our leasing and redevelopment progress. As Alan mentioned, our SNO pipeline sits at 350 basis points, representing approximately $49 million of annual base rent of which about 65% is scheduled to commence by the end of this year. As these lease commencements are weighted to the fourth quarter, the resulting NOI growth will largely occur next year. And part of this commencement is within our redevelopment pipeline, where we continue to expect an outsized benefit to same-property NOI growth in 2025 from delivering completed projects with the positive contribution likely to exceed 100 basis points, which is double what we would have experienced in past normal years. Finally, we continue to be very proud of our sector-leading balance sheet and liquidity position, which provides Regency with the cost of capital advantage and the ability to invest opportunistically. Our debt is nearly all fixed rate. Our weighted average maturity is close to seven years. We remain within our targeted leverage range of 5 to 5.5 times net debt and preferred to EBITDA, and we expect to continue generating free cash flow of more than $160 million annually. Supported by our financial position, we often reference the available options within our capital allocation toolbox that we utilize for various reasons and at different times. And in the second quarter, we had a unique opportunity to purposely employ nearly all of these tools successfully and accretively from leasing to operations to investments to capital allocation and balance sheet management, wrapped together with an increased outlook on current year earnings, Regency's unequaled strategic advantages were on full display. With that, we look forward to taking your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Goldsmith: Good morning. Thanks all for taking my question. From a capital allocation perspective, you kind of did it all in the past quarter. You bought, you sold, you repurchased stock and you started ground-up development. So can you talk a little bit about your capital allocation priorities? And maybe just touch about what the cap rates are in the acquisition market for Regency type centers versus kind of how you are looking at the implied cap rate of where your stock was treating and caused you to buy back shares?
Lisa Palmer: Great. Thanks, Michael. I appreciate the question. And I appreciate the recognition that we basically used really every kind of tool, if you will, in the toolbox for capital allocation. Our goal -- our objective is to create value for our shareholders. And we remain very consistent in our belief that the best use of our capital is to our development and redevelopment program. And we absolutely believe that we are in the position, very intentionally that we had the capacity, the balance sheet strength, the liquidity to do it all this quarter. And we've been talking about that for quite some time now how we've been on the -- we are on the offensive. And we were able to execute that. And as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, in my history with -- in the sector with the company, all the stars need to align to successfully execute on a share repurchase program, and they did for us. So we bought back our shares at an implied cap rate of 7%, and this disconnect between public and private market pricing has been much more permanent than we ever imagined. And so we were able to lean into our balance sheet strength because while we are very active in the acquisition market as well, and I can have Nick just touch on that a little bit as to the cap rates we're seeing you can see that we've been active as well. We are seeing assets, shopping centers, grocery-anchored of the quality that we would like to invest in the 5.5 to -- if you're lucky, Nick likes to say it a lot, the needle in a haystack, bring in those that are 6.5. But those are rare. We're seeing a lot more and had a lot more conviction that are trading in the mid-5 cap rate range. And that made the share repurchase an excellent use of our capital. And I'd love for Nick to touch a little more on the transaction market and what we're seeing.
Nick Wibbenmeyer: Absolutely. Thank you, Lisa. I appreciate the question, Michael. As Lisa alluded to, we're seeing the bid pools are much deeper than they were a quarter ago. So things that are on market now have very bidding pools. And we're staying very disciplined to what we've always articulated, which is the opportunities that we're going to pull the trigger on have to be more accretive to our quality and our growth profile, and we have to fund accretively. And so the opportunities that we've disclosed so far this year. You can see those ingoing yields are in the mid-6s. We're very comfortable, they check all those boxes, but there have been a lot of opportunities in the market that have traded that are well below that cap rate and did not check all those boxes, and we stay disciplined to making sure we are ultimately driving accretion. And so we've seen things trade in the low 5s even.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Jeff Spector: Great, thank you. I do have a question on markets, but I know it's one question. Can I just confirm on the repurchase program to clarify the $250 million, that's still left?
Mike Mas: No, Jeff. So Jeff, we -- as a practice like just -- and our board likes to have an open repurchase program authorized by the Board at about a level of $250 million. So our activity in the quarter exhausted the previous authorization. So we've simply refreshed the authorization for another two years at $250 million capacity.
Operator: Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Juan Sanabria: Hi, good morning. And thanks for the time. I noticed the small shop occupancy ticked down a little bit sequentially. Just curious for some color behind that. Is there any signs of stress that you're seeing on the small shop side, in particular, with the local mom-and-pops? Or is that still relatively healthy?
Alan Roth: Juan, good morning. Let’s say, good afternoon. It's Alan. I appreciate the question. The short answer is no. There is no concern over the underlying fundamentals. We feel great about where we are in terms of the health of those regions, both national and local mom-and-pops. I would point you to how we're thinking about foot traffic being up 6% year-over-year, year-to-date. Sales are remaining healthy. Again, both in the national and local level. Retention rates are also above 80%, which is slightly above what our historical trends have been. So as we put all of that together, we feel very comfortable that where we sit today. The portfolio is certainly healthy. And I think that's largely a testament to how our teams go through a very rigorous qualification process for durability of occupancy.
Lisa Palmer: When we think about it, it's interesting. It seems like it shouldn't be this way. But when we're in the position of strength that we are in, we are much more comfortable getting space back and because we're able to re-lease it at higher rents and with better merchandising. So we are -- when a lease comes up for renewal, if the tenant isn't necessarily going to pay what we want them to pay. We are happy to move on.
Operator: Our next question comes from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.
Viktor Fediv : This is Viktor Fediv on for Greg McGinniss. I just wanted to ask on the credit side. So we have now $300 million on revolver. Are you on the market now for new decisions to cover that? Because we've seen a 20 bps decline today and more than 50 bps decline within the last month. So just curious what's your thoughts on that?
Mike Mas: I appreciate the question. First, I'd say we're very comfortable with our liquidity today. We recently recast our revolver so we have $1.5 billion of capacity. You're correct. We are at $300 million drawn on that facility. That's largely attributed to the active investments we made in the second quarter, largely also stemming from our repurchases. We're monitoring the capital markets, as you would expect us to. We do have a bias towards public unsecured financing on a long-term basis at a fixed rate, and we'll continue to monitor those markets. It is -- I mean, in the past 48 hours have been somewhat choppy, and we have seen a pretty significant rally in base treasury rates. But as you would expect, oftentimes with that type of movement, you start to see a little bit of weakness from a credit spread perspective. So just expect us to be highly attentive and attuned to where the market is going, and we will term out that facility when we think it's appropriate.
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig Mailman with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
Craig Mailman : Hey apologies, if someone asked this. I got dropped of the call. But just on the development side, you guys have been in a pretty good position here, having liquidity to start projects and clearly, higher interest rates made it difficult for peers. But given kind of the pullback in the 10-year here and potentially lower rates going forward, do you feel like it gets harder for you guys to source or at least a more competitive environment as maybe construction financing becomes an option for others going forward?
Nick Wibbenmeyer: Craig, this is Nick. I appreciate the question. Yes, look, as we've talked about a lot, there's a lot that goes in defining these development opportunities and executing on them. And you've heard me say time and time again, capital is one of those key components. And so if capital does become available, that does open up some opportunities for others. But let's not forget the other two needed ingredients, which is relationships and expertise to find and execute on these opportunities. And so we continue to have the best relationships in the business with not only the key tenants that are expanding, but also the brokers and landowners in those markets that we're looking to expand in. And clearly, our team has the expertise coast to coast. And so regardless of capital markets, we feel really good about our ability to get more than our fair share of these opportunities as we look forward. And our shadow pipeline continues to grow as we're getting arms around these opportunities.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Samir Khanal with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.
Samir Khanal : Good morning, everybody. I guess, Mike or Lisa, can you expand on the opportunities that exist on the shop space? I'm just trying to understand how much more you can push on occupancy when you clearly will have one of the best growth in the strip sector next year, right? And I'm just trying to see from a -- whether it's first start bid, or just trying to see how much more incremental growth there could be versus kind of what you've already put out for '25 at this point.
Lisa Palmer: I think the team might be petrified if I answer this question because I'll just keep pushing and pushing and pushing. So I'll let Mike answer it.
Mike Mas: Let me start, and Alan, you can cover my comments up. But just kind of fundamentally, Samir, Page seven in our quarterly investor materials is really helpful. And I think that's what gets us so excited about our near-term prospects for growth. And I would point you to the percent commenced bullet on that line. And what we're indicating is that compared to our historical prior peak, we have 220 basis points of commenced occupancy opportunity. That dovetails very nicely that the $50 million of SNO pipeline that the team has built, and that we know we're going to deliver starting in the fourth quarter of this year and largely into 2025. And there's runway beyond that. As I look at that chart and think about the post-GE recovery period, you can see significant increases and percent commenced achieved over about a two to three-year period. And all else being equal, as I think about the quality of our portfolio, the quality of our leasing team and the demand we're seeing, we don't see that there's any reason why we can't replicate that process going forward over the near term. It's going to be -- it will take longer than one year to make 20 basis points of GAAP differential, right? You're still going to have churn. You're still going to have move-outs. As Lisa said, we're going to be very differentiating with our tenant selection. So it will take more than a year's worth of time, but very excited and bullish about our growth prospects from here.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dori Kesten with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Dori Kesten: Thanks, good morning. Your tenant watch list exposure is quite low versus peers. Can you hit on the highlights of the process you go through in evaluating tenant credit pre-signing and just any refinements you've added to the process over the last year?
Alan Roth: Dori, yes, this is Alan. I appreciate the question. It's very rigorous. We do not just lease for occupancy. We're very thoughtful and deliberate in our approach to how we think about our retailers. I would say that our watch list is comprised of roughly 150 basis points of ABR. But if you think about what the industry has experienced this quarter, cons filing for bankruptcy, we have 0. Eastern Mountain Sports, we had 1. Rue21, we had 1. Big lots announced store closures, although not yet filed for bankruptcy, again, we have 1. And so I sort of look at that and go, this is exactly what we have asked of our leasing teams on how to think about not just doing transactions, but being very thoughtful in aligning with the right retailers, and I feel great about where we stand on that front.
Lisa Palmer: I go back to how I think I started the first question answer that our objective in every part of the business is to create value for our shareholders. And we can also create -- we also do create it by applying those principles and concepts to our leasing program and ensuring that we are merchandising to the long term, not just for the short term.
Operator: Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.
Ravi Vaidya : Hi, good morning. This is Ravi Vaidya on the line for Haendel. Just wanted to touch on the CapEx and the TI. For new leases this quarter, a little bit elevated versus previous quarters. Is there anything onetime in there? And how do you expect this to go -- how do you expect it to trend going forward?
Alan Roth: Ravi, I appreciate that question. The answer is feel very good about the approach of how we are prudently managing capital. I would just bring us back to net effective rent as a percent of GAAP rent. And we're in that 80% to 85% range that we're very comfortable with. I would also say when you look at total comparable capital for the quarter, it is lower than our trailing 12 months. So the team is prudently managing it. We're growing rents appropriately. We're focused not just on rent spreads, but the embedded rent steps as well. And I don't see any shift in underlying fundamentals or trends to your question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Ki Bin Kim : Thank you, good morning. So -- I mean, it looks like you're setting up for a pretty good growth year in '25. If you look at the snow pipeline of 5% upside, and of course, there's some upside from contractual rent step-ups of 140 basis points and then if you add on lease spreads. So you can get to a pretty big number. Obviously, not everyone renews. But can you just talk about some of the factors that might bring down some of those positive growth factors. And if you have any kind of large known tenant move-outs that might occur in the foreseeable future. Thank you.
Mike Mas: Ki Bin, number one, I appreciate you articulating our wheel of growth very well. We spent a lot of time communicating that. So thank you. And we have spoken to the plus 100 basis points of same property growth attributed to the activation of our redevelopment pipeline that we anticipate next year, which is about double what we would expect in a historical average year. We are set up for growth. I talked a lot about the SNO pipeline. I talked about where we stand from a percent commenced perspective. I appreciate the direction that you're indicating. I'm going to stop short of providing any guidance for next year, and there's more to come on that side as we dig into our plan effectively as soon as this call is over, as we get back to work. But some headwinds, there's always going to be move-outs. You're always going to -- you're not retaining everybody. And I think we do an awesome job of selecting who we want. Bankruptcies are always going to play a role. Historically speaking, that could range anywhere from 30 to 60 basis points on a look-back basis depending on who files and when timing is a big factor in that. But I don't know that I would anticipate our credit loss provision being wildly different than what we're experiencing now. So more to come is where I'll end it. But we are -- we're looking at 2025, the same way we did last quarter. We had a lot of positive momentum building into next year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ron Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Ron Kamdem : Just a quick two-parter. Just on, obviously, this earnings season, we've seen a lot of institutional capital since you're looking at the open shopping center space. Just if you could comment on either on the acquisition front or just in general, if you're seeing institutional capital, private equity and so on and so forth coming to more into the space. And then Mike, the second part is, I had sort of a follow-up on that occupancy gain slides on the peak commence where you have 220 basis points. Any way to double-click whether it's market or assets? Can we get a second layer of where that upside is really concentrated in?
Lisa Palmer: That was a sneaky way to ask two questions. I think Nick really did already address the, I believe, the transactions market that maybe as Nick just touched because you mentioned that the pools were deeper. So just maybe, Nick, the composition of the kind of the bids that we're seeing, if it's any different if it's changed at all?
Nick Wibbenmeyer: Absolutely. Ron, appreciate the question. No question. The bidding pools are much deeper for assets that we're pursuing and looking at and evaluating. And so where maybe before there were 3 to 5 bids now there's 15 to 20 bids on assets. And so we're definitely watching funds flow into our asset class for all the reasons we're bullish on that Mike just articulated in. As you would appreciate, a lot of those bidders are institutional, whether it be pension funds, whether it be private equity backed, et cetera. And so no question seeing a lot of institutional capital pursuing assets right now.
Mike Mas: Ron. Take a look at Page 8 of our investor presentation for the quarter, and I think you'll get some good composition with respect to our existing SNO pipeline. And there, you'll see that it's roughly 60% shops, 40% anchors. And from a timing perspective, we also have detail that about only about 15% of that income is going to be recognized in '24, up to 90% of that income will be recognized next year, sticking to our bullish posture on '25. I would say, though, that as we think about moving the needle on occupancy, we have some room to run on the anchor front, and we've got some really exciting opportunities that the team is working on. And I thought -- I know Alan may want to color up some of that activity.
Alan Roth: Yes. I mean, I guess, Ron, the only thing I would add to that, to put definitive occupancy to it is we're at 97.2% and our historic peaks are 98.5%. So there is certainly runway there. There's been a couple of, I'll call them, stubborn deals that have been out there that are really right at the goal line right now. So I feel great about the trajectory of where we are. I look at that SNO pipeline, and I would say the top 6 that are sitting there are grocery stores that we're really excited to get online, and that will also provide for some ancillary center of gravity and synergistic merchandising to go with it. So the future is looking great there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Floris Van Dijkum with Compass Point.
Floris Van Dijkum: Lisa, I wanted to ask you a question, more of a bigger picture question, perhaps. But I think you're probably uniquely position to be able to answer something like this. Obviously, there's -- the news, the Blackstone is looking at one of your peers. There's the private formations. The fact that interest rates are likely coming down in September. You talked a little bit about your implied cap rates being at 7% back when you bought back the stock. Obviously, your stock price is more than 10% higher, so it's gone down a little bit. But I'm curious to get your sense. I mean, from where are cap rates in the shopping center sector headed in your view? And do you think that we could see some of the cap rate expansion retrace itself over the next 12 to 18 months as capital comes in as interest rates come down and frankly, is growth and IRR from assets still appear pretty interesting?
Lisa Palmer: Floris, thanks for the question. I would go back to the conviction that we had with regards to the -- what we believe a meaningful discount to private market values. We would not have executed the share repurchase. So I don't believe that cap rates are rising in the future. And with cost of financing potentially going down if we see that, I think that our product type, grocery-anchored, higher-quality shopping centers. We've seen it throughout what we thought should be a time when cap rates would rise, the cap rates were really sticky. And that's because our product type offers that sustainability and stability of cash flows. So we have convictions that cap rates are going to stay where they are. And if anything, and that's in the private market, perhaps with more capital coming into the sector, I think the scenario you described would say cap rates should go down, not up.
Operator: Our next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies.
Linda Tsai: On the 100 basis points of positive contribution from redevs coming online in 2025 being 2x the average. Could you just expand on some of the underlying drivers? Does it have to do with underwriting higher-than-expected rents?
Mike Mas: No, Linda. It's really project specific. Going back a little bit in time, recall, our development, redevelopment pipeline, which we talk about in totality, over the last several years have been more balanced to redevelopments. And if you go back several years, that's us kind of working through much of the opportunity that we acquired in the Equity One merger frankly. So these projects are now largely well on their way. They've been constructive. They've been leased, and we're delivering that income into the same property pool. So it's more a function of the quantum of the projects than it is the rates on the rents which, by the way, adds to our transparency and visibility. We feel really good about delivering new centers.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Deutsche Bank.
Tayo Okusanya: Congrats on the quarter. In regards to commenced occupancy, curious if you could help us think about what that could look like going into 2025. Again, occupancy is already pretty high. You have a very large new pipeline, but you're also going through very strong leasing as well. So just kind of curious where you think that can end up going over the course of the next 12 months and what snow could look like over the next 12 months?
Mike Mas: I appreciate the question. And I promise, we'll give much more visibility in 2025 on a granular level at -- when it's the right time. But again, I'll point you to that Page 7, at 220 basis points. I'll reflect you to the -- our historical commenced occupancy changes and in really good years, we can move that number by about 100 basis points. And if you recall, it's in our investor materials, but every 10 basis points of percent commenced increase can contribute up to 15 basis points of same property growth. So that's where we get comfortable indicating that the contribution of redevelopment, which is moving commenced occupancy being 100 basis points, 100 basis points through the 15 bps would give us about 150 basis points of potential growth. Again, timing matters here. So I don't want to get too into the weeds on 2025. But I think that should help you understand and appreciate the opportunity set in front of us, and I would just encourage you to spend some time on that Page 7 in our investor materials.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alec Feygin with Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Alec Feygin : Hi, good morning. And thanks for taking my question. Kind of curious about the competition that Regency is seeing in the Northeast? And is there anything specific to the region to explain what's driving the increased activity there?
Lisa Palmer: I'm not sure we understand the question. It increased the -- you're saying transaction activity?
Alec Feygin: Yes, sorry, the increased transaction activity.
Nick Wibbenmeyer: Yes. I would just tell you a couple and this is Nick. Appreciate the question, Al. So a couple of things. Obviously, the acquisition of UBP that's got our team up there, very, very active and increased our presence throughout that market. But a lot of it is also just timing. And so although this quarter, we were very active in the Northeast and very happy with the opportunities that have been presented. We're seeing a lot of activity across the country. And so as we move into future quarters, I think you'll see that activity be geographically dispersed more than it was this past quarter. So continued opportunities are presenting themselves in each of our markets at this point.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Mike Mueller : I guess, between Erstad, the Westport acquisition and the Northeast center you have under contract, it seems like you put a lot of capital to work up here recently. When you're looking at the broader pipeline that you see today, are the opportunities more geographically diverse or still kind of concentrated?
Nick Wibbenmeyer: Mike, yes, we're definitely seeing opportunities coast to coast. And so it is just timing related this quarter as it relates to the Northeast. And our team up there is doing a great job continuing to find opportunities. But I know the Southeast region, the West region, the Central region is anxiously waiting for some announcements and opportunities they're working on as well. And so we feel good about the opportunities we're seeing all around the country at the moment.
Operator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Lisa Palmer for closing comments.
Lisa Palmer: I want to thank all of you for spending the last approximate hour with us. We appreciate your interest in Regency. Have a great weekend, though. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-05-03 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Regency Centers Corporation First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] 
 As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Christine McElroy, Senior Vice President, Capital Markets. Thank you. You may begin. 
Christy McElroy: Good morning, and welcome to Regency Centers' First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Lisa Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Mas, Chief Financial Officer; Alan Roth, East Region President and Chief Operating Officer; and Nick Wibbenmeyer, West Region President and Chief Investment Officer.

Please note that we have also posted a presentation on our website with additional information, including disclosures related to forward earnings guidance. Our caution on forward-looking statements also applies to these presentation materials. Lisa? 
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Christy, and good morning, everyone. We had another really solid quarter, in line with our expectations and driven by a continuation of very healthy leasing fundamentals. Robust tenant demand is driving significant leasing activity across all of our shopping centers, and this is evident in an even higher percent leased rate and strong rent growth. With this robust demand and activity, we are poised to accelerate growth into 2025. As you will hear more from Alan, we are having great success quickly re-leasing space. And I will [ note ], some of which we've intentionally recaptured with upgraded merchandising of leading operators and at higher rents. As a result, our pipeline of executed leases is larger than it's ever been, and we look forward to these tenants coming online propelling our future growth. I'm also really excited about the progress our team has made, executing on our value creation pipeline. Sustained development activity over the long term, which creates value and enhances growth is an important part of our business and is a differentiator for Regency in our sector today. The strength of our platform provides us an unequaled strategic advantage. Our talented and experienced national development team, our relationships with top grocers and retailers, and ready access to capital, all are enabling strong execution on an impressive lineup of great in-process projects and continued growth in our pipeline of opportunities.  
 As you'll hear from Nick, following our impressive execution in 2023 with over $250 million of development and redevelopment starts, we expect to drive a similar level of success this year. The benefits from this ramp-up in activity will continue to grow as NOI comes online in 2025 and beyond.  
 Importantly, the strength of our balance sheet and our liquidity position is what provides Regency with the ability to sustain a meaningful value creation pipeline through cycles to remain opportunistic in our capital allocation strategy and to consistently grow our dividend. And we are really gratified to see this position of strength acknowledged by Moody's with a credit rating upgrade to A3, which occurred in February. We are currently the only REIT in the open-air shopping center sector with an A rating, and we are already seeing the benefits in our relative bond market pricing, further supporting our cost of capital advantage. This is a big accomplishment and a direct result of our team's consistent track record of operational excellence and balance sheet strength over the long term. It's a reflection of what I speak to often, which is what we believe to be Regency's unique and unparalleled combination of strategic advantages that differentiates us from our peers and allows us to drive above-average earnings per share, dividend and free cash flow growth. It's the favorable attributes of our portfolio, including quality tenants and merchandising mix, format, and trade area demographics driving rent growth and durability of occupancy. It's the expertise of our people and the strength of our operating platform. It's our ability to create value through development and redevelopment consistently over time. It's the strength of our balance sheet, and it's our commitment to corporate responsibility and stakeholder stewardship.   
 High-quality suburban shopping centers, especially with the particular strength of our portfolio and the trade areas in which we operate will continue to benefit from structural tailwinds that support continued excellent performance and long-term growth of our business. Alan? 
Alan Roth: Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. We had another great quarter of leasing activity in Q1 as tenant demand for our centers remained very strong. The tremendous appetite for space that we saw in 2023 has continued unabated, enabling our team to achieve both higher rents and push our leased rate to even higher levels. We are executing leases with high-quality tenants, further improving upon the strength of our merchandising and creating value at our centers. 
 Our same-property percent leased rate increased by another 20 basis points this quarter to 95.8%. This is especially impressive given the significant anchor move-outs that I discussed on last quarter's call, which I'll come back to in a moment, coupled with the seasonality of higher move-outs we historically experienced in the first quarter. Our shop lease rate was up 10 basis points sequentially in the first quarter reaching yet another new record high for shop of 93.5%. Base rent growth in 2024 is benefiting from shop commencement activity given our record year of lease-up in 2023.  
 You'll recall that a quarter ago, we discussed an expected decline in our commenced occupancy rate in the first quarter, driven by anchor move-outs consistent with our plan, while our leased rate has moved even higher, our same property commenced rate ended the first quarter down 70 basis points from year-end. Roughly half of this decline was attributable to the intentional recapture of a Walmart store in Norwalk, Connecticut. Some of you were with us on a recent tour of the property, seeing firsthand this great opportunity to create value from an anchor tenant lease expiration in an exceptional location. We will experience some downtime impact while the space is built out and the center undergoes a transformative redevelopment, but the new lease of Target has already been executed with significant accretion. This is just one example of similar scenarios within the portfolio. On the surface, this disconnect between leased occupancy and rent paying occupancy would appear counterintuitive, but the strength in the leasing environment, coupled with our deliberate approach to asset management, is enabling us to take advantage of these accretive opportunities quickly and in many cases, before the tenant vacates.  
 We are remerchandising with upgraded stores and at higher rents, improving and growing the long-term value of our centers, and we look forward to getting these new anchors open for business in the coming months. As we've replenished this vacating space with new leases, our pipeline of executed leases has grown. We stand today with a 370 basis point delta between our same property leased and commenced occupancy rates, which is an all-time high for us, reflecting an incremental $50 million of annual base rent that will be very rewarding as these leases commence within our operating portfolio.  
 Beyond what's already based, we have another 1.4 million square feet of space under letter of intent or in negotiation with consistent demand across the portfolio from a wide variety of categories, including grocers, restaurants, health and wellness, off-price and personal services.  
 Cash re-leasing spreads in the first quarter were more than 8% on a blended basis including the highest spread for renewals that we've seen since 2019, an indication of our ability to increase rents further as occupancy rises and available spaces limited, a reflection of the strong demand in today's environment.  
 Both GAAP and net effective rent spreads were in the mid-teens this quarter, given strength  contractual rent steps in the majority of our leases and our prudent use of leasing capital.  
 Our team across the country is energized by the unwavering strength and leasing activity we are seeing, supported by a limited supply of high-quality retail space available and a surplus of great retailers actively looking to expand. We look forward to harvesting the benefits of our record high SNO pipeline, getting those tenants open and operating and continuing to move the occupancy needle higher in the months ahead. Nick? 
Nicholas Wibbenmeyer: Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone. Motivated by our tremendous success in 2023, including the start of more than $250 million of new projects, our team remains very active, both executing and growing our development and redevelopment pipelines. Among our first quarter starts was the shops at Stone Bridge in Cheshire, Connecticut. This $67 million ground-up development will be anchored by Whole Foods as well as T.J. Maxx and while we just broke ground last month, we are already seeing significant leasing demand. The project serves as the retail component of a new master plan community, a format with which we've had great success over the years. We recognize the mutual benefits and value that these relationships with master plan developers can provide for our shopping centers as well as the communities they serve.  
 In addition to new starts, we continue to make great progress executing on our in-process pipeline and bringing NOI online. In total, we now have more than $0.5 billion in process, which is nearly 90% leased with blended returns of 9%. And in 2024, we plan to complete over $200 million of these projects. Some examples of the tremendous progress are several exciting recent anchor openings that are worthy of highlighting.  
 At our Glenwood Green ground-up development in Old Bridge, New Jersey, both Target and ShopRite celebrated successful grand openings last month and the project is now nearly 95% leased. Exciting shop tenants opening soon include Honeygrow, Duck Donuts and Playa Bowls.
 At Westbard Square and Bethesda, the new giant grocery store opened in January, and rent will start commencing from the shop space over the coming months, including tenants such as Tate, Stretch zone, Silver and Sons BBQ and Oak Barrel & Vine.  
 Turning to the private transactions market. Although data points and deal volumes remain below historical norms, we are seeing increased activity in deeper bidding pools in the marketplace and cap rates remain low. The implications of the recent move in treasuries remains to be seen, but our team is actively underwriting acquisition opportunities that fit within our portfolio quality, growth and earnings accretion requirements. This includes a great asset that we are buying in Westport, Connecticut, immediately adjacent to one of our existing centers, adding to our already strong portfolio in that region. As we look ahead, our team is focused on sourcing accretive investment opportunities across our national platform. We expect to execute on acquisitions opportunistically, and we have great visibility on development and redevelopment activity as we continue to grow our pipelines. We are planning for another year of project starts north of $200 million and remain on track to meet our strategic objective of completing more than $1 billion of projects over the next 5 years. We are partnering with leading grocers looking to grow their footprints in high-quality centers within our attractive trade areas and our recent project successes are also driving additional opportunities to further grow our pipeline. The strong momentum within our program is supported by macro tailwinds within the shopping center business, but more importantly, by Regency sourcing and execution capabilities. As you hear me repeatedly say, we have the best development team in the business, which combined with our free cash flow and balance sheet give us an unequaled ability to fund and drive significant value creation within our investment program. Mike? 
Michael Mas: Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with some highlights from our first quarter results and then walk through updates to our 2024 guidance and forward expectations before ending with comments on our balance sheet position. We reported Nareit FFO of $1.08 per share and core operating earnings of $1.04 per share for the first quarter. Same-property NOI growth, excluding term fees and COVID period reserve collections was 2.1%. It's worth a reminder that while bad debt this quarter trended closer to our historical averages, we are comping against a year ago bad debt number that was net positive, which we know is unusual. This anomaly impacted our first quarter growth rate by 60 basis points. At 2.7%, base rent was the largest contributor to same-property NOI growth and continues to be the best indicator of portfolio performance. This was largely driven by our team driving rec growth through embedded rent steps and re-leasing spreads as well as executing on our redevelopment pipeline.  
 Our same-property leased occupancy rate is 95.8%, up another 20 basis points in the quarter, reflecting the continued strong leasing environment. First quarter earnings results benefited from a $0.01 of timing-related items outside of the same property pool as well as $0.01 of straight-line rent, which you can see in our increased full year noncash guidance. Additionally, recall that we typically recognize more than half of our annual percentage rents in the first quarter, benefiting Q1 by about $0.03 compared to the implied run rate for the balance of the year.  
 I also would like to point out our new AFFO disclosure on Page 9 of our supplemental, which highlights what in our view, is one of the most important performance metrics, reflecting a REIT's ability to grow dividends and to invest back into its business in order to grow earnings. This added disclosure also provides transparency around the level of capital used to drive same-property NOI growth and allows for greater apples-to-apples comparison across the peer group.  
 Turning to our guidance updates. As always, I'll refer you to the helpful detail on Slides 5 through 6 in our earnings presentation. We raised our Nareit FFO outlook by $0.01 at the midpoint, which corresponds to the increase in our guidance for noncash items. Our guidance for same-property NOI growth remains unchanged at 2% to 2.5%, excluding term fees and COVID period reserve collections. We also adjusted our full year transactions outlook.  
 As Nick referenced earlier, the asset we are buying in Westport is now included in our acquisition guidance, and we modestly increased our dispositions guidance to include the potential sale of a few smaller noncore lower growth assets. Notably, our core operating earnings per share guidance, excluding COVID period reserve collections, implies growth of more than 3% at the midpoint despite higher interest rates and the impact of our debt refinancing this year.  
 As we look beyond the calendar year, we wanted to highlight some tailwinds we see impacting our growth, especially as it relates to items where we have greater visibility. We've discussed the meaningful growth coming from our pipeline of executed leases where outsized commencement activity will begin as we approach year-end and move into 2025.  
 As Alan mentioned, our SNO pipeline sits at a historical high of more than $50 million of annual base rent, of which about 65% is scheduled to commence by the end of this year. In fact, we expect our spot commenced occupancy rate to end this year, roughly 50 basis points higher as compared to year-end 2023. As these lease commencements are weighted to the second half of the year, the NOI and earnings impact will largely occur in 2025.  
 And as Nick discussed, we've continued to ramp-up our in-process development and redevelopment activity and look forward to completing these projects delivering space and commencing rent. We expect same-property NOI to benefit from this redevelopment activity and for growth to accelerate into 2025. The positive contribution to same-property NOI is likely to exceed 100 basis points next year, leading to above-trend overall growth, and total NOI growth will also benefit from the continued momentum of our ground-up development program, which will also start to bear more fruit as we head into next year.  
   Finally, turning to our balance sheet. The recent credit rating upgrade from Moody's to A3 further validates Regency's balance sheet strategy and liquidity position. we are relatively insulated from the current volatility in the debt capital markets as our balance sheet is in phenomenal shape. The majority of this year's maturities have been prefunded following our bond issuance in January, which we are gratified to price at a 10-year treasury yield meaningfully below where it sits today. And our next unsecured bond maturity is not until November 2025. 
 Nearly all of our debt is fixed. Our weighted average maturity is close to 7 years, and we remain near the low end of our targeted leverage range of 5 to 5.5x net debt preferred to EBITDA. We have approximately $1.7 billion of liquidity today including nearly full capacity on our revolver, and we remain on track to generate free cash flow of more than $160 million this year. 
 With that, we are happy to take your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Comes from the line of Jeff Spector with Bank of America. 
Elizabeth Yang Doykan: [Technical Difficulty] 
Lisa Palmer: We cannot hear the question. I don't know if it's us or if it's. 
Jeffrey Spector: Hello, can you hear me now? 
Lisa Palmer: Lizzy, you're breaking up a bit. 
Elizabeth Yang Doykan: So I was asking [Technical Difficulty] if any of the benefit to same-store flowed through in the first quarter? Just seeing if maybe you [ saw ] any upside [indiscernible] or additional sources of accretion might have exceeded your expectations as we're through the early part of the year. 
Michael Mas: I think, Lizzy, you're still breaking up a little bit in the early parts, but I think I understand the gist of your question. Maybe cadence on earnings given the beat in the first quarter versus the run rate for the balance of the year. I think that's what I heard you ask. 
 Let me just kind of go back to some of the comments I made in the remarks and maybe color some of that up a little bit for you. Let me start by saying at a very high level, we thought we delivered a really solid quarter. We were very happy with our performance. We met our plan. Our confidence in our outlook was simply confirmed as you can see through our limited guidance changes. There was some timing in the first quarter that I -- as I outlined in the remarks that do impact our forward run rate, right? So percentage rent is the biggest one. That is a seasonal issue. It's 50% or more of that rent is collected in the first quarter. That does lead to about a $0.03 kind of deceleration from an earnings impact perspective going forward on a run rate. And then there were some timing a little timing issues coming out of the non-same property portfolio, which as, again, as a reminder, is a little larger than it customarily is because we have our entire Urstadt Biddle merged portfolio designated as non-same for 2024. 
 But what -- but those timing issues didn't change our outlook for the year, right? So those aren't going to flow through in any kind of additive way. So at this point, we continue to have a lot of confidence in the guide that we shared last quarter. We did raise Nareit FFO by $0.01. That is incremental to the plan that's coming from noncash revenue and specifically straight-line rents coming out of -- improved straight-line rents coming out of the development pipeline. We also had a mark-to-market adjustment following a mortgage paydown that we executed on this quarter. 
 So those -- that led to the $2 million that we increased our noncash guidance and that's what you're seeing flow through from [ an ] AFFO perspective. Let me just end with this. From a same-property growth, we didn't modify the range. We have a lot of conviction in that range. We -- the fallout in percent commenced that we anticipated and communicated last quarter happened as we planned. And the best part of that is we've re-leased as much space as we've gotten back and then some, done a remarkable job there. And our outlook for the balance of the year and commencing that rent going into end of '24 and into '25, we feel really good about. 
Elizabeth Yang Doykan: That's helpful. And I apologize for the connection issue. Just as a follow-up, I know you all said that you're viewing external growth opportunities opportunistically, and there's a lot to go on the development, redevelopment front. But just curious on maybe what kind of opportunities would look most -- the most interesting to you today, maybe what you're seeing out in the market. More color on that would be helpful. 
Lisa Palmer: I'll take that and allow Nick to come over top of me if he wants to add a little more detail. Really unchanged, our investment strategy, whether it's for acquisitions, which we've had recent success with or whether it's for development, is aligning with our operating portfolio. So above-average quality with regards to merchandising mix, the tenants and to the extent that we can add our expertise to make that happen, we're looking for those opportunities as well. Grocery anchored primarily and also in great trade areas with above-average demographics. 
 We've had success from both the acquisition and the development strategy and doing that and remaining disciplined. And we continue to find opportunities. I really want to reiterate because I know that we continue to get questions about our development pipeline. Remember, we're generating ample free cash flow and the best use of that free cash flow is into our developments and redevelopments, and we have had a really impressive track record in that, especially of late 2023 was an exceptional year. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we expect that to continue into 2024. And I'm not saying that it's easy, but when you take what we have, which is a talented, experienced development team across the country, when you have access to capital with the strength of our balance sheet, and when you have the relationships that we have with top grocers, top retailers, master plan community developers, it's equaling success, and we're really proud of that. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. 
Michael Goldsmith: Same-property NOI growth of 2.1% in the quarter. Mike, you called out a tough bad debt comparison of 60 basis points with base rent contribution at 2.7%. So looking forward, can you remind us of maybe any other moving pieces in the comparisons that if we should use that 2.7%, the high 2% range is the rate, base rent growth is the forward trajectory? And did you say that next year should be about 100 basis points above trend? 
Michael Mas: Thanks, Michael. As I -- as we look into the balance '24, 2% to 2.5% guide range. We still have a lot of confidence in that expectation. It's going to hover around, it's going to hover within that range quarter-over-quarter and really pretty consistent, I would say, as we look through the balance, and I appreciate you highlighting the fact that Q1 did have a unique anomaly in the prior year basis. 
 I did say plus 100, let's make sure we understand what that means. That's the positive contribution coming from redevelopment deliveries to our same property growth rate. We are really excited about the -- and have growing conviction in that pipeline and that delivery of projects. And you can see it on our redevelopment disclosure page, by the way, and get really comfortable yourself with thinking about when that income will be delivered. 
 Remember, and we spent a lot of time kind of talking about our steady-state growth rate generally, redevelopments are going to provide about a plus or minus 50 basis point positive contribution to our growth plus 100 basis points in our outlook for 2025 is materially better than that. And again, I would just come back to the conviction we have over that, given the projects that we see, the leasing that the team has executed on and really, it's just a matter of executing on deliveries and commencing those rents, which you'll start to see happen in [ Urstadt ] towards the end of this year and into 2025. 
Lisa Palmer: I'll just add, and I promise, Mike, I won't give guidance for 2025. But what I would like to add, Michael, if you just go back and you look at long-term growth rates, same property NOI growth, AFFO growth rate, I picked 5 years, you will see that Regency is at the top of the sector with that. And that is the result of our strategy. It's all of the things, right? It's our unequaled strategic advantages that I talked about in my prepared remarks. And with that, given 2024 is a temporary dip from those long-term expectations, we would expect 2025 would kind of make up for that. And that -- with the growth of 2025 that we expect all else being equal with regards to the economy, we would still -- we will rise to the top of the sector. 
Michael Goldsmith: And my follow-up is on the SNO pipeline. It took a step up here now currently sitting at 370 basis points or $50 million with the SNO pipeline. What's the elevated -- what's the trajectory from here? Should we expect that to be worked down through '24 and '25 or should it kind of still remain elevated and choppy. Just trying to understand better around how you -- how quickly you can monetize this elevated pipeline. 
Michael Mas: Listen, I hope for the right reasons, I hope it grows, and I'm looking at Alan when I say that and he'd say the same thing. I think we have a lot of conviction in our leasing team's ability. We know our properties and how well they are desired by the [indiscernible] and we have a lot of conviction in continuing to lease at a high rate. 
 So I wouldn't be honestly, I'd like to see that number increase. But from an economic impact perspective, our commenced -- it's about our commenced occupancy rate is the essence of your question. And we do think as we look at our plans, we do think that we've troughed on a spot basis from a commenced perspective. All planned, we knew these move-outs were going to occur in the first quarter of this year. And now it's about moving and delivering space, moving that commence rate up. Let me give you something to help you with your question. A little bit over $50 million of SNO pipeline from an ABR perspective, 65% of those leases will commence by year-end, but that's not rent, right? So $14 million, plus or minus, I'm going to be in the area. We should recognize in the earnings in '24. So that's only 1/4 of that pipeline. So that tells you that, that adds to that conviction we have in 2025, the balance of that ABR is going to come online as we deliver units into 2025. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. 
Juan Sanabria: Just curious on the decisions, in some cases, to be proactive and trying to increase the -- or improve their merchandise mix and increase rents and if that -- how are you making that decision? And it seems like that's obviously a product of a stronger market here. Could you do more of that in '25 that could temporarily offset growth? Just trying to play devil's advocate here. 
Alan Roth: Juan, this is Alan. Thank you for the question. We've always taken the long-term view of intense asset management. And so to answer your question, we're absolutely all about what is the right long-term decision for the asset, for the portfolio and for the future success of Regency. It's interesting. I said last quarter that we moved 3 office supply stores out of our portfolio. I'm not so sure that I actually identified who's replacing them. But to take those units and replace those with Sprouts in one location, HomeSense in another location, and a Baptist Health medical facility in a third location. 
 I think it's just really good examples of how we look at enhancing the merchandising, providing durability to our occupancy through better tenant credit and to your point, getting significant rent growth. So it's certainly the mindset of how we're trained. It's certainly the mindset of how we think about managing our portfolio, and I would expect that to continue. 
Juan Sanabria: And then just curious on how Urstadt is performing if that would have been  -- if included in the same-store numbers additive and presumably, there's more lease-up opportunities there. Does that maybe then create a tough comp issue next year as that's folded into the same-store pool? 
Michael Mas: Let me take it first, and then I'd like Alan to give some color on what you've seen in the portfolio. But from my perspective, the Urstadt portfolio is performing right on plan. And we had high expectations for the portfolio, and the team is doing a remarkable job of delivering on those expectations. So just to reiterate that, we called for about 1.5 points worth of accretion. We're going to deliver that and that we haven't come off plus or minus that expectation. And there's a little bit of timing noise from a cadence perspective as I indicated in the first quarter, and that will level off by year-end. Is additive or would have been additive, had we called it same property by about the same amount I mentioned last quarter, which we said we're up to about 0.25 point. So I'll leave it at that. And if Alan has a comment. 
Alan Roth: Yes. Juan, the only thing I would add is we continue to be thrilled with the expanded platform, but I am personally probably more thrilled with the great people that have come into the organization as a result of it. And we did have another productive quarter. We signed about 50 transactions in that portfolio. And as I said, the last few quarters, there's runway there. We are going to grow that 93% formerly leased portfolio and leverage the platform, certainly that we have, and that is the hyper focus of the company right now relative to that acquisition. 
 Redevelopments are something that are more medium to long term, but we're doing some small little [ pad deals ] out in the parking lot, maybe evaluating a couple of multi-tenant deals, but largely, it's a hyper focus on leasing and the team is doing well. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. 
Viktor Fediv: This is Viktor Fediv for Greg McGinniss. So we've noticed that your new leases, tenant allowances and landlord work as a percentage of new base rents have increased both on a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis. Just curious, was it something unique this quarter or it's a current market environment. So you need to provide higher TAs and [ landlord ] work to get new leases done. 
Alan Roth: Viktor, this is Alan. Thank you for the question. The short answer is we're not seeing any material shift at all, although there is a slight elevation this quarter. I'll start on the renewal front. The elevation you see there is one tenant that we did a turnkey relocation to make way for a larger junior box. If you take that one out, our capitals are absolutely in line with historic levels. And again, I think that ties back to the intense asset management mindset of what's right for the asset.
 On the new leasing front, I would just tell you, it's largely elevated by anchor leasing. And we had 4 anchor transactions. Notably, one of them was a space that was vacant for over 7 years. And so again, I think there's some mix issue in terms of just anchor transactions that's driving that, but we're not seeing any market shifts as a result. 
Lisa Palmer: I think it's -- yes, it's important to just reiterate that, our strategy and our approach hasn't changed. We're very judicious with our leasing capital and do believe that, that is clearly leads to again, ample free cash flow growth, but also helps drive our AFFO growth, which if you were to look at long-term AFFO growth, we do lead the sector. 
Viktor Fediv: And then as a follow-up, could you please provide some additional color on the remaining $75 million of dispositions. So far, both dispositions in '24 were in Florida. And apart from properties being noncore, was it also driven by just relatively more attractive pricing than transaction market in Florida now, and should we expect other dispositions be within the same submarket or there are no other noncore assets in that submarket. 
Nicholas Wibbenmeyer: Viktor, this is Nick. I appreciate the question. As you referenced, I mean, you answered part of the question in your question, which is we are always looking to fortify our growth profile. And we're always looking to potentially sell noncore, nonstrategic assets at attractive cap rates. And so as we look into the future, as you see in our guidance now, we do expect to continue to sell assets at attractive cap rates, recycle that capital into more accretive opportunities that we may see. And so it just so happened, these 2 were in Florida, but I would now tell you, strategically, we are trying to exit Florida, as you know, we have a tremendous portfolio in Florida. 
 And so these are really case-by-case decision to asset by asset, trade area by trade area. And so I would not expect these additional assets necessarily be in Florida. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. 
Ronald Kamdem: Just 2 quick ones. So one on -- just on the acquisition front, obviously, the $46 million added in the guidance. Maybe can you talk about just how that came about? And has sort of opportunities sprung up or change given sort of the move in rates has that sort of slowed activity? 
Nicholas Wibbenmeyer: Ronald, this is Nick again. I appreciate the question. So let me talk first to the first part of your question, which is about the acquisition we've now guided to. And so that asset, we're very excited about. It's a 76,000 square foot shopping center in Westport, Connecticut at CVS anchored, and for those of you recently on our tour in the Northeast, you'll be familiar with it. The center directly across the street from our Trader Joe's asset that we own at the corner of Compo Road and Post Road. And so just a tremendous opportunity to bring a great asset into a region that we already are really, really familiar with and excited about, again, adding to that great portfolio. And so that asset was fully marketed. And so we competed in on-market process. And I think given our reputation and our presence in the market definitely helped us and related to that competition. And so excited to get that closed here very, very soon, maybe even as soon as today. 
 And so beyond that, we continue to be, again, opportunistic, as Lisa indicated earlier, which is looking across the country for opportunities that we believe we can create and add value to shopping centers. And so there is definitely more opportunities on the market over the last quarter than they were in the quarter before. 
 But as we all know, treasuries have moved here in the last couple of weeks. And so it's TBD of does that slow transaction volume or not. But from the chatter we're hearing, we do expect transaction volume to stay pretty darn steady and we're going to take advantage of any opportunity we see that we think we can add value to. 
Operator: Does that complete your question? 
Ronald Kamdem: Yes. My second question was just on the same-store. Look, I'm getting the theme of the call, which seems to be acceleration in 2025 on the same-store. I guess the question is, is the conviction coming from sort of the fact that you have sort of the [ signed-out ] lease pipeline and you have visibility or is it more that the sort of the tenant health, there's no sort of larger move-outs or bankruptcies, that could be a headwind next year or both, right? Just trying to figure out where the conviction is coming? 
Lisa Palmer: I'll answer that just very high level and to the extent that my partners here want to add any more specific color, but it is both. I'm glad that you added that at the end. I mean, I think you can see with our leasing success and results, the health in the portfolio and where -- we can say, some records are meant to be broken and we continue to drive our percent leased higher and higher. And that SNO pipeline is real. And so that does create real visibility to rent that will commence and we also have been really successful with our redevelopment pipeline. And Mike talked about those in the prepared remarks and in one of the questions. And we have real visibility to that also being additive in 2025. So it's all of the above. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. 
Ravi Vaidya: This is Ravi Vaidya on the line for Haendel. I hope you guys are doing well. We've heard from you and your peers that the leasing environment is very strong and robust. But I just wanted to ask, particularly around [ Med care ] and urgent care centers and things along that line. We've started to hear some softness in demand from some of the operators there, notably Walmart. And just wanted to hear your thoughts on what you're seeing from a leasing demand perspective. 
Alan Roth: Ravi, it's Alan. So our current medical exposure is about 7% of ABR, and that has grown from 5% where we were pre-COVID. We are very comfortable not only with where it is, but certainly comfortable if it were to continue to grow. Interestingly, we signed nearly 20 new medical leases in the first quarter, and that was our second highest category for new leasing from a square footage perspective. And it was largely dentists, optometrists, physical therapy, primary care and it included a new ground lease that we also did with the largest primary care operator in Houston, where they're going to build a new medical building where Regency didn't even invest any capital on that. 
 But overall, we're comfortable certainly with that category. From an urgent care, specifically to answer that question, it's just not a significant piece of our medical exposure, it's less than 1% of our ABR. We, interestingly also have all the medical transactions we did in the first quarter, none of our new leasing activity this quarter was in the urgent care facility arena. But I would just take us back to the strict vetting process that we do for all of our operators, whether medical, personal services, restaurants, et cetera. And I think the team does a really nice job to make sure we're aligning with the right operators. 
Unknown Analyst: Just one more here. Where do you think CapEx goes as a percentage of NOI goes from here for you and I guess, broadly for the sector, as we're seeing occupancies are -- more, more leases are renewals than new ones. How do you think this could impact AFFO growth maybe over the next couple of years and maybe is there -- are we approaching an inflection point, I guess, is the crux of the question? 
Michael Mas: Ravi, it's Mike.  Maybe I'll give you a bit of a boring answer, but we don't see any change. I've been pretty -- we've been pretty consistent on this topic for some time. 11% area is kind of our run rate, and that's all CapEx, right? So that's maintenance and leasing capital. And we don't see that changing on balance, on average over the long run. You're going to have periods of time where as you're adding to commenced occupancy as we are now where that could increase over that line -- that average line, again, because of the volume of activity you're doing, but the team does an incredible job of ensuring that we're investing the right amount of money into the operator's business, and we're getting a fair -- market-leading rent in those cases and market-leading terms and they're just very judicious with our capital spend, and I think that's appropriate. 
 Capital is precious. We're going to generate as much free cash flow as we can so that we can reinvest that to Lisa's point back into our development and redevelopment business. And when we have available capital outside of that, by properties, like the great asset we're going to add to the portfolio in Westport. 
 So I don't see that 11% area changing over the long run. 
Lisa Palmer: And I do just -- I want to reiterate because it's an intentional strategy to maximize rent while limiting leasing capital, trying -- staying within our parameters of our expectations and it's the strength of our asset quality and our shopping centers that allows us to do that, and we are successful in doing so. And it is a reason that we -- it does drive our AFFO growth. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with Citi. 
Craig Mailman: Just want to follow up. I know you guys increased dispositions a little bit here to partly pay for the Westport acquisition. But just from a need of capital, $125 million with the free cash flow you guys throw off. Is this just a placeholder because you think you could get more acquisitions? Or is this necessary to fund the redevelopment? Just trying to get that accelerated pace of dispose just given the spending you guys have. 
Michael Mas: Yes, I think this will help you, Craig. We don't need to sell the properties to afford or pay for the Westport acquisition. That is -- we have the free cash flow in position, we have the balance sheet capacity. We have -- on a leverage neutral basis, if you take our free cash flow expectations, we have over $300 million of kind of investment capacity at our fingertips, so to speak. 
 So honestly, the $25 million add was simply identifying some small noncore assets in our portfolio where we have received indications of interest that show pretty low cap rates. And when we think about that trade of exiting a noncore asset on an accretive basis, into either our developments or redevelopments on acquisition. Some of these assets, you could argue you can pay down debt and that's accretive. So when we see that trade opportunity, we're going to take it. And that's all we're doing here. It's just a little bit of pruning why, I think kind of smartly and over time, that's going to lead to a more durable income stream and earnings growth as well. 
Craig Mailman: And the remaining $95 million that you guys have kind of dialed in, how much of that do you have visibility on at this point? And maybe what do you think timing could be on some of these sales? 
Michael Mas: I think -- I mean the $25 million that we've added, we have visibility on all of it, and it's on the market, it's actively being discussed. The $25 million is going to be back-end weighted. And I think I still have a lot of confidence that we're going to execute on that plan. The other transactions are known. They're going to occur. These aren't speculative disposition assumptions. These are -- these are actionable disposed that we have a lot of confidence in. 
Craig Mailman: Okay. So I guess I was getting at -- you guys have done $30 million, $25 million is incremental you kind of think, but then the other $70 million is kind of known, what's the timing on those? 
Michael Mas: Timing, I'm going to look to the team to help me out, but Q3 -- end of Q3 estimate on the $70 million roughly is how I would think about it. 
 I think about it at the kind of end of third quarter. 
Christy McElroy: And Craig, we also announced that we did another disposition in the second quarter, it was Tamarac, and we disclosed that in the press release. It's just not in the transaction list yet. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist. 
Ki Bin Kim: So there's been a couple of retailers in the media like Starbucks, McDonald's. And I think grocers has been talking about smaller basket sizes and certain consumers being stretched for some time. I was just curious if you've noticed any of that conversation and your dialogue with tenants today. And I know both things can coexist where demand could be good for a while, even though there might be some challenges. Just curious what you're seeing on the ground. 
Lisa Palmer: Let me just take it generally first, and then I'll let Alan talk about the actual discussions with tenants. I mean the future is always uncertain, right? And in today's world, the macroeconomic, I don't know any of us can predict what is going to happen. But what we do know is that we have high-quality centers and our trade areas have been to this point, and we expect to be able to -- and we expect to continue especially given the types of, the types of uses within our centers, right? It's value, convenience, service that we would expect that our shopping centers, the trade areas, the consumers and our trade areas are going to be capable of absorbing the macro pressures that we're seeing today. 
 We are generally seeing that through the results in our shopping centers. I want -- you also made a comment about stress for time, which I think is really important because this even goes to the medical that we spoke about. It's a real structural tailwind that there's -- and you've heard us say this, a renewed appreciation for a physical presence of the shopping centers near and close to people's homes to service their needs, and to buy goods because they are stretched for time. And it is why that we really do have this tailwind, the suburban shopping centers for all the types of uses that we are offering at our shopping centers. And I think that, that is -- we don't see that softening today. [indiscernible] handset he thinks I hit it. So he's not going to add. 
Ki Bin Kim: And on development, I don't think you guys have a large land bank and -- but you guys have been very successful in starting some projects at high yields. Also just curious about the second round of development that you might be pursuing. How might that be different in terms of yields versus the current pipeline, especially given your kind of land bank position? 
Nicholas Wibbenmeyer: Sure, Ki Bin, this is Nick. Appreciate the question. You're absolutely right. We do not land bank as a strategy for our development program. And so we are very, very thoughtful about derisking these projects as part of our diligence while we control the real estate prior to closing. And so our process is we make sure we have control of the real estate. We make sure we have really high-quality tenants committed to the projects, especially our grocery tenants. We work through the entitlement process. We work through the pricing exercise. And as we've talked about in previous quarters, it is a challenging environment to bring all of those pieces of the puzzle together, but it is a core competency of ours, and our teams continue to do a really, really tremendous job of finding those opportunities across our platform, across the country. 
 And as we've said on multiple occasions, we feel really bullish about the future of our development program. We continue to lean into it and our teams are continuing to find more than our fair share of those opportunities. And as you -- in terms of your question of yield, as you can see in our in process, our yields range between 7% and 9% and on our development and redevelopment program, and that's where we're still targeting and we expect to have additional success in that range. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Floris Van Dijkum with Compass Point. 
Floris Gerbrand van Dijkum: I guess it's more of a follow-up question. In terms of the development versus redevelopment. One of Regency's core competencies has always been the development, I think, Lisa. You guys have -- you're somewhat unique as I think most of your peers are saying that rents probably need to rise by anywhere -- over 25% in order to justify new development on a national basis. But obviously, there's always unique opportunities. And I suspect Cheshire is one of those. But how much of an advantage or how much of your development -- future development pipeline do you think is going to come from your existing portfolio versus brand-new opportunities like Cheshire. And also, what's the difference in return on those kind of opportunities in your view? 
Lisa Palmer: I'll start, and then I'll let Nick finish. I think you've been following us since you do -- you have seen that the percentages were more weighted towards redevelopment in the recent past, but we have created a ton -- we've generated a ton of momentum in the ground upside. And again, this goes back to the renewed appreciation for bricks and mortar and for being close to customers' homes. And for the retailers to be able to service their customers through all channels, and one is for the customer to walk through the front door and also to buy online and pick up in store all tailwinds for our business. And you're correct, and I appreciate the acknowledgment that development has been a differentiator for us and a competitive edge, for as long as I've been at the company, and I've been here almost 28 years. And we have an extremely successful track record in that regard. And that matters because we have an experienced, talented national team with these relationships that is helping us find and Nick and the team reminds me all the time, and I'm not saying that it's not easy, but that's what makes us so good. And so that I would expect that we're going to continue to see more momentum on the ground upside. Redevelopments will also continue to happen, as Alan talked about. We intensely manage our existing portfolio, and it's an important part of fortifying our future NOI growth. But I do expect that you're going to see ground-up grow over the next few years. 
Nicholas Wibbenmeyer: And all I would add to that, Floris, is as Mike alluded to earlier, and we continue to be very vocal about, the great news is, for us, it's not an either/or process. We are an enviable position with our capital that we are going to take advantage of opportunities that we see in our existing portfolio. And as you see in our in process, the team has found a lot of opportunities at very accretive and attractive returns to invest new capital into our existing portfolio. But we also are going to continue to take advantage of every opportunity we see on a ground-up basis that we know we can derisk and we can put a shovel on the ground at an attractive return there. And we have capability. We have the team that's across the country focused on that, and we have the capital. And so we are blessed to be in a position of not choosing between the 2. We're going to do both. 
Floris Gerbrand van Dijkum: And maybe in terms of the return thresholds, I guess, maybe if you can talk about like I would imagine that some of the redevelopment opportunities are going to have higher returns, but how does that compare to buying, for example, something today in the market like a West border or other things that you're looking at? How much higher does the return need to be in order for you to pull the trigger on opportunities? 
Lisa Palmer: Sorry, I was just going to reiterate, Nick, what you already said earlier, and that was the 7% to 9%, the target threshold hasn't changed for developments. And acquisitions are going to -- it's going to vary. It's going to depend on the total return, if you will, what's the future growth right? We acquired Nohl Plaza, which had a tremendous amount of upside and a much lower cap rate, for example. 
 We did our Chicago acquisition, higher cap rate, not as much -- there's not as much leasing upside or redevelopment upside. So that's acquisitions are going to really vary depending upon the actual individual opportunity. Development 7% to 9%.  Historically, we have always -- we've tried to target a minimum of 150 basis point spread over what that shopping center upon completion would sell in the market. And I think we're still pretty successful with that. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Jefferies. 
Linda Yu Tsai: For the 39 anchors that have signed, but not yet commenced, just wondering who some of those anchor tenants are? Like how many of those are grocers. And then I guess just my second question is do you think your grocer penetration, if it's plus 80% right now could get much higher? 
Alan Roth: Linda, this is Alan. I don't have the actual number of what percent were grocers, but there certainly were a number of transactions that are in there. The target that we had mentioned in Norwalk, we are very excited about the first Whole Foods Daily Shop. I think that was announced here a few months ago in Manhattan, which will be opening likely in the fourth quarter of this year. And if you haven't heard about that concept, that's their new quick and convenient shopping experience for that urban customer. We've got a couple of public deals that are under redevelopment right now. So I would tell you there's a pretty significant amount of grocer activity that is within that number. We're excited to get both of those Kroger deals -- excuse me, Publix deal is open, which are down in Atlanta. And so it's a significant part of it. Second part of your question? I'm happy in a moment with it. 
Michael Mas: We're not grocer penetrated. We're 80% grocery-anchored. And I don't think we see that number materially changing from this point forward. The bias here is around grocery, and we'll continue to pursue grocery-anchored shopping centers as a rule. But I don't think you're going to see that go materially or change materially from here. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. 
Michael Mueller: So for the Stone Bridge development that's part of a master plan community, how mature or early stage is the community? And as being part of a project like that changed the risk profile or economics, you compare to a development, not one of those communities? 
Nicholas Wibbenmeyer: I appreciate the question. This is Nick. I'm glad you actually pointed out that it is part of the master plan community because to us, these partnering and working with master plan developers is a real competitive advantage of ours. And so if you put yourselves in the shoe of a master plan developer, one of the most important things you can have to make sure that you continue to sell high-quality homes to high-quality purchasers is retail amenities and grocery being a really important part of that. And so in the communities that we're servicing, these are wealthy areas with expected high purchase prices for the homes. And so they want high-quality grocers. We have the relationships with the high-quality grocers. We have the expertise to design those assets at a really high level. They know we have the capital to build them. And they know we anticipate owning those. And so we're making every decision along the way from a long-term ownership perspective. And so when you put your shoe -- yourself in the seat of a master plan developer, we're really one of the best partners that you could hope for to execute on that important amenity. 
 And therefore, that's why we've had a lot of success in that. And so as you mentioned, Cheshire is an example of that. Our Baybrook development, our HEB development down in Houston is an example of that. Our Sienna project is an example of that, and we continue to work with a lot of large master plan developers around the country, and that's part of our pipeline. 
 But I'll just add to that. These are not greenfield areas. These are not tertiary markets. These are infill master planned communities that have been underway for, in some cases, decades. And so that's where the sort of perfect formula coming together where there is demand at high enough rents to make our deals pencil, and that's the sweet spot we're working in and continue to focus on. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya with Deutsche Bank. 
Omotayo Okusanya: So based on all the commentary, on the call, everything seems to be going really, really well at the company. So I guess, just going back to guidance, Again, I'm trying to understand the solid beat in 1Q, understanding all the items. Mike, that doesn't kind of translate to a bigger increase in guidance? And kind of what's trying to connect those 2 dots of -- what am I missing? 
Michael Mas: Tayo. Listen, I think it's timing. Really on every -- just about every line item in our outlook, we've delivered on a full year basis, what we anticipate delivering but some of that timing was front loaded. Again, I'll just reiterating the percent rent. That's kind of a classic first quarter issue, but it occurs largely in the first quarter. Again, over half of our percentage rents are earned -- and the balance is coming from other line items like other income, where the income streams within those line items can be nonlinear. And it just so happens that some of that was occurred in the first quarter, for example, rather than our plan, which was in the second. 
 So some of those items are just kind of idiosyncratic. But on a full year basis, as we kind of zoom out, we are delivering on all of them at the level that we anticipated. So it's just not translating to the full year expectations. What you're sensing though, in our commentary is that the incredible quarter we have from a leasing perspective and combined with the incredible momentum we continue to generate on the development side of the business leading to this added conviction over our future growth. And that's what we're trying to convey today is that, that plus 100 basis point contribution on same-property NOI from [indiscernible] as a '25 event, you didn't hear us talk about that last quarter. That's, I think, what's happening. The quality of Q1 is translated into our conviction over the end of '24 and full year '25. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of R.J. Milligan with Raymond James. 
R.J. Milligan: First off, I really appreciate the AFFO disclosure, hopefully, the rest of your peers that don't already provided, follow your lead. But aside from the lack of disclosure from some of your peers, there's always a lot of different bucketing of CapEx. And sorry, I have more of a philosophical question. In your AFFO calculation, you don't include redevelopment CapEx and I think as an industry, some of your peers are pretty discerning as to what's really redevelopment, i.e., growth CapEx. Well, I think some are pretty liberal and throwing a lot of re-tenanting into that redevelopment bucket, which really looks a lot more like maintenance CapEx. So I'm just curious how you think about bucketing those costs to get to your AFFO calculation? 
Michael Mas: I'm happy to take it. And RJ, I appreciate the question. The team did a nice job, really nice job enhancing our disclosure. So thank you for the kudos. I would encourage you to look at it on a look-through basis. That's my simple answer to it. And I understand that redevelopments are hybrids. They are -- they can be challenging to differentiate between maintenance capital and added capital. We -- as we think about our bucketing, it is -- we're densifying the site. We're adding GLA. We're significantly repositioning the asset within the market. And when that occurs, we are designating that as a redevelopment.  If it's straight lease-for-lease, box-for-box [ refinancing ] that space as is, that's leasing CapEx, and we're going to put that into the leasing bucket. But I would encourage you, as you think about Regency versus others, put it all in, call redevelopment capital. We're happy for you to do it and then compare us on an apples-to-apples basis, and we like how we stack up. 
Lisa Palmer: I think what Mike is trying to say is that whether you look at it on just the leasing only, we're at the low end. And if you bump -- if you throw everything together, we're still at the low end. And it goes back again to just our intentional approach to leasing capital. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell with Barclays. 
Anthony Powell: Just a question on the Kroger, Albertsons merger and the back and forth with the FTC in that with the dispositions. Any concerns that, that merger may be taking a bit longer to completely expected or any impact if it's not commenced, got a few questions on that from clients in the past few months. 
Lisa Palmer: I can appreciate that you probably are getting questions from that. But we don't have any new information. We're reading what you're reading -- and it has not -- it doesn't -- the timing of it isn't impacting our operations whatsoever. They're still operating as 2 separate companies. They're talking with us as 2 separate companies. I mean -- and they're key customers of ours. So we do have real -- we do have good relationships with them, but they're not allowed to give us any inside information. 
 We continue to feel really good about our real estate. And I think you've heard us and you've heard us and you've heard me say this before, if the merger goes through, we believe that, that will create a stronger, more well-capitalized grocer that will better be able to compete with some of their competitors and will be a really strong operator for us. And if it does happen, the spin-off of stores that would -- that would happen certainly is the greatest area of uncertainty. But again, we feel really good about our stores. And those are productive grocery locations and we would expect them to continue to be so. If the merger doesn't happen, they're really good operators, and we're happy to have both of them operate in our portfolio. 
Operator: Ms. Palmer, we have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments. 
Lisa Palmer: Thank you all for joining us this morning. Appreciate your interest, and have a great weekend. Thank you. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-09 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Regency Centers Corporation Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Christy, and good morning, everyone. We had another strong quarter in Q4, finishing off an exceptional year for Regency. I'm so proud of the success and what we were able to accomplish, a direct result of the hard work of our dedicated and talented team. Tenant demand across our shopping centers remains robust and this is most evident in our record shop occupancy and in the strength of our leasing pipeline. As we look ahead, we believe the current macroeconomic backdrop supports the continuation of positive trends for neighborhood and community shopping centers. This favorable retail demand environment has also served as a great foundation for driving success in creating value through our sector leading development program. In 2023, we started more than $250 million of new projects with a healthy pipeline of future projects that the team continues to build. We are on track to start $1 billion or more of projects over the next five years. My hat is off to all involved on our team. You have heard me say it before, I believe we have the best development platform in the sector. Our experienced team and ability to create value through this platform and the ability to self-fund with levered free cash flow are unique competitive advantages for Regency. It was also a big year on the transactional side, highlighted by the closing of the Urstadt Biddle acquisition in August. The integration into Regency is now essentially complete. Kudos to all involved for effecting such a smooth and seamless transition. Our ability to grow through developments and transactions is also a testament to the strength and stability of our balance sheet, which in turn enabled us to successfully execute on our $400 million bond issuance and revolving credit line recast in January. Our ability to access low-cost capital is reflective of the quality of our portfolio, our track record and the strength of our lending relationships. Most of you on this call also know that I'm very proud of Regency's best-in-class corporate responsibility, reputation and practices. I'm also grateful when the efforts of our team are recognized, such as in Newsweek's most recent Americas Most Responsible Companies List, where Regency ranked 6th overall in the United States and first in the real estate and housing category. Our company has been included in this list for all five years of its existence and this is the highest ranking any real estate company has ever achieved. For the benefit of our shareholders and all stakeholders, we are committed to adhering to our corporate responsibility principles in all areas of our business. Before turning it over to Alan, I do want to reiterate that we believe the strength in leasing demand over the past 24 months or so is showing no signs of abating. Consistent job growth and moderating inflation are driving consumer resiliency in our trade areas. We also continue to experience tailwinds favoring brick and mortar retail in strong suburban markets, supporting a positive retail environment ahead. Alan?
Alan Roth: Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. We had another quarter with great operating results and leasing momentum capping off a very active 2023. Our teams are taking full advantage of the healthy retail environment that has continued into 2024. Our success was evident in same-property NOI growth of 3.6% in 2023, excluding COVID period reserve collections and termination fees, with base rent growth being the most significant driver, a function primarily of driving rents higher, commencing shop occupancy and bringing redevelopment projects online. In the fourth quarter, we executed nearly 2.5 million square feet of leases with activity from categories including grocers, restaurants, health and wellness, off-price and personal services. Our leasing pipelines continued to be robust, representing another 1 million square feet of potential new leases in LOI and lease negotiation. We achieved cash rent spreads of 12% on a blended basis in Q4, including 35% spreads on new leasing. Full year 2023 cash rent spreads of 10% was our highest annual level since 2016. GAAP and net effective rent spreads were above 20% in the quarter, demonstrating our ability to obtain contractual rent steps in our leases while also being judicious on CapEx spend. Our same-property percent lease rate was up another 30 basis points in Q4, ending the year at 95.7%, and our prelease spread widened further to 280 basis points as a result of our leasing success in the quarter. This pipeline of executed deals now reflects more than $40 million of base rent for leases yet to commence. I've said in the past that records are made to be broken and the team drove our shop leased rate to yet another new record high of 93.4% in the fourth quarter. That represents an impressive 150 basis point increase in shop leasing year-over-year, reflective of nearly 1.4 million square feet of shop space leased, our highest shop volume in more than a decade. Our anchor lease rate also ticked higher in the quarter and ended the year up 10 basis points over 2022 despite the impact from bankruptcy related closures. Our teams have made great progress remerchandising this space with exceptional retailers and at higher rents. And in some cases, our ability to recapture this space has acted as a catalyst for long awaited redevelopment projects. As I look towards 2024, it will take some time to see the benefit of this re-tenanting activity given the 12 to 24 month average downtime associated with anchor re-leasing and lead times on redevelopment projects. For example, some of the Bed Bath spaces that we've released will not rent commence until the fourth quarter of this year. So even with our substantial leasing progress, our anchor commenced occupancy rate ended 2023 lower by 60 basis points, and as a result, we will feel the impact of these vacancies in 2024. That said, the work we've done to date means that we have meaningful visibility into our anchor commencement trajectory. We expect to move our portfolio lease rate even higher in 2024 as demand for space in our high quality centers continues unabated. This will ultimately drive an elevated level of anchor commencement in late 2024 and into 2025. In closing, I am really proud of the tremendous work and success of our team over the last year and I am excited for another great year of leasing activity as the current retail environment is enabling us to create meaningful long-term value at our shopping centers. Nick?
Nick Wibbenmeyer: Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone. We continue to experience strong momentum in our development and redevelopment program as our investment teams were active in the fourth quarter. With additional projects breaking ground in Q4, we ended 2023 with just over $250 million in starts. This is the highest level of starts in a single year for Regency in nearly two decades and demonstrates the incredible work and progress our team has made in sourcing new projects and ramping up our pipeline to achieve our goals. Among our fourth quarter starts is the $23 million redevelopment of Avenida Biscayne. With this project, we are excited to bring additional shop space to one of the best pieces of commercial real estate in South Florida, adjacent to our existing Aventura Square shopping center. In the quarter, we also began the redevelopment of Cambridge Square Atlanta. This $15 million project will bring in new Publix as well as extensive improvements to the center. As of year-end, our in-process pipeline has grown to $468 million and overall our execution remains on time and on budget with expected blended returns of more than 8%. Our in-process projects are 89% preleased on average, reflecting the tremendous work of our team and continued strong demand from high quality retailers. I'll reiterate Alan's comments about anchor recapture, as it can often be a catalyst to unlock creative redevelopment opportunities and bring exciting new merchandising to reinvigorate a center. We have several examples of those within our in-process redevelopment pipeline today, including Baptist Health at Mandarin Landing, Sprouts at Circle Marina Center, REI at Walker Center and Publix at Buckhead Landing. Moving to acquisitions, private transaction activity remains light, but our teams were still able to close two compelling transactions in the fourth quarter. As disclosed previously, we closed on the acquisition of Nohl Plaza in Orange County, California in October, and as a reminder, we bought this center as a future redevelopment pipeline project. And in December, we acquired The Longmeadow Shops in Massachusetts. This 100,000 square foot neighborhood center is fully leased to a strong national merchandising mix of tenants and serves as the premier shopping and dining destination within its trade area. Looking ahead to 2024 and beyond, our team is focused on further building our value creation pipelines and achieving our goal of starting more than $1 billion of development and redevelopment projects over the next five years. While it is difficult to get developments to pencil, we continue to be uniquely suited and remain optimistic about finding and executing attractive opportunities. Demand continues to be strong among best-in-class grocers, as well as other retailers and service providers looking to grow their footprints in our high quality centers and within our trade areas. As Lisa just said, Regency has the best development team in the business and our free cash flow and balance sheet give us the capability to fund projects and continue the success we enjoyed in 2023. Mike?
Mike Mas: Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with some highlights from our full year results, walk through details related to our initial 2024 guidance range and finish by discussing recent balance sheet activity. We reported Nareit FFO of $4.15 per share and core operating earnings of $3.95 per share in 2023. Year-over-year growth in core operating earnings per share was nearly 6%, excluding the timing impact of COVID period reserve collections, driven in large part by same-property NOI growth of 3.6%. Base rent, following significant gains in rent paying occupancy remained the largest contributor to our NOI growth rate at 360 basis points. Turning to our initial guidance for 2024, I'll first refer you to the helpful detail on Slides 5 through 7 in our earnings presentation. Excluding the timing impact of COVID period reserve collections last year, the midpoint of our 2024 range reflects core operating earnings growth of more than 3%. The largest contributor to growth continues to be same-property NOI, for which our guidance assumes a range of 2% to 2.5%. Base rent growth this year will continue to be driven by embedded rent steps, positive re-leasing spreads, additional rent commencement of shop leases and deliveries of redevelopment projects. However, anchor space recapture is expected to impact our commenced occupancy rate in the near term, primarily a result of bankruptcy related moveouts and some junior anchor moveouts following lease expiration. Given the longer lead time to open new anchor tenants, we expect our average commenced occupancy rate to be down by about 50 basis points year-over-year in 2024, impacting same-property NOI growth in the short-term. But more importantly, due to robust tenant demand, we have been re-leasing this anchor space just about as quickly as we are recapturing it and we expect our overall portfolio lease rate will trend higher throughout the year. We will begin to benefit from this outsized anchor rent commencement activity beginning in late 2024. In addition to same-property NOI growth, our earnings range also reflects previously discussed accretion from the UBP merger as well as positive contributions from recently completed ground-up developments. As we discussed last quarter, the impact of higher rates and debt refinancing activity remains a headwind to core operating earnings growth this year. That said, we are very pleased to gain greater visibility on this impact as we took advantage of an attractive debt capital markets window in early January to prefund our 2024 maturities with a new $400 million bond priced at 5.25%. Notably, as you consider our guidance range for interest expense and preferred dividends, please know that it is showing net of expected interest income. January proved to be a busy month as we also closed on the recast of our revolving credit facility, which was upsized by $250 million to a $1.5 billion total commitment, which included a tightening of our borrowing spread by 15 basis points. In an environment where access to capital is even more precious and banks are being incrementally more discriminating, we are proud of this result, a reflection of Regency's performance track record, portfolio quality and balance sheet position, as well as the strength of our long-standing banking partnerships. Our recent activity has further fortified our sector-leading balance sheet and liquidity position. We remain at the low end of our targeted leverage range of 5 times to 5.5 times net debt to EBITDA. And following the prefunding of our '24 maturities, our next unsecured bond maturity is not until November of 2025. We have ample capacity on our newly upsized revolver and expect to generate free cash flow north of $160 million this year. This liquidity, balance sheet capacity and differentiated access to capital allows us to further grow our development and redevelopment pipelines as both Lisa and Nick discussed, and remain opportunistic as we look for incremental avenues to drive growth and value. With that, we are happy to take your questions. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Goldsmith: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. As we look at the algorithm for 2024, is it that same property NOI growth is solid? And then there's some puts and takes related to the merger and debt refinancing and a normalization of some factors that just may limit the flow-through. So I guess my question is what gets you to the low and the high-end of the range this year? And then thinking about anchor leasing coming online at the end of 2024 and into 2025 and potentially more normalized comparisons kind of going forward, should that algorithm look better going forward? Thank you.
Mike Mas: Hey, Michael, you pack a punch with one question. There is a lot in there. So let me unpack some of that. And if I don't get to it all, I'm certain that others will have similar questions. So just to recap what you said there from a core earnings perspective, big moving parts, and you've got it largely correct. Same-property NOI growth is the largest and has been the largest contributor to our earnings growth rate. So at the midpoint, we're looking at a core growth rate of just over 3%, same-property growth, as you can see, 2% to 2.5%, largest contributor there. Very proud to deliver the UBP merger accretion estimate of 1.5% to our growth rate, and that's been consistent, as you know, since we announced the transaction back in May. We continue to deliver upon that underwriting. The headwinds, of course, and you alluded to some of them, but let me just click through them for the benefit of everyone. No further COVID collections of about $4 million, that's $0.02 a share. By the way, we're extraordinarily happy for that headwind to be behind us. And kudos to the team for collecting on that rent. Lower termination fees is about $0.02, and of course, the results of our recent debt financing, which we're also extraordinarily pleased with, is another $0.02 of headwind to earnings growth. To your follow-up question, just let me start here. The puts and takes of outperformance -- underperformance relative to the midpoint, listen, it's going to come through the NOI plan, and specifically within the NOI plan, it's going to come through move-outs as it typically does, occupancy and our assumptions around that. We've really -- we've put together this occupancy plan, this leasing plan, and later in the call, I'm sure Alan will jump in and give us some color. But we feel really good about the direction of our percent lease. When you look at the top line kind of surface level, we're going to move percent leased up towards our 96% target by about 20 basis points this year. And on the surface, that looks like we're moving in the exact right direction, consistent with the dynamics we're seeing in the marketplace, which we spent some time on the prepared remarks describing. But it's what's happening beneath the surface, uniquely in 2024, which is causing some of that drag. And we are going to see in the first quarter of this year, a decline in commenced occupancy of about 80 basis points. Much of that, the vast majority of that, we can see it. It's bankruptcy filings, it's moveouts from Rite Aid, it's the moveouts from Bed Bath & Beyond. We have a couple of high rent paying leases in Manhattan that are expiring, and we've got great activity on the re-lease of those spaces. But we're going to feel that occupancy decline early in the year. And then to finish it up on your impactful question, as I said in the remarks, we're re-leasing this space as about as quickly as we can get it. By year-end, our commenced occupancy rate should be north of where we started. We should be up by about 20 basis points on that rate, on a spot basis again. But it's that downtime, it's that average, it's that impact of timing that's going to weigh on our 2% to 2.5% growth rate. So lastly, '25 is looking -- from an algorithm perspective, '25 is looking like a disproportionate year to our standard 2.5% to 3% run rate. If all -- again, there's a lot to say here. I'm not giving '25 guidance, but if all can kind of hold together here, '25, we should see the benefit of that commenced occupancy rate coming back online and moving our growth forward.
Michael Goldsmith: Mike, thank you so much for the thorough response.
Lisa Palmer: Michael, if I may just one second, just to come back to what we did say in our prepared remarks, because the takeaway, there's a lot of words because it was a lot of -- it was a big question. The health of our business is really good. The demand is really strong. And we said that in all the prepared remarks. And the downtime that's associated with these anchor moveouts is very short-term in nature. This is not something that is permanent. Certainly nothing that we're seeing right now. As I've said in my remarks, as Alan did, we're not seeing any signs of the healthy demand for our space abating whatsoever. And I think that's a really important thing to remember.
Michael Goldsmith: Thanks for that. And maybe --
Lisa Palmer: You can ask your second question, Michael.
Michael Goldsmith: Maybe I'll keep it very short. You're looking for NOI growth of 2% to 2.5% for the core portfolio. How are you thinking about growth in the UBP portfolio? Is that growing a little bit faster than the core?
Mike Mas: It is. Just looking at '24 on a standalone basis, the growth rate in that portfolio is north of the 2% to 2.5%. It would be accretive if we have included it in the same-property portfolio. It would have been additive, I should say, by about 25 basis points to that 2% to 2.5% range. We like -- and it's consistent. What we saw in that portfolio was a leasing opportunity. That portfolio was about and is about 200 basis points shy of our lease rate. And the team has assimilated the assets into the Regency platform. They are making great progress and we're excited about the prospects there. But that growth rate is slightly additive.
Michael Goldsmith: Thank you so much for the thorough responses.
Lisa Palmer: Thanks, Michael.
Mike Mas: Appreciate it, Michael.
Operator: Our next question is from Dori Kesten with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Dori Kesten: Thanks. Good morning. I know your acquisition guide currently sits at zero, but can you talk about the volume of centers you described as of interest to Regency out there today? And would you be surprised if you ended the year as a net acquirer?
Nick Wibbenmeyer: I appreciate the question. Yeah, I'll just give you a little color to what we're seeing in the market. We're definitely seeing a little pickup. As you heard us say time and time again in 2023, there was definitely a lot less opportunities out in the market. We were happy with the needles in the haystack. We did find, as you know, in 2023. But as we've turned the page now into 2024, we are seeing more activity out there. I'd say, it's still below historical norms, but definitely a pickup from '23. And as always, we're very active in underwriting and understanding those opportunities and goes back to what we always say, when we find opportunities that are equal or accretive to our quality and our growth rate and accretive to earnings, we're going to pounce. And so we are hopeful to continue to find needles in the haystack as we move through '24. But as you know, we do not guide to those and so we do not have clear visibility.
Dori Kesten: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Jeffrey Spector: Great, thank you. And thanks for the comments on '24. I know there's a lot to get done, but comments into '25, right, because I think investors, the market, is kind of trying to look past, let's say, some of these headwinds in '24 in terms of a higher longer-term growth rate for that same-store NOI. Can you remind me, like, do you have a company goal target for that same-store NOI? And second would be what other key initiatives are you working on, whether it's portfolio composition, technology, et cetera, to, again drive that higher same-store NOI, let's say, into '25 and beyond?
Lisa Palmer: Thanks, Jeff, for the question. We do provide, and have really always provided kind of our same-property NOI growth model, if you will, as we affectionately call it, it's in our materials. And we do target over the long-term to grow same-property NOI by 2.5% to 3% annually. And the primary component of that is going to be contractual rent steps and cash re-leasing spreads. Occupancy, whether -- and in this case, we have percent commenced occupancy in 2024 coming down. Occupancy is one that will move that up or down. And then also we have had a really successful track record of adding to that same-property NOI growth through our investment and redevelopment dollars. So that is our long-term goal. And I know -- most of you know this, I've been with the company a long time. I do believe that throughout the years, we have continued to evolve and leverage all tools, technology to get better and to continue to improve processes and also continue to ensure that we are sustaining that long-term NOI growth, which is, as Mike commented, the largest contributor to core operating earnings growth.
Jeffrey Spector: Thank you. And then a more detailed question. Can you talk a little bit more about The Longmeadow Shops, the acquisition in December? Can you discuss anything around the cap rate, seller motivation, value-add opportunity? Any color on that asset would be helpful. Thank you.
Nick Wibbenmeyer: Sure. This is Nick. Appreciate the question, Jeff. I'll start with just your question related to the cap rate and valuation. And again, we talk about needles in the haystack and using every tool we have in our tool belt. And this is one of those opportunities where the seller approached us. They were looking for a units transaction. And as you can appreciate a units transaction, they care about the currency they're getting, and therefore they wanted Regency currency. They were a fan of ours from afar, and so for planning purposes, they were ready to transact. They'd own the assets for decades. And so we were excited about the opportunity. And as you can see, from a valuation standpoint, this thing is plus or minus 8% going in yield. So very attractive from a yield standpoint as well as quality standpoint. And so we're excited about the future of that opportunity.
Jeffrey Spector: Thank you.
Lisa Palmer: Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: Our next question is from Craig Mailman with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Craig Mailman: Hey, thanks. Maybe I just want to follow up. I know it seems like the call has been kind of focused on what the longer term earnings power is, given just how good fundamentals are. And I guess, I maybe want to come at it from a different way. Lisa, you've seen kind of the perfect storm of minimal supply, good demand, and that's helped push market-led growth. But inflation has also been a big piece of that the last couple of years as kind of top line for a lot of your tenants has taken off. As inflation starts to moderate back to more normalized levels, I mean, are you seeing any pushback on the market rent growth kind of being able to be sustained into '25? You know it's too early for '26, particularly with some cost pressures, maybe in the labor side, that's hitting some of the fast casual, fast food guys that may hit some other type of tenancy?
Lisa Palmer: I know you addressed me with that question, Craig, but I think it's best to allow Alan to handle that.
Alan Roth: Yeah, Craig. I appreciate the question. As I've said in our opening remarks, 10% is our highest total annual rent growth in seven years. But we prefer to emphasize the GAAP growth as a better measure and we have some impressive spread this quarter, 20% total over 50% on new deals. But to your question from an inflation perspective, we're approaching peak occupancy. So I think when we get there or even when we're near that as we are now, I still think that pricing power is there and expectation is that the teams can continue to push on both the spreads and the steps as we go-forward. We are getting more steps. And we're getting steps in more deals now and we're getting higher steps. Approximately 95% of our new deals had steps and 70% of those had 3% or higher. So again I think the focus is there and I believe that given where occupancy is that trend can continue, Craig?
Lisa Palmer: And again, I would just come on top. When you think about our business model and our value proposition to our investors. It is the sustainability and the safety of that growing cash-flow stream, which translates to our core operating earnings growth and then dividend growth. And I know that we're getting far removed from the 2020-year, but I think it's really important to remember that we went through, I mean a time, the entire world went through a time that none of us had ever experienced before. And we did not cut our dividend. And I think that, that's really important when you again, you think about the value proposition for our investors. It's core operating earnings growth plus dividend growth to get to total shareholder returns in the 8% to 10% range.
Craig Mailman: No, that's helpful. And I don't know, maybe this one's for Mike or I don't want to direct it to any one person, but interest expense headwinds have been an issue. You guys have successfully sourced some acquisitions and you have potentially a billion of redevelopment ongoing over the next five years. I'm just trying to get at when you see coming to the numbers, the snow pipeline really kicking in, average occupancy, the timing of some of these anchor box backfills kind of normalizing out, when maybe the headwinds moderate enough that you start to see kind of the leverage multiplier on same store kind of flow through the earnings. Is that in the next couple of years, or do you really have to get through the kind of the continued repricing of the debt stack?
Mike Mas: Another power packed question. And I appreciate it, Craig. We do have some headwinds to our growth rate this year and we kind of -- we just ran through them and clicked through them and I think we understand those in '24, and again, happy to dig into any of those that you'd like to. But I do see the power of our existing free-cash flow. And the ability for us to put that capital directly into our growing and exciting -- excitingly growing, development, redevelopment pipeline, which will add to our growth rate going forward. Beyond -- and we actually have from a leverage perspective, given our balance sheet position at the low-end of our targeted leverage range, we actually have on a leverage-neutral basis even more capital driven again by that free-cash flow to put into our acquisition intents. And Nick did a nice job of explaining how we think about acquisition activity going forward, which will add to our core operating earnings growth rate. But then you kind of put all that together combined with a normalization and continued growing of our commenced occupancy through '24 towards the end unfortunately, into '25, I think those elements will reflect themselves in a core operating earnings growth rate, that is at least meeting the objectives that Lisa outlined of being 4% on core operating earnings with a commensurate increase in dividend growth. And if we can do better on the margin in all elements of our business, rent growth, maybe even push those occupancy records even a little bit higher. All of those should result in maybe a slightly even more amplified vision of growth.
Craig Mailman: No, that's helpful. Appreciate the color. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Samir Khanal with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.
Samir Khanal: Hey, Mike. Good morning. I guess one on the integration with Urstadt Biddle. I know you've talked about 1.5% accretion for a while now. But as you've had time to digest this portfolio, and what potential further upside are you seeing maybe from an internal growth standpoint on the occupancy side. And also, what about the opportunities to unlock some of the redevelopment opportunities there?
Mike Mas: Hey Sameer. Yeah, I'll reiterate the -- from the beginning, we've articulated the strategy behind this merger as being a portfolio that looks like Regency's assets. And on a long-term basis, we see a growth rate that looks like Regency's growth rate. But in the near-term one element that we liked about the opportunity was this ability to bring that rent-paying occupancy higher than it has -- than it currently exists and I just articulated. In fact, this year we are seeing an additive growth rate from a same-property perspective because of that movement in commenced occupancy. So there's not -- that doesn't, what you didn't hear me say is, there's a big redevelopment, heavier component of this merger in the near-term. But I'm not -- we're not dismissing that either. We do see -- we are -- we know it's a leasing exercise right now. But as we're leasing up this portfolio we have an eye towards the future, as we do in our -- across all of our assets. And we are constantly looking to find value-add accretive redevelopment opportunities for really well-located pieces of commercial real-estate, and that's what we bought. And so we're pretty excited about the long-term prospects there.
Samir Khanal: Okay and then, I guess my question -- second question is around the health of the consumer and the local shop segment. I mean, I appreciate the comments on the consumer being resilient and you're not seeing impact to the business yet. When you look at credit card debt, it's at record levels. You see delinquencies that are up, I guess what are you seeing not just on the Shop segment, but kind of the local side of that? Thanks.
Lisa Palmer: I'll take it. If Alan like to add, please feel free, Alan. But generally speaking, again, think about our portfolio and the types of shopping centers we own, neighborhood community shopping centers tend to be more convenience, value, necessity, service. So the consumer -- and in the trade areas that we do mostly operate in, there's not been a lot of job losses. So people are -- they still have their -- they still have their jobs, and they are still earning wages. And therefore they're still spending. And when people do cut back, they tend to not necessarily cut back at their neighborhood and community shopping centers first, they may trade down, which sometimes also will benefit us. So we're not going to say that we'll never -- that we won't feel any pressure from consumer spending declining. But again, we have long-term leases. And we can absorb, and our tenants, because they are high quality, good operators, can also absorb some decline in sales. Sales do not need to grow every year for a tenant to be able to pay their rent. Our tenants are great operators. And it has been, in my experience, we have gone through many cycles at Regency, and there have been more moderate recessions. So even if we were to enter into a recession, there have been more moderate recessions where we really didn't feel any pain as a result of that. And then there are ones that are much more significant, like the GFC and COVID, and we did feel that pain. But I don't see that in -- I don't have any visibility to a recession of that type or that type of decline in 2024, so don't expect to feel much pressure.
Mike Mas: And Samir, I would just add, just from an operator's perspective, we're going to look first to our AR balances, they're healthy. We're going to look next to sales reports, they remained strong. We're going to then look at are we seeing elevated levels of assignments? We're not. And so, I think sort of all of those things also dovetail into the consumers reaction, at least within our portfolio right now.
Samir Khanal: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Greg McGinnis with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.
Greg McGinnis: Hey, good afternoon. We've spoken about finding ground up developers maybe lacked the capital to get construction started. Do you still see that as an opportunity for investment this year, or are there other non-traditional, opportunistic investment opportunities, it's a lot of opportunities that you're looking to pursue this year.
Nick Wibbenmeyer: Greg, this is Nick. I greatly appreciate the question. Yeah, I mean I'll just say it this way, again, we have the benefit of every tool in the toolbox available to us when it comes to sourcing, development, acquisition, investment opportunities overall. And so, there's no doubt construction loans are definitely still hard for people to get. So we are continuing to be engaged with smaller developers, but many times they need more than just debt capital, they need expertise, they need relationships to fix their cash-on-cash returns. And so, debt and equity is in play in those conversations. So we continue to have dialog related to that. And more times than not, those conversations turn into some sort of equity participation given we can bring more tools to the overall deals than just debt. That being said, when appropriate, we will lean in to deals that we want to own long-term. We recently closed a transaction where we are just providing senior and mezz debt on a potential future acquisition. And it may have future development opportunities as well. And so again, we go into these conversations with every tool in the tool belt and bring them out and we're excited about the future potential.
Greg McGinnis: Great, thanks, for a second question here. It's a bit of a different type of asset from your shopping center bread-and-butter, but what's your confidence in re-leasing those Manhattan vacancies that you talked about and is 101 7th Ave potentially address this year as well.
Alan Roth: Greg. Yes, thank you for that question, so I think, as Mike mentioned in his opening remarks or maybe it was in the early parts of the Q&A, you know those rents as you know are very high in Manhattan, and we did lose two key tenants, a former food importer in middle of last year and then a CVS that vacated just last month. We get it back, we lease it. And I think that speaks to the strength of the real-estate, we do have signed transactions to solve the Third Avenue premises that unfortunately sort of ties into that story down rent paying occupancy in '24, where it's not going to come back online until the fourth quarter likely of this year. And as to Second Avenue, we're negotiating a lease there as well. So the real estate certainly is strong enough for us to find those replacement users, feel very good about that. But it is impacting us in '24. As to Barneys, we continue to pursue all avenues leasing it, demising it redeveloping it or evaluating the sale and so for us, we're going to act upon what makes the most best financial sense. And it's certainly a top priority for us.
Greg McGinnis: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Ron Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Ronald Kamdem: Hey, two quick ones. So I'm looking at the supplement, I see Avenida Biscayne Cambridge Square was added, maybe can you provide an update on Westbard Square, that looked like $450 million, is that still coming on in the next sort of 12 months to 18 months. And even beyond that, how are you guys thinking about potential sort of new starts and development given the strength of the balance sheet?
Mike Mas: Ron, greatly appreciate the question. So start with Westbard, really happy to announce that redevelopment continues to progress very well. Giant, which is the grocer that we relocated and built new flagship for them just opened in the last couple of weeks, and it's doing tremendously well. So if anyone's in the DC area, I would highly recommend you all checking out that asset as we're very proud about the continued redevelopment potential as the team is doing a nice job keeping us on-time and on-budget. And then as you sort of zoom out and look at the wider scope, we feel really good about our development and redevelopment pipeline. As we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we started over $250 million in 2023, which was the highest amount of starts in quite some time. But we're not done. We still see a very strong pipeline as we look into 2024 and beyond. And it's all aspects of the business, it's redeveloping our existing portfolio. Sometimes it's tear down rebuilds of grocers as you've seen with Cambridge as you mentioned. Other times, it is putting these junior boxes back in production in one way or another. Alan and I alluded to in our prepared remarks. And then last but not least, it is ground-up net new ground-up opportunities that are extremely difficult to pencil. There's no question about that. These are difficult transactions to pull together, but as you saw us execute in 2023, we are doing it and we're excited about the potential to continue with several projects, some sooner rather than later. We hope to announce one here in the next couple of weeks in the Northeast, that would be phenomenal ground-up opportunity our team is rounding home base right now. So excited that pipeline we expect to grow and hit as we've articulated, our $1 billion dollars of starts plus or minus in the next five years.
Lisa Palmer: It's -- so many of you know, I played softball and my favorite softball team actually opened the season today. And this is a softball. Give me another opportunity to say the best team in the business, the best platform in the business, our leverage free cash flow funds it. That is a competitive advantage for us, and it's something we're really proud of. And I expect, and I'm confident that we will continue to execute and perform. Thanks for the question. That was great.
Ronald Kamdem: Right. Just if I could sneak in my second one. Just closing the thought on the same-store NOI. One specifically, I think you talked about 80 basis points dip in 1Q. What's bad debt that's factored into the same-store NOI guidance and how that compares to sort of historical? And then just a bigger-picture is the messaging that because this was sort of an odd year, as you sort of flip the calendar, we should be thinking more about sort of the same-store NOI, translating to core earnings growth in sort of the mid singles digits and so forth, just making sure that's still the messaging. Thanks.
Mike Mas: Yeah, appreciate it, Ron. So from a credit loss perspective, and I think is how I'll take your question. We are planning for 75 basis points to 100 basis points of -- and that's, by the way that's a metric on build revenues, but we are planning for 75 basis points to 100 basis points of credit loss. That is very similar to what we planned for. In fact, we kind of ended the year towards the lower end of that range in '23. Roughly half of that credit loss provision is, I'd call, bankruptcy related and the balance roughly to traditional bad debt expense. I think to extend your question beyond kind of as we deal with the drop in commence occupancy in '24. And Alan alluded to some of the reasons for that, but as we solve them pretty actively throughout the course of the year, yeah, we're going to -- it's about driving that commenced occupancy rate, closing that gap on that SNO pipeline. That is what's going to translate to top line earnings growth on a core basis.
Ronald Kamdem: Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question is from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Juan Sanabria: Hi, just maybe a softball here, Lisa given your recent comments. But just curious on why do you think you guys are able to find a decent amount of development start opportunities when if we listen to some of your peers, they're saying market rents have to grow 40% to 50% for new developments to pencil. Where is the disconnect, I guess in those two comments?
Lisa Palmer: I've never seen Nick play softball, so I'm a little afraid of this answer, but I'll let him answer.
Nick Wibbenmeyer: Thank you, Juan. I appreciate the question. With that, setup, now I'm nervous what my answer is going to be. No, I'm kidding. No, it is a great question, Juan, and both are true. And so, I just want to keep stressing that it is very, very difficult to find land that is priced appropriately, tenants that want to pay enough rent to make sense for that land cost and that construction cost. And so, it is extremely difficult and I want to stress that. And it is finding needles in a haystack. But because it's so hard, and because you have to have all of those tools in your tool belt, is why I am so excited. Because as Lisa has said time and time again, and I couldn't agree more, we have the best team in the business. We have 23 offices waking up every day, working with our critical grocery partners, helping them grow their business, and they want to grow their business. And so, they are sitting at the table with us, shoulder to shoulder with the land sellers, with the contractors, helping us collectively all figure out how do we make these deals pencil so that they can get net new stores opened. And so, although there are very few opportunities where that calculus comes together to make financial sense, it's not zero. And we continue to get more than our fair share. And so, it's because it's so hard to find those opportunities that excites me because we can execute on, and we will continue to.
Juan Sanabria: And where do you think we should think of yields for new starts that you may find in '24?
Nick Wibbenmeyer: Another great question. As you've seen our in process pipeline, as you can see is in that 8% plus range, on a blended basis. I would expect that to be the continued blended rate. That's not to say some opportunities that we want to lean into that we think are really compelling that we won't see the numbers, start with the seven from an initial yield standpoint. And so, I'd say that's where our eyesight is, is seven on the low-end of the range for really compelling risk-adjusted returns. But on a blended basis, we'd expect to see us continue to push north of 8%. And I'll just stress again on the development side. I do not expect we're going to wake up tomorrow and see a bunch of new supply coming on market because of how difficult it is first and foremost. And then number two, I just want to stress how much we do derisk these opportunities before we close and put a shovel in the ground. And so we have entitlements in hand before we close. We are substantially pre-leased, especially with our grocers and other anchors as you've seen in our pipeline. And so, that pre-leasing is really critical to high quality anchor tenants. And then last but not least, our construction drawings and bids are in hand. And so again, those are the key pieces of the puzzle to have in hand to give us the confidence that these yields do make sense. These projects can move forward and as you've seen, our teams have done a tremendous job, and I appreciate the daily efforts of once we start making sure we bring them online, on-time and on-budget. And as Lisa has alluded to, we have a very strong track record of doing that given that history.
Juan Sanabria: And one more follow-up, if you don't mind, anything unusual in the fourth quarter on the OpEx side, flowing through the same store, that kind of impacted the growth rate for the quarter that we should be aware of thinking forward?
Mike Mas: Yes and no. So on a full-year basis in '23, I think our growth rate was about 7% on OpEx. You know insurance is a big part of the story, Juan. And I think you're pretty well versed in what the property insurance market feel like today, and we are not immune from that impact. Inflation has been an impact as well, as you know we're largely triple net, so we're able to pass through successfully the vast majority of any increases including those in insurance to our tenant base. And you can see that in our recovery rate, which has held its own. We did have a unique item in the fourth quarter on real estate taxes where we had kind of a burn-off of a brownfield credit in a real estate tax line item. I don't know if you're picking that up in your analysis. But that was one unique item in the fourth quarter, that won't -- so that credit won't recur going forward.
Juan Sanabria: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Anthony Powell: Hi, good morning. I guess a clarification question on the junior anchor comments. The ones that moved out at least aspiration, were these all Manhattan and other in a watch list tenants or are there other groups of tenants in that bucket? And if so, why did they move or why did they, I guess vacate?
Alan Roth: Anthony, this is Alan. I appreciate the questions. So it was, Manhattan and bankruptcies, but on top of that, there was many intentional move-outs. As part of our intense asset management approach, and so I would give a few examples. I know a number of you live in or around Connecticut and Norwalk by way of example, we've got a retailer that's going to stop paying rent here next month, and we're going to be down the entire year. And we are bringing target into that project, it's not going to open until likely Q2, Q3 of 2025, phenomenal merchandiser great and highly accretive transaction and something that was absolutely the right long-term decision for us yet impacting 2024. I would also take a couple of office supply examples. We have three of them in fact that we intentionally made the decision to replace them. One was Sprouts, one with Homesense, one with a Baptist Health medical facility that I think Nick had mentioned in his remarks. And again, this is just an opportunity to enhance merchandising, provide durable occupancy with enhanced tenant credit and get really significant rent growth. And so that is our proactive way of really thinking through this and just from the sort of that uneven climb comment, it's coming offline here in '24 from a rent-paying perspective and filtering its way back in year end and into '25.
Anthony Powell: Okay. If I get to my next question. So you look at '25 and '26, you have like 7% of your anchors, I guess, lease operations in those two years. Are you going to keep doing this and maybe pushing tenants out for higher rent, or is this kind of the peak of this activity in '24?
Mike Mas: I mean, look, I would just say from a practical perspective, we are constantly looking at our entire portfolio for opportunities to appropriately remerchandise, drive accretive returns, focus on redevelopment opportunities. That's always been part of our mantra. And we're going to certainly continue to do that.
Alan Roth: And I would just -- I'd just add that over the long-term, we'd come back to our components of same-property NOI growth, and would still expect to be in that 2.5% to 3% range.
Anthony Powell: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Ki Bin Kim: Thanks. Just wanted to go back to Juan's question about OpEx expenses. I guess, just high-level, I know you explained some of the causes of it, but I guess how concerning is the increase in expenses as it pertains to your business and ability to push rent. And does that actually start to impact the way you think about where you want to own properties, whether that be local politics or how these local governments are run?
Mike Mas: I appreciate the question Ki Bin. Listen from on a go-forward basis, the directionality of our OpEx and the growth rate in that line item hasn't changed our capital allocation thoughts at all. We continue to want to grow our portfolio across the entirety of our regions, in fact, in particularly Phoenix, we'd like to dive into and add to the extent we can find some opportunities in that region, and add that to the Regency portfolio. But kind of no change from a capital allocation perspective as a result of the increases. I'll let Alan comment on the pressure that may or may not exist on rent growth.
Alan Roth: Yeah, I would say, Ki Bin, generally speaking, we're not seeing the pressure to rent growth. Does it play a small part? Sure. I mean at the end of the day our retailers certainly look at their overall occupancy costs. And so, when you kind of layer all of that in, again on the margin, I think that could certainly have a small little impact. But it's just not material enough at this point to really change I think the realities of where we are.
Ki Bin Kim: Okay. And then, quick follow-up here. The 50 basis points drag from the commenced occupancy, is that roughly equivalent to the NOI drag?
Mike Mas: Let me break down the NOI drag a little differently, which I think will help you out. So same-property NOI growth, let me go through the puts and takes to everyone's benefit, 2% to 2.5% again base rent is going to be the largest positive contributor to that growth rate, in, in fact about the same range. And that's rent steps, lease spreads, and the commencement of shop occupancy helping support that growth. Redevelopment contributions are going to be 50 basis points to 75 basis points to the positive. And then here's your question on the offsets. It's really coming from two primary areas, bankruptcies. It's about 50 basis points of drag in that area. And that's both actual announced, known bankruptcies, as well as the potential for bankruptcies in 2024. And then the Manhattan assets that we've spoken about today at length is dragging us by about 30 basis points. So that 80 bps Ki Bin that I just summarized for you, that's essentially tied to that commenced occupancy drag in the first quarter.
Ki Bin Kim: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Linda Tsai: Thanks. Not sure if you've answered this with the previous line of questioning, but you said 2025 is setting up based on lease timing to be disproportionate year of growth in NOI. So does that mean '24 should be disproportionately above your long-term 3% target?
Lisa Palmer: I think you meant to say 2025 in your question, not 2024.
Mike Mas: Yeah, we're not meeting our objectives in 2024 that we articulate on a long-term basis. And that we -- frankly, hold us -- we're pretty serious about holding ourselves accountable to. And in '25, yes, to the extent, and again, we're not giving '25 guidance, Linda. But to the extent we -- the portfolio delivers what we see it delivering at the end of this year, going into '25 and compressing that commenced rate, bringing that -- growing SNO pipeline back online, yeah, that should translate into above average core operating earnings growth, all else being equal, and I stress, all else being equal. We're going to have a bond to refinance again in '25. I mean, there are other elements to the plan that certainly incorporate, that will impact that result. But I think the idea and the direction that you have in mind is correct.
Lisa Palmer: Yeah, and the other big part of all else being equal is, we can't control any geopolitical or economic uncertainty. But all else being equal, absolutely agree. That's why I'd come back to over the long term, two years isn't a long term, but it's an average. We would expect to be in that 2.5% to 3% average same-property NOI growth.
Linda Tsai: That's very helpful. Thank you. And my second question is, on the Rite Aid's and Bed Bath & Beyond that contribute to the economic anchor occupancy decline. Can you just give us an update on where you are in various stages of signed leases versus working on backfill still?
Alan Roth: Yeah, Linda, happy to answer that question. This is Alan. So the team has made really great progress. I'll start with Bed Bath & Beyond, 9 of our 12 are executed. And again, so a number of those won't be coming online until later in this year, but really great retailers REI, RH outlet, LL Bean, Fresh Market, TJ Maxx. I mean, there's some just great users that are backfilling these, and we've experienced rent spreads that actually exceeded what we anticipated, north of 40%, while also keeping our capital levels as I mentioned in my remarks at a very I think judicious level for those. So the remaining three are all in negotiation right now. So we are beyond the point of prospecting. We hope to wrap those up in relative short order and really have all of those back open and rent paying. With respect to Rite Aid, we had we had at the time of filing 22 locations, including those that came through the UBP merger, six of those have been rejected, five are closed. One is in the closing process. And again, I think a testament to how our team proactively gets out in front of these, two of those six locations are already leased. One to a hardware store, one to fitness operator. And so, we're actually pursuing the remaining four. And we're going to stay on our front foot relative to the balance of that portfolio as you know, Rite Aid continues to go through that process as they haven't officially exited bankruptcy.
Linda Tsai: And how do we think about those rents for Rite Aid, are they sort of all over the map. Are they above or below market?
Alan Roth: Yeah, interestingly enough, I like the way you just phrased that. They are all over the map. However, I will tell you that we are double-digit certainly from a mark-to-market. I'd say, generally speaking 15% to 20%, but there is some really massive ones that can be in there, there are some flat ones. So -- but generally I feel really good about certainly the upside depending on those that we get back.
Linda Tsai: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Mueller: Yeah, hi, just a really quick one here. Your 93.4% small-shop leased rate, what's the commenced level that goes along with that and where do you think that commenced level can grind higher to, if at all?
Mike Mas: Let's see here, we are at a 89.9 commenced shop occupancy. Our -- the SNO on the shops is 350 basis points at year end. How much higher -- what record are you going to set, Alan?
Alan Roth: North, so we're going to continue to take it north, Mike. I would -- I mean --
Mike Mas: We're getting pretty close. Let me help out. We're getting pretty close to. I mean we're in thin air. As I've used the words to describe the level of leased rate that we have in our shop space, I like to think we can continue to grind it higher. We have great centers with really good spaces that are still available and a great leasing team. And we'll keep pushing. The commence is just going to follow, right. So we are going to deliver on these leases. On balance, all in, that spread on a normal basis, including anchor, should be 175 basis points between leased and commenced.
Michael Mueller: Okay, so that spread applies to small shops too.
Mike Mas: The small shops spread will be wider. The anchor spread will be narrower. We'll get back to you, Mike, on what kind of a long-term shop spread is.
Michael Mueller: Okay, okay. Appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Floris van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please proceed with your question.
Kenneth Billingsley: Hey, good afternoon. This is Ken Billingsley for Floris. Quick question on your guidance for '24. Given the same economic conditions that are supporting your core business, you're guiding to a 100 million in dispositions at approximately 5.5% cap rate. Can you provide some color as to why you're seeing that given your confidence in this cap rate?
Nick Wibbenmeyer: Ken, this is Nick. I appreciate that question. As you know, our guidance on disposition is when we have clear visibility to that. And so, as we've stated over the last several years, now we feel really good about our portfolio, and don't have the need to sell assets that have risk. But we still have non-strategic assets that we will prioritize for sale. And so, those assets and the guidance we do have visibility to that pricing. They're non-strategic, and for instance a couple of them are single-tenant. And so, we feel good about that guidance, and we feel good about that cap rate given those the assets have been selected to be disposed off.
Kenneth Billingsley: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the floor over to Lisa Palmer for any closing comments.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you all for your interest in Regency. And hope everyone has a great weekend. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-11-03 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to the Regency Centers Corporation Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Christy McElroy, Senior Vice President, Capital Markets. Please go ahead, Christy. 
Christy McElroy : Good morning, and welcome to Regency Centers' third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Lisa Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Mas, Chief Financial Officer; Alan Roth, EVP National Property Operations and East Region President; and Nick Wibbenmeyer, EVP and West Region President.  As a reminder, today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements about the company's views of future business and financial performance, including forward earnings guidance and future market conditions. These are based on management's current beliefs and expectations and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. It's possible that actual results may differ materially from those suggested by these forward-looking statements we may make. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements may be included in our presentation today and are described in more detail in our filings with the SEC, specifically our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filings.  In our discussion today, we will also reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. The comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this quarter's earnings materials, which are posted on our Investor Relations website. Please note that we have also posted a presentation on our website with additional information, including disclosures related to forward earnings guidance. Our caution on forward-looking statements also applies to the presentation materials. Lisa? 
Lisa Palmer : Thank you, Christy, and good morning, everyone. We had another strong quarter of operating results, supported by continued positive momentum in our business Tenant demand remains really healthy and consistent, and this is evident in the strength of our rent growth and our ability to further increase leased occupancy despite elevated bankruptcies. And you're going to hear a lot more about this from Alan in just a few minutes.  We continue to drive success within our development program as well. This is reflected in the leasing progress that we've made across our in-process pipeline as well as our significant volume of project starts year-to-date. Development is a core competency of our company. And as you heard me say before, I believe we have the best national platform in the business. We have proven our ability to create meaningful value and earnings accretion over time and we remain well positioned to reach our targeted annual pace of $200 million to $250 million of redevelopment and development spend annually.  On the transaction side, we were proud to close our merger with Urstadt Biddle in mid-August. And since then, we made significant headway integrating the assets into our platform and welcoming our new Regency team members. Our short time with the portfolio and the people has only served to reinforce our confidence in the combination of our 2 great companies.  We also recently acquired 2 shopping centers. Nick will discuss these in more detail. But despite a pretty thin transaction market, I'm really proud that we were able to find some higher total return needles in the haystack.  So turning to the macroeconomic environment. Yes, we continue to see positive trends. We are seeing in real time the spending power of the consumer in our trade areas. This is evident in the solid sales performance for our tenants and for traffic to our centers. And while a deceleration perhaps has been expected by many, we are not seeing it. We remain really encouraged by the structural supply-demand trends that are supporting our business today. Our tenants continue to invest in brick-and-mortar stores that are profitable as a last mile distribution channel, and our suburban trade areas continue to thrive. And while we continue to create value through ground-up development, overall, there is very little new retail space being added in the U.S., supporting the value and scarcity of existing space.  That said, we do acknowledge that increased interest rates and significantly higher borrowing costs in the recent months do create uncertainty. First is the future to our earnings from refinancing next year's debt maturities. Our intentional strategy of maintaining low leverage and a ladder debt maturity schedule do act as mitigants to changes in rates, but we still expect to see an impact in 2024. The bottom line, though, is that in today's uncertain world, the one thing that we -- that I am certain about is that Regency remains well positioned. And this is a direct result of many attributes, one of which is our intentional portfolio composition. We believe the quality of our grocery-anchored neighborhood and community centers and the strength and demographics of our trade areas support durability of occupancy and create a wide buffer to insulate against potential economic impacts to our tenants and to our customers.  And another attribute is our strong balance sheet and liquidity position, including our significant free cash flow. With this, we have flexibility in our capital allocation decision-making and an ability to self-fund and maintain consistency in our value creation pipeline through economic cycles. And importantly, we can also continue to play offense and be opportunistic. All of this is what's enabled us to maintain our dividend through the pandemic and raised it again this quarter by another 3%. We're now up 15% from 2019. Alan? 
Alan Roth : Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. We continue to experience a very healthy retail environment as demonstrated by another quarter of strong operating results and demand for space in our centers remained robust. We increased our same-property lease rate by 20 basis points in the third quarter, even when factoring in roughly 25 basis points of impact from bankruptcy-related move-outs, primarily attributed to the remaining Bed Bath locations.  Our shop leasing activity has been at a record pace over the last several quarters, including above-average retention rates, resulting in another 50 basis point increase in our shop lease rate in the third quarter to a near record high of 93.2%. We were also able to generate solid re-leasing spreads again this quarter, 9% cash spread on a blended basis, including spreads of more than 20% on new leasing. Our straight-line rent spreads were above 17%, reflecting our keen focus on sustainable annual growth and our ability to consistently achieve contractual rent steps in the majority of our leases with annual steps often 3% or higher on our shop deals. Leasing progress continues to drive strength in our same property base rent growth which was more than 3% in the third quarter and remains our largest and most important contributor to same-property NOI growth. We continue to replenish our executed SNO pipeline as tenants open today, representing more than $36 million of annual incremental base rent, and our leasing pipelines remain full, supported by continued depth and negotiation activity. We are seeing strength in tenant demand across all of our regions and from a range of categories, including grocers, off-price, medical, restaurants, fitness, and pet services. In fact, at our former Bed Bath location, we've had one of the fastest absorption rates in recent memory as it relates to a material anchor liquidation. And while most of the new leases won't commence until the second half of 2024 or later, half of our vacated spaces have been executed with new tenants and the remainder of the space is in active negotiation. Based on our activity backfilling the rejected leases, we now expect rent spreads above 30% on average, exceeding our original projections.  In regard to the recent Rite Aid bankruptcy filing, we have 22 locations in total, representing 50 basis points of ABR. We had one store that was already dark, which was part of the initial rejection list and one more on the going out of business sale list. We are early in the process of this bankruptcy proceeding, but we feel really good about our exposure and the quality of our locations as a result of productive sales or below market rents. We know that tenant bankruptcies are a normal part of our business. And importantly, our high-quality shopping centers are well positioned to grow through it with better merchants, often at higher rents and driving greater traffic to our centers.  Lastly, as Lisa mentioned, the integration process with Urstadt Biddle has been progressing successfully. We're excited to welcome our new Regency team members in the Northeast and bring these high-quality assets into our portfolio where we are already having tremendous success on the leasing front. With this transaction, we further strengthened our best-in-class operating platform. Nick? 
Nicholas Wibbenmeyer : Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone. We had another productive quarter for development and redevelopment activity, increasing our starts year-to-date to $210 million. One of our Q3 starts is the $15 million redevelopment of Circle Marina Center in Southern California. Acquired in 2019 with the intention of redeveloping the center, the project includes the replacement of the existing Staples box with the new Sprouts Farmers Market in addition to extensive site improvements of the façade renovation, enhancements to the shop space in common areas. We continue to make great progress executing on our $440 million in-process pipeline and have seen tremendous activity on these projects, currently over 84% leased with blended returns of more than 8%.  As an example, at our ground-up Glenwood Green project in Old Bridge, New Jersey, the target in ShopRite buildings are substantially complete and on schedule to open this coming spring. Leasing momentum has been strong, we are now 92% preleased with a great tenant lineup, including Wawa, Shake Shack, Duck Donuts, Paris Baguette and Evolve Med Spa.  Now turning to acquisitions. While private transaction market activity remains then, we were able to source 2 unique opportunities to allocate capital and higher IRRs within our targeted trade areas. In September, we acquired Old Town Square within one of our joint venture partnerships, a high-performing center in dense Chicago neighborhood anchored by Jewel-Osco, the recent top grocer. This is a near urban asset with a suburban file layout located in a trade area with over 500,000 residents in a 3-mile radius. It is widely regarded as one of the premier grocery centers in the Chicago area.  In October, we closed on the acquisition of Nohl Plaza in Orange County, California. This Vons-anchored center provides a near-term value-add opportunity after redevelopment, resulting in an estimated IRR that will exceed 10%. As we look ahead, our teams remain focused on building our value creation pipeline, and we see the opportunity to start more than $1 billion of development and redevelopment projects over the next 5 years. Demand is strong among grocers and other retailers looking to grow their footprints in high-quality centers within attractive trade areas, coupled with the relative lack of new supply. We have the best development team in the business, and we continue to see a compelling opportunity to capitalize on this incremental demand at a time when we are one of the only developers with the capability to fund projects and execute.  And as we've discussed many times before, we have the ability to self-fund our growth pipeline without raising any incremental equity with free cash flow north of $160 million annually. We are sourcing these projects through the redevelopment of our existing assets, we're acquiring redevelopment opportunities like Circle Marina and Nohl Plaza, and we're partnering with landowners and expanding grocers as we seek new ground-up development projects. It's important to note, especially in this environment, that as we evaluate investment opportunities, our teams remain cognizant of today's higher cost of capital, and we are focused on ensuring appropriate risk-adjusted returns. It also gives us comfort that for the type of assets we are building and redeveloping, we meaningfully derisk our projects ahead of putting a shovel on the ground with significant pre-leasing, entitlements and bids for the majority of our cost in hand. Overall, we are excited about the investments we've made and by the opportunities we see ahead of us. Mike? 
Michael Mas : Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with highlights from our third quarter results, walk through a few changes to our guidance for the balance of this year, provide some comments on 2024 and finish by touching base on our balance sheet position.  We reported third quarter NAREIT FFO of $1.02 per share, which was impacted by $0.01 of EDP merger transition expenses and core operating earnings of $0.97 per share. We grew same-property NOI by 2.9% in the third quarter, excluding the impact of COVID period reserve collections and termination fees. Importantly, as Alan mentioned, the largest component of growth continues to be base ramp, contributing 320 basis points to our NOI growth rate in the quarter, driven by the combination of embedded rent steps, higher commenced occupancy and redevelopments coming online.  Turning to our revised current year guidance, I'll refer you to the detail on Slides 5 through 7 in our earnings presentation. Driven by another strong quarter of new leasing and continued high tenant retention, we've eliminated the bottom end of our prior same-property NOI growth range and are now guiding to finish the year at about 3.5%, excluding COVID period reserve collections and termination fees. We have also raised our per share core operating earnings guidance by $0.03 at the midpoint, driven primarily by the upward revision to same-property NOI, the expected accretion from the Urstadt Biddle transaction and changes to our acquisition and disposition assumptions. Comparably, we only raised our NAREIT FFO per share range by $0.01 primarily due to the offsetting impact of forecasted merger transition costs.  As we all start to plan for 2024 on Slide 8 of our earnings presentation, we provided some forward-looking considerations of certain nonrecurring items, including COVID period reserve collections and noncash impacts as well as summary details on the Urstadt Biddle merger accretion and related continuing transition expenses. While I won't belabor the details on today's call, we trust you'll find this disclosure very helpful, and we highly recommend you review it as we recognize there are many moving pieces to consider heading into next year. Additionally, given the higher interest rate environment and potential future refinancing impact, we want to provide as much transparency as possible as to how we are thinking about our financing plans next year.  These plans include an unsecured bond offering in the first half of 2024, sized in the $400 million to $450 million range with proceeds used to refinance scheduled debt maturities and to reduce our balances on our credit facility. We are proud of the strength of our balance sheet, which has been an intentional and foundational strategy of our company and is particularly important in times like today when for others, access to capital is more limited and pricing more volatile. Importantly, as Lisa mentioned, we are not immune to the adverse impact of higher rates but our overall low leverage, combined with a well-laddered maturity schedule helps mitigate the financing impacts for Regency in any given year. We feature one of the strongest balance sheets in the REIT sector with our leverage remaining at the low end of our targeted range of 5x to 5.5x debt-to-EBITDA. We continue to generate significant free cash flow, expected to be north of $160 million this year, self-funding our growing investments pipeline, and we have access to meaningful liquidity through our $1.25 billion line of credit. Given this foundation, we remain confidently on our front foot as we move forward.  With that, we're happy to take your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Michael Goldsmith from UBS. 
Michael Goldsmith : Can we just talk quickly about the moving pieces of the Urstadt Biddle transaction, any impact on the guidance next year and then also next year? It seems like the deal is a headwind in NAREIT FFO this year. And so maybe the fourth quarter FFO number isn't the best run rate for next year, but it's also positive in core operating earnings this year and next year, it should be a tailwind to both FFO and core operating earnings. Is that right, Mike? 
Michael Mas : I would encourage everyone to look at Page 8 of the supplement that we put out with our guidance considerations for next year. I think that would be very helpful. But I think you've actually outlined it pretty well in your question. It will be a positive contribution from a core perspective at the level of about 1.5% accretion. And we've given those components there on the slide. It's basically worth an incremental $0.04 to $0.05 per share in '24 versus' 23 and then the complexity that you're outlining would be in our NAREIT FFO line item as it relates to merger transition costs. We will have -- we'll end this year, we estimate in the $5 million area large portion of that coming through in the fourth quarter of this year. And then we are anticipating the trailing $7 million of those same expenses on a transition basis leaking into 2024. From a timing perspective there, I think it's fair to just pro rata spread of that $7 million through the year next year. 
Lisa Palmer : And I can't help but take this opportunity. I think it's a great opportunity to just reiterate what I said in my prepared remarks. It's been a short time. I mean we just closed in mid-August, but the integration and bringing the priorities and the people into Regency in that short period of time. It's just -- it has just really validated that this is a great transaction and a combination of 2 really good companies, and we're excited about it. 
Michael Mas : One last piece. Just to confirm, many have asked us about the noncash impacts from the purchase accounting, just -- it's in our materials, but I just want to confirm that there is no impact in 2024 as the revenues -- the noncash revenues are offsetting the noncash expenses. 
Michael Goldsmith : And my follow-up is on the lease escalators. It seems as though that's the lease of our same property NOI algorithm, it seems like you're getting 3% plus. I guess how quickly can in an elevated escalator environment, you've got the most exposure to small shop? How quickly can you kind of cycle too cycle through some of the older leases, which may have lower escalators and get these tenants on to higher escalators so that it slowly lifts your overall earnings growth or same-property NOI algorithm? 
Alan Roth : Yes, Michael, this is Alan. What I would say is that is a keen focus and has been for quite some time. And as you noted, I don't think you said the number, but 75% of our shop deal did have 3% or higher escalators and approximately 95% of our deals had escalators. So the team is constantly when given the opportunity to have a of this embedded rent step opportunity, we are implementing it. And so certainly, a keen focus. 
Operator: Next question is coming from Juan Sanabria from BMO Capital Markets. 
Eric Borden : It's Eric on for Juan. Maybe just starting with Old Town Squares, I just want to talk about -- maybe you could talk about the back story and maybe the opportunity set within the asset. And then is this maybe a potential indication to increase your presence into Illinois and potential other Midwest markets? 
Nicholas Wibbenmeyer : Eric, this is Nick. I appreciate the question. So starting off with Old Town per your question, yes, it's an asset we've been targeting for quite some time to have the ability to have a suburban layout and a near urban environment with a really high-quality grocer. And we've tracked that asset for so probably over a decade and just seen it perform year in and year out. And so it was 1 we were excited to have the opportunity to participate in the bid process. It was ultimately owned by an institutional owner that did have an end of their life to that whole period is our understanding, and so they were looking to liquidate it. And on the flip side, once we got control of it, one of our long-standing institutional partners that we've been partners with for nearly 20 years, did have the opportunity through our rotation to take an 80% stake and they exercise an opportunity given they were excited about the real estate as well. And so we were happy to get that one locked up and close this quarter.  In terms of your question on the Midwest, as you know, we're focused in all of our major markets that we have offices. So we are looking for those needles in the haystack. And I think the analogy I heard this week, and I kind of like it is instead of the normal deal flow, there's drips of water out there. And so we are evaluating each of the drips of water in all of the major markets that we do business in. and the ones that, as we've always said, are equally accretive to our quality and growth and/or and accretive to earnings, we're going to act on. We have the ability to act on. And so whether it be in the Midwest or the coastal markets, we're focused on investing our capital where it makes sense. 
Eric Borden : Okay. That's helpful. And maybe one on the SNO pipeline. Of the $36 million, how much is that related to Bed Bath? And then how should we think about the cadence that coming online through '23 and '24? 
Michael Mas : Eric, $1.5 million of that $36 million is Bed Bath. I'll add to this. Interestingly, we did add $3 million of UBP portfolio SNO pipeline to that number as well in the quarter. And from a cadence perspective, about 80% of that pipeline will come online through the end of next year. 
Operator: Next question today is coming from Lizzy Doykan from Bank of America. 
Lizzy Doykan: I just wanted to follow up on the cap rate that we closed on for the Chicago asset and maybe if this is an indication for where you see cap rates trending for quality grocery-anchored centers today? And then separately, if you could confirm the pricing on Nohl Plaza. I know that deal is quite different, given the redevelopment opportunity, but would love to hear more of the back story on that as well. 
Lisa Palmer : I'll take the first part and then I'll pass it to Nick for Nohl Plaza. I love Nick's analogy. I actually didn't hear that this week, and we were together. So I'm not certain where he heard it. But there really are drips of water and not deal flow. So it's really difficult to say that the cap rate on Chicago is a read-through to cap rates. We're there's-- the transaction market is still just really in. And we did have -- we think of it -- and I said it in my prepared remarks, really is more of a needle in a haystack. The most important thing, and Mike said this, and you've heard me say it many times, we generate a significant amount of free cash flow and we have that cash flow prioritized to go through our development and our redevelopments. But to the extent that we have excess cash flow, not allocated to that, we have the ability to be opportunistic. And that's what you're seeing us do. And that's what we did with the Chicago asset as well as Nohl Plaza. So I'll pass it to Nick for Nohl. 
Nicholas Wibbenmeyer : Great question regarding Nohl, very different profiles in old town. And so Nohl was owned by a tick that had owned it for decades, ultimately got to the point where the tick wanted to divest. And take their money and move it elsewhere. And so given it was owned by a tick as most tick situation, not a lot of capital invested over those years. And so a great opportunity for us to use our platform in Southern California come in. We love the real estate. We love the fundamentals of it, but it definitely needs a reinvestment, and that's an opportunity for us. And so we -- although you see the cap rate there when you do the math is lower than a standard acquisition. Given the redevelopment we expect to do near term and the investment we expect to make, we do expect the IRR to be north of 10%. And so we're really excited about using our redevelopment expertise to shine that asset up and put into the operating portfolio for a long time to come. 
Lizzy Doykan: Great. That's helpful. And second, just looking at your page on net effective rents from the supplement, it looks like the composition of new leases signed for small shop trended down quarter-to-quarter, closer in line with anchor leases signed. I guess, first, is that a function of moderating demand from small shop, what may be more of a fair composition to think about in signing new leases. And then second, what's more realistic as to how much further you can push on the small shop lease rate, given it's reached a near record high? 
Alan Roth : Liz, this is Alan. Thank you for the follow-up question. So no, it is not indicative of any market noise whatsoever. It can be a bit lumpy quarter-over-quarter, as you know. And you said it, yes, there were more anchor transactions in Q3 than we had in prior quarter. And so that certainly is what drove that. Regarding shop lease rate, I was laughing, but dead serious when we were having a conversation amongst the company records are meant to be broken. And so I really believe in the team we have, the portfolio that we've got. And so we are certainly focused on the shop side, although at the 93% mark right now, being able to do our best to continue to drive that. So excited to watch and see what the team can do. 
Lisa Palmer : The environment, as you've heard us say, and you've heard all of our peers is really healthy today and the demand in our sector is really strong. And we've reiterated the structural tailwinds we have, they're still there. The post-pandemic, hybrid work, limited new supply and just the renewed appreciation from both the customers, the shoppers themselves and the retailers on the physical presence. And we are still benefiting from those tailwinds. So I do believe that this record is there to be broken. 
Operator: Next question is coming from Greg McGinniss from Scotiabank. 
Viktor Fediv : This is Victor Fediv on for Greg McGinnis. And so now that you started integration of UBP portfolio and given your scale and relationship with current tenants, I assume you already had some conversations regarding expansion into newly acquired properties. So do you have a vision of what would be, let's call it, the agency impact on UBPs portfolio occupancy within the next, say, 6 or 12 months? And how it translates into the combined occupancy impact? 
Michael Mas : I'm happy to take that one, and Alan can provide some color on the integration momentum and what you've seen within the portfolio in particular. The thesis of the merger is the same as well, this is a leasing exercise for us with a portfolio of very high-quality shopping centers in very high-quality trade areas. That look very similar to what Regency invested in for the last 60 years of our company's existence. We saw an opportunity of a 200 basis points plus or minus differential in percent lease between the 2 portfolios at the time of the merger announcement. And our eyes are set on closing that gap. We don't see any inherent reason with the assets themselves or the trade areas within their -- that they exist. That gap should exist. We think that the portfolio should slowly and over the next several years come to the same lease rate as the legacy Regency portfolio. And to your point on when, this isn't going to be an overnight impact on absorbing that 200 basis points of differential. But we do -- we've gotten off to a really good start. We really appreciate the integration efforts that are ongoing within the team to Lisa's comments earlier. And Alan will take it from here, but I think we're pretty excited about the prospects. 
Alan Roth : Yes. I think Mike articulated it quite well. Our #1 goal is a very intentional approach to leasing. But we're also thinking about how can some redevelopments in the future be unlocked. And the near term, we recently executed a Dunkin ground lease where we're going to create a pad out in one of the parking locks of our shopping centers. So there are certainly opportunities like that the team is focused on. But in sort of the medium to long term, I think there's also the opportunity to evaluate some redevelopment opportunities. But we had some interesting spaces that right around the closing of the merger were there. David's Bridal was in bankruptcy and the team has already executed to replace that space. We had a large vacant former Barnes & Noble, and we brought in a phenomenal local multi-store operator of illicit brewing a craft beer concept that the community is super excited about. Again, we've gotten that solved. And so the team is really hyper focused on the shop leasing side. And as Lisa mentioned, I am most excited about the great people that have been integrated, but the platform, I think, really will pay dividends long term as well. 
Viktor Fediv : And probably as a quick follow-up. You already mentioned that there are probably some attractive redevelopment opportunities within that portfolio. So given where interest rates are now what would be our kind of target IRR and for redevelopments and acquisitions in developers you mentioned, if you have an ex capital that you can deploy? 
Lisa Palmer : For those of you that remember records, I'm always going to sound like a broken record because yes, we acknowledge, obviously, our cost of capital, we acknowledge that our cost of capital has increased. But again, free cash flow and the best development platform in the business, and we have proven our ability to execute and create value through cycles. And the only thing I would reiterate that Nick already said once, and this is where the broken record comes in, to the extent that we can invest capital that is going to be in shopping centers that are at least neutral but accretive to our quality, accretive to our future growth rate and accretive to our earnings, we're going to do it. And I believe that, that is a competitive advantage for us, and it is something that we're going to -- again, from my prepared remarks, we're going to continue to play offense and be opportunistic and do that when we can. 
Operator: Next question is coming from Ron Kamdem from Morgan Stanley. 
Ronald Kamdem : Just a couple of quick ones. Just staying on the development front, I see the $440 million, but in the presentation, you have another sort of $80 million at the midpoint in the next 12 to 18 months. Just on that $80 million, can you talk about are those pre-leased? Is there a sort of interest there? And what would it take to start those maybe sooner rather than later on your thinking? 
Nicholas Wibbenmeyer : Appreciate the question, Ron. This is Nick. So you're absolutely right. We are hyper-focused, as Lisa has said, and we've been vocal about it continuing to lean into our development and redevelopment pipeline. And so the teams are very active in doing exactly sort of what you laid out and what I laid out in my prepared remarks, which is derisking these as much as we possibly can before we put a shelf older ground. And so there is great tenant demand out there. So some of these deals we're just finalizing leases to get them released appropriately. We are very thoughtful of making sure we have our arms around costs and some of these deals we're finalizing cost. And then some of them are in our last legs of entitlements that we're finalizing. And so once we check those boxes is when we put a shovel on the ground, and we are excited about what we're seeing in our pipeline of continued opportunities to use all of the tools in our tool belt to our advantage in these market conditions. And so do you expect to continue to talk about some great opportunities quarter in and quarter out. 
Ronald Kamdem : Great. And then my last one is just on the 2024 considerations are just -- are super, super helpful. If I could just ask just 2 more. So one is just on bad debt, how is it trending this year? And given the opening comments, it doesn't seem like there's any reason we should think that should be different in '24. And then the last one is just on interest costs. Is there anything in '24 debt maturities or anything that we should be mindful of? 
Michael Mas : Ron, really, first, I appreciate the comments you made on the disclosure. The team did a phenomenal job with that and glad you appreciate it. Let me speak a little bit to those 2 line items from a '24 outlook perspective. Happy to give some color. Also, I want to be sure to say there's more to come when we put out our full suite of guidance and the full package as you're accustomed to, which we'll do in -- when we guide in February. The -- from a credit loss perspective, our outlook hasn't changed for the balance of this year, right? So from a full year perspective, we've affirmed the 60 to 90 basis point impact for full credit loss, which includes both bad debt expense or uncollectible lease income, together with the lost rents associated with bankruptcies. To your question on ULI or bad debt, our historical run rate is about 50 basis points. We will do better than that in '23, largely due to the first quarter of the year, and we've talked about this on that call, where we had from a cash basis tenancy, we had an unusually high collection rate where they just were paying some very late billings in that quarter. All of that's translating to a lower than average historical run rate.  So -- and when I think about the second half of the year, it's actually kind of trending back to historical averages. So I would -- our eyesight kind of looking into '24 is going to probably start in that area of our historical averages of 50 basis points. I'm also happy you mentioned interest expense in my remarks, I did try to lay out what our plans include looking into next year, but let me just go through them again. Roughly $400 million to $450 million of planned financing activity. We need to refinance the $250 million bond that matures in June. Recall that, that's at a 3.75% interest rate today. We have some mortgages that are maturing next year. There's one larger mortgage that's roughly $80 million. So we'll add that to our financing plan. And then recall that we have the transaction expenses from the merger with UPP that we will also fold into that transaction activity. All in all, that's $400 million to $450 million of needs and we see where the treasury is running at the moment, which is running in our favor.  And just to give you a sense of where we think our indicative spreads are, we're probably in the mid-6s, plus or minus, and again, depending on where the base rates go from here and how our spreads have contract or expand from this point forward. But we feel really good about our ability to execute really efficiently in the capital markets, and it will just be a matter of our timing selection and where rates end up. 
Operator: Our next question today is coming from Samir Khanal from Evercore ISI. 
Samir Khanal : So my question is more on the anchor side. You talked a lot of talk a lot about sort of limited supply, demand is still strong. But is there an opportunity to even push rents higher here upon renewals with anchors maybe from a mark-to-market opportunity or even higher rent bumps. Clearly, that's not happening overnight. But I guess, how are those conversations going with anchors today? 
Alan Roth : Samir, this is Alan. Thank you for the question. The answer is yes. Where we stand today, we have north of 50 anchor leases that do expire without options over the next 3 years. And so certainly, the team is hyper aware of for those that need to stay making sure that we're getting the appropriate market rent for those and where we can upgrade tenancy, we will certainly do that. So there is that opportunity. Demand remains strong. I think that's largely driven by a lack of supply. And as we look at our Bed Bath resolutions, as I said in my remarks, the speed to getting those executed was faster, frankly, than we anticipated, and it's with some great retailers, REI, Restoration Hardware Outlet, Burlington, just to name a few, were some of the deals that we've already signed. And so there is a pretty deep pool right now with the supply and demand scenario is certainly working to our advantage. 
Samir Khanal : Right. I mean, I usually think about -- when you think about anchors, they usually pay lower rents, right? So I'm saying, is the industry ready to get to a point where they start to start to come up and start to pay market rents that are even higher than where they are today. That's sort of my question. So I guess you're starting to... 
Alan Roth : Yes, Samir. The answer is yes. I would just take you back again using real-time the Bed-bath as an example, we're exceeding 30% mark-to-market on the deals that we've signed. And so I think from that perspective, that would definitively tell you, yes, as we sit here today, we are able to drive those spaces to a much higher market rent than that of what's in place. 
Samir Khanal : Got it. And I guess on this -- the rent spreads, the 30% you talked about, I mean, how should we think about the CapEx involvement to get that 30%, I guess? 
Alan Roth : So Samir, I would say capitals in general relative to shop leasing have stayed pretty neutral. We're not seeing much in the way of enhanced capital there. I will say on the anchor leasing front, you do find that capital tend to be a little bit more expensive. But as you noted, the 30% obviously is the GAAP rent spreads that we experienced. And I think the balance of that embedded rent steps as being a keen focus is the success we're having right now. 
Operator: Next question today is coming from Craig Mailman from Citi. 
Craig Mailman : I want to go back to the transaction market. It's helpful, the 10% or north of 10% IRR on the asset you bought in the quarter. But I'm just trying to see kind of where your return requirements have trended with rates going higher on something that's more of a core asset versus a redevelopment opportunity like this? And your appetite for going into a lower initial cap rate knowing that there's upside acknowledging the fact that you guys offer a good amount of free cash flow a year. So just thinking about your weighted average cost of capital and how you're kind of putting that all in the pot and kind of thinking about it? 
Lisa Palmer : Yes. And I'm just going to reiterate what I said before. We do look at our cost of capital and our cost of capital does inform and basically dictate what our required returns are. And to the extent that we can invest our capital and we look at something like Nohl Plaza, that is -- it is a redevelopment. It is like our development pipelines. And yes, they take time to get to the total return, but we're looking at the total return IRR and to the extent that we can invest our capital on an accretive basis and ensure that we are being paid appropriately for any risk reward, if you will, core versus ground-up development we look at all of it and accretive to our future growth rate, accretive to our quality and accretive to earnings. And if it checks those boxes, then we're going to do it. 
Craig Mailman : I mean do you guys have like a lower threshold than where unlevered returns need to be for the deal to kind of move forward investment to me? Or is it fuel by deal? 
Lisa Palmer : Again, if it exceeds our cost of capital and especially for our core acquisition, that works for us. 
Craig Mailman : Okay. And then just separately on the leasing, everyone is talking about really good demand across the board. And I'm just kind of curious from your viewpoint being going through cycles before. Are you feeling comfortable with the expansion plans of retailers? Do you think some of them are expanding too quickly or just the lack of availability is maybe amplifying how good things feel relative to kind of the activity going on in your portfolio? Just kind of thoughts around that versus sort of the normal cycle. 
Lisa Palmer : I'll take it from a higher level perspective and to the extent you would like to color it up at the end. I mean, generally speaking, there are higher borrowing costs for everyone, and that includes our tenants. And I don't have a crystal ball. I'm not certain what the future holds. I can tell you, right now, we have not seen a slowdown in demand. Could higher borrowing costs and higher cost of capital for tenants slow their expansion plans? Possibly. But even if it does, we own high-quality real estate and some of the best real estate. Slowing it doesn't mean it's grinding to a halt and I am really confident that we will continue to capture new stores and expansion plans of retailers. 
Alan Roth : Yes, Craig, the only thing I would add is whether in good times or bad times, we refer to our 3 pillars of merchandising, place making and connecting to the community, and we're always taking an intentional approach to that, and always proactively and intensely managing these assets. And so we don't just sign the leases to sign leases, right? We are diving into operating experience, creditworthiness, synergistic enhancement to the overall assets. So I think with that mindset, it works in good times are bad. 
Craig Mailman : Okay. I guess I was coming up from the standpoint of -- do you feel like there's anyone that's expanding too quickly given what's going on in the macro? Or does it still feel people are appropriately kind of size of the opportunity for the long term? 
Alan Roth : Let me kind of talk through some of the retailers that we're doing business right now. As I think about off-price TJX, Burlington, Five Below, we're doing a lot of business with them. They're fantastic. If you think about QSRs, First Watch and Cava relatively new public companies, Mendocino Farms, Philz Coffee, phenomenal. And I think they're very deliberate in their approach as well and great operators with strong sales performance. If you lean into the franchise concepts, we're doing a lot of business with the likes of [Sam Hound] or the Stretch Zones of the world. Again, they're putting really good operators in there, and we're seeing great success at that level. So all I can do, Craig, is look at the retailers we're doing business with, look at their volumes and sort of the productivity of where they are and look at the operators when it is a franchise concept. And I can just tell you, as we sit here today, I think they're making the right decisions. And I think our team is making the right decisions in partnering with those operators. 
Operator: Your next question today is coming from Ki Bin Kim from Truist Securities. 
Ki Bin Kim : So certain retailers have highlighted potential consumer weakness trend even the grocers. So just from your vantage point, I was wondering if you saw any discernible trends from your consumers however you want to slice and dice that. 
Lisa Palmer : We have not seen anything to date. And again, do believe that our sector while not completely immune is more resistant, and I hear you from the grocers, but the grocers have been experiencing pretty strong comp sales across the board. And so instead of growing at 8%, they're now growing at 3%. They're still growing. So we are not seeing that yet and expect, again, given the property type, the necessity, the value the convenience we feel really well positioned and resistant to potential economic adverse impacts in addition to the trade areas in which we operate. 
Ki Bin Kim : Okay. And a quick one for my... 
Lisa Palmer : Tend to be -- sorry, go ahead. 
Ki Bin Kim : For Mike, you mentioned that the bond that you might raise next year would be in the mid-6s. I was curious, is that based on like last week's treasury or this week? 
Lisa Palmer : Based on yesterday's. 
Michael Mas : Our indicative spreads are 180. So 180, 185 plus or minus on where the treasury is and it's been moving around pretty rapidly. So it's looking better, Keith, maybe a little bit hesitant to declare victory here. But we're actively and very acutely monitoring the markets. We're going to execute when we see a really good opportunity for Regency to have a good execution. There's no -- we can be patient. We only have 20% of our overall debt maturing over the next 2 years. So to the comments we made upfront, we're as well positioned as we can be even in a higher rate environment, given all the work we did over the last decade from how much debt we carry to when it matures. No one's losing sleep here over this year's execution and transaction activity, and we're going to act when it's -- when the window is there. 
Operator: Next question is coming from Linda Tsai from Jefferies. 
Linda Tsai : I know you don't normally disclose retention ratios, but just wondering if you're running at peak or have even exceeded peak retention? 
Michael Mas : We're basically at slightly above average retention rates. I think we're in the 80% area. Is that right? And that's a little bit of a tick up on top of what our historical average is. 
Linda Tsai : And then in terms of the purchase accounting impact, that you outlined on Page 8, noncash revenues and noncash expenses fully offsetting each other next year. In 2025 and beyond, how would those impacts flow through? 
Michael Mas : Interesting. It's going to -- for '25, I would fair to say it's going to continue to balance each other out. It's interesting. The weighted average life of that debt mark-to-market is significantly shorter than the weighted average life of the lease mark-to-market, Linda. So there is a point in time when that the debt mark will burn off prior to the leases, but it's not in the next 2 years. 
Operator: Next question is coming from Mike Mueller from JPMorgan. 
Michael Mueller : Two questions. First, the small shops, 93.2% leased. I'm curious, where is that on a commenced basis? And then a second question. I know you haven't had [indiscernible] long, but how is the leasing of the smaller centers in the buildings going from an efficiency standpoint compared to what you thought heading into the transaction? 
Alan Roth : I'll start on the second question. Mike, this is Alan. So it's working well. And I think a lot of that is back to Lisa's comment of not just the integration of the portfolio, but the integration of a lot of great people -- so their people had intimate knowledge of some of the smaller assets that you're referencing. And just across the board, we've felt really great about the activity that's going on. and the integration process. And so we're not seeing any differentiation of challenges or successes based on the asset at all, just in general, I think it's the rising tide with what you're hearing across the totality of the portfolio. 
Michael Mas : And just in from the stats department, 89.5% on the commenced shop rate at the end of the quarter. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Paulina Rojas from Green Street. 
Paulina Rojas: As you highlighted you have a muted exposure to Ride Aid, but pharmacies are a material tenant of yours as a group, especially the -- well, the industry has been shrinking for a while. And to my knowledge, confirming some writing about, you haven't been impacted by closures -- significant closures thus far. But what is your strategy looking forward for the industry as a whole? And given the size what tenant categories come to minus best backfield for the space? 
Lisa Palmer : I'll start, and then I'll let Alan finish it up especially addressing the latter part of that question. But just generally speaking, when we think about pharmacy exposure, and I know some of you have heard me say this in prior meetings, and there's probably many of you that are on this call that didn't live through this. But I was with Regency when all drug stores were in line, and we had a lot of them and they moved out of line and moved out to outparcels, and we were able to replace them, and we were able to replace them at better rents. Now that they're mostly on outparcels, it's some of the best real estate in our shopping centers. And while, again, I believe that we have some of the highest quality real estate in the country, and we tend to have lesser locations or fewer locations when retailers do closed stores. But even when we do, it's an opportunity for us to re-lease. And as one of the questions earlier, address those anchor -- even junior anchor rents tend to have longer leases. And the rents will move and when we are not able to get access to them, that gives us access to the opportunity to market to market. And given the location and the quality of the real estate, even within our shopping centers, we will replace it with really good tenants. 
Alan Roth : Yes. And Paulina, I would add to that. So we have locations. And as you mentioned, one was on the rejection list that we're aware of and one more was on the going out of business list. But I think just to speak to the quality of the real estate and how the team thinks and I tip my hat to our West Coast team, we're not sitting back waiting for these spaces to come back. We do have one deal that naturally expires in May. We haven't heard yet whether Rite Aid wants to reject it or not. But we have executed a lease already at a triple-digit rent spread. We love those low single-digit rents. And so that happens to be with a hardware store. So as you think about retailers that are willing to go in there, it's hardware, so the home improvement, cosmetics, grocers, we may have a few that could make sense if we get access to them where we would split them and do some multi-tenant deals. But I think there's various different ways we can go. And as Lisa mentioned, these are some really good end caps or prominent locations. Some of them have drive-throughs. So there's a lot of different tools in the playbook based on the unit itself. 
Paulina Rojas: Very detailed answer. And then on the transaction market, I know you have said there is no real deal flow. But given the rise of interest rates, I'm trying to put together the few transactions that have closed. How do you think the bid for strips has changed since last quarter at the margin? And we don't want to provide a numerical answer qualitatively. How has the dynamic changed? So has the market reacted to higher rates? 
Lisa Palmer : Yes. I don't know that it's changed much at all since last quarter. It's changed, I think, from the -- in the beginning of the year, if you were to go back and read our transcripts, we were starting to feel better and thought that there was more clarity to the stabilization of interest rates, which would then reduce. There's still a bid ask spread because there's really -- there's -- I think it's clear that there's a disconnect between public market pricing and private market pricing. And that is going to continue as long as that we have the volatility that we have with interest rates and borrowing costs, which is why I'm really proud of the total return needles in the haystack that we were able to find this quarter. I don't think the dynamic has changed at all. It's still just a drip. 
Operator: We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Lisa for any further or closing comments. 
Lisa Palmer : Kevin, appreciate that. Thank you. Thank you all for your interest. Have a good weekend, and enjoy your extra hour of sleep or however you intend to use it. Thanks all. 
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-08-04 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Regency Centers Corporation Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce to you, Christy McElroy, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets. Thank you, Christy. Please go ahead.

Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Christy. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us. We again had a really strong quarter, in fact, one of the strongest and most active quarters in Regency’s history. Our success came from all facets of the business, including leasing, development starts and, of course, the Urstadt Biddle merger announcement in May. I said many times since we emerged from the pandemic, that Regency is so well positioned for sustained growth and that we’re on our front foot ready to capitalize on opportunities. Our achievements in the second quarter reflect this. They reflect the exceptional work of our team, supported by the strength of our portfolio, the current retail environment and our balance sheet position. As we all know, there is still uncertainty in the macroeconomic landscape, but at Regency, we’ve not seen any signs of softening. As evidenced by our results, the fundamentals of our business remain very healthy and operating trends are strong. From a leasing perspective, tenant demand is robust, and the second quarter was one of our strongest quarters ever, and it’s supported by sustained momentum in our LOI and lease negotiation pipelines. Tenant bankruptcies are playing out as we expected, but importantly, our exposure to these retailers is limited. From a capital allocation perspective, most of you know that we have been acutely focused on ramping our development and redevelopment activity back to our strategic goal of a pace of $200 million to $250 million of average annual investment. I’m really proud and gratified by the success demonstrated by such a strong second quarter for new project starts. Nick will discuss our activity in more detail, but creating value through development and redevelopment has always been a core competency of Regency, and it is a competitive advantage for us that is often overlooked. As I’ve said before, I believe we have the best team and platform in the business. And with ground-up development, we can really move the needle in an environment where new supply of high-quality centers is lacking. Even as we ramp our activity, our pipeline will continue to be self-funded on a leverage-neutral basis with free cash flow, driving accretion and a sustainable component of our earnings growth above and beyond the organic same-property NOI growth that are high quality, well-located properties are generating. With regard to Urstadt Biddle, we’re proud of this transaction and are excited to integrate both the shopping centers and many of their people into Regency. These centers align so well with our own and meaningfully expand our presence in these strong trade areas in the Northeast. The teams on both sides are working hard to effect an efficient and timely merger close. As Mike will discuss, we expect it to be immediately accretive to our core operating earnings, and we also look forward to unlocking value within the combined portfolio under the umbrella of our leading national leasing and asset management platform. Another highlight of the quarter was the release of our annual corporate responsibility report in late May. This report is a synthesis of our commitment to ESG and the many initiatives driving us forward. We are extremely proud of the progress that we continue to make towards achieving our long-term goals. The principles of our program are embodied throughout our organization and are integral to achieving our strategic and financial objectives. Before I turn it over to Alan, I’ll reiterate that Regency is very well positioned in this environment given the strength of our assets, the trade areas in which we operate, supported by the solid fundamentals of the grocery-anchored suburban shopping center business today. Our liquidity and balance sheet position will allow us to remain opportunistic driving sustainable cash flow growth going forward. Alan?
Alan Roth: Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. We continue to benefit from a strong retail environment as demonstrated by another quarter of fantastic operating results, particularly on the leasing side. New leasing volume year-to-date is 40% above our historical average. And in the second quarter, we achieved our highest shop new leasing volume in over 10 years. As a result, we increased our shop lease rate by another 60 basis points sequentially to 92.7%. Our overall same-property lease rate is up 10 basis points in the second quarter despite 60 basis points of occupancy loss due to bankruptcy, further validating the strength and quality of our portfolio. Exceptional second quarter leasing activity also came with strong cash rent spreads of 12% on a blended basis and nearly 30% on new leasing. Our continued success with contractual rent steps is reflected in our GAAP rent spreads of 20% on a blended basis. This strength in our operating trends helped us drive another successful quarter for same-property base rent and NOI growth. Tenant demand is coming from a broad range of categories, including but not limited to grocers, off-price, medical, restaurants and pet services. Our signed but not occupied pipeline represents over $30 million of annual incremental base rent, and our same-property occupancy spread remains wide at 250 basis points. Even as executed leases commence each quarter, we continue to replenish our SNO pipeline with the execution of new deals. As we look ahead, our leasing pipelines remain full, with another 1 million square feet under LOI and lease negotiation. Our second quarter activity did include a mix of larger space deals with longer lease terms, which resulted in elevated per square foot leasing CapEx. But importantly, net effective rents remain in line with our historical average. With regard to backfilling our former Bed Bath & Beyond spaces, we are executing our vision and making excellent leasing progress. You’ll recall that our exposure at the time of the bankruptcy filing a quarter ago was 50 basis points of ABR. Two of our locations were purchased at auction by Burlington and Michael, and we have fully executed leases on three additional spaces. We have significant interest on the remaining spaces and our team is actively negotiating with multiple prospects, including the in-process pursuit of redevelopment projects at a couple of the locations. Overall, we anticipate marking the market our rent by approximately 20% to 25% on average for our former Bed Bath stores. As we’ve noted previously, we feel confident in our ability to re-lease our high-quality real estate when tenant bankruptcies occur often at higher rents and upgraded tenancy. In closing, we recognize that our success in the second quarter is not only reflective of the current environment and the strength of our assets but of the hard work of our best-in-class leasing and operating team. We see that momentum continuing as we work in the coming months to integrate Urstadt Biddle’s people and high-quality properties and create even more value through the combined portfolio. Nick?
Nicholas Wibbenmeyer: Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone. We had a very productive and gratifying quarter for development and redevelopment activity. We started several exciting new projects and made great progress on leasing and construction across our $400 million in-process pipeline while maintaining costs, returns and timing consistent with our underwriting. We also continue to build our future pipeline of projects and see meaningful opportunities for incremental investment. In the second quarter, we started 12 new development and redevelopment projects totaling $175 million. That is an impressive amount for Regency, and I’d like to thank our development teams for their efforts. As these projects start to reflect years of hard work behind the scenes, getting us ready to commence construction at these sites. The first project I’d like to highlight is Sunbelt. The $90 million Whole Foods anchored ground-up development on Long Island that we spoke about last quarter. The properties in Holberg, New York and located on the heavily trafficked east-west artery of Sunrise Highway, which is the dominant retail corridor in the market. Construction commenced on the 170,000 square foot center in May, and we anticipate Whole Foods opening in 2025. We already have signed leases with Starbucks as well as Citibank and have seen significant leasing interest from many other best-in-class retailers. In the second quarter, we also started Phase 3 of our redevelopment of Serramonte in Daly City. This project will allow us to transform the Northeast quadrant of the property, including the redevelopment of the former JCPenney space with a world-class Asian food market as well as the development of 2 new small shop buildings adjacent to Macy’s. We continue to see significant demand throughout all components of this asset and look forward to even more value creation in the future. We also commenced redevelopment of our Whole Foods anchor, Mandarin Landing in Jacksonville, which will include a new 25,000 square foot Baptist Health Medical Center, additional shop space and a new 2-tenant pad building. In addition to the development and redevelopment starts, I’m appreciative and proud of the work our teams have done completing 5 projects during the second quarter, which will collectively contribute more than $5 million of annual rental NOI. The largest of these projects was our $55 million redevelopment of the Crossing Clarendon in Arlington, Virginia, where our leasing and construction teams did an amazing job further solidifying the asset at the center of gravity in the Rosslyn-Ballston corridor. The project is now 100% leased with an incredible tenant mix, including a new state-of-the-art flagship lifetime, which had a very successful opening a few weeks ago. Looking ahead, our teams are laser-focused on sourcing new investment opportunities. These include redevelopments within our existing portfolio as well as new ground-up development projects. The 3 cornerstones of Regency’s development strategy, our capabilities, our capital and our contacts are more relevant than ever in the current environment. Our leading grocers continue to expand, and we are one of the few developers that have the ability to help them execute on their desire to locate with a new high-quality shopping centers throughout the country. We continue to build our pipeline to achieve our strategic objective of more than $1 billion of project starts over the next 5 years of our expertise and our long-standing relationships, combined with our access to capital, uniquely position us to capitalize on opportunities. Mike?
Michael Mas: Thanks Nick, and good morning, everyone. I’ll start with highlights from our second quarter results, walk through a few changes to our current year earnings guidance, provide some estimates for accretion related to our pending Urstadt Biddle merger and finish with some comments on our balance sheet position. We grew same-property NOI by 3.6% in the second quarter after excluding the impact of COVID period reserve collections. Importantly, the largest driver of growth continues to be base rent, contributing 380 basis points to the NOI growth rate in the quarter. As we’ve continued to stress on previous calls, base rent growth is the most important indicator of our portfolio’s performance. And in Q2, our growth was driven by the combination of embedded resets, positive re-leasing spreads, growth in occupancy and redevelopments coming online. Turning to 2023 guidance. As always I’ll refer you to the helpful detail on Slides 5 through 7 in our earnings presentation. Driven by another strong quarter of leasing, incredibly strong, if I may add, and greater clarity around the current operating environment and bankruptcy impact, we’ve raised the bottom end of our same-property NOI growth range as well as our ranges for NAREIT FFO and core operating earnings. With more certainty at the margin, we have eliminated some previous downside scenarios. Our updated same-property NOI growth range is now 3% to 3.5%. While we’ve maintained our total credit loss assumption at 60 to 90 basis points, we now expect a greater contribution from average commenced occupancy, benefiting from strong shop leasing through the first half of the year and absorption more than offsetting the negative impact from bankruptcy closings. Same-property NOI is the primary driver of the $0.01 increase in the midpoint of our core operating earnings guidance range. With the Bed Bath auction behind us and the outcome of those stores now known, we now have clarity on impact from the acceleration of below-market rents tied to those locations. For the full year, we anticipate roughly $6 million of accelerated below-market rent within our non-cash guidance, about half of which has been recognized year-to-date. Our full year non-cash guidance also includes $3.5 million of expected impact from the reinstatement of straight-line rent associated with the conversion of cash basis tenants back to accrual up slightly from a quarter ago. As a result, we’ve raised our assumption for noncash items to plus or minus $37.5 million, positively impacting our NAREIT FFO range, the midpoint of which is up $0.02. For those that are undoubtedly starting to think about 2024, we consider both of these items, combining for $9 million to $10 million of noncash revenue this year to be non-recurring in nature. And speaking of non-recurring items, our guidance for COVID reserve collections for 2023 remains unchanged at $4 million. As we thankfully reached the last of our collections on deferral agreements, and with only 5% of our tenants on a cash basis of accounting today, we are not currently anticipating any material COVID period collections to recur in 2024. These updated guidance ranges and the details I just reviewed remain on a Regency stand-alone basis only and do not yet factor in any impacts from the Urstadt Biddle transaction, which we expect to close by the end of this month. We will provide updated current year guidance with more detailed assumptions on a pro forma basis when we report our third quarter results, so more to come. But in the meantime, we are prepared to offer a high-level outlook. Our expectation is to deliver incremental per share core operating earnings accretion of $0.01 in 2023, reflecting about 4 months of impact and plus or minus 1.5% accretion for the full year of 2024, which continues to include an estimated $9 million of annual G&A cost synergies. Importantly, this accretion estimate is for core operating earnings, not NAREIT FFO as it does not include any impact to noncash items. The teams are making excellent progress with integration prep, and we’re all excited for the merger closing and the future prospects of the combined company. I’ll finish by highlighting the strength of our balance sheet, which is the foundation of our capital allocation strategy. With one of the strongest balance sheets in the overall REIT sector, our leverage remains at the low end of our targeted range of 5 to 5.5 times debt-to-EBITDA and will remain so following the close of Urstadt Biddle merger. We are generating significant free cash flow, expected to approach $150 million this year, self-funding our growing investment pipeline that Nick highlighted previously. And we have access to meaningful liquidity through our $1.25 billion line of credit with less than 10% of our total debt maturing through the end of 2024. I can’t stress enough the importance of our balance sheet strength and allowing us maximum flexibility throughout economic cycles and providing us an ability to remain opportunistic as the team executes on our investment strategy. With that, we look forward to taking your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
Craig Mailman: Hey good morning. Lisa, I just wanted to touch base on the transaction market. Clearly, I know you guys have UBA in the pipeline here. But a lot of your peers have been talking about maybe a little bit of a swing [Ph] in the acquisition market. I’m just kind of curious what you guys are seeing if there’s even an appetite to buy one-offs or if the focus now is just on redevelopment pertaining within the portfolio and what you guys are going to bring into the portfolio after the merger closes?
Lisa Palmer: Yes. I appreciate the question, Craig, but my first order of business is going to be to toss that to Nick.
Nicholas Wibbenmeyer: Good morning, Craig. I appreciate the question as well. So yes, as you guys have been hearing and seeing close activity definitely still remains then, but there’s no question. We’re seeing the pace of opportunities coming to market accelerating and that bid-ask spread is tightening. And so we are starting to see data points come up somewhere in the range of low 6s to 7 on a cap rate. But on certain deals, we’re seeing them definitely even drop below 6 depending on the growth rate and the size. And so we are actively pursuing these opportunities, underwriting them, understanding them. And as always, if we see an opportunity that we think is equal or accretive to our quality and growth rate and accretive to our earnings, then we’re ready to move forward. As Mike just indicated, we have the capacity to do so.
Craig Mailman: Great. And then just shifting to leasing. You guys had some good absorption here in the shop portfolio. I’m just kind of curious just monitoring whether the begging issues have had any impact. Just are you guys seeing any particular vertical of tenants maybe backing off here? Or is the access to capital not been an issue at all and it kind of continues to be across the board, demand for that the shop space?
Alan Roth: Yes Craig, good morning it’s Alan. We have not seen any backing off just yet. And so there’s been no impact to your backing question at all. In fact, I would take us to our pipeline, which we feel really good about where we have nearly 1 million square feet still in the pipeline that is in active negotiation right now. So nothing just yet.
Craig Mailman: Of that 1 million square feet, how much of that would be shop? And where could we see that lease rate kind of tick to in the next couple of quarters?
Alan Roth: It probably leans more towards shops on the pipeline side, Craig, but it’s really across the board just in both anchor and shops in terms of the activity. I think there’s a lot of junior box retailers that just haven’t had the ability to identify spaces given limited supply and, of course, the Bed Bath & Beyond is I think, opened a bit of that. So again, I think it’s really -- it’s addressing the totality of the portfolio, but leaning towards shops.
Craig Mailman: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Sanket Agrawal with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.
Sanket Agrawal: Good morning team, thanks for taking my question. So I just -- I was just curious around leasing activity. As we saw that leasing activity picked up again in second quarter after being low in first quarter. So we just wanted to understand how are the leasing conversations as of today and as we model spreads for second half and into 2024?
Alan Roth: Can you just repeat the last part of that is you’re seeing an uptick? Sanket?
Sanket Agrawal: So basically, leasing activity were up this quarter, right? So we just wanted to know like what are the -- a model spreads for second half of this year and for 2024? What are the contents on leasing conversations on the ground today?
Alan Roth: So Sanket, I’ll go ahead and see if I can answer that question. So the leasing conversations on the ground still remain really positive. We’re very proud of, I think, the certainly, the spreads that we achieved in the second quarter. I think as you saw, it was almost 30% on new leasing. And I think really a lot of that was a function of the mix of our anchor and shops where we had a little bit more on the anchor front. But if you look at just the shop spreads for the quarter and you’re going to take a few of those anchor deals out, we were still in the mid-teens, which is really exceptional. And I’d probably bring you also towards our GAAP rent spreads, which were 44% and again, really outstanding for the quarter. And I think that ties into the focus the team has on embedded rent steps and really speaks to the strength of the market to your question.
Lisa Palmer: And I’d come back to just our opening remarks is just the overall strength of our business in suburban, especially grocery-anchored shopping centers. And anecdotally, we are hearing that with inflation abating some, our tenants are benefiting from that as well from a cost perspective. And also there’s been improvements on the labor front. So with all of that, again, that’s the leasing conversations on the ground. We don’t have any hard and fast evidence, but it is anecdotal, and we do have great relationships with our offices across the country and with our people really close to our centers. So again, we see continued strength at this point.
Sanket Agrawal: Okay. And I have a follow-up, sir. As you guys expect to close the Urstadt Biddle acquisition this quarter, did you guys like study the difference in base rent or is that Biddle’s portfolio has versus your portfolio in similar markets? So what is the gap there behind how much you guys are trying to acquire on that side as you take over that portfolio?
Lisa Palmer: I’d just bring you back to, again, that we’re really excited about integrating these properties into our portfolio under our platform. As you heard us say when we announced the merger, and as I think we just reiterate it today, we do believe that there is going to be some upside from leasing and really capitalizing on bringing that into the Regency leasing and asset management platforms.
Sanket Agrawal: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Ki Bin Kim: Thanks and good morning. If I can start off with a really boring question. Can you just help me go back to that below-market rent topic? How should -- you had a little bit more in this quarter. How should that trend throughout the year? I’m just curious if there’s going to be a bigger burn off point at some point in 2023 or 2024?
Lisa Palmer: Ki Bin, before Mike answers that, there are no boring questions, and there are no bad questions.
Michael Mas: I will limit my spot to 2023. I mean much more to come on 2024 as we finish out the budgeting process, right, this -- which will kick off later this summer, and we’ll offer more guidance later this year. But you bring up a good point, I mentioned on the call, there will be a burn off really targeted to the Bed Bath & Beyond spaces in particular. So we are anticipating losing another $1 million of non-cash income just simply related to them in the second half versus the first. So you should plan for that as we think about our full year guidance. And hopefully, that helps you with what you’re looking for on that item, plus in my prepared remarks with respect to the reinstatement of straight-line rent as well, not recurring.
Ki Bin Kim: Okay. And at high level, California is obviously your biggest market. And I’m just curious if there’s been any discernible trends in terms of traffic or spending patterns when you compare California to your other markets and kind of any standouts? Thanks.
Nicholas Wibbenmeyer: Sure. Thanks for the question. This is Nick. So definitely not seeing any difference in California to the rest of the country. We’re seeing strong demand across the board, and that is inclusive of California, in all aspects of California. And I would even point out even in the Bay Area because again, the majority of our properties are in the suburban markets that are still seeing significant demand. And so we’re very, very pleased with the activity the demand and the leasing velocity we’re seeing out LA.
Ki Bin Kim: And if I could squeeze a quick third 1 here. The New York MSA occupancy dropped at 82%. Was that just deleasing for development or anything you can share on that?
Alan Roth: Ki Bin, I think that’s the vacating of our grocer in Manhattan, the deal. So again, we can’t announce who that tenant is, but we’ve already executed a lease to replace a majority of that space, so more to come in the next quarter.
Ki Bin Kim: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning. It’s Eric [Ph] on for Juan. According to your prepared remarks, it sounded like you had 60 bps of occupancy loss related to the Bed Bath & Beyond potentially other bankruptcies. I was just kind of curious on your expectations for the third quarter and the remainder of the year?
Michael Mas: Hey Eric, from a percent lease perspective, I mean, this has changed from last quarter. Last quarter, we were communicating an expectation that by year-end, percent lease could be actually down modestly as a result of that Bed Bath & Beyond filing. But given the team’s incredible leasing activity in the shop category in the second quarter, we’re now anticipating being up modestly as a spot percent lease rate by year-end. So super excited about that here at Regency. However, from a commenced perspective, we are anticipating that, that commenced spot rate at year-end is going to be slightly down and that’s only a matter of time as we deliver the assigned and non-occupied pipeline going into 2024. So really, the seeds that were planted in the second quarter and the leasing that the team delivered from a leasing perspective, that’s all going to pay dividends for us as we turn the calendar and move into 2024. Not to mention the fact that we’re making incredible progress on the re-leasing of the vacated Bed Bath stores as well.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. That’s helpful. And then just following up on the snow pipeline, that $30 million of ABR. Could you just talk a little bit more about the timing of that commencement there in 2023 and then into 2024?
Michael Mas: Sure. Yes, you’ve got a 250 basis points, about $31 million of rent. That’s about 3% of our Abbot. And I’d say it’s roughly pass by year-end this year and all of it -- nearly all of it by the end of next. .
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. That’s helpful. And then last one for me. Just given the acceleration in the leasing spreads, both on a cash and a rent per GAAP basis. I was wondering if you could just quantify the annual bumps in the second quarter. And is that a new trend? Is that expected to be the floor there? Any color on that would be very helpful.
Michael Mas: What are we getting -- sorry, Alan, what are we getting in from a leasing bumps perspective in our current activity?
Alan Roth: Yes. No, Eric, thank you for that question. We are getting 100% of our new deals had steps this quarter. So very proud of that number and appreciative that the team has embraced the importance of embedded rent steps. And I would say 2/3 of those deals had escalators that are at 3% or more. So we are seeing a pretty good shift, Eric, on that front.
Michael Mas: And then from an impact perspective, Eric, 140 basis points of our base rent growth is coming from rent steps. And that’s been pretty consistent for us for a long time now as the team has done an exceptional job of embedding growth into our leases. We are -- based on this momentum and we’re pushing this every single day, we’re hopeful to move that impact going forward. But it is a tough mountain to climb, and it is that -- moving that impact to same-property growth north from where we are now, we’ll take some time, but the teams are doing great work.
Unidentified Analyst: Alright, thank you very much.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Victor Pete [Ph] here on Greg McGinniss. I have a question on what does a typical leasing agreement look like now and how it has changed, if at all, during the last 3 months in terms of concessions, escalators and GIs?
Alan Roth: Yes. Victor, thank you for the question. I would say it certainly has shifted a bit in the landlord arena, I think, as evidenced by some of the results that you’re seeing. But from a market perspective, we’re not seeing capital go up just in terms of the market shifting that. For us, specifically, quarter, it’s gone up moderately because of just the mix of deals that we did this quarter, leaning more towards the anchor side. But generally speaking, as occupancies certainly rise, we feel pretty good about the quality of the portfolio, our ability to really choose the right retailers as we always intensely asset manage our portfolio and continue with what we perceive as fair market terms.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Anthony Powell: Hi, good morning. A question on bad debt. I think you kept your bad debt guidance the same. Other -- some of your peers have reduced their bad debt guidance given kind of the better expected regression here. You were just lower than others, but what are you seeing there on that front?
Michael Mas: Anthony, I appreciate the question. We left our guidance range unchanged, correct. What I would say there is actually; let’s get some stats out here first. 60 to 90 basis points of our credit loss reserve. Remember, I think we all are familiar with this by now, but that’s coming from 2 different line items, right? So you’re losing base rent from the bankruptcy impact, but you’re also recording bad debt expense unrelated to the bankruptcies, right? That’s what’s comprising the 60 to 90 basis points. Two thirds of that guidance is from bankruptcy impact, the balance coming from traditional bad debt and I would say we’re about 30% of the way through that estimate at the midyear, so that gain. Let me say this, if nothing else were to happen from this point forward in the bankruptcy arena, we’ll probably end up closer to the 60 basis points out of that range. And it does feel as if the -- as we all have talked about in the past, bankruptcies do tend to be seasonal. It does feel like more of a first half of that in a second. But we’re in uncharted territories here, so we’re just being a little bit careful with that range. But 90 basis points would be satisfactory to kind of capture any unforeseen kind of negative impact that could happen in the back half of the year.
Anthony Powell: Got it. Thanks. And then maybe 1 more on development. It seems like the sector is doing very well here. Are you being approached by private equity firms or other sources of capital to do more development? This is a pretty strong fundamental sector, and you guys have obviously been successful in developing. So I’m curious what you’re hearing there.
Nicholas Wibbenmeyer: Anthony, this is Nick. I appreciate the question. So there’s no doubt right now the financial markets are a challenge for most developers. We all talk about liquidity challenges; the tightest liquidity is in construction loans. And so that is really an opportunity for us. And as I said in our prepared remarks, our capabilities, our capital and our contacts, and we mean that are all very necessary to make deals happen right now. They’re really tough to make developments happen for a plethora of reasons. But that’s why we feel really bullish we’re going to get more than our fair share of opportunities. And so we have to from everyone in the business, whether it be capital interested, whether it be developers that need capital and the good news is we already have all the tools in our tool belt, and we’re using those as appropriate. And so excited about, obviously, bringing Sunbelt online start of construction this quarter and hope to announce future deals in the future.
Lisa Palmer: And we -- again, development has been an important part of our business model for as long as I’ve been at the company, and it just enhances our earnings growth with $150 million of free cash flow and we can essentially leverage that remaining leverage-neutral and invest that capital into our development, it really does move the needle with regards to enhancing our earnings growth.
Anthony Powell: Thank you.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Ronald Kamdem: Hi, just a couple of quick ones. So just starting on the sort of the recurring or non-recurring stuff this year versus next year. Just trying to get my arms around that. So I mean, I think it sounds like the collections of past reserves and certain noncash items is going to be the biggest sort of tough stuff to comp next year. But from a cash basis, whether it’s same-store NOI whether it’s some of the occupancy gains is that fair that should be closer to sort of your long-term targets?
Michael Mas: Yes. I mean Ron, it’s Mike. Just to maybe catch some of the items you’re referring to. We want to -- and we try to make it very clear in the remarks. There’s $9 million to $10 million of noncash FFO that won’t be recurring. And I wouldn’t plan on that recurring next year, driven by the straight-line rent reversals as well as the below-market rent acceleration. There’s another $4 million that we’ve guided to from a prior year collection perspective, and we’re thankfully getting to the bottom of that bucket. So collectively, you’re in the $14 million range of non-recurring FFO items. And that’s why we will continue to look through the core operating earnings to again remove the impact of those -- of that noncash component. So that’s a better reflection of what we think AFFO direction should be. And then the prior year collections will take care of themselves.
Ronald Kamdem: Got it. Makes sense. And then so I mean, I think going back to -- I think some of the comments you made about the UBP merger, presumably, you’re not going to have any more of these headwinds on the same-store NOI guide. So presumably, I mean, I think 2024, if you look past these noncash items, I mean, it could be a pretty strong sort of year, right? So what are sort of the like the puts and takes, right? Is it bad debt that we should be thinking about? Because everything else seems like it’s going to be pretty strong.
Michael Mas: Yes. I’d appreciate you mentioned it. I’m going to be a little careful, Ron, and we’ve talked too much about 2024. We’re going to give that as we customarily do a full suite of forward-looking guidance later in the year. So I want to kind of be careful there. But from a rent steps perspective, as we just talked about, we will continue to deliver positive impacts just from contractual rent increases. We’re having a great year so far on rent spreads. In this year alone, that’s an 80 basis point positive impact. I would anticipate that rent spreads continue to positively impact us going forward. Commenced occupancy, we still have room to run. There was a question earlier today about the top end. 96% on total and 93% on shops is where our eye level is. That would include the to-be merged portfolio of Urstadt Biddle, which -- which will take some more time for us to achieve those levels. There spot occupancy levels at about 200 basis points below ours today, and that’s what we’re excited about driving growth from that portfolio. Something you didn’t mention is the positive contribution from redevelopments. We schedule that out in our supplement, 70 basis points to 2023 of positive NOI contribution. We’ve brought online key projects at the Abbot Market Common Clarendon. These are exciting large projects that we’ve brought online, and we’ve been talking about for -- it feels like years now, and they’re finally coming into fruition and through income. Those will continue to grow for us into next year as well. And there will be the impact of bankruptcies as a negative impact this year, and we’ll make an adjustment from a credit loss perspective looking into 2024. But as you know, our exposure to these tenants just from a watch list perspective, is pretty limited. So that’s about what I want to share today on 2024 outlook, and we’ll give you much more to come, both on the merger as well as on our base outlook for 2024 later this year.
Lisa Palmer: But probably important just to reiterate, I know you mentioned the opportunity in increasing the commenced occupancy in the UBP portfolio. But in case you missed the prepared remarks, Mike did say that we expect 1.5% COE accretion in 2024 from that merger.
Ronald Kamdem: Excellent. Thanks so much. Super helpful.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Floris Van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please proceed with your question.
Floris Van Dijkum: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I had you guys Regency is your DNA historically has always been development. You’re leaning into development now when nobody else can when demand still sort of exceeds supply, if you will. So I think that bodes well for your future. And I see that you’re doing a couple of different types of development, including repurposing a former anchor box at a mall and you’re doing some -- it looks like some residential. I don’t believe you’re doing the residential yourself at West Barge or are you doing that? Could you remind us again what’s -- how you look at residential and how you try to stick to your knitting and typically would let others take the risk in noncore property types?
Lisa Palmer: Appreciate the question, Floris. And I also appreciate the comments. You are correct. We are focused on the retail portion of development. It is our core competency. It is our competitive advantage. It is what we are really good at. And yes, there are going to be a mix of uses when we are focusing on some of the highest quality pieces of property and land. Oftentimes, there will be demand for other types of uses. And when that is the case, we’re certainly going to capitalize on that, but it is not our specialty. So we will typically partner with someone who -- that is their core competency. And it may mean that we just invest the land. It may mean that we invest a little bit of capital, but we will always bring in the expertise that is needed to ensure that we have the Folsom project and optimizing the land. And we have examples of that, as you said, Westbard is one. We have 1 out in California where Nick is where we’ve partnered with Holland to do the residential across the street from the Grove, which is everyone, is familiar with it. We’ve rebranded it to Bluemont third. So absolutely. I appreciate the question, Floris, and you are right. We are focused on the retail portion of high-quality mostly grocery anchored suburban shopping centers.
Floris Van Dijkum: And then I guess my follow-up here. I wouldn’t consider California market as the state. It has a couple of different markets in there. But New York clearly is going to be your biggest market, particularly post the Urstadt Biddle merger. Is that correct?
Lisa Palmer: Yes, if you say markets and not a state that is correct. And again, I think it’s really we like the portfolio, the composition, our geographic diversity. The fact that we have offices across the United States. And we’re very focused on trade areas, as you know, not necessarily macro markets. And we will continue to invest in the markets that we are already invested in when we have the opportunity to add high-quality shopping centers to our portfolio.
Floris Van Dijkum: Thanks guys.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Mueller: Yes, hi thanks. So you spent a little bit more time. It seems like with the Urstadt portfolio. Just curious, how are you thinking about, say, the 3-year same-store NOI CAGR potential compared to the existing Regency portfolio?
Michael Mas: Yes. Mike, sorry, I’m going to prevent the team for me to answer the question. More to come on the close, we’re not closed yet. We have spent more time with it. We’re as excited as we have been since we announced the merger and since we started to look at it. None of that has changed. It’s only accelerated and amplified. As a matter of maybe disclosure guidance, we actually at this point in time, don’t anticipate including it in the same-property pool. We will likely treat it as an asset acquisition. So your -- the technical question, how will impact our same-property growth isn’t necessarily relevant. But we’re excited to talk about the portfolio when it’s time to do so.
Michael Mueller: Got it. Thanks.
Operator: On the line of Wes Golladay with Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Wesley Golladay: Hey everyone. I just want to look at a high-level view of 2024. Just trying to find any potential headwinds. And more in particular, for the redevelopments, are you going to be deleasing anything of material size next year that you know of at this point?
Michael Mas: Hey Wes. I think I’ve talked to the headwinds we want to talk about already, and they’re largely coming from the non-cash area. So the $9 million to $10 million of non-recurring non-cash impacts. We’ve talked about the $4 million of prior year collections that also won’t recur. That’s where we’re going to limit our conversation today. The redevelopment impact, I mentioned previously, just again, directionality. We will continue to see that as a positive contributor going forward. And the details of that are in the support, you can map that out.
Wesley Golladay: Okay. Fair enough. And then I guess, more bigger picture. There are definitely a lot of developers struggling, see where [Indiscernible] is and what the propane for a development yield is quite high. What are the retailers coming to you saying, hey, could you just step up your pipeline? Are you having those conversations? Are they willing to give you a higher yield? Could you take your pipeline up higher? Are you governed by maybe your free cash flow capacity? What’s the outlook for maybe accelerating the development pipeline to a much higher level than it is today?
Nicholas Wibbenmeyer: Sure, Wes. I appreciate the question. This is Nick. There is no question we are in direct dialogue with our partner grocers around the country. The grocers want to continue to add stores. Their business has been very good over the last several years, and they’re excited about continuing to grow their top line. And so there’s no question, but there are challenges making those deals pencil and there isn’t 1 solution to solving all those challenges. Part of its construction cost, part of its entitlements, Part of it is financing cost. Part of it is rent. And so our job and our capabilities allow us to stand in the middle of all of those and make sure we’re pulling every single lever using every tool in our toolbox, which is why I would tell you, we’re as excited as we’ve been in a long time about getting more than our fair share because we are one of the only companies in the country that have all of those tools, have those capabilities, have those relationships and have that knowledge. And so we’re bullish on growing the development pipeline in the cycle right now. I’m sorry, go ahead, Lisa.
Lisa Palmer: Sorry, Nick. No, I thought you were finished. Keep going.
Nicholas Wibbenmeyer: I was just going to allude to, as Mike indicated, we have plenty of capacity. And as Lisa indicated, we have free cash flow is prioritized for it, and we have a balance sheet behind that to make sure we can appropriately continue to lean into those opportunities as we put those pieces together.
Lisa Palmer: Yes. All I was going to add is that we haven’t been limited from capital; it has been a limitation on the opportunity set because we’re really disciplined. And I think it’s important that we maintain that discipline, and we will maintain that discipline. If it gets to the -- and Nick reminds me all the time because I do -- I like to say my $200 million to $250 million that it could be lumpy and there may be some years where it’s going to be more than that, there may be some years where it’s going to be a little bit less. If we can average the $1 billion to $1.25 billion over 5 years, that’s our goal. And if it gets to the point where the opportunity set is growing, we will certainly evaluate how we can meet that demand.
Wesley Golladay: Great guys. Thanks everyone.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Linda Tsai: Hi, I think your retention ratio was historically around 75%, and it’s trending above that now. Are you getting back to peak occupancy? Are you above that?
Alan Roth: Hey Linda, it’s Alan. We are still hovering in that.
Unidentified Company Representative: Peak retention rate. She just clarified your question.
Lisa Palmer: Peak retention rate. excuse me.
Alan Roth: We are still -- let me answer -- let me -- let me go and reverse that. So in terms of are we back to where we think peak occupancies are, no, we believe there’s still runway. We’re making really good progress. Obviously, some of the bankruptcies that we alluded to the 60 basis point impact did sort of pull us back a bit despite the great success we had on a lot of shop leasing. But there’s runway there. We feel really good about, again, as I said the pipeline of where we’re going. And I hope not only do we get back to historic highs, but we can get past this. That’s certainly where we’re setting our eyes.
Lisa Palmer: The only thing I’d add on retention is, and we’ve talked about this, the pandemic really kind of purged some of the weaker operators. And so as we emerge from that, we’ve done a great job of recovering our occupancy. We continue to do that. We continue to increase it. And we feel better today about the strength and health of our operators, and I think we ever have in the past. So it does not surprise me that the retention rate continues to be strong, and I would expect that it will continue to be -- to stay there, if not improve.
Linda Tsai: And then when you look out to the next year or two, how do you think about the ratio of organic versus external growth in terms of having the best opportunity sets?
Lisa Palmer: Again, $150 million of free cash flow; we will leverage that and invest that into our development and redevelopment activity. And so that’s where you’re going to see our external. And as Nick said earlier, we will always be evaluating acquisition opportunities. And to the extent that we can fund it so that it is accretive to earnings. And if the opportunity itself is neutral -- at least neutral or accretive to our quality and our future growth rate, we’re going to act on them. So I think you can take our same-property NOI and the team does a great job of communicating that via our investor presentation as well as the meetings. If you take our same-property NOI model, that’s the base. That’s the fundamental. And then on top of that is going to be our investment activity, and that will enhance that growth.
Linda Tsai: Thank you.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Goldsmith: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. My question relates kind of to the balance between new leasing and your ability to pay TIs. Are tenants looking for greater TIs I thought it stepped up in the quarter? And just given the macro environment, maybe other landlords don’t have as much capital available to help their tenants out. Is that helping you become a landlord of choice for certain types of tenants? Thanks.
Alan Roth: Michael, I appreciate the question. Look, we will invest in great retailers that we know have a great track record that we’ve done tremendous business with. But when you talk about sort of the uptick that we’ve experienced for the quarter. As I mentioned, it really is a little bit more just in terms of the mix of anchor and shops. We -- as noted in the supplemental, you’ll see the weighted average length of term is also longer. So I would bring you back to how we’re thinking about net effective rents as a percent of GAAP rents where we’re in the mid-to-high 80% range over the last 5 quarters and for this quarter, we’re at 83%. So it’s really still really in line with how we are prudently managing our capital spend, and we foresee it sticking in that similar range as we go forward.
Michael Goldsmith: And just as a follow-up related to small shop. Clearly, another big quarter with a sequential step-up of 60 basis points. Is there an artificial cap on how high small shop occupancy can get historically, it’s been lower than anchor, but we just seen such strong movement lately. It sounds like you have a great pipeline there. So is there a point where we just kind of reach a moment where it may be -- it just doesn’t move that much higher and are we approaching that?
Alan Roth: Michael, I would say for all of our leasing agents that are listening to this call, there is no cap on our shop occupancy and the direction that we’re going. But sure, we’re going to still obviously have some vacancy as even when we meet those historic highs or get past those. But again, it’s historically been in the 93-ish percent range. And as I said previously, we feel pretty good about the direction that we’re going with the pipeline that’s in place right now.
Michael Goldsmith: Thank you very much. Good luck in the back half.
Alan Roth: Thanks, Michael.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, there are no further questions. I would like to turn the floor back over to Lisa Palmer for any closing comments.
Lisa Palmer: I just want to thank you all for joining us this morning and bearing with us through the end of this earnings cycle. Have a great weekend all. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today’s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a great day.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-05-05 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Regency Centers Corporation First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Christy McElroy, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets. Thank you, Christy. You may begin. 
Christy McElroy: Good morning and welcome to Regency Centers' first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Lisa Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Mas, Chief Financial Officer; Alan Roth, EVP, National Property Operations and East Region President; and Nick Wibbenmeyer, EVP and West Region President. As a reminder, today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements about the company's views of future business and financial performance, including forward earnings guidance and future market conditions. These are based on management's current beliefs and expectations and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. It's possible that actual results may differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements we may make. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements may be included in our presentation today and are described in more detail in our filings with the SEC, specifically in our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filings. In our discussion today, we will also reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. The comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this quarter's earnings materials, which are posted on our Investor Relations website. Please note that we have also posted a presentation on our website with additional information, including disclosures related to forward earnings guidance. Our caution on forward-looking statements also applies to these presentation materials. Lisa?
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Christy. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. We are pleased to report another solid quarter with positive results. Yes, we acknowledge there is uncertainty in the economic outlook, especially given the recent bank turmoil. So we do continue to look for signs of softening in our business. But to date, we haven't seen it. Operational trends remain positive and this is consistent with our update a quarter ago. And in fact, with three more months in the book, we have even more conviction in our outlook for this year. Tenant demand for space in our centers remains strong, sustaining the momentum in our leasing pipelines and also in our ability to drive base rent growth. This is the case across our entire operating portfolio as well as within our development and redevelopment program. We've seen continuing outperformance in tenant sales as well, which have resulted in higher percentage rents, especially in restaurant and grocery. We believe this reflects strength in those categories, as well as an ability of consumers in our trade areas to absorb elevated inflationary impacts. As we discussed in our last call, we are seeing more activity related to tenant bankruptcies, most recently with a widely anticipated filing from Bed Bath & Beyond nearly two weeks ago. But none of this activity has been a surprise to us, as these retailers have been on our watch list for some time. And as Alan will discuss, our teams have been proactive and we're seeing strong demand from tenants to backfill the space. Regency's relatively limited exposure to these bankruptcies is not by accident or luck, it is the result of proactive asset and portfolio management over a long period of time, as the quality of our assets and locations gives us the advantage and the ability to be selective in the merchandising of our centers. We believe that our in-place tenant roster today is as strong as it's ever been. One change that we have seen since our update last quarter is in regard to the transaction markets. You may recall that I commented that we were starting to see increased activity and competitive bidding situations returning. But that was pretty short-lived, as within weeks after that the transaction market was again impacted by uncertainty and instability in the financing markets. I was hoping that today we'd have more concrete data points to share with you, but transaction volumes remain very thin. That said, we remain on our front foot from an investment perspective. As Nick will discuss in a few minutes, the team is hard at work finding new opportunities to invest our free cash flow and grow our development and redevelopment pipelines. This has long been a core competency of Regency, as many of you on this call are aware. And I'm proud of our industry-leading team and a long track record of successful execution. In summary, we believe that, given the positive structural trends supporting continued tenant demand in suburban trade areas, we and the shopping center sector as a whole are in an enviable position with greater resistance to potential adverse economic and capital markets impacts. And further, we also believe Regency benefits from competitive advantages including the exceptional quality of our assets and our people, our liquidity, access to capital and balance sheet strength that uniquely positions us to be opportunistic, while still delivering quality results. Alan?
Alan Roth: Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. The positive leasing and retail environment we experienced last year has continued, as evidenced by another quarter of strong operational trends. Leasing activity remains robust with new leasing volume 20% above our historical first quarter average. Activity was led by continued strength in shop leasing, where occupancy was up another 20 basis points in the quarter, on top of a 200-basis point increase during 2022. Cash rent spreads remain healthy. And importantly, our GAAP and net effective rent spreads were both in the mid-teens in Q1 and on a trailing 12-month basis. The GAAP and net effective rent spread metrics are the most reflective of our ability to drive base rent growth, while prudently managing our capital investment and maximizing our return. We believe, these mid-teen spreads are reflective of the quality of our shopping centers and locations, which gives us leverage and lease negotiations and allows us to limit leasing capital spend. To that end, I would encourage you to review our new net effective rent disclosure on page 20 of our supplemental. Embedded rent escalators are a huge driver of our rent growth and we continue to have success driving these steps. Nearly, 90% of all leasing activity and 93% of shop leases in the first quarter had embedded rent steps, which is our highest percentage on record for shops. So not only are we pushing the rate of contractual increases higher, but we're getting them in more leases. These positive operating results and activity contributed to another solid quarter of base rent and same-property NOI growth. Most importantly, it provides further conviction in our forward growth trajectory. Leasing activity remains strong and our signed, but not occupied pipeline is flat quarter-over-quarter at 230 basis points, representing $32 million of annual incremental base rent. So the leases that we are commencing each quarter, we are replenishing the pipeline with new leases signed. Notably, our new disclosure on page 20 also includes enhanced information on our signed, but not occupied pipeline. Today, we also have nearly one million square feet of leases under LOI or lease negotiation, further reflective of the strength and demand that we continue to see. This activity includes square footage associated with recent tenant bankruptcies for which we've seen strong interest. The most notable of these is the recent filing of Bed Bath & Beyond, of which we have 10 locations comprising only 50 basis points of ABR. Five of these locations were included on last week's rejection list, which we had expected. Our teams have been proactively engaged on all of our Bed Bath locations with potential backfill tenants, in anticipation of the opportunity to recapture and remerchandise the stores. Demand is coming from several categories, including grocers, off-price retailers, home décor, sporting goods and medical uses. This is resulting in multiple retailers buying for many of these spaces and we anticipate average mark-to-market of approximately 20%. In addition to Bed Bath, we continue to actively manage all of our at-risk tenant exposure. We own great real estate in some of the best suburban trade areas around the country and leasing demand remains strong. We are not afraid to get spaces back in an environment of limited new supply growth and a surplus of great retailers that are actively looking to expand. In summary, our team feels really good about the continued positive momentum we are seeing in the retail operating environment. Nick?
Nick Wibbenmeyer: Thank you, Alan. Good morning everyone. We continue to make great progress, executing on our development and redevelopment strategy, ending the quarter with $300 million of in-process projects. Leasing activity remains strong and our team has done an excellent job of keeping our projects on schedule within budget. As we have discussed on prior calls, Regency is uniquely positioned to grow our investment pipeline, by utilizing our three development cornerstones, our capabilities, our capital, and our contacts, are an equal combination of development expertise, our access to capital given our extensive free cash flow and fortress balance sheet in conjunction with our expansive and deep industry contacts and relationships across our 22 offices, give us an unparalleled advantage to source and execute on attractive opportunities throughout the country. For instance, we are nearing the finish line on the purchase of a development project in the New York Metro area. This nearly $90 million investment will be anchored by a best-in-class specialty grocer, and located in an extremely high barrier to entry market. Additionally, this week we also closed on the first phase of a retail development and a thriving 10,000-acre master plan community in Metro Houston. Although the first phase is smaller in scale at approximately $10 million, we do anticipate being able to grow the project in future years. We look forward to sharing more details on both of these projects when we add them to our in-process pipeline. Beyond ground-up developments, our investment team continues to execute on opportunities to create value within our current portfolio. Subsequent to quarter end, we started Phase III of our redevelopment at Serramonte Center in Daly City. This $37 million project includes the redevelopment of the former JCPenney and the addition of two small shop buildings adjacent to Macy's. We have executed a lease with best-in-class South Korean food market and grocery operator for the former JCPenney space. And we're excited to bring their new concept to the Bay Area. This phase of the project sits at the highly visible front door of the shopping center and will bring the center to 97% leased. In summary, we remain encouraged by the opportunities we are seeing to drive future value creation and reinvest our free cash flow and are focused on continuing to build our development and redevelopment pipelines to north of $200 million of annual starts. Mike?
Mike Mas: Thanks, Nick and good morning, everyone. I'll start with some highlights from our first quarter results then walk through a couple of changes to our full year earnings guidance and assumptions. Excluding COVID period reserve collections, we delivered same-property NOI growth of 6.3% in the first quarter. The largest driver was base rent, contributing a strong 430 basis points in the quarter. Base rent growth is the most important indicator of our portfolio strength. And we continue to see positive impacts from embedded rent escalators, positive spreads on re-leasing space and higher occupancy year-over-year. We also saw meaningful outperformance on percentage rents in the quarter, contributing 100 basis points to same property NOI growth, despite tougher year-over-year comps, driven by continued strength in grocery and restaurant sales. Notably, percentage rents tend to be seasonal with the majority of sales-based billings occurring in the first quarter of the year. The other meaningful driver to first quarter same-property NOI was a 130-basis point positive contribution from uncollectible lease income. We continue to isolate the collection of COVID period reserves from 2020 and 2021 to provide a better picture of normalized results. But the realities of cash basis tenancy can create some variability in the bad debt line item from quarter-to-quarter. To that end, and due to the better-than-expected collection rates on cash basis tenants, we experienced a positive contribution to uncollectible lease income this quarter, as we collected on rents originally billed and reserved in 2022. The increasing collection rates and decline in receivable and reserve balances demonstrate the health and resiliency of our tenant base. Turning to 2023 guidance. I'd like to point you to the helpful detail on Slides 5 through 7 in our investor presentation. We've increased both our NAREIT FFO and core operating earnings guidance ranges each by $0.04 per share, driven largely by the outperformance in percentage rents and uncollectible lease income in the first quarter. Collectively, these items also drove the 50-basis point upward revision in our same-property NOI growth guidance to a new range of 2.5% to 3.5% excluding COVID period reserve collections. I also want to spend a minute on our credit loss assumption, which we revised to a lower range of 60 to 90 basis points for the full year from 75 to 100 basis points previously. Notably, the midpoint of our new same-property NOI and earnings per share ranges now capture the potential for a full liquidation of Bed Bath & Beyond by mid-year. This scenario was previously contemplated in the low end of those ranges. However, this change was offset by first quarter outperformance and bad debt that I discussed earlier, which positively impacted our full year credit loss assumption. On the capital side in late March, we repurchased roughly 350,000 shares for $20 million at an average price just over $57 per share. This repurchase was executed to hedge the planned issuance of a like kind of Mountain OP units to the seller of the development project in New York that Nick mentioned earlier. I'll end as I typically do, highlighting the strength and afforded opportunity of Regency's balance sheet, the importance of which is never more evident than in times of capital markets' turmoil. Leverage remains at the low end of our targeted range of five to 5.5 times debt to EBITDA we are generating significant free cash flow projected to be north of $140 million this year funding our investments' pipeline. We have access to significant liquidity with our $1.25 billion line of credit. And there are no significant debt maturities for over a year. This position of strength allows us to be patient and opportunistic, in this evolving environment. With that, we look forward to taking your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Goldsmith: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. My first question is on the sustainability of the leasing demand. What have you seen -- have you seen any change in the leasing volumes post-Silicon Valley Bank and some of the disruption that was experienced in March? And just has that sustained in April? And if you have seen anyone express any sort of resistance or slowdown in leasing what are the reasons they're talking about, just trying to get a sense of the long-term sustainability of this recent trend?
Alan Roth: Yeah. Michael, this is Alan. I appreciate the question. We are still seeing very strong demand across many categories in all of our regions. And as we mentioned, we've got over one million square feet of new activity in the pipeline. And when we look back and we think about the bumpy road of the kind of bank announcements that you had mentioned in March, our March new activity actually exceeded both January and February. And then, of course, post-closing of first quarter, we actually obviously have visibility to April activity as well. April new activity has exceeded January, February and March independently. So I think collectively, we would tell you that we still feel really good. Again, head is not in the sand. But it's quality retailers. It's a deep pipeline. The activities are coming across the finish line and we've got plenty that still remains in the queue as we look forward.
Michael Goldsmith: Got it. Thanks for that. And my follow-up question is for Mike. It seems like half of the upside to the 2023 guidance and the outperformance was driven by base rent which we kind of talked about. But then, the rest was kind of driven by percentage rent and maybe some upside or near-term upside in the lease termination fees. So I guess, the question here is just the sustainability of that. Or is that sort of a one-time item that shouldn't recur through the rest of the year?
Mike Mas: Hey Michael, it's a combination of both. I mean, we won't – clearly, we had some onetime impacts to the first quarter that beat our estimates internally and those are flowing through to full year resort -- results. But there is a little bit of tailwind remaining in our guide. We've become slightly more conservative I would say on the -- with the added visibility to the ongoing Bed Bath & Beyond filing. And a lot of that's been covered up by those first quarter impacts as well as our outlook for the balance of the year. So we do see ourselves floating into -- floating back into our guidance range from the first quarter. There's some headwind in the top-end from base rent, as we lose the Bed Bath locations. Our outlook on an ongoing basis with uncollectible lease income remains I would call it, historically average maybe to a little bit slightly better from what we had coming into the year. And the best story that I see is, tagging on to Alan's point on our leasing pipeline, the shop demand continues to be there and our -- and we're commencing rents. The $32 million of ABR that's in the pipeline we will deliver that this year. 80% of that in fact will come in this year. And that's just a great driving factor of the -- of our renewed outlook on same property growth.
Michael Goldsmith: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.
Greg McGinniss: Hey, good morning. Just to kind of touch on some of those headwinds/tailwinds thinking about where we might end up at the end of the year. I think on the last call, you talked about kind of flattish occupancy through year-end potentially. But given this kind of healthy Q1 leasing maybe a little bit of an offset from the Bed Bath & Beyond bankruptcy how are you thinking about year-end occupancy expectations at this time? 
Mike Mas: Hey Greg still flattish. The bank -- essentially the bankruptcy is turning out how we envisioned it would a quarter ago. So, our outlook remains the same that depending on how the auction proceedings end up, we're going to be flat to slightly down potentially by year-end. But again from a revenue perspective, remember that we have all -- we have this tailwind of delivering that occupancy that we have already contracted that -- and that shop space demand that will come through all of which is -- the word I would use is overwhelming what we may lose through the bankruptcy proceedings. 
Greg McGinniss: Great. Thanks. And as a follow-up I just wanted to touch on the tenant watch list. I think regional banks have obviously been in the news a lot based on our look. You don't have any exposure to the ones that have been called out yet. It's more like 50 basis points maybe-ish around there I think. We'd love to have you confirm. On other regional bank exposure, curious on potential backfills for those kinds of spaces especially on the outparcels and what level of demand you might be seeing there. And then looking at maybe like Kohl's, Rite Aid, Michaels, we see some more risk than I think limited to 1.9% of GLA. Are you in discussions on some of those spaces as well?
Alan Roth: Greg I'll just generically answer the question in terms of overall tenant watch list. We are always proactively evaluating who's on the list both those that come off it those get added. Our teams out in the field are constantly and aggressively looking at those spaces in terms of sales volumes in terms of foot traffic in terms of lease expirations upside downside. And so if there's an opportunity where we think we want to proactively take it back we're getting out in front of it. If we have concern they're going to vacate we're out in front of that. And so I think that's just really an overall comment for the totality of the watch list to include some that you might have mentioned and others that you didn't. 
Lisa Palmer: I'll just -- if Alan doesn't mind I'll come over top for the bank branch. I think your observation is correct. Our exposure to the bank branches are -- I mean I think on our significant tenant list you've got JPMorgan, Wells, and Bank of America. And so any of the regional bank branches that we have would be really immaterial. 
Greg McGinniss: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Craig Mailman with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Craig Mailman: Good morning. I just wanted to circle back to the leasing environment. You guys are pushing through escalators in a lot more leases and rent spreads remain healthy. I mean what kind of pushback are you guys getting from tenants on rent increases adding escalators to this? And kind of where are these OCRs coming in given these rent resets?
Alan Roth: So, Craig good question. Thank you. Look I think there's -- it's widely accepted that inflation is impacting all of us to include us and therefore we're able to pass through a lot of these higher escalators as you saw and heard on our -- 90% of all deals had embedded rent steps and 93% of our shops had those. And so we're having success not only getting them in our deals but we're having them success in getting them at higher values. I'm not seeing a tremendous amount of pushback there. Occupancy costs frankly are going in the inverse direction because I think sales are generally going up for most of our retailers. And so will that provide an ability to push further? I think in some categories it will Craig and in others maybe it doesn't. But they all seem to be operating in pretty healthy reasonable levels that give us the ability to I think really reasonably push those going forward. 
Nick Joseph: Thanks. It's Nick Joseph here with Craig. Just maybe on capital allocation. Obviously, it was quiet in the first quarter but you did purchase some shares. So, I guess number one what are you seeing on the transaction market? Are things starting to show at all there? And then the second part how are you thinking about additional share repurchases from here? 
Lisa Palmer: Well, I'll quarter back. I'm going to have Mike answer the share repurchase. And then we'll toss it to Nick for the overall transaction market. 
Mike Mas: Hey, Nick, good question. So first on the share repurchase. Let me say that that was largely tactical this quarter. And we outlined it in my prepared remarks tied to a great development opportunity that we have. We want to be able to be as flexible as possible to be competitive in that marketplace. And I think this was a point at which we can differentiate. We are obviously very keenly aware of our NAV and our perspective of value. And at the same time, when units are necessary to make a deal, we found this opportunity to hedge that transaction. And we're not big back patterns but we will pat ourselves on the back. I think we did pretty nicely from an arbitrage perspective as well time will tell. But that was what that transaction was designed to do simply to hedge the unit issuance of that development pursuit which we're excited about. 
Nick Wibbenmeyer: And thank you, Nick in regards to the transaction market as Lisa alluded to in our opening remarks that is a little surprising of how few data points there were in Q1. So it has been very, very quiet out there. But as we've said in the past, we're always focused on opportunities that are accretive to earnings and that are equal or accretive to the quality and the growth of our current portfolio. And we have the capacity and the desire to act on those opportunities that meet that criteria. And so we're very focused on it and hopeful that in the near future some more opportunities we'll pop up that we can take advantage of. 
Nick Joseph: Thanks. And then just on the development side has pricing changed at all there relative to where it was before?
Nick Wibbenmeyer: On the margin, I mean look we're eyes wide open regarding what's going on in the market. But we're again highly focused on making sure it's accretive to us and what is our cost of capital and how do we best use that cost of capital. And so, depending on the risk profile of any transaction we evaluate that we decide how we're going to fund it and make sure that there's an appropriate spread there. And so we're very comfortable that the opportunities we're working on right now are accretive to the company long term.
Lisa Palmer: It's a great opportunity for me to remind you of our significant free cash flow that we generate. And the best use of that cash flow is into what I believe the leading development program in the sector.
Nick Joseph: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Samir Khanal with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.
Samir Khanal: Hey, good morning, everyone. Mike on the FFO guidance, you did the 108 NAREIT FFO in the quarter and I know there were some onetime items. I mean we were looking at some of the term fees maybe it was a $0.02 impact, but even if we use 106 sort of for the run rate you're still getting to like 420 for the year. And I look at your guidance and I'm just thinking are you being overly conservative here given the macro or is there something we need to think about that are impacting growth?
Mike Mas: Hey, Samir, thanks. I'll go back to some earlier comments. Let's first identify what is timing related in the first quarter and what is uniquely onetime. So clearly, the pursuit income that we recognize is a onetime of that. Kudos to the team for being very careful with our pursuit efforts there and monetizing that value. The balance -- the higher percentage rent that's a timing-related impact. So it will recur over time and through the years, but within the year percentage rent is largely an earlier Q1 event. So we have to factor that in. Our outlook for uncollectible leasing income, if you think about the Q1 being positive this quarter, we are not anticipating that we will replicate that through the balance of the year. As I mentioned previously, we think we'll float back down to our historical averages of ULI which is in the 50-basis point area of build rents. Term fees, again more of a -- we did guide on that element. We knew that we were going to have a significant term fee in 2023. It is a -- the $4 million payment was received in the first quarter. Clearly, we'll have to adjust for that. Some comments on term fees. We basically looking over our shoulders get $0.05 a foot year in year out, as a semi-recurring part of the business. So that's about a run rate of a couple of million dollars if you think about going forward. Those are some of the elements there Samir. I think it's -- and then we have the bankruptcy and the impact that losing our Bed Bath & Beyond will have on our forward growth. So that's going back to us floating from Q1 through same property NOI as well as core earnings back down into the guided levels that we offered.
Samir Khanal: Thanks for that. And then my second question is around leasing spreads. When you provided the commentary certainly very positive around leasing. But when I look at the spreads and again it's still pretty good or mid-single digits growth. But if you look at the last few quarters, they've decelerated right? And look I know it's volatile month-to-month. I get that but maybe just provide a bit of color on those leasing spreads we're seeing?
Alan Roth: Yeah, Samir I appreciate the question and thanks for acknowledging the lumpiness that can happen certainly quarter-to-quarter with that. As we look at the last quarter, we did not have any significant new anchor transaction that was in the quarter. We did over 100,000 square feet of anchor activity in Q1 but only one deal that represented 11,000 square feet was a comparable anchor deal that's included in that. So when you look at our cash rent spreads for Q1, it's predominantly all shop leasing, which is generally lower than anchor leasing that gets the big pop. But I'd bring you back to the 12-month trailing cash spreads of 11% on new activity. And importantly our keen focus and success with the embedded rent steps and prudent capital spend. And so on that new disclosure page, net effective rent as a percent of base rent has been in the mid to high 80% range over the past five quarters. And we're pretty proud of this metric as it's a testament to our team's efforts of achieving those contractual rent steps while prudently managing our capital spend.
Samir Khanal: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Juan Sanabria: Hi. So maybe just circling up a little bit from a different perspective or asking it differently than Samir did. For the guidance, you assume that occupancy is maybe flat to slightly down by year-end, but does it dip between now and then as a result of Bed Bath before you capture the SNL pipeline? How should we think about the quantum of that decline to maybe piece together these various pieces you've talked about on the call?
Mike Mas: I mean simply -- I'll give into some details on, but simply I'd say use our guide on same-property growth. And I think -- and if you think about it -- if you're trying to sequence it from quarter-over-quarter, we know when we're losing Bed Bath. They've rejected half of our locations. And coming into the year, our exposure was in the $5 million range to that tenant. So half of that is losing it at the beginning of Q2. And then as you think about delivering the $32 million of contracted SNL that will come on as I said about 80% of it by year-end. I would sequence that pretty ratably through the year. And we're going to float down from a 6.3% Q1 post on same-property growth to a midpoint of 3% by year-end. There is a unique Q4 item that we all talked about last quarter from a recovery standpoint in our numbers. So the fourth quarter comp is a little more difficult. But I hope that helps you and if you need anything else we'd be happy to connect offline.
Juan Sanabria: No, thank you. That's helpful. Super helpful. And then just a quick question on the reversal of cash to GAAP had a bit of a benefit in the first quarter. How is that captured in the guidance to look at page 6 and what bucket does that fall under? And is there anything else assumed in terms of reversals back to GAAP for the balance of the year?
Mike Mas: Yeah. So the majority of those reversals will come through in our non-cash guide and we have -- so I would -- as you can see we didn't change that guide. So our outlook hasn't -- it's $2.5 million rough weighted impact embedded within there. This is a good opportunity to indicate that we are at 7% on a cash basis and that has not changed from fourth quarter. I would offer that given the first quarter results and the good collection rate that we're seeing out of our cash-based tenancy. Our outlook remains the same that we will continue to convert tenants to accrual through the year. As we said last quarter, we anticipate that we should be in the plus or minus 5% area by year-end. And so we're -- we haven't come off of that expectation either. There is a little bit of AR that could -- as you convert tenants that could come through as well, but it's de minimis Juan. So I would just focus on that non-cash guidance that we provided. 
Juan Sanabria: Right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. 
Anthony Powell: Hi. Good morning. There are some press recently on some of the traditional anchors in malls like Macy's and Nordstrom expanding their smaller format shops. Are you seeing some of that activity in your leasing pipeline? 
Alan Roth: Anthony, thank you for the question. The short answer is, yes. So Macy's is doing Market by Macy's. They've got their sister company Bloomingdale Outlet. Nordstrom you referenced is really expanding their Nordstrom Rack concept one that we just signed down here in Jacksonville. So they're out there. They're aggressively doing it. And I think that entire really off-price category is rocking and rolling right now. 
Anthony Powell: Thanks. And maybe one more on percentage rents. I get that it will be lower this year, but there was a big kind of year-over-year increase. How should we be modeling percentage rents just going forward say next year either on a as a percent of base rent or year-over-year growth? 
Mike Mas: I'll give you some big picture items that will help you. Number one it's up year-over-year. We've actually increased our percentage rent in two consecutive first quarters by over 40%. However, it's a small number. So we only -- we get about 1% of our total revenues out of percentage rent. And I would think about that in your longer-term modeling that we should keep that level pretty consistent. It is front-end loaded. So the majority of what we recognize in percentage rate income will occur in the first quarter. We will have more percentage right through the balance of the year but the majority is in the first quarter. 
Anthony Powell: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Lizzy Doykan with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. 
Lizzy Doykan: Good morning. I just was curious about the G&A line item that was revised up by $1 million for full year. And not too meaningful but just wanted to see what drove the increase in expectations there and if anything could be noted as recurring or if we should expect more variability to that as we get through the year?
Mike Mas: Thanks, Lizzy. Really just a lot of odds and ends in the non-salary line items as we look out for the balance of the year, and kind of, tightened up our reforecast. It is what it is. And we just kind of, refining that estimate for everybody looking forward. There's -- I wouldn't identify any trends any way or the other. It's really just a refined outlook. 
Lizzy Doykan: Got it. Thank you. And I was hoping to get more details on a couple of the projects you had discussed at the opening just on the development in the New York metro area and the master planned community in Metro Houston, understand if you are waiting to share more details once you're able to add it to the pipeline. But just seeing if there's anything unique to each of those projects that you think you could find in other opportunities in the near future? And what particularly drew you in about the markets for these specific projects? 
Nick Wibbenmeyer: Absolutely. Thank you for the question, Lizzy and good morning. Yes, as it relates to the New York asset at this point we can't disclose more. We have not yet closed. But as I mentioned in my opening remarks we're excited about the opportunity and looking forward to in the not-too-distant future being able to give more details. As it relates to the Houston opportunity, we did close on that earlier this week and are very excited about that project although again relatively small approximately $10 million. It is located within a very thriving master planned community. So to be one of the only retail component servicing that community is really a blessing. And those are the type of opportunities we're looking for where we know we have a very captive audience. And as I referenced we do plan on expanding that opportunity in the future. And so we do think there'll be future phases to grow that opportunity as demand continues to increase in that submarket. And so excited to bring that on board and again share even more details next quarter when it comes into our end process. And then just generally speaking, as I said, development is never easy. And we're well aware of some of the headwinds that are out there facing development and how challenging it is. But as I said, we have the three cornerstones that are critical especially in this environment to execute, which is the right expertise the right capital and the right relationships. And grocers are continuing to expand. They've had very good years. We have great relationships with the grocers across the country and we continue to evaluate really coast-to-coast. Those opportunities one-by-one and the team is doing a great job of figuring out, which ones we think we can help with, which ones we think we want to own long term, and therefore deploy our human and financial capital.
Lisa Palmer : And Lizzy our overall development strategy just follows our investment strategy. And we want to invest in shopping centers that have a long-term sustainable competitive advantage, where we're going to be able to grow NOI over the long term. And these two developments New York and in Houston fit that criteria. 
Lizzy Doykan: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Wes Golladay with Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Wes Golladay : Hey, guys. Good morning everyone. I just want to stick with Bed Bath & Beyond. I think you said you five of the 10 rejected and you're not going to get any rent from those assets at the beginning of this quarter. But once you get rent during a liquidation, why they liquidate the inventory, or have they been doing that I guess behind the scenes? 
Mike Mas : Yes, so [indiscernible] rent you obviously would lose and we planned -- and we estimate that to be about $0.5 million less given what they were paid current through first quarter and what we will lose into the filing date. And then post petition for the five that have not yet been rejected we would continue to collect rent through their -- through the event that may or may not happen, which could be an assumption of the lease in the bankruptcy itself or a future rejection. As we indicated, we've -- at the midpoint of our guidance, we've accommodated for the worst-case scenario, which would be a full liquidation of the chain. We think we have some pretty -- we know we have some pretty good locations. The ones that have not yet been rejected we like all of our opportunities we really like those and there's -- which also tells us there's a chance that they could be picked up in option. So we'll be paying very close attention to the proceedings there. But that's -- hopefully that helps you think about the financial impact of Bed Bath.
Wes Golladay : Yes, it does. And then sometimes I remember at Sears at kind of unlocked some bigger projects for you some larger scale redevelopments. Anything -- any of that potential here with Bed Bath? And what is your hurdle now with today's capital markets for some bigger projects?
Alan Roth: I'll start with Bed Bath and let Lisa or Mike answer the capital question but -- the short answer Wes I appreciate you asking that. There's one Bed Bath that we are evaluating the merits of whether or not we want to entertain redevelopment but generally speaking this really is just a re-leasing exercise for us as all it is. 
Lisa Palmer : And with regards to redevelopments, I mean, that follows and flows directly with our development strategy. We look at those in the same manner. If we can use our and invest our cash accretively and if we are improving and enhancing an existing center and fortifying that future NOI growth, while getting a really attractive investment return we'll do as much of that as we can.
Wes Golladay : Got it. Thanks for the time everyone.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the Floris Van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please proceed with your question.
Floris Van Dijkum: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Your shop space is the most valuable portion of your portfolio was I think, Lisa, you've alluded to in the past as well. And the beauty is you have over 50% of your ABR comes from the shop space and a big trend two-thirds of your SNO pipeline in the shop space. Could you remind us again what your peak shop occupancy was? And where do you think that could go over the next two, 2.5 years or so?
Mike Mas : Hey, I'll do the reminder and I'll let Alan color up his -- what he thinks about our guide -- our glide path to achieving it. We peaked over 93% from a shop occupancy perspective. That was at a point in time when I think we would all look at each other and agree that our portfolio is better today than it was then. I think even the demand -- supply and demand characteristics of today are better. I'm not promising you that we will significantly outsee those peaks, because those are pretty high levels of occupancy, but 93.3% I think was in that area was our peak. 
Alan Roth: Yes. And as you know, we're at 92.1% right now. And I would just go back to the pipeline of really great deals that are falling up. And I'd put on top of that, our upcoming Vegas ICSC show that's here at the end of May, the amount of meetings the teams already have scheduled and the attendance that we anticipate from the retail community is really strong. So, we have the runway and we're planning to continue to set our sights high. 
Lisa Palmer: And I appreciate you, remembering that we say that. And I think what's really important when you think about, where we sit today versus that peak occupancy. And you've heard us say this, really coming out of COVID. We feel really good about the health of our in-place shop tenants. We believe that there -- it's as strong as ever. And what makes shop space so valuable, is the fact that there's change as it happens in our business. We say that all the time. There's always going to be some tenant failures. But what makes that so valuable, is that we're able to replace it relatively quickly versus an anchor box, with a lot less capital and the rents are higher. And so that's what makes that space so much more valuable. We're able to continue to get really good annual contractual rent steps, in the shop space in addition to, leasing spreads upon new leasing. And that's what makes that space so valuable to us. We are not afraid to shop space. That's what you've heard me say, over and over again. 
Floris Van Dijkum: No, I appreciate that. Maybe if you can -- you've talked about the rent bumps. And to me that's one of the most underrated aspects of the business, and sort of the cruising speed that that produces. You mentioned, that almost all of your shop space has fixed rent bumps, are you getting 3% rent bumps? And how do you see that your cruising speed evolve, as you sign new leases? 
Alan Roth: Yes, Floris, I appreciate that question. Yes, we are having more success at higher rent bumps. And I would tell you historically, if you were to rewind the clock pre-COVID, I would say, our teams are probably asking for anywhere between 2.5% and 3%, in the shop leasing sector. And now we're starting at 3% to 4% depending on the circumstances or even in some cases higher. And so it has evolved. I do think it's become a bit more of a commonplace of where we are. And for the foreseeable future, I certainly expect us to continue down that path. 
Floris Van Dijkum: Thanks. Maybe last but not least, just I hear, Wegmans might be coming to Connecticut. Any chance that you guys might be involved in that? 
Lisa Palmer: I'm looking at, Alan. 
Alan Roth: We are not involved in that, Floris. Sorry, I didn't know who was going to answer that whether it was Nick or myself. But we're hearing the same rumors. So, they'll be great for the Connecticut community, if they end up making that happen. 
Floris Van Dijkum: Thanks. That’s it for me.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Mike Mueller: Thanks. So for the two questions. The first one, what are the characteristics of the 7% to 10% of leases where you're not getting the rent escalators? I think you talked about 90% or 93% before. So, the ones where you're not getting it. And then, as we look at your development redevelopment pipeline, I think it's like $50 million new $250 million redevelopment. We're thinking about the shadow pipeline, what's the mix going forward in the shadow pipeline? Is it -- does it have a healthy component about new development opportunities as well?
Alan Roth: Hi, Mike. This is Alan. I'll answer the first part. It's pretty simple. It's simply options that are getting exercised that don't have embedded rent steps. That's the 7% to 10% you mentioned. I'll take it to Nick. 
Nick Wibbenmeyer: Mike, as it relates to the second part of your question, I appreciate it. And you're absolutely, right. I mean as we continue to push forward, we're always pruning our portfolio and looking for opportunities to reinvest in it. And we've given you some visibility, on some of the opportunities in our investor deck, as it relates to those future redevelopments. But clearly, I can't disclose sort of the same level of detail on potential ground-up developments that, we don't yet own. And so I'll tell you our shadow pipeline is very focused on that mix, including ground-up developments. 
Mike Mueller: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Ronald Kamdem: Great. Just a couple of quick ones. Just trying to understand over the sort of the recent events with the banking system, if there's been sort of any ripple effects of the business? And I'm thinking of it in 2 or 3 different ways. One is as you guys are thinking about this future redevelopment pipeline opportunities of $115 million to $150 million I see in the presentation does anything change about your timing or conviction to getting those done? And the other piece of it is obviously on the acquisition front have you seen sort of more activity? You guys are in a great liquidity position does that create opportunity? And then I'd love to hear from a tenant perspective. Clearly, the bad debt is feeling pretty good. It went down in the guidance but are tenants sort of talking about it feeling it? Just trying to understand if there's any ripple effects we should be thinking about? Thanks.
Lisa Palmer: Look Ron I'll start and Alan can hit the tenant piece and Nick may add some color. But generally speaking we have not seen any impacts yet from whichever word you want to use to describe, what's happening in the banking market right now crisis turmoil certainly some challenges. I'll remind you from our own personal perspective we're using free cash flow to fund that. And we knock on wood do not have any challenges or issues with access to capital beyond that. So then it becomes how are we thinking about an underwriting the new leasing that's associated with our developments. And I think as you know, we are very disciplined with our development program. We don't do speculative development and we're not going to start a new development until we have real visibility to signed leases. And we're as we talked about we continue to try to look around the corner and see if there are signs of softening or impacts to the business and we have not seen it yet. And development is not something you just flip the switch on or off. They take -- it's a cycle. It takes some time. And it's an important part of our growth profile. And we have developed through cycles in the past successfully and we expect that we will continue to do the same. We're just a little bit more cautious as we think about our underwriting and I think that that's appropriate and prudent. 
Alan Roth: And Ron from a tenant perspective the short answer is no. We're just simply not hearing that at the property and portfolio level. That said, our team is utilizing currently on a proactive basis and enhancing programs that we started during COVID to support our tenants. And so, we've got a tenant mentorship program. We do webinars for them. We've got this proprietary merchant success toolkit. And so we're prepared to not only proactively deal with that, but should that tide turn have the resources there for our retailers to partner with them and help them through that process.
Lisa Palmer: I'll jump back and I apologize I missed your acquisition question. We've been saying, it we are on our front feet. We believe that we are really well positioned to take advantage of any dislocation in the market and compelling opportunities. As we've discussed, we haven't seen a lot come to market, but we're ready if they do. We have the capital. And as Nick said, when he answered the earlier question as long as we are able to invest that and acquire accretively. And it's equal or accretive to our quality and our growth rate we're poised to act. 
Ronald Kamdem: Great. And then just my last one. Just any quick updated thoughts on the Kroger Albertsons situation and views for the company. Thank you.
Lisa Palmer: I think if you were to go back and probably read my answer from the last quarter, it would say the exact same thing I'm going to say right now, and that is we don't have any information that you don't have. We have really good relationships with both of them and it just continues to unfold. The either way it goes, I think is something that will be good for us. For some reason the merger doesn't go through. We have two really good grocers in really good locations and it will be business as usual. If the merger does go through, you'll have a larger operator, with greater scale, greater ability to invest back into their business. And we feel really good about our locations and our real estate for those that may be part of their divestiture plan.
Ronald Kamdem: All right. One more sorry I had in my notes I missed it. But -- so we've been hearing about sort of the insurance costs and premiums on property in Florida, other markets and so forth. Clearly you guys -- you charge some of that back to the tenant. But are you guys -- how are you guys thinking about that at all? Has that come up? What's the thinking there?
Mike Mas: Hey Ron, it's Mike. Yes, absolutely thinking about it. With the recent renewal behind us, the team did an extraordinary job renewing our policy, but not without a little bit of pain. The markets are very difficult. They're challenging. We have, from a results perspective, we're planning -- we're expecting about a 15% to 20% increase in that line item. More on that in a second. But our access to insurance I think is better than most given our scale, our quality, our moss track record, the way we maintain and think about our properties. So that is a kudos to the team, because access at a small scale level is challenging today, not just about price but about access. With respect to that 15% to 20% increase in the line item, it is a relatively small component of the tenant's rent. So when you think about the bleed or the pass-through, we can pass it through. It is through our lease contracts, we will pass that through. It's in the neighborhood of $0.10 a foot to a tenant. So again, it's a pretty small component. So we feel like we've mitigated that risk or challenge to our forward growth and again, I think time will tell when and if the insurance markets soften. But today it's challenging.
Ronald Kamdem: Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.
Greg McGinniss: Sorry. I was muted. Just wanted to talk about the transactions and potential development pipeline, again just for a couple of points of clarification. Is the $90 million cited from the New York Metro area development inclusive of acquisition and development costs? Similar question for Houston, and whether you need additional land acquisitions for future development phases there, if you're securing that with that first investment?
Nick Wibbenmeyer: Sure. So, it's speaking to New York, yes, that's all encompassing all costs. So that would be the acquisition cost of the property as well as future investment to build it out in its entirety. So that's all encompassing the future investment for that opportunity. And then the second part is, I want to make sure I understand it. I believe you were asking about the Houston opportunity. Are we comfortable with the current phase if the future phases don't happen? We are. And so we would never purchase an opportunity if we weren't comfortable ultimately just owning it as is where is. But that being said, given its small scale we are hopeful. And we do have an expectation that future phases will be added. But if they don't we're very comfortable owning what we purchased and building it and have tremendous demand already for the retail space we anticipate building.
Greg McGinniss: Yes. Sorry, I was also saying for the Houston, whether you'll need to acquire additional land for future phases or if you're still carrying that with the $10 million.
Nick Wibbenmeyer: Great question. Yes we have control over adjacent property. And so as part of this acquisition it also gave us extended control over adjoining property that we're focused on for future phases. So this acquisition is just for the portion of property we're going to build Phase I on. But we do have definitive control over the adjacent property for future phases.
Greg McGinniss: Okay. Great. And then what are the targeted returns on these development projects that make the additional risk worthwhile maybe versus something like redevelopment. I mean I know you've – Lisa you said that you're not taking risky investments here, but inherently with development there's got to be a little bit more than where you already have the cash flow. So just curious what expected returns might be.
Nick Wibbenmeyer: Yes. No great question. As I said before, we really look at opportunity by opportunity. And so each one of these developments we're analyzing we are definitely looking at what we believe the future value of that asset is to make sure we're comfortable with the ingoing yield. And so to give you an example that Houston asset will be developed at approximately an 8% return. So that gives you one data point of where our eyesight was as it relates to that transaction.
Greg McGinniss: Okay. Great. And just final one for me. Are these investments the type that Lisa was previously referring to? I think it was the Q3 call, at least initially on the Q3 call regarding smaller developers about access to capital. And does that feel like a growing opportunity as bank lending becomes potentially even more scarce going forward? 
Nick Wibbenmeyer: Great question. I mean I would say exactly that the inverse of the banking challenges out there are – it is creating opportunities for us – continued opportunities. As Lisa has mentioned multiple times, we have available capital and we have a desire to play offense. And so there's some quality developers out there that are very capable. They have great relationships and contacts, especially locally. But right now capital is their issue no question. If there's any place that capital is most restricted as we all know right now it's construction lending. And so we have the ability to step in and not only bring capital but bring relationships and expertise to help some of these deals figure out waiting over the goal line. And many times it takes more than just capital. It does take expertise to dig in with them, figure out where we can be cost effective regarding budgeting pricing, et cetera, as well as deal with the retailers as it relates to relationship potentially restructuring transactions. And so we are very engaged with local developers to help fill in wherever the hold may be on these projects that have challenges at the moment.
Lisa Palmer: And I just – I want to reiterate that because I think that's a really important point that Nick just said. Our relationships with the retailers or especially the grocery anchors that are driving a lot of our developments shouldn't be underestimated because they know we can perform. And in times like this that is extremely important and that is also helping us to drive that development pipeline and build it further.
Greg McGinniss: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the floor back over to Lisa Palmer for any closing comments. 
Lisa Palmer: Thank you all. Appreciate your interest in being with us today. And everyone have a nice weekend.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-10 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Regency Centers Corporation Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Christy McElroy, Senior Vice President, Capital Markets. Thank you, Christy, you may begin.
Christy McElroy: Good morning, and welcome to Regency Centers' fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Lisa Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Mas, Chief Financial Officer; Alan Roth, Executive Vice President, National Property Operations and East Region President; Nick Wibbenmeyer, Executive Vice President, West Region President; and Chris Leavitt, SVP and Treasurer. As a reminder, today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements about the company's views of future business and financial performance, including forward earnings guidance and future market conditions. These are based on management's current beliefs and expectations and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. It's possible that actual results may differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements we may make. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements may be included in our presentation today and are described in more detail in our filings with the SEC, specifically in our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filings. In our discussion today, we will also reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. The comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this quarter's earnings materials, which are posted on our Investor Relations website. Please note that we have also posted a presentation on our website with additional information, including disclosures related to forward earnings guidance. Our caution on forward-looking statements also applies to these presentation materials. Lisa?
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Christy, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. 2022 is a really good year for Regency, and we ended it on a high note with solid fourth quarter results on all fronts. Our strong performance is a testament to the quality of our shopping centers, the health and resiliency of our tenants and the hard work of our team.  We enter 2023 with great momentum in our leasing pipelines fueled by strong tenant demand as we continue to have success growing rents across our portfolio. This persistent strength in the operating environment also continues to support the economics of our development and redevelopment projects. We look forward to further growing that pipeline over the next several years. At the same time, it is important to acknowledge that the challenging macroeconomic backdrop is bringing with it more tenant bankruptcies and early store closures, which have been relatively light for the last couple of years. But importantly, our exposure to at-risk tenants is limited. This is not by accident. It is a product of many years of intentionally cultivating our portfolio of neighborhood centers and strong suburban trade areas. And where we do have exposure, we see upside opportunities in getting spaces back and taking advantage of the strong leasing environment. Additionally, with inflation moderating, along with some stabilization in the capital markets, we believe we have more clarity on the impacts to our business from the economic environment than we did three months ago. These factors underscore our conviction in our 2023 outlook. Shifting to the private transaction markets, we are starting to see increased activity. Transaction volumes remain thin, but with financing markets stabilizing and treasuries reversing course, competitive bidding situations are returning for high-quality grocery-anchored centers. We believe this validates our portfolio and our investment strategy as shopping centers with a focus on necessity, convenience and value are more resistant to impacts from economic cycles. A couple of final thoughts before I turn it over to Alan. In addition to the stability and steadiness of grocery-anchored shopping centers, the open-air sector generally has really benefited from structural tailwinds coming out of the pandemic, lifting all boats with the rising tide.  While we do expect those tailwinds to continue, we believe that 2023 can really shine a spotlight on Regency's attributes, allowing us to separate from the pack. These attributes include the quality and locations of our real estate, our tenant credit, our balance sheet strength and liquidity and the hard work and dedication of our amazing team. In our business, you win on the meaningful margin by making solid operating and investment decisions every day that generate steady and sustainable growth. It's how we create value for our shareholders and this is reflected in Regency's long track record of outperformance in cash flow and dividend growth. Alan?
Alan Roth : Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. The retail operating environment remains healthy, and we ended the year with another strong quarter. I'm really proud of our 2022 results.  We had an exceptional year in leasing, helping to drive strong occupancy gains with our leased rate up 80 basis points and our commenced rate up 110 basis points over levels one year ago. Notably, our year-end 2022 same-property lease rate is back to our 2019 level of 95.1%. But make no mistake, we still have room to run and we aim to ultimately get back closer to peak levels of 96% or higher. The primary driver was our record year for shop space leasing ending the year up 200 basis points with our shop lease rate now 70 basis points above 2019. I am especially proud of the shop occupancy recovery considering the many challenges we faced during the pandemic. Our tenant retention rate remains above historical averages, bad debt as a percent of revenues is back to pre-COVID levels. And importantly, our GAAP and net effective rent spreads were in the mid-teens for the year due to our team's accomplishments of achieving initial cash rent spreads north of 7%, embedding contractual rent steps in the majority of our leases and maintaining our track record of judicious leasing capital spend. All of these positive trends and the progress we've made contributed to another strong year of same-property NOI growth of 6.3%, excluding COVID-related reserve collections and term fees. At year-end, our signed but not occupied pipeline of 230 basis points represents more than $34 million of annual base rent, giving us positive momentum into 2023. Importantly, as leases commence, we continue to replenish this pipeline with newly executed leases. We have seen strong tenant demand continuing in the New Year, and our LOI and lease negotiation pipelines remain full. Our most active categories include restaurants, health and wellness, veterinary, grocers and off-price. We are hearing from top national retailers that their appetite to expand outpaces the quality inventory available today which bodes well for Regency's high-quality portfolio. As we all know from recent headlines, tenant bankruptcies and early store closures will be more impactful as we think about move-outs in 2023. Among retailers that have recently filed for bankruptcy, Party City comprises only 20 basis points of ABR over 6 stores, and we have only one Regal Cinema, which is less than 10 basis points of ABR.  In the context of Bed Bath & Beyond's recently announced store closures, at year-end, we had 11 stores comprising 60 basis points of ABR. We had one of those expire naturally in January, and of the closures announced last week, we had five locations on the list. Within our 2023 guidance range, we've embedded assumptions for credit loss associated with these bankruptcy filings and store closure announcements which Mike will discuss in more detail. But all of that said, we believe our overall exposure to at-risk tenants is relatively limited. Our current tenant base is healthier than ever as a result of being intentional in the centers that we own and thoughtful in our merchandising process. And whatever the outcome of the at-risk tenants, we feel really good about the quality of our real estate. Tenant bankruptcies are a normal part of our business. And to the extent we get stores back from underperforming retailers, we have opportunities to mark-to-market rents and upgrade the merchandising mix at our centers. To that end, our teams are already negotiating with replacement tenants at higher rents for all of the known closures. In summary, our strong Q4 results and the trends we are experiencing today provide positive momentum into 2023. Nick?
Nick Wibbenmeyer : Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone. Last year, we successfully executed on our development and redevelopment strategy. Even with pressures from rising construction costs, we continue to achieve solid returns on our investments that will provide earnings accretion in years to come. To that end, we completed more than $120 million of projects with over $100 million of those completions in the fourth quarter. These include East San Marco, our public-anchored ground-up development here in Jacksonville.  The property is 100% leased and outperformed original expectations on all metrics, including timing, cost and rents. Carytown Exchange in Richmond, Virginia is another public-anchored ground-up development. We split this project into two phases during the pandemic and recently completed construction on the second phase. We've had great leasing success at Carytown with tenants such as Torchy's Tacos, Jenny's Ice Cream, Burton's Grill and Starbucks. Preston Oaks is the redevelopment of an HEB-anchored center in Dallas. We were able to significantly upgrade the center in the merchandising mix by adding vibrant new shop tenants, including Mendocino Farms, Heyday and Everybody, and the property is now 100% leased. Out at Serramonte Center, we completed the first two phases of our redevelopment project during the fourth quarter. These phases included the interior mall renovation as well as the addition of Chick-fil-A and Starbucks outparcels. Future phases of this project, including the addition of two exterior buildings and the redevelopment of the former JC Penney space are expected to start in the second half of 2023. In addition to our completions, we've also made great progress on our in-process development and redevelopments, which totaled $300 million at year-end. Highlights include our Whole Foods-anchored Town & Country redevelopment in Los Angeles. We discussed this project in detail a quarter ago, but construction has commenced in the fourth quarter and demolition of the former Kmart building is nearly complete.  Additionally, at our Glenwood Green development in Old Bridge, New Jersey, construction is on schedule with Target's anticipated opening later this year, and we expect Shoprite to open in early 2024. The team continues to do an excellent job of managing costs and keeping our projects on time and on budget. In total, we believe our accretive development and redevelopment program remains on track to deliver $15 million of incremental NOI in 2023 and 2024.  Beyond our in-process projects, I'm really encouraged by the progress we're making growing our shadow pipelines. We're focused on building our pipelines through sourcing new ground-up development projects, new redevelopment projects through value-add acquisitions, as well as continuing to unlock redevelopment opportunities in our existing portfolio. We also continue to engage meaningfully with developers that are facing financing challenges, which could create additional joint venture opportunities. In totality, we have the key ingredients necessary to grow our program, including robust tenant demand, long-standing retailer relationships, experienced development teams in top markets around the country. Importunately, we have the ability to self-fund this growth with free cash flow. We believe the combination of these capabilities are unequaled, and we look forward to sharing additional details as we advance these opportunities. Mike?
Michael Mas: Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through some highlights from our Q4 and full year results, then walk through our 2023 guidance and assumptions before ending with some color on our balance sheet position.  Our strong performance last year was underpinned by growth in NOI and more specifically from base rent growth. Excluding the collection of 2020 and 2021 reserves, which I'll refer to today as COVID collections, we delivered same-property NOI growth of 5.8% in the fourth quarter and 6.3% for the full year. Again, most importantly, we saw a 3.6% contribution from base rent growth in 2022, accelerating to 4.8% in the fourth quarter. This growth in base rent over the last year has been driven by contractual rent steps, mark-to-market on re-leasing, increases in occupancy and commencement of rent from redevelopment projects. As Alan mentioned, our leased occupancy rate is now back to pre-pandemic levels, but our eyes are set even higher. COVID collections were about $2 million in the fourth quarter and totaled $20 million for the year. That's down from $46 million in 2021. During the fourth quarter, we converted another 2% of our tenants back to an accrual basis of accounting from cash, and as a result, recognized nearly $5 million of non-cash income from the reversal of straight-line rent reserves. We ended the year with 7% of our tenants remaining on a cash basis of accounting. For uncollectible lease income, in 2022, we were close to our historical average of 50 basis points on current year billings by nearly all metrics but for some limited exposure to higher profile potential bankruptcies, our in-place tenancy is about as strong as it's ever been. Looking ahead to 2023 and after excluding COVID collections, we are guiding to core operating earnings per share growth of close to 4% year-over-year at the midpoint. We'd like to point you to Slides 5 through 8 in our earnings presentation, which I'm certain you'll find extraordinarily helpful as you work through our outlook.  We expect same property NOI growth, excluding COVID collections of 2% to 3%, which is the largest positive driver of earnings into 2023. The primary contributor continues to be base rent growth, driven by embedded rent steps, rent growth from new leasing and shop space commencement as well as the delivery of completed redevelopment projects. Importantly, our same-property NOI guidance range also assumes credit loss impact of roughly 75 to 100 basis points from anticipated tenant bankruptcies and early store closures, including from those tenants that Alan discussed. This credit loss impact includes an assumption that current year uncollectible lease income will be modestly above our pre-pandemic average of 50 basis points as well as the potential for occupancy to end the year flat to lower -- should bankruptcy-driven move-outs occur. Again, this range excludes any impact from COVID collections, which I'll discuss in a minute. As you think about reconciling NAREIT FFO of $4.10 last year to a guided midpoint of $4.07 in 2023. Remember that this metric continues to be significantly impacted by COVID era accounting adjustments, including the collection of rents previously reserved as well as the impact on non-cash revenues from converting tenants from cash to accrual.  Our operating fundamentals continue to strengthen, as they have in 2022 and as they are expected to continue this year. And these pandemic-related items can mask our true growth in cash earnings. It's important to take this a step further this morning as these two items meaningfully impact year-over-year comparability. First, we are anticipating lower COVID collections of $3 million in 2023 compared to $20 million last year. And second, we are also anticipating lower non-cash revenues of $36 million at the midpoint in 2023 compared to $47 million in 2022. Please note that we increased our full year non-cash revenue guidance from $30 million a quarter ago to account for new information, including an assumption that we will continue converting tenants to accrual accounting in 2023, as well as the likelihood that we will recognize accelerated below-market rent amortization triggered by the potential for bankruptcy-related store closures. This is why we focus on core operating earnings, which strips out the noncash adjustments and also why we provide same-property NOI excluding COVID collections. With this added transparency, you can better see the underlying positive growth. Again, I encourage you to use the materials in our earnings presentation, as I'm certain you'll find it very helpful in evaluating these impacts. The good news is that we are fast approaching the point where these COVID-related impacts will no longer create meaningful noise in our reported results. To finish and to pivot from guidance, we feel great about how we are positioned from a balance sheet perspective with one of the strongest in the REIT sector at a time when it matters most. Our leverage is at the lower end of our targeted range of 5 times to 5.5 times debt-to-EBITDA. And we expect to generate free cash flow north of $140 million this year, self-funding our development and redevelopment commitments.  While the financing markets have moved in our favor over the last 3 months, we have no need to access the capital markets this year. Our revolving credit line was undrawn at year-end, and we have no unsecured debt maturities until mid-2024. Our liquidity position and maturity profile provide us the ability to remain patient and act when we need and walk to. With that, we look forward to taking your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Goldsmith : Good morning. Thanks for taking for my questions. You have this nice chart in your presentation where you outlined the factors that drive your long-term organic same-property NOI growth algorithm of 2.5% to 3% to your 2023 guidance of same property NOI growth without termination fees or collections of reserves 2% to 3% is generally consistent with that. So maybe you can reconcile your long-term algorithm with what you're expecting this year. Where are the moving pieces? And just does that mean that 2023 is setting up as a Regency average year? Thanks. 
Michael Mas : Good question, Michael. Thank you for that. Let me color that up, and I think you'll find that the algorithm still is intact. We are anticipating north of 3% growth this year and the also important base rent line item. And that's largely being driven by the tremendous activity that the leasing team delivered, and we highlighted on the call, 200 basis points of percent lease coming out of the small shop arena total, 110 basis points of commenced occupancy increases really driving good solid base rent growth. Rent steps are playing a contribution there. Rent spreads from 2022 into 2023 redevelopment contribution. So all of those elements as you highlighted in our algorithm are there. That being said, there are some items that are dragging us down in 2023, one of which is our credit loss reserve. So a touch higher on a sequential basis, 2023 over 2022. I spoke to that in the prepared remarks, we are accounting for and providing for the potential for bankruptcies, which would be in excess of what we experienced last year.  And then there is a slight drag coming from the net recoveries line item as well. You may have noticed that, that spiked in the fourth quarter. It's been a little bit elevated for the year, and some of that won't recur going into next year. So on balance, I feel like the algorithm is still in place. Regency has set up extraordinarily well to deliver upon that growth profile. And we still have room to run from a leasing perspective and seeing that north of 3% base rent growth in '23 is a real positive identifier.
Michael Goldsmith : And my follow-up is on the (inaudible) pipeline. Are you able to quantify how much is in there? And is that going to be realized by the end of 2023? Or is that a 2024 type of event?
Michael Mas : Let me start and if Alan wants to provide any color, he'll jump in. It's roughly $35 million of ABR. You can call that 4% of our in-place rents. So that's -- I'm speaking to the 230 basis points of SNO from a timing perspective, Michael, about 75%, 80% of that should be online by the third quarter of this year. And nearly all of it, in fact, by year-end, I think we're in the 90% area for year-end.
Michael Goldsmith : Got it. Thank you very much. Good luck in '23.
Michael Mas: Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question is from Ki Bin Kim with Truist. Please proceed with your question.
Ki Bin Kim : Thanks. Good morning. So when you look at the inventory space that is left to lease across your portfolio, how would you describe the quality or leasability compared to what is currently occupied? Meaning there's always typically space in every center that's always harder to lease. So just trying to -- I'm just trying to calibrate our expectations going forward.
Alan Roth : Ki Bin, it's Alan. I would look to our pipeline to answer that question and tell you that it's still full with a tremendous amount of activity that's following on the heels of a really strong 2022 year. So -- by and large, as we said, at 95.1% leased, we're setting our eyes higher, and we believe we can and will get back to 96%-plus and the quality space that remains will certainly allow us to do that coupled with the great merchandising activity that remains in our pipeline.
Ki Bin Kim : And as you've reached 95% and on your way to 96%, like you mentioned, what do you think that means for lease spreads going forward? I know it's not always linear, meaning the more you're occupied, the higher spreads you get, but just trying to understand that dynamic a little better.
Alan Roth : Yeah. I think we're shooting for high single digits is kind of how we look at that, Ki Bin. Feel again, really confident in doing that. But as you know, there's a lot of levers that also go into that cash rent spread and that includes embedded rent steps as well as our approach to how we spend our capital. And so collectively, again, I think we feel confident with the trajectory and the path that we're going down.
Ki Bin Kim : Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.
Greg McGinniss : Good morning. I realize it hasn't been that long since the Bed Bath store closure announcement, but I'm hoping you might have a few points of clarification. One is on -- you discussed higher rents, just curious how much higher? And then how many break backfills are you looking at versus demising and what type of downtime should we expect on those?
Alan Roth : Yeah, Greg. No fun to be talking about bankruptcies again. But we have 10 stores that do remain that represent 50 basis points of ABR. We have five stores that were on the closure list. And again, we feel really good not only about those five stores, but the totality of whatever may come of the Bed Bath portfolio. From a mark-to-market perspective, we think we're in the 15% to 20% range. And I think when you think about bankruptcies that have happened in the past such as Sports Authority, Toys "R" Us, Stein Mart, those were 40,000 to 45,000 square foot stores, and the Bed Bath stores are generally in the 30,000 square foot range. And so that really provides a much wider pool of interested users that, for the most part, will not require downsizes or splits, which again, I think will play a part in your capital question. We are negotiating deals for all of our known closures. And in some instances, we're even running what I'll call an RFP in the interest of appropriately managing demand and relationships. But time will tell. They obviously just recently announced that equity raise. So we're staying close to it, and we're staying active and aggressive on all of our spaces.
Greg McGinniss : Okay. And one follow-up on you mentioned the developers facing financing challenges and those who might end up doing deals with. I'm just curious kind of how big of an investment are you looking at on some of those assets? And how close are you to getting any of those deals done?
Nick Wibbenmeyer : Great question. This is Nick. As you can imagine, it's a wide range of investment. As you guys have seen the capital markets, especially for construction debt for local developers is effectively frozen. And so we are very well situated, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, with our retailer relationships, combined with our impressive team around the country and clearly our available capital.  And so -- we are, I would say, moving from coffee conversations that started 90 days ago into real dialogue and real negotiations and analysis of these opportunities. And so I do feel like it's the early stages, but the early stages are very important to growing a meaningful pipeline. And some of these projects that you could appreciate when you look at our historical development program of scale. So excited about it.
Greg McGinniss : Okay. Thank you for your time. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Floris Van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please proceed with your question.
Floris Van Dijkum : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe, I guess, I've got two for you. Number one, maybe if we can get a little bit more detail on the $0.21 nonrevenue mark-to-market. And presumably, some of that is related to some of your troubled retailers. If you can give us a little bit more color on that and also in particular, what sort of mark-to-market opportunities would you have if you get some of the space back, and I'm particularly thinking about properties such as Buckhead Station, South Beach, University Garden, some of your properties that have some of this Bed Bath exposure.
Michael Mas : Sure, Floris. I think you're asking about the accelerated below-market rent associated with the potential to get back anchor spaces. So we do -- we have incorporated a touch of that income into our expectations. It is a fluid situation, as you know. And those -- what we have incorporated into our guidance is, call it, roughly $3 million or so of anticipated accelerated amortization. Those would be tied to what we believe to be the potential for the Bed Bath & Beyond scenario to play itself out in which we may get back those spaces. To Alan's point, I mean it's really a direct reflection of Alan's point that it's about a 15% mark-to-market opportunity on those units, which that below-market rent would indicate exists. And again, those original amounts were put up at the time of acquisition of the shopping centers and time will tell on the true economics where we end up.
Floris Van Dijkum : Great. And then maybe a follow-up, a little bit more. Obviously, your not all spaces created equally, your small shop rents are double your anchor rents typically. I note that your small shop occupancy, leased occupancy went up 60 basis points. Can you talk about your physical occupancy a little bit? And also maybe talk about where you see -- I know you've mentioned that total occupancy in the portfolio gets to 96%. Where can small shop occupancy go? Where was the peak in the past?
Lisa Palmer : Before Alan answers this question, I feel like I have to jump in and say I appreciate that you recognize that all space is not equal. And I would say it's not just from small shop and anchor all retail is not created equally, and high-quality space actually is very different and command, but much different rents than those of lesser quality. So I appreciate you making that recognition, Floris. I'll let Alan answer your question more specifically.
Alan Roth : Yeah. Really well said, Lisa. I think the only thing left to answer there, Floris, is where is the peak occupancy? And that's at 93% historically. And so we are at 92% on a shop occupancy perspective right now and again, as I said, we feel really good about kind of where our pipeline is and what remains in our ability to not only get there, but hopefully, we can exceed that.
Floris Van Dijkum : Thanks. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from [Indiscernible] with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could walk through the assumptions behind base rent growth seeing that as the primary driver of 23% same-store NOI guidance. What exactly are you assuming for contractual rent in-place rents and then the commencement of rent from redevelopment? Or if you could just talk about your strategy on how you're balancing the Street?
Michael Mas : Sure. I'll walk through the components and Lisa or Alan may provide some color from a strategy perspective. North of 3% base rent growth, you got it right, and we're excited about that opportunity in 2023. It's really coming from a combination of several things, as I talked about earlier with Michael's question with respect to our NOI growth algorithm.  So rent steps, that's the bread and butter of our growth profile. It's been a -- the positive contribution has been in the 140 basis point range for a long time, and we're trying with every lease to move that needle as we continue to embed higher and higher contractual rent increases. Rent spreads continue to be a positive contribution. You saw a 7%-plus outcome in 2022. That will translate to growth in '23. That will be in that call it, 75 basis point area. It depends on timing from that perspective on rent commencement from a delivery perspective. What we're really excited about is now that we're starting to contribute from a redevelopment perspective. We've talked about this $15 million of NOI that's coming online from our redevelopment and development pipeline. A lot of that is from the redevelopment pipeline. It will come through our same-property NOI growth line item. We strategically try to deliver 25 to 75 basis points of impact to NOI growth. I will say with this pipeline that we are delivering at this point in time, we should be at the upper end of that range. And then I made some comments in the remarks around our outlook for occupancy. We've made tremendous strides in moving that commenced rate in 2022. We will continue to deliver our SNO pipeline, hopefully, maybe even a little sooner in 2023. But now we're getting into the impact of the credit loss and the BK reserve. So that could be a bit of a dampening impact depending on how the bankruptcies play out over the course of '23. Those would be the contributing factors to face rent growth.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you. Another follow-up, I was wondering what is included in your assumptions for the $65 million of dispositions baked within guidance at a 7% cap rate? Is this just based on what you're seeing in the market? Or is that kind of an estimated -- just an allocation for now? Thanks. 
Michael Mas : It's specifically identified projects. They are actually a collection of assets coming from one of our larger JV portfolio. So that's -- we've long been a -- we've long believed in kind of culling the bottom of our portfolio, whether it's wholly owned assets or JV properties. It's one of the reasons why our exposure to risk is so minimal. It's just Regency's active commitment to calling on a limited basis, lower-quality, nonstrategic, lower-growth assets. So this -- the $65 million is just that specifically identified projects. Note the timing expectations there are an assumption that could move around. But it's just a placeholder for now on those identified projects.
Lisa Palmer : And I'll just add. I appreciate Mike's comments about that. We really do believe that a year like 2023, may really shine a spotlight on that in terms of making sure that we are proactively managing the quality of our portfolio. And we believe that, that really does fortify sustainable NOI growth over the long term.  So while that disposition guidance did come with a 7% cap rate that as Mike said, that's a placeholder. We looked at last year's transactions and just added a little bit of perhaps market movement to that. But more to come, and we'll have more clarity as we move through the year with regards to that market.  But again, it's an important part of our strategy and one that we remain committed to, and I believe has enabled us to deliver same property NOI growth at the higher end of the industry.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Craig Mailman with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Craig Mailman : Good morning. Just want to follow up on the transition of tenants back to accrual accounting from cash. I'm just kind of curious, as we sit here today. I mean, could you just give a little bit of color on what types of tenants you guys move back in the fourth quarter? And of the 7%, maybe what's the probability of moving more and where you think that 7% to move to by the end of the year or what's a more normalized level?
Michael Mas : Sure. Hey, Craig. So we're at 7% at year-end, as I mentioned in the remarks, and that's down significantly. I think the high watermark at the peak of -- in 2020 was 27% of our ABR. The answer to your question of who is that and what is that it's largely just a reflection of who was originally. And that is small shop tenants, more local credit, personal services.  It actually has a bit of a West Coast bias to it now because those are the tenants who are -- who kind of came out of the impacts from it later. And there being very specific requirements that we've set up internally to qualify for conversion. So current on all rent no same deferred billings, and have been current for a period of time around nine months or so is what we anticipate. So they're meeting pretty strict hurdles. And I mentioned on the call, we're extraordinarily satisfied with the quality and health of our tenancy at this point in time. To your point on 2023, we have included about $2.5 million of conversion forecast into our expectations. That is worth about 2% of ABR. So another 2% brings us down to the 5% area. That is probably in the ZIP code of where we -- I think we settle out from a cash basis tenancy perspective. A touch higher than if you were to look over our shoulders years ago, and it's a touch higher than that. But I think 5% given the new standard with respect to the accounting for that impact is about in the ZIP code of where we'll be.
Craig Mailman : That's helpful. And then separately, maybe Lisa going back to your commentary of better visibility today than three months ago. Could you just give a little bit of color on what aspects of the business you feel like you have more visibility on today, whether it's leasing, you talk about the transaction market a bit, tenant credit?  And also, I'm just kind of curious, if you were forced to give guidance three months ago versus today, what -- directionally kind of where we sit today versus three months ago?
Lisa Palmer : Answering it first, it's all of the above. It's actually everything that you pointed to. It's another three months of building the leasing pipeline. It's another three months of seeing how our tenants are performing with sales continuing to rise and at our restaurants and our grocery stores. It's three months of prior -- three months ago, we were seeing literally no activity in the transaction markets, and those are starting to fall, and we're seeing high-quality properties come to the market. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, competitive bidding situations for the types of properties that we want to own.  So it's really all of the above that is just giving us that confidence. I'm looking at Christy and Mike, to make sure that I can answer this question. If I was forced to give guidance thee months ago, I would say it would be similar to what we just did. I just have a lot more confidence and conviction today than I did 3 months ago because of all the reasons that I just stated.
Craig Mailman : Great. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Juan Sanabria : Hi, thank you. Maybe a question for Mike. I was just hoping you could maybe delve a little bit into the expense recoveries that you noted were elevated in the fourth quarter and for the year and how that changes or morphed a bit into '23?
Michael Mas : Sure. Yeah, and you can see the impact in the supplemental, and I appreciate you asking the question and pointing that out. It's about a 160 basis point positive impact in the quarter alone. It is diluted down for the full year to 30 bps. So there's some seasonality actually in that line item in the fourth quarter. We do -- the billings from a recovery perspective in that quarter tend to be on the higher end of the recovery ratio side. You can think of expenses like snow removal, like real estate taxes that just have a bit of a higher collection rate. Another component, it's really a lot of little things, Juan, and I'm going to go through some of them. But one of the larger drivers is also a bit unique. Going back to the Equity One merger and Prop 13 impacts, it took remarkably long for the municipality to get through the supplemental tax billings. And those billings ultimately were expensed as incurred, but then collected later and now you're bringing in some cash basis tenancy impacts here as well.  So thankfully, and gratefully, we've collected all of it in 2022. Some of that being accelerated into the fourth quarter so that's causing a bit of the bump as well. So it's really a combination of those 2 things driving that outsized impact in the fourth quarter. I feel really good about our collection rate. We're in that 85%-plus area from a recovery rate perspective. I would anticipate that holding steady into 2023 as you think about your model.
Juan Sanabria : Great. And then just maybe a sensitive question, but on Amazon, what do you guys think from them across Whole Foods and their other brick-and-mortar concepts with regards to demand for space, appetite for new stores the lack thereof and how you're using your space? And is there any signs of weakness there with regards to foot traffic versus other grocery concepts?
Alan Roth : Juan, I appreciate the question. So look, they're still performing really strong in our portfolio. We have a great relationship, given the abundance of Whole Foods stores that we have in the portfolio. They're expanding, as maybe Nick can touch on a bit in terms of his discussions on new stores and how they're looking at that with our conversations.  But foot traffic is certainly coming back with them, and they remain a great retailer that we really love merchandizing around in terms of the totality of our assets.
Nick Wibbenmeyer : Yeah. Juan, I would just add, as Alan alluded to, there's just -- there's a lot of demand from a lot of our grocers right now to continue to expand around the country. And so that's a lot of what's driving our excitement about future development opportunities is key grocers such as Whole Foods do want to expand. They're performing really well, and we're excited about continuing to grow our portfolio with them and others.
Juan Sanabria : Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Anthony Powell : Good morning. I guess a question on the bad debt assumptions for the year. How much of the 75 to 100 basis points is tied to known situations like Bed Bath & Beyond? And how much more cushion is there in that number?
Michael Mas : Sure. Anthony, it's Mike. Let's talk through maybe scenarios is how I like to think about it from a midpoint, low end and high end. And also, when we think about credit loss reserve, I think it's important to remind everyone, that's a combination of uncollectible lease income or bad debt expense, together with the impact on base rent that could come from a rejection of a lease in the bankruptcy. So it's a combination of base rent in assets as well as the expense line item. From a scenario standpoint, let's start with the midpoint and go from there. We are anticipating what I would call more of a classic reorganization scenario at the midpoint of our range. So in the middle of that 75 to 100 basis points. And by the way, that 75 to 100 is really encapsulating the top to bottom.  So a classic reorganization, Alan gave us some intel and some clarity on what stores have been identified for closure at least. That does not mean that they've been identified for rejection. Nothing's happened at this point. But that scenario would be in the midpoint. You can also be certain to know that a full liquidation scenario of this name would be captured by the low end of our guidance. So we are very comfortable that even with a relatively -- soon to follow filing if that were to happen and a relatively quickly paced liquidation process, we are pretty comfortable here that the low end of our range would capture that scenario. And then the -- and then I'd say, I'd actually extend that midpoint scenario into the upper end. So what may be an unlikely scenario that a lot of good happens and Bed Bath is if there are no closures at all and that they continue as a going concern, frankly, that would be a little bit of an upside to our guided range. Now also recall it's credit loss, so there's bad debt expense. I mentioned in the call, we are a little bit of an increase with respect to 2023 outlook versus 2022 actual performance. So just a little bit more cushion in the plan from a classic bad debt expense perspective. And we'll see how the year progresses. I feel really good, again, about our tenancy, feeling really good about the quality of our merchandising but we all are aware of what potential headwinds there may be out there.
Anthony Powell : And maybe one more on acquisitions. I think, Lisa, you mentioned that you're seeing more bidding processes play out. How do you view your potential to be acquired this year of assets given what you see in cap rates, transaction volume, your own cost of capital?
Lisa Palmer : I'll just point to our balance sheet and the fact that we're generating $145 million of free cash flow. We do have development spend. But even we are able to access the debt markets and to the extent that we leverage that cash flow, even staying leverage neutral within our strategic net debt-to-EBITDA targets, that gives us investment potential north of $200 million.  So we are positioned to be active. It has to be the right opportunity. And you all probably get tired of hearing me say this, right? If it checks the three boxes, we will be active. If it's accretive to earnings, accretive to our future growth rate and accretive to our quality, we're poised to act.
Anthony Powell : Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Mike Mueller : Hi. In your slides, you talked about five redevelopments that could start over the next, I think, it's like 12 or 12 to 18 months. Just wondering, how should returns on those look compared to what's already in process today?
Alan Roth : Thank you for the question, Mike. The simple answer is very similar to what we've seen historically. And so our target returns on redevelopments have not changed materially. And so when you look at our ones that we've recently completed and are ones that are in process, we're targeting similar returns for our future redevelopments.
Mike Mueller : Got it. Okay. And then, Mike, I know there are a lot of moving parts with the ins and outs of occupancy. But what does guidance assume for the year and commenced occupancy level?
Michael Mas : I like to think about it in two layers, Mike. And it all kind of -- it's -- I'll summarize as to what I said in the call that it's flat to slightly negative if the bankruptcies were to appear. But when I think about our lease -- our base leasing plan. And again -- and if I think about the SNO pipeline and the fact that we're going to deliver that pipeline, that's a rising level of percent commenced, and that is what's driving that billable base rent line item. However, when you layer in the possibility of bankruptcies, that could lead us in my midpoint scenario to a flat to maybe slightly negative outlook for percent leased. So there's a lot of good news in that occupancy outlook but there's also the potential for some vacancy to come back our way. Not afraid of it to Alan's comments really excited and actively working on re-leasing that space today. But that would be the best outlook on occupancy.
Mike Mueller : So the midpoint, we should think of it as roughly flattish?
Michael Mas : Including the scenario I outlined with respect to a reorganization scenario of the tenant in question.
Mike Mueller : Got it. Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Tayo Okusanya with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Tayo Okusanya : Hi, good morning, everyone. Lisa, thanks for your comments around how you're thinking about acquisitions. You guys also made some comments about the redevelopment pipeline. I'm just curious, just kind of given freshness cost of capital today. How do you guys kind of think about prioritizing or accelerating one versus the other acquisitions, development, redevelopment and as well as share repurchases?
Lisa Palmer : That prioritization has not changed. The best use of our capital has been and will continue to be the developments and redevelopments. We get the best returns. We have a really successful track record of delivering our underwriting and the underwritten returns that we disclosed to you, which are clearly a premium over competitive bidding acquisition market.  At the same time, we do have the capital to invest, as I just stated. And if we are able to check those boxes of accretive to earnings, accretive to quality and accretive to our future growth rate, then we will invest in high-quality shopping centers as well. We've been successful with that. We had quite an active -- really the past two years, we've been successful in closing on shopping centers that check all three of those boxes, some off-market and one or two that were actually competitive bidding as well. And share repurchases, we've had the opportunity to take advantage of what we believe to be a significant dislocation in the market a few times in the history of Regency, and we will continue to use that arrow in our quiver when the opportunity presents itself.
Tayo Okusanya : Great, thank you. 
Operator: Our next question is from Paulina Rojas with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.
Paulina Rojas: Good morning, and -- so transactions are spars and having a retool on pricing, it's more difficult than it was before, but there are still hundreds of millions of dollars of exchanging hands. So what in your assessment of how pricing for your product has changed since, let's say, the peak last year?
Lisa Palmer : I'm going to Paulina, going to -- I'll let Nick handle this as he's -- again, we haven't been active, as you've seen from the results as I said, the market is falling, transaction activity is still pretty thin. But Nick's team is the one along with Barry Argos are really kind of farming those opportunities. So I'll let Nick address that.
Nick Wibbenmeyer : Appreciate it. Thank you for the question, Paulina. I don't have a lot to add. As Lisa said, there just aren't specific data points we can point to yet. However, we do expect here in the next 60 to 90 days as some of these transactions that have come to market and we are seeing real competition for them. There's solid demand for our type of asset, high-quality grocery-anchored assets around the country can continue to be in demand from investors. And so -- we do expect to have some specific data points here in the next, call it, 60 to 90 days as some of these deals close. But we're expecting those to be -- to highlight the quality of our assets.
Paulina Rojas: And can you characterize point to a specific segment of investors that are back at the table that have regained confidence? Because we also hear a lot of institutional investors that are selling product and need to sell product today. So how can you characterize the demand at the margin that you are seeing coming back?
Nick Wibbenmeyer : Again, great question. And again, as these deals close, we'll be able to point to specifically who the buyers were, but what we're seeing and hearing as these -- as our team continues to underwrite and talk about specific transactions is it's really broad-based. And so it's institutional investors around the country. And so as much as we're seeing broad-based in the sellers, we're seeing broad-based and the buyers. And so I can't point to a single institution that's the buyer or the seller right now. It's broad-based in both respects.
Paulina Rojas: And if I can, last one, hopefully short. Where do you think that the CMBS market is for grocery anchored centers today?
Michael Mas : Paul, it's Mike. Hard for us to tell. We're not really a CMBS user. So I'm not as -- as close to or familiar with that market day to day. I will -- for our product, grocery-anchored neighborhood shopping centers that are very resilient, have great quality rent rolls with underwritable tenant credit. I would imagine that, that market would be available to us. I don't know that I would appreciate the pricing of that product.  But it's -- as with most of the credit markets, especially today, it's limited. And borrowers have little less access to debt capital today, but borrowers like Regency with great reputations in the credit market with scale, with quality will have and great relationships. We'll have more access than most.
Paulina Rojas: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Linda Tsai : Hi. Just one quick one. With treasuries reversing course and inflation is starting to abate a little bit, is this showing up in terms of more traffic or transactions at your centers?
Alan Roth: Linda, we're basically flat to 2019. And so we feel really good about the traffic that's there right now. Again, necessity-based retail, and they're performing really well. Our restaurants are performing exceptionally well, as are others. So I think we're back to a pretty steady state right now from a traffic perspective.
Linda Tsai : Thanks. That's it for me. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Ronald Kamdem : Hey. Just two quick ones from me. Just going back to the 96% potential leasing targets. Just curious what we need to see for that to happen. Is that just the current run rate are you seeing? Limit sort of move outs? Just trying to figure out the building blocks, the breadcrumbs to get to that 96% and how achievable that is?
Michael Mas : Well, we know it's achievable as we look over our shoulder in our past, and we feel even better about the quality of the assets we own today than when the last time we achieved that level. So that's how we know it's achievable and where our targets are. You outlined the breadcrumbs. The third element I would give is time. We've talked on previous calls about our ability to lease space at pretty meaningful rates. And we delivered on that in 2022. We added 100 basis points of commenced occupancy. I mentioned the 200 bps of percent lease coming from the small shops.  So time, continued effort by the leasing team, bankruptcies of a material sense will put kind of holes in the bucket that we then need to work our way through. And again, that will only be a matter of time, not if we can lease that space but really win. It's not -- Ron, we're not anticipating that achieving that level, and I'll just say, in 2023, there's going to be more time than 12 months ahead of us to achieve that. But we'll get there in due time.
Lisa Palmer : And I would just add, and setting the bar high, as I expect that our team would deliver that, if not for those bankruptcies, as Alan talked about, our leasing pipeline is really strong. We have a lot of momentum. And my expectation, if we didn't have the hole in the bucket from those store closures and bankruptcies that we know are coming, we have visibility to it. We'd be able to increase occupancy in 2023.
Ronald Kamdem : Great. And then if I could just sneak in a quick one because I haven't heard it. Just any updated thoughts on this, the Kroger Albertsons, how you guys are thinking about the deal and as it relates to Regency?
Lisa Palmer : Yeah. I mean not much has changed. I know that there was a report this morning where they -- I think they publicly stated that they were looking to sell 250 to 300 stores but that's actually not any different. It's just more narrow than what they had said when they first announced the transaction. So we're just going to -- we are in a wait and see what happens. We've got great relationships with both of them. They're not allowed to give us any nonpublic material information, though, so we know what you know. But what we do know is we feel really good about the quality of our real estate and our grocery stores that have Kroger and Albertsons, they're both leading grocers and we believe the combination of the two would be good.  We think that, that would provide them more scale, more ability to invest in both their physical bricks-and-mortar as well as in technology. And if for some reason, it gets blocked, we still feel really good about our real estate, and we have 2 of the leading grocers anchoring our centers.
Ronald Kamdem : Great. Appreciate the disclosures. Thanks. 
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Lisa Palmer for any closing comments.
Lisa Palmer: Just want to thank you all for being with us this morning, and I also want to once again thank the Regency team for a really good 2022. And we look forward to further conversations and great results this year. Thank you all.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-11-04 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to Regency Centers Corporation Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce you to Christy McElroy, SVP of Capital Markets. Thank you, Christy. You may begin.
Christy McElroy: Good morning, and welcome to Regency Centers' third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Lisa Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Mas, Chief Financial Officer; Jim Thompson, Chief Operating Officer; Chris Leavitt, SVP and Treasurer; Alan Roth, Senior Managing Director of the East Region; and Nick Wibbenmeyer, Senior Managing Director of the West Region. As a reminder, today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements about the company's views of future business and financial performance, including forward earnings guidance and future market conditions. These are based on management's current beliefs and expectations and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. It's possible that actual results may differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements we may make. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements may be included in our presentation today and are described in more detail in our filings with the SEC, specifically in our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filings. In our discussion today, we will also reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. The comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this quarter's earnings materials, which are posted on our Investor Relations website. Please note that we have also posted a presentation on our website with additional information, including disclosures related to forward earnings guidance. Our caution on forward-looking statements also applied to these presentation materials. Lisa?
Lisa Palmer: Thank you. Christy. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. We are pleased to report another quarter of solid results. We've continued to see positive operating trends as tenant demand is strong and rent growth remains at healthy levels despite the challenging macroeconomic backdrop. We do recognize that neither we nor our tenants are immune to macro pressures, especially higher levels of inflation, rising interest rates, and lower consumer spending, and this does create some uncertainty in the near term, but the last few years have proven anything, it's the resiliency of our people, assets, and our balance sheet in tough times. It is through a lens of what I would characterize as cautious optimism that we look ahead and we remain confident that we are uniquely positioned to outperform. The demographic profile of our portfolio provides greater cushion for inflationary impacts to be absorbed by consumers and for spending to continue through a softer economic environment. Our dense suburban trade areas also continue to benefit from structural tailwinds stemming from post-pandemic migration patterns and hybrid work, but also by a renewed appreciation for the value of brick and mortar retailing. Additionally, and just as importantly, we are well-positioned to continue to execute on our self-funded growth strategy. While the costs of raising incremental capital have risen meaningfully over the last several months, our strong free cash flow and balance sheet dry powder enable us to continue to invest in our value creation pipeline on an earnings accretive basis without the need to raise new equity capital or sell assets into an illiquid transaction market. We remain focused on further growing our development and redevelopment pipelines and the commencement of our Town and Country project last month is an example of that. Another example is our acquisition of East Meadow Plaza on Long Island, as we bought this as a redevelopment opportunity. And with the backdrop of a more challenging financing environment, we are starting to see more opportunities come to us to co-invest in attractive development projects. On the acquisition side, while we always are looking for compelling opportunities, [bid ask spreads] [ph] remain wide and volumes are low, so it will likely take time to get real price discovery. But regardless of when or where things settle, we do believe there will be less of an impact to values for well-located grocery anchored neighborhood and community centers at the upper end of the quality spectrum. In other words, for the types of assets that we own, but in the meantime, we are fortunate to have the liquidity and balance sheet capacity to take advantage of dislocation or other opportunities that may arise. Finally, as I step back and think about the potential for operating in a more challenging environment or in any environment for that matter, I feel grateful to be leading Regency with the quality of assets and the caliber of people that we have. I believe we are well-positioned to outperform over the long-term, acting as both a safe haven and generating solid and sustainable growth driving total shareholder returns with earnings growth plus dividend. I always like to remind you that I'm proud that we delivered our dividend consistently during the pandemic, even growing it with another 4% increase just announced for the fourth quarter. Jim?
Jim Thompson: Thanks, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. We had another strong quarter and continue to experience healthy operating trends throughout the portfolio. Some of the highlights include continued robust tenant demand as evidenced by achieving our highest quarterly total leasing volumes on record, both in terms of square footage and number of deals executed. A strong leasing pipeline, including over 34 million of annual base rent forecasted from our 240 basis points of leases signed, but not yet commenced. Further occupancy gains as we continue to fill vacant space with percent leased up another 20 bps over the second quarter and up 90 basis points over the prior year. Above average retention rates with record high renewals executed in the third quarter. Healthy cash spreads of 7% and GAAP rent spreads over 13% in the quarter. Continued prudent management of leasing CapEx, resulting in net effective rent growth in the mid-teens, and return to pre-COVID historical levels of current year bad debt as a percent of revenues. Importantly, we're carefully monitoring our portfolio for any signs that these trends are softening, but we remain encouraged by the continued strength and progress we are seeing, leading us to further increase our 2022 same property NOI guidance, excluding prior year collections by 25 basis points to 5.5% at the midpoint. Turning to development and redevelopment. We continue to make great progress on our nearly 400 million of in-process projects around the country. Even with the increases in construction costs that we've seen over the last several years, our average yields have held firm in the 7% to 8% range. Notably, we anticipate roughly 15 million of NOI coming online over the next two years from development and redevelopment projects currently in process. At our new much anticipated Ground-up East San Marco development here in Jacksonville, Publix opened their doors in August and the stores outperforming sales expectations. Leasing demand for the shop space was also very strong as the project is already 100% leased. We've also made significant progress over the last quarter at the Abbott, our redevelopment project in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The first tenant successfully opened and rent commenced in Q3 and we've recently signed a 17,000 square foot lease for the entire fourth floor and have good momentum and interest in the remaining penthouse space. As Lisa mentioned, last month, we commenced construction at the Town and Country Center in Los Angeles located across the street from the Grove and the LA Farmers Market. This long awaited project will include a redevelopment of a former Kmart building into new retail space and approximately 300 luxury mid-rise apartments. We have partnered with a leading multi-family developer who will construct the apartments on a ground lease. Looking ahead, we are very focused on continuing to build our pipeline of value-add development and redevelopment projects by executing on redevelopment opportunities that we have with our existing portfolio, sourcing new redevelopment projects through value-add acquisitions, like our East Meadow and by sourcing new ground-up development opportunities like our recently announced Glenwood Green. This is a key element of our growth strategy and a core competency of Regency. And we believe that the tightening of the financing markets will favor our strong balance sheet and access to capital affording us greater investment opportunities with developers and owners. In closing, I spent the last 42 years of my career learning and growing this business with this incredible company. There isn’t a stronger team or more thoughtfully curated portfolio or shopping centers in this business than what Regency owns today. I have the utmost confidence that our operating and development platforms will continue to thrive under the leadership of Alan and Nick, and I look forward to watching Regency's future successes from the sidelines over the years to come. Mike?
Mike Mas: Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. I'll start by addressing third quarter results, walk through a few changes to our current year guidance, provide some comments on 2023 and touch base on our balance sheet. Same property NOI, excluding prior collection was up 2.6% in the third quarter. This metric continues to be impacted by the noisier comps of uncollectible lease income last year, diluting the growth rate. But as we've indicated previously, we are now back to a more historical run rate on collection losses of about 50 basis points on current year billings. Importantly, base rents contributed 3.9% to that growth rate, reflecting our strong embedded rent steps combined with the progress we've made growing occupancy and marking our rents to market as we convert on our strong leasing pipeline. I'll continue to stress that while we still have some remaining pandemic related accounting anomalies impacting our Same property NOI growth rate, we believe that base rent growth is the best representation of the trends driving our business today. Included within our Q3 results is close to $3 million of prior year reserve collections, now totaling $18 million year-to-date and we have increased our fourth quarter expectations for continued collections by another $2 million bringing our full-year 2022 guidance range to an anticipated total of 20 million. We also converted another 3% of our cash basis tenants back to accrual in the third quarter, resulting in a reversal of straight line rent reserves that contributed another $4.6 million to Nareit FFO. Following these conversions, we now have about 9% of our ABR remaining on a cash basis of accounting. As has been our practice, we have not included any potential fourth quarter conversions in our guidance, but it is possible that we may see another 1% to 2% convert before year end, which could result in an additional straight line rent of $2 million to $3 million on top of what's currently in the 2022 guidance range. We raised our full-year 2022 Nareit FFO range by [$0.075] [ph] at the midpoint [$0.45] [ph] of which was driven by the prior year collections and straight line rent reversals that I just discussed, but most importantly, a large contributor to the increase was also further improvement in core trends, reflected in an increase in Same property NOI growth ex prior-year collections of 25 basis points at the midpoint to a new range of 5.25% to 5.75%.  Our revised core operating earnings per share range of $3.75 to $3.78 excludes the impact of non-cash items and when further backing out the impact of prior collections represents year-over-year growth of 7%. We also made a few tweaks to our transactions guidance, mostly to adjust for the $30 million acquisition of East Meadow, which closed shortly after quarter-end.  This is a value-add opportunity for us, a low going in cap rate, under earning center immediately adjacent to the Stew Leonard's anchored center that we bought as part of our Long Island portfolio late last year. This property is an ideal addition to our future redevelopment pipeline. Looking ahead to 2023, as usual, we will provide full-year guidance in February, but recognizing that we still have some pandemic hangover noise in our numbers, we would like to provide some context as you think about modeling our earnings over the next year. I'd also refer you to Slide 8 of our earnings presentation for additional details. First, with regard to prior collections, an area where we certainly experienced the most dramatic change over the last several years, recall that in 2021, earnings benefited from prior-year collections by $46 million and our current 2022 guidance now implies an impact of $20 million. We're proud of the success we've had collecting those rents, much of which we reserved during the height of the pandemic in 2020. These collections are evidence of the strength of our tenant base, but thankfully, there's not a whole lot left in this bucket. As we look ahead, we only expect to recognize another $3 million next year, related to collections of receivables initially reserved in 2020 and 2021. Beyond those anticipated collections, the impact from a pandemic-related reserves should start to normalize. I'd also like to point-out the impact of non-cash items where our current year guidance of $43 million includes 12 million positive contribution from the reversal of straight line rent reserves. Our 2023 guidance will not include any further impact from conversions. As of right now, we expect total non-cash items, which include straight line rents above and below market rents and amortization of above and below market debt of approximately $30 million for the full-year 2023. Turning to the balance sheet, we remain well-positioned with one of the strongest balance sheets in the REIT sector and were proud to have been recognized for that strength by Moody's, placing us on positive outlook during the third quarter. Our leverage is at 5x net debt-to-EBITDA, which is the lower-end of our target range and we ended the quarter with full capacity on our revolver. We are extremely well prepared whether the future holds further challenging conditions, or increasing opportunities for value-add investment. The debt markets have remained volatile and the rise in treasury rates along with wider credit spreads has meaningfully impacted everyone's cost of new debt capital, but with no unsecured debt maturities until the middle of 2024, we have no need to access these uncertain credit markets in the near term. We can remain patient. In addition, 99% of our pro rata debt is fixed rate and our low leverage and long-dated maturity schedule will help to further suppress any potential negative impacts to our growth rate of marking our debt-to-market in the coming years. With that, I'll turn it back over to Lisa.
Lisa Palmer: Thanks, Mike. Before turning to Q&A, I do want to take a moment to recognize Jim. Jim has been a cornerstone for Regency’s success over the past 42 years. And so, I thank you, Jim, on behalf of our entire company for your dedication and enormous contributions to Regency, building a legacy that will carry forward with Alan and Nick with all that you've taught them. I also thank you for being such a terrific partner to me and to Mike and also to have. So, as a parting gift today for your last earnings call, Alan and Nick will handle the Q&A for you. I wish you all could see a smile right now. Congrats Jim, and enjoy the next chapters. With that, we will open it up for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Goldsmith: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Congratulations, Jim. The leasing environment continues to be strong. Can you talk a bit about your pipeline and the visibility you have into it even as the macro remains uncertain as you said in your prepared remarks? And then on that topic, leased and commenced occupancy continue to move in-line, are construction delays that we've heard about, kind of pushing out the ability to realize some of this leasing faster than maybe at first thought? Thanks.
Lisa Palmer: Thanks, Michael. I'll let Alan address that question.
Alan Roth: Yes, Michael, good morning. The pipeline remains really strong. Strong demand is out there for sure. We've got north of a million square feet of leases that are still in negotiation right now. So, I feel really good about the future. Your last question relative to is construction delays the issue, not really in fact it's actually more permitting delays. And so, it's more on the front-end that we're dealing with. And our teams, whether it's our tenant coordinators in-house that are working on things diligently whether we're engaging expediters from the outside, whether we are doing advanced landlord work on some vacant spaces to really help try and speed that process up, there's a number of different levers that we're certainly working on to help compress those dates, but it is more permit driven than it is necessarily construction driven.
Michael Goldsmith: Is the permitting – is that getting better or worse? Like, is [indiscernible] getting longer or is it narrowing at this point?
Alan Roth: I'm going to choose door number three and say it's staying pretty constant. It hasn't really gotten worse or better, Michael.
Michael Goldsmith: That's helpful. And then as a follow-up, Mike, on 2023, we appreciate the disclosure on Page 8 of the presentation, and your commentary. So, it looks like you're expecting prior year collection and non-cash items in 2023 that are $30 million less than 2022. Can you kind of walk through the assumptions there, what's included with that? And then I believe straight line is not included, so that could be a potential benefit next year, can you just walk through that again? Thanks.
Mike Mas : Yes. I appreciate you noting Page 8 in the deck. It's a very helpful reminder for folks that prior year reserve collections as we highlighted in the prepared remarks aren't expected to recur at the same level that they did in 2022. There’s frankly less to collect. In fact, our unresolved bucket of AR is down to about $5 million and it's largely out west and this has been a theme for us over the last 18 months and we're making – the teams out there are making great progress and we're really happy to see us in the final innings of that. We're only – so 20 million in 2022 on prior collections, we're telling you now to expect about $3 million on that line item next year. So, think about that in the context of 2023 expectations. From a non-cash perspective, that is where the straight line rent impact is included. It's really the conversions that are the outlier, not the recurring nature of straight line rent. So, we had about $12 million of recurring – I'm sorry conversions in 2022. Those obviously won't repeat.  I gave a little bit of color on some anticipated Q4 conversions. Again, 1% to 2% of our ABR could convert in the fourth quarter this year that could lead to another $2 million $3 million of impact in the fourth quarter, be cognizant of that, as well as you think about 2023. And then the $30 million plus or minus guidance on that Page 8 is the combination of straight line rent above below market rent amortization and the amortization of any debt mark-to-market.
Michael Goldsmith: Thank you very much. Good luck in the fourth quarter.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you Michael. And our next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Anthony Powell: Hi, good morning. Just a follow-up question on the lease to commence. How do you expect that to evolve next year as you continue to both leasing and also get new stores open?
Lisa Palmer: Since we're getting into the guidance realm there, I think I'll let Mike address that one.
Mike Mas: Yes. I'll take that Anthony. It's a great question. And we have to be a little careful with respect to 2023 as we talk about guidance. We want to help with as many themes as we can. As you can imagine, we're still putting the finishing touches on our plan. And there's a – that we have some tailwind, which I'd like to talk about in the [SNO pipeline] [ph], but there's certainly some headwinds forming. So, we're going to be patient between now and February. So, I mean, we're fortunate to have this 240 basis point [SNO pipeline] [ph] that we will deliver into 2023. About 75% of that, we anticipate delivering by the middle of next year. We'll deliver all of it by the end of next year for our plan. That's $34 million in total of ABR. Alan mentioned behind that, the million square feet of leasing that's in our pipelines, whether it's in lease negotiation or negotiations of LOIs, that's about six months' worth of activity. We've been carrying that level of activity for quite some time and continue to feel really good about the demand for our space. So, those are really good indicators of how we think about the directionality of occupancy going into 2023. You've heard us also talk about post-pandemic, our recovery pace being in that 100 basis point area from a commence occupancy perspective. I'm really pleased to say that a year ago this time, Q3 a year ago, we're now 80 basis points ahead of where we were at. So, we're delivering space, we're leasing space, we're delivering space, we're really achieving those recovery rates that we had thought we could and that our portfolio deserves. So, the outline, I mean the consideration, Anthony is going to be move-outs. That is when I talk about the finer points of our plan for next year, that will be what really drives our occupancy expectations next year. More to come on that in February, but you would anticipate that some elements like ULI. We are at historical averages now in the third quarter and we anticipate to stay there in the fourth. Does 2023 sound like a historical average year? Those are the considerations we're having. I would anticipate that ULI expectations probably on the margin are modestly expected to be a little higher. And again, more to come up from a details perspective. But those are the elements that I would think about today as you model out 2023.
Lisa Palmer: If I may just add one thing because this is something that we have said repeatedly on calls and meetings. Who knows what 2023 is going to bring with regards to a recession? But the one thing that is different is, because we've been through cycles before. When we've entered other cycles, we've typically been at peak occupancy and exactly what Mike – just building on exactly what Mike just said. We're entering this one if it happens with still room to move in terms of increasing occupancy and we expect that to be the case. We're also entering it, having been through a really tough 2.5 years for our tenant base. And so, our existing tenant base is really healthy. And I think that that is a differentiator with regards to what may be coming from an economic cycle. And I think that's a really important difference, and one to consider.
Anthony Powell: Thanks for that detail. And maybe one more. I think Lisa you mentioned that you're looking to do new developments with partners ground up developments. Are you seeing more people getting – looking to do more ground up developments given the kind of strength in the sector until we see supply goes really – finally start to tick-up a bit given what we've seen here?
Lisa Palmer: Let me clarify, in my prepared remarks [were that] [ph], given the scarcity of capital in today's capital markets, some of the smaller developers are having a more difficult time sourcing, debt financing. And so, we are starting to have a rising number of incoming calls to potentially partner and help be that source of funding for these smaller developers. So, it's very different than actively just seeking JV development partners. We will when opportunities are brought to us from JV partners look to that, but we're still very much committed to achieving our strategic objectives of annually having a consistent start and completions of developments and redevelopment dollars, I'd like to say at least at 200 million if not north of.
Anthony Powell: Understood. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
Craig Mailman: Great. Good morning, everyone. Maybe I just want to follow-up on that last topic, at least another year, your commentary around the JV partners and just, kind of square that up with your – also your commentary about the lack of movement or more minimal movement potentially in valuations for the quality of assets that you guys seek and have in the portfolio? I mean would that suggest that maybe you guys would be more interested in the debt side of some of these potential transactions versus the equity side or if you do the equity side, would it be more opportunistic or you might like to flip it? I'm just kind of curious about the quality of the opportunities relative to what you guys typically would look for?
Lisa Palmer: For the last, I would say coming out of GFC, I believe that our development program has been very disciplined and focused on the quality of the assets and that has – that remains constant. And so any opportunities that we think about in terms of what we have others coming to us to help them, it starts with the quality of the opportunity and the real estate and the asset. Is this something that we want to own long term? And if the answer to that is yes, then the decision tree is to continue the conversations and move forward and evaluate the opportunity. But it always starts with the quality of the shopping center.
Craig Mailman: Okay. And you guys know that I think you saw off around 130 million of free cash flow, you kind of levered that up, it's around the 200 million that you kind of like to look out – put out per year rather. Can you guys just talk about how you view that cost of capital versus kind of potential deployment opportunities? And kind of the cushion that that may give you from an accretion standpoint and kind of risk adjusted returns?
Mike Mas: Sure, Craig. I'll start and Lisa may jump in here too. But you're exactly right. We are – we have talked about $135 million plus or minus in anticipated free cash flow that the portfolio is throwing off in connection with the low leverage that we carry. That whether – let's call it non-dilutive capital, maybe that's a better description for that. So, we have access to 135 million of non-dilutive capital. We are also targeting 5x to 5.5x leverage overall. So, we can lever that capital at a rate of about 50% and that provides actually north of the 200 million, about 270 million, approaching $300 million of capacity for us to invest accretively. Now, to your question, how do we then think about investment return thresholds? We have this great source of capital, non-dilutive capital. We can't be competitive. We can't be aggressive, but we are also very conscious and aware of what valuation – where valuations are? What risk premiums need to be, especially in the development business. And those remain the same. We do target spreads of 150 plus basis points to what we would determine – what we would think to be in place cap rates.  Today, that's a little bit more challenging to wrap your head around because of the lack of data points that are out there in the market today, but we are finding, as Lisa mentioned, just good conversations, opportunities to advance conversations in this space and those returns we have confidence will be accretive to earnings because of that non-dilutive capital source. And we also think we'll end up achieving return thresholds that makes sense to us from an NAV basis and from an incremental cost of capital basis.
Craig Mailman: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your questions.
Ki Bin Kim: Thank you. Good morning. Congratulations, Jim. So, first question, your occupancy today is about 94.7%. I mean, you look at the prior peak, it's hovering around 95%. I know this isn't perfectly apples-to-apples and your portfolio has shifted, but how should we think about the lease occupancy upside from here on out? And can you describe the existing vacancy quality or desirability as it compares to the rest of the portfolio?
Lisa Palmer: Very quickly, I want to comment on the peak occupancy comment and then I'll have Alan address the quality of the vacant space, if you will. I'm probably a little bit older than you Ki Bin. So, perhaps I remember the peak occupancy a little bit more clearly. But we – I mean, we were north of 96%, certainly going into the GFC and got pretty close to it again if not exceeded it coming out. I'm getting very, very adamant head nodes, yes, around the table. So, exceeded 96% and our shop space exceeded 94% in the peak for a very short period of time. And I believe that we have the – I'm sorry, 92%. And I believe we have the ability to get back there again. And so, that's when I talk about entering this potential recession if that's what it is and becomes that we still have opportunity to continue to grow that occupancy.
Alan Roth: Yeah. And Ki Bin, this is Alan. To answer your vacancy quality, feel really good about what's there. And I think that's evidenced by, if you look at our cash rent spreads for the quarter at 14%, which were obviously strong and if you think about it also in context of space that's been vacant for less than 12 months, we actually were driving 20% cash rent spreads.  Again, another testament to I think the quality and on top of that, if we look at our embedded rent steps, it was the highest quarter we've ever had. And so, our ability to drive those cash rent spreads, our ability to have these embedded rent steps at averaging 2.5% and in many instances well north of 3% does speak to the quality of the vacancy and I feel really good about setting our eyes at that 96% plus that Lisa had mentioned.
Ki Bin Kim: And Lisa, you're right. I had to unhide a couple of columns in my [Excel model] [ph]. [Indiscernible] if this is right. So, second question on the signed but not lease pipeline, 3 million, 4 million of ABR, how much of that is [replacing] [ph] existing vacancy? I mean, it's like replacing existing occupancy?
Alan Roth: Ki Bin, it's all incremental. None of that is replacing anything that is rent paying today.
Ki Bin Kim: Okay. Thank you.
Lisa Palmer: Thanks, Ki Bin.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
Derek Johnston: Hey, everybody. Good morning and thanks. The lease rate pretty close to pre-pandemic, are you now able do you feel to focus on rates over occupancy? How does the possible recession kind of impact your underwriting and thinking or actual ability to push rents? And I'll make it a two-part because you might not answer the second part, but what feels like a realistic goal for the leased rate over the next year?
Lisa Palmer: Derek, I'm actually looking at Mike to make sure that I don't speak out of turn too much. So, I'll try to stay away from guidance, but – and keep it at a much higher level in macro. Generally speaking, I think that if you were to run a correlation between percent leased and rent spreads, you're going to see that there's a pretty strong correlation. I mean, the more occupied you are, the less space there is available to lease, the more pricing power that you have, and we continue to see that. And add on top of that inflation and I think that we're going to be able to continue to drive healthy increases in rents. I think that's probably – I will leave it at that in terms of guidance from rental spreads. We'll contractual rent spreads we've talked about. We continue to see that in almost – nearly all of our leases more than the vast majority. And we're always close to averaging close to 3% and we are seeing that still very, very steadily and in more cases than even last quarter greater than 3%. So, we continue to see increases in rents.
Mike Mas: Yes, Derek, with respect to 2023 guidance, I mean, largely from a rent spread perspective, it's largely within our [SNO pipeline] [ph]. So, the spreads that we've already achieved are what's really going to drive our growth into 2023. The challenge for us and we are up to the challenge is to maintain what we're seeing in today's spreads in that mid-to-upper single-digit area. That is our strategic objective. We think we have the right portfolio, the right team, sourcing the right tenants and to Lisa's point in spite of some of these headwinds or challenges to continue to drive rent spreads at those levels to continue that pace of growth in 2024 and beyond.
Derek Johnston: Okay, great. And then just touching on the Abbott, can we get a little more clarity on the early leasing that was mentioned in the opening remarks and obviously how it's tracking versus plan or initial underwriting and how you're feeling about it and what about leaning in and possibly commencing some more of these mixed use projects given what seems to be pretty good success in Cambridge?
Lisa Palmer: I'll start with the latter part of that question and then I'll kick it over to Alan to talk about the property specifically. Generally speaking, again, I'll go back to the 12 plus years and coming out of the GFC. We've been very focused and disciplined on developing quality, primarily grocery anchored shopping center doesn't mean that it won't – that it has to be grocery anchored, but primarily grocery anchored shopping centers. And even in those cases where we have had the opportunity to add density to existing shopping centers, we also again really focus on participating and developing the retail portion of that shopping center.  And where there is other opportunities to bring in, for example, Town and Country is a great example since we just started that where we partnered with a multi-family developer to do the multi-family development of that. That's how we will pursue those types of projects. The Abbott was a little bit different. We did – that did come with our merger with Equity One. It was already in process. And it's also – it's a lot more vertically integrated and I'll let Alan speak to the leasing and even with our leasing of that, it's still very similar uses to what we would do if it was a horizontal shopping center. So, with that, I'll talk to – I'll toss it to Alan.
Alan Roth: Yes, Derek, I am really proud of what the team has accomplished there. All of our ground floor retailers have spoken for and leased and they've done an exceptional job with the uses in terms of merchandising credit rents, etcetera. What remains left is our premier penthouse space. It's a space that originally was going to be taken by fourth floor tenant and they just decided in the eleventh hour just to take one space, but if we want to have one space left to lease, it's that one and the demand has been really strong on it. We just hosted a grand opening event there last week. Well attended. The feedback from the retailers that are open is that they're doing remarkably well. So, again, we're thrilled with the project and we're thrilled with the support that we've gotten from the entire Cambridge community.
Derek Johnston: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Craig Schmidt: Thank you. My questions are on Town and Country. First, congratulations to Jim. It's been very interesting to let you and your work at Regency, but going to Town and Country, I'm just wondering, do you know any of the new retailers you're going to be adding to that complex?
Lisa Palmer : We’ll let Nick – Nick has been dying for someone to ask him about Town and Country. So, we'll let Nick answer that question.
Nick Wibbenmeyer: Yes, no. Good morning, Craig, and thank you for the question. No, we're extremely excited. As Jim mentioned in the opening remarks, just a phenomenal piece of real estate obviously across the street from the grove. And so, retail demand, as you can appreciate, has been extremely strong even with long lead time before delivery. But the new anchor tenant to the new phase will be Whole Foods building a new store. So, they are currently a tenant shopping center. It will be relocating into a new prototype underneath the vertical residential that [indiscernible] is developing. So, really excited about having them reimagine what their experience as a consumer will be in that shopping center and clearly excited about future tenants we will add in and around them in the future phase.
Craig Schmidt: And do you have a – [obviously do] [ph] comps for luxury apartments in the middle [indiscernible] area?
Nick Wibbenmeyer: We do. But again, just to reiterate, we are leasing the air rights to [halt] [ph]. And so, the good news about that structure is our rent is 100% committed from Holland through an air rights lease structure. And so, if you can appreciate, Holland is hyper focused on what those rents are going to be, but we feel very, very confident they're going to achieve their underwritten rents, and therefore feel extremely confident that it's going to be a really successful partnership with both.
Craig Schmidt: Great. And then just, I was reading about, you've had robust community feedback, what are some of that feedback and how did that relate to how you're setting up the property going forward?
Nick Wibbenmeyer: The really good news is again with the lead time we have. We can be extremely patient. And so, the conversations we've been having with tenants are really at the preliminary stage. Now that construction is starting, now that we are going to see shovels in the ground now that it's become public that Whole Foods will be relocating, it really allows us to lean into those conversations. And so, again, with this type of quality of real estate with couple of years of lead time, we're going to continue to progress conversations appropriately, but also continue to be extremely patient as we expect to be able to pick from the best of the best throughout the industry.
Craig Schmidt: Okay. Thank you very much.
Lisa Palmer: Thanks Craig.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Hong Zhang with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Hong Zhang: Yes. Hi. I guess a quick question on how to think about commenced occupancy. Given you've grown commenced occupancy 60 basis points since the beginning of the year, just given your comments about strength of tenant quality and your backlog of commencements, is it fair to say that you would expect a greater than 60 basis points increasing commenced occupancy by year-end next year?
Mike Mas: We'll take it easy on 2023. I'm sorry, more to come, I think is something you'll hear from us pretty often. But let me take the opportunity to take your comment and speak to 2022 and then we can extend that from a trajectory standpoint. Base rent, as I said in my remarks, just continue to focus on base rent as the best indicator. Because of our high degree of cash basis tenancy, 2021 is providing a very sloppy comparison in the year in our quarter-over-quarter results.  We're all accustomed to that. Our disclosure does an excellent job of explaining that phenomenon, but base rent growth, just to repeat some numbers in first quarter of this year was 2.8%. That grew to 3% in the second quarter, that grew to 3.9% in the third. You can imply from our guidance and our revision to guidance that the fourth quarter will continue to march forward, again consistent with the 60 basis points of rising commenced occupancy as you mentioned Hong. Pair that with some of the comments we've made about leasing demand, about our SNO pipeline that exists today, about the shadow leasing pipeline that extends beyond that Alan shared some details with us on.  I do think it's fair to say that we are positioned to grow base rent through what could be a softer economy. And one of the reasons we're positioned to do that is because of the circumstances at least I articulated. Much of the weakness was eliminated in 2020 and 2021. So, we're coming into this position from a period of strength, good well located vacancy, good demand from the markets, more to come on how much growth we should anticipate in 2023, but I do think we like this trajectory that we're on.
Hong Zhang: Thanks. And apologies if you talked about this before, but could you talk a little bit about the value-add opportunity you see at East Meadows?
Lisa Palmer : Yes, I'll just start really quickly and again toss it to Alan to talk about the projects. But as I said in my prepared remarks, we bought that as a redevelopment opportunity. And clearly with our disclosure, you can back into what the in going cap rate was. So, it's a very low in going cap rate. But we expect unlevered IRR is approaching 10% on that. So, it is a development like return. So, I'll toss that to Alan.
Alan Roth: Yes. So, we bought that from a family that's owned the land since the 1920s and obviously coming off the heels of acquiring the adjacent Stew Leonard's anchored asset back in December of last year, we're really excited about our ability to connect these two assets. We are going to be working with a local municipality on a redevelopment, but our team up in the Northeast is really excited to do what we do best and that is enhance merchandising, implement our place making strategy, and connect to the community through the redevelopment of the assets. So, a lot to unlock and I just think the center of gravity by creating both of these assets into one larger project will really be fantastic. So, we're looking forward to that completion.
Hong Zhang: Yes. So, it sounds like it's – we'll see in the redevelopment pipeline sooner rather than later. 
Lisa Palmer: Correct.
Alan Roth : Yes.
Hong Zhang: Thanks and congrats Jim.
Jim Thompson: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Wes Golladay: Hey, everyone. I want to go back to the comment about talking about the catching up with inflation. Is there a way to measure how much upsides in the portfolio being that these are long duration leases, it's the best way to look at it with as a [renewal, no] [ph] option. And if you have that data, that would be nice?
Alan Roth : I didn't pick up the words before option, I'm sorry, Wes.
Wes Golladay : Oh, the renewal. Yes, the – is the best way to look at it. The embedded growth in the portfolio to look at the renewals that you're signing that don't have an option?
Lisa Palmer : Let me make sure that we do address it as we can. So, if you do, I think when you think about how can – how are we positioned, I think this is what you're saying to capture what may be rising market rents due to inflation. And the best way to look at that really is to look at what percentage of our space is expiring. And what market rents are that are expiring, but it's difficult for you to see with the mixes of anchor and shop and that gets a little bit – that gets a little bit more difficult. So, your question then becomes what percentage of them have options? Is that what [Technical Difficulty]?
Wes Golladay : Yes. Well, I guess when you do renewals, you got your renewal spread that you cite as a mix of tenants that have options or that were maybe set out a lock rate and then ones where you negotiate with them, hey, this is where the new rate is and you get a big pop on the ones that they don't have an option on. And so, I was wondering if you had the delineation between those two types of renewals?
Lisa Palmer : Okay. Question is more clear now.
Mike Mas : Yes. The renewal rate on – renewals – sorry, Wes, the renewal rate on – the lease spread on renewals without options is 8%. The bucket that is exercising options is at 5%.
Wes Golladay: Got you. And is that the best way to look at the embedded growth in the portfolio as it stands today in your…?
Mike Mas : I mean, I guess it’s a little bit more complex than that. I think we have to start with our lease – we have to start our contractual rent increases. Those are our – we are putting in place 2%. We have in place 2% contractual increases in our, kind of same space portfolio. That contributes about 1.3%, 1.4% to our growth profile. So, I think you have to start the conversation there. And as Alan mentioned earlier, we're hitting, kind of peak levels that we haven't seen from a new threshold from a contractual increase perspective. Then you add-on to that what we're experiencing on the lease spreads.  Yes, some of that is going to be contractual. Some of our tenants have fixed rate options that they have to their benefit that will have, as I mentioned, a bit of a dilutive impact on that ability to grow, but where we can maintain control of space, limit options to our tenants, then attack that new market rent growth, that's where we – that is the other lever that we can pull to increase our growth profile. The third element that is available to us today is all about this peak occupancy level. And we've spent some time today talking about that. We have room to run and that will be probably more of an amplifying impact going in as we think about the 2023, 2024 in the near term than the impact coming from the lease spreads.
Wes Golladay: Got it. Thanks everyone and congratulations Jim.
Mike Mas : Thanks Wes.
Jim Thompson: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Ronald Kamdem: Great. Just a couple of quick ones. Starting with sort of the occupancy gains, just trying to get a sense of, in your mind just how much more full the portfolio can get? Or when we're thinking about, sort of the same store growth function in the next couple of years, clearly the base rents are a big driver, we’re trying to understand how much more occupancy can drive that? Thanks.
Mike Mas : Yes. I think it's been a little bit of guidance and kind of asked and answered different ways today. But more to come around on our expectations for 2023, but I'll just reiterate, we feel good about the quality of the portfolio. We don't – the weakness has largely been shared. We feel good about our SNO pipeline and delivering that rent. We feel great about the shadow pipeline that's behind that and the negotiations that are ongoing. So, we do see continued opportunities to grow base rent from here. And just more to come on our expectations for achieving peak occupancy, whether that's at the end of 2023 or into 2024, more to come on that in February.
Ronald Kamdem: Great. And then, apologies if this has been asked already, but have you commented on, sort of the Kroger Albertsons deal? Just curious what implications for the company and the phases for the industry? What your take on that is? Thanks.
Lisa Palmer : We have not had that question yet. So, generally speaking, as long as I've been in this business, which is now over 26 years, not quite as long as Jim's 42 years, but the grocery industry clearly has always been one of consolidation and of the stronger operators getting stronger and the top grocers getting better. And to why our strategy has always focused on investing in shopping centers that are anchored by the top grocers in that market, whether it's by market share, but it's really by the productivity of those stores and the sales that they generate. The combination of Kroger and Albertsons just creates an even better operator. And we think that that's a positive. It will allow them to invest further into their business in all aspects of their business, both digital and also in the in-store experience, which they both were already doing. And now combined they will be able to do that even better.
Ronald Kamdem: Great. Thanks. Congrats, Jim. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Linda Tsai: Hi, good morning. Can you remind us pre-pandemic, what percentage of your tenants were on cash basis? I know it's been going down about 2% to 3% a quarter and it's at 9%, but where do you think it ends up by year-end 2023?
Mike Mas : Hey, Linda, it's Mike. So, we're at 9%. We get this question often and it's hard to answer only because the policies from a GAAP perspective that we're applying today don't quite match what those policies and GAAP treatment was pre-pandemic, but we were in the mid-single digit area, 5% plus or minus previous to that. I called for maybe another 1% to 2% that could convert in the fourth quarter, we're getting down to where we're going to normalize somewhere in that mid-single-digit area.
Linda Tsai: Got it. And then maybe on the idea that you could see a slight uptick in move-outs early next year given the more uncertain environment, but coupled with the idea that your tenant base is a lot stronger headed than versus headed into past recessions, what's the best way to think about bad debt for next year?
Mike Mas : Couple of questions in there. So, we didn't comment on the seasonality expectation of Q1 move outs. I think you're alluding to the fact that it typically is a stronger move out type of quarter, more to come when we put out full 2023 expectations. From a bad debt perspective, I'll reiterate what I said earlier. We are at historically average rates today from a third quarter and the fourth quarter from an expectation standpoint. It would not be out of the question again, is next year a historically average year, it would not be out of the question to think that it would not be and that we would be prudent to plan for some, sort of modest increase in our rate, but I don't by no means do anticipate that we will equal the rates that we had in 2021 or 2020.
Lisa Palmer: Just reiterating, again, I'll go back to my prepared remarks. I characterize it as cautious optimism and that none of us really do know where the economy is going to settle, if you will, with regards to the recessionary, if there are recessionary impacts. And what I think to clarify Mike's comments the question – the answer to a question earlier is, the leasing is essentially accounted for because we have our sign not occupied leases that are coming online. The uncertainty is in the level of move-outs, because when you have a move-out that impact is immediate, because they stop paying rent. I think that's what you're referring to. We did not indicate that we expect it to be – there to be an uptick. More to come in February when we give guidance.
Linda Tsai: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Paulina Rojas with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.
Paulina Rojas: Hello. I only have one quick question. Regarding the transaction market, are there any areas or markets where cap rates have been less or the reaction to the macro headwinds from staying in your mind more market agnostic?
Lisa Palmer: Yes, Paulina, I'll address that by a little bit of what I said in the prepared remarks as well. There’s been very low volumes in the transaction market, so very little price discovery. The bid ask spreads are still really wide. And I would say that is market agnostic. It is not that there aren't any specific markets where price discovery is better than others and volumes are low across the country. So, at this point in time, it's still market agnostic.
Paulina Rojas: Okay. Thank you. That's all.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. And I would like to turn the floor back over to Lisa Palmer for any closing comments.
Lisa Palmer: First, thank you all for your time this morning. One last – you heard me say when we're closing the prepared remarks that I wish you all could see Jim smile when we said that he wasn't going to answer the questions. You also didn't have the opportunity to see how relaxed he was this whole time, while we were answering your questions. So Jim, it's the least that we could give you and you deserve. Thank you so much. And enjoy your time.
Jim Thompson: Thank you much. Thanks for the bye.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you all. Have a great weekend.
Operator: This concludes this conference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a great day.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-08-05 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to Regency Centers Corporation Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] And please note that this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Christy McElroy, Senior Vice President, Capital Markets. Thank you. You may begin.
Christy McElroy: Good morning, and welcome to Regency Centers' second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Lisa Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Mas, Chief Financial Officer; Jim Thompson, Chief Operating Officer; Chris Leavitt, SVP and Treasurer; Alan Roth, Senior Managing Director of the East Region; and Nick Wibbenmeyer, Senior Managing Director of the West Region. As a reminder, today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements about the company's views of future business and financial performance, including forward earnings guidance and future market conditions. These are based on management's current beliefs and expectations and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. It's possible that actual results may differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements we may make. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements may be included in our presentation today and are described in more detail in our filings with the SEC, specifically in our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filings. In our discussion today, we will also reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. The comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this quarter's earnings materials, which are posted on our Investor Relations website. Please note that we have also posted a presentation on our website with additional information, including disclosures related to forward earnings guidance. Our caution on forward-looking statements also applied to these presentation materials. Lisa?
Lisa Palmer: Thank you. Christy. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. We are pleased to report strong second quarter results, reflecting a still healthy operating environment. Leasing demand continues to be strong and tenant move-outs remain light driving occupancy and rent growth higher We acknowledge the increasing macroeconomic headwinds and in our view that makes our results all the more notable. We know that we're not immune to the adverse impacts of inflation, interest rate increases and recessionary risks, all of which could have implications for us. But we very much believe that we are extremely well positioned to weather any economic storm. For the remainder of this year as a result of that we are very confident in our forecast as reflected in our guidance increase and looking beyond 2022 Regency's portfolio and balance sheet were built for times of greater uncertainty. Everything we've done over the last decade and every decision we've made positions the company not only to play offense and drive growth when times are good, but to successfully navigate challenging macroeconomic environments we are designed to outperform through cycles evident most recently in the resiliency of our performance through the pandemic and how quickly we were able to pivot back to offense and return to pre-pandemic levels of NOI, earnings per share and leverage. Importantly, in the context of the current environment, the demographic profile of our trade areas is supportive of a consumer that has more cushion to absorb pressures from inflation and economic softness. And in times when tenant bankruptcies may be elevated, our locations tend to be among the best performing limiting occupancy decline. Additionally, current positive momentum is a source of tailwinds into 2023 and beyond. First and foremost is our strong pipeline of leases both execute and those in negotiation. Also next year we will see an even greater benefit from development and redevelopment NOI coming online. And finally, as we've been saying our dense suburban neighborhoods and communities continue to benefit from structural tailwinds stemming from post pandemic migration and hybrid work. Where we have begun to see some impact from the current environment is in the capital markets, but again we are extremely well positioned. The strength of our balance sheet and our low leverage afford us the luxury of not needing to raise capital when it's not advantageous to do so. And our dry powder and ready access to capital, gives us a competitive advantage should opportunities arise. A prime example of that was the execution of our share repurchases in the second half of June. We saw a window of opportunity to essentially buy our own high quality properties in a mid-6% implied cap rate range, a meaningfully more attractive price than what we would pay for anything comparable in the private market today. We were uniquely positioned to take advantage of that dislocation given our balance sheet strength and liquidity position. We can't control the macro environment, but we can control our response to it. As we sit here today, we remain confident in our operational strategy and our balance sheet strength, regardless of the macro backdrop. Closing out, I'd like to comment briefly on ESG as many of you know that have been covering Regency for a while. We take pride in having best in class sector-leading, environmental, social and governance programs across which we continue to meet or exceed our goals. We did publish our Annual Corporate Responsibility Report in late May and also announced an interim 2030 target for reducing absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions which was endorsed by the Science Based Targets initiative. We also set a long-term net zero target of 2050. We don't take these commitments lightly. These targets were established after extensive work by our team to identify and analyze the impact of specific initiatives that will help us reach these goals, which includes further improvements in common area, energy efficiency and continued growth in our on-site solar program. Corporate responsibility is a foundational strategy for Regency and it has been for many years. It's part of our culture and is as fundamental to what we do as is our commitment to portfolio, quality and balance sheet strength. Jim?
Jim Thompson: Thanks, Lisa, and good morning everyone. While we are keeping a close eye on the increasing economic pressures in the US today, the operating environment for our open-air retail centers currently remains healthy and active. We had a great second quarter of operating results, leading us to further increase our 2022 same property NOI guidance by 100 basis points to 5.25% at the midpoint, excluding prior year collections. This confidence in our outlook is driven by continued positive vectors in our key metrics first continued robust tenant demand with new leasing volumes up 20% year-to-date versus the historical average. Increasing occupancy both on leased and commenced spaces especially on shop space as we backfill space vacated during the pandemic. Our tenants are paying rent and we're nearly back to more customary levels of current period bad debt. Retention rates remained above historical average. Cash spreads for nearly 9% in the second quarter and we're embedding contractual rent steps and close to 90% of our executed leases especially important in this inflationary environment contributing to GAAP rent spreads of 17%. Strong tenant sales reports again contributing to higher percentage rent and we're maintaining low levels of leasing CapEx with net effective rent growth also in the mid-teens. Our success and momentum relating to all these key drivers of our business, gives us continued confidence in the strength of our core operating outlook. As Lisa discussed, we do acknowledge the heightened risk of softer economic environment including the potential for an uptick in tenant failures. We're not seeing that yet as tenant move-out activity has remained light and we believe that is a result of the purge of weaker operators that occurred during the pandemic. Our tenants are healthy as they've ever been, especially our shop tenants who went through the ringer two years ago and emerged stronger and smart. So if we do see bankruptcies materialize, we feel like we're in a good relative position. Turning to development, we now have nearly $390 million of development and redevelopment projects in process at yields in the 7% to 8% range. Despite construction cost increases over the last couple of years, we remain on track and on budget with our current in-process projects. Additionally, we continue to source new opportunities supported by strong tenant demand at yields who are holding steady despite cost increases we're seeing in our underwriting. During the second quarter, we started Phase 2 of our ground-up Baybrook development in Houston. You may recall that we completed Phase 1 of this project late last year in the H-E-B anchor, which opened in December is already one of the top performing grocers in the Houston market. This new phase of the project will include roughly 50,000 square feet of shops and outparcels adjacent to the new H-E-B store. We have already signed or committed leases on the nearly 75% of new space, and anticipate the first tenants opening in about a year from now. We also started the major redevelopment this quarter at our Buckhead landing property in Atlanta, formerly known as the Piedmont Peachtree. With total cost of around $25 million we will redevelop the 150,000 square-foot center and replace the existing grocery with a new public's anchor. Our team is really excited to start this much anticipated transformation of this irreplaceable location in the heart of Buckhead. Our consistent track record and successful execution within our development and redevelopment program is a testament to the depth and perseverance of our experienced teams across the country. This avenue for investment is a core competency for Regency and this is where we have the ability to create value and drive incremental growth in upcoming quarters. We look forward to sharing further details on additional projects as we plan to start over the next 12 to 18 months. In summary even in a more volatile macro environment we remain encouraged by continued strength in tenant sales, foot traffic and demand for space. Supporting continued same property NOI growth and reflective of the resiliency and quality of our locations and tenant base. Beyond that are self-funded value creation pipeline provides an additional layer of accretion and growth. Mike?
Mike Mas: Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. I'll start by addressing second quarter results, walk through key changes in our 2022 revised guidance and touch base on our balance sheet. First would like to point out some new disclosure on page 8 of our supplemental, where we now summarize the contributing elements of our same-property NOI growth. Last quarter, we spent time describing the noise that exists in the quarterly cadence of our NOI growth rate throughout 2022 driven primarily by the collection of prior year reserves as well as an expense recovery adjustment that occurred in the second quarter of last year. Due to the continued significant impact of these items, we stress that base rent growth is the best indicator of what is truly driving our business and is the best representation of our continued growth trajectory. You should find that this new disclosure is helpful in making these things more clear and as you can see in the table, the largest positive contributors to second quarter performance where growth in base rent and improvement in current year uncollectible lease income which together added the total 450 basis points to our NOI growth rate while the offsetting factors include the tougher year-over-year comparisons related to prior year reserve collections and expense recoveries detracting a total of 380 basis points from our results. We've also had a gap more straight-line rent spreads to our supplemental on Page 19 as a complement to our historically reported cash spreads. GAAP spreads have always been an important metric for us internally given our strong focus on embedding contractual rent growth into our leases and we believe this metric helps provide an even more fulsome picture of the primary drivers of our base rent growth over time. Notably, as of the second quarter even after removing the positive impact of prior year collections. Our core operating earnings per share has returned to pre-pandemic 2019 levels. This achievement is a testament to our portfolio's quality and resiliency. We also converted more cash basis tenants back to accrual in the second quarter continuing a trend over the last year following improvement in both collections and underlying tenant credit. The resulting reversal of straight-line rent reserves contributed $3.5 million or $0.02 per share to Nareit FFO which was not included in prior guidance. We now have about 12% of our ABR remaining on a cash basis of accounting. Turning to our updated current year guidance we refer you to page 6 of our second quarter earnings presentation, specifically the column indicating the drivers of the increase in our Nareit FFO range at the midpoint. The biggest change was to our same property NOI growth forecast of 100 basis points of the midpoint positively impacting our Nareit FFO per share outlook by about $0.06. All the positive operating trends we are seeing that Jim outlined and that impacted our second quarter results are supportive of the 100 basis point increase for the full year. The primary drivers include higher average commenced occupancy benefiting both base rent and expense recoveries and better collections on cash basis tenants leading to decreasing levels of uncollectible lease income. Another driver of the increase is non-cash revenues up $0.03 per share at the midpoint primarily driven by the impact on the straight-line rent from the conversion of cash basis tenants back to accrual during the second quarter. Recall that we only include these impacts and results and guidance on an as-converted basis. Our balance sheet remains in excellent condition and in the quarter, with full capacity on our revolver with total leverage at the bottom end of our targeted range of five to 5.5 times net debt to EBITDA. This strong balance sheet position enabled us to take advantage of an opportunity to repurchase our shares in the second half of June. We bought back 1.3 million shares for about $75 million representing an average price of $58.25 per share. As Lisa mentioned this price implied a cap rate in the a price at which we would happily buy assets that match Regency's quality and growth profile. Notably, the share repurchase was about a penny accretive to 2022 earnings. The debt markets have remained volatile and the movement in both treasuries and spreads has impacted our cost of debt capital. But, with no unsecured maturities until 2024 we have the luxury to remain patient waiting for more opportunistic windows. We are also reminded that during periods of dislocation in the capital markets, the importance of our significant level of free cash flow was highlighted which at north of a $130 million annually, allows us to continue investing accretively. Looking ahead from an operational perspective, inflationary impacts on the consumer combined with a softer economic backdrop introduces some uncertainty into our outlook beyond 2022. But as we reflect on our resiliency throughout the pandemic the impacts from which could be described as indiscriminate towards property location and tenant quality. We believe Regency's portfolio is well positioned ahead of a more traditional economic recession with greater bifurcation in performance across the quality spectrums of trade area locations, property formats and tenant exposures. As Lisa indicated, you won't hear us say we're immune to the impacts of a downturn but the good news is that we are starting from a position of strength. Our leasing pipelines are very active, feature in a healthy mix tenant demand across all markets, categories and sizes with retention rates that continue to be above historical averages. One silver lining of the pandemic, is that the less resilient operators were called out during 2020 and our tenant base has emerged even stronger providing stable footing in our occupancy. We also have a strong value creation pipeline fully funded with free cash flow with visibility to more meaningful NOI contributions in 2023 and 2024 and maybe most importantly as we consider the rising economic uncertainties. We have one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector allowing us the ability to remain on offense and create value through investment should opportunities arise. With that, we look forward to taking your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.
Greg McGinniss: Hi, good morning. So Regency, GLA was down from prior quarters at 1.3 million square feet, is that just a function of more limited anchor leasing because obviously the number of leases was quite good. Or how should we be interpreting that result?
Jim Thompson: Greg, this is Jim. Great question. And be happy to kind of explain what's going on there. Basically, the total number of transactions was right in line with trailing 12 months as the new leasing volumes and quite frankly rent spreads were very solid as well, but overall the GLA leased, was slightly down for the quarter due to the renewals and it's really the mix between anchors and shops, typically we're about 50-50 mix. This particular quarter, it was 70-30 heavy on shops, which basically smaller square footage averages. It also relates to that ABR of $34.43, which is a little higher than the average. So as I looked at that and don't tell anybody but I looked at the July numbers, from a renewal standpoint is to satisfy my own curiosity, July numbers are significantly on the renewal side, significantly higher than our average monthly rates and the mix is back where the anchors should be. So, I think the anomaly will be sorted out prior to year-end. So I'm not too worried about that. In addition, I just mentioned that the overall renewal retention rate is over to right at 80%, which is again higher than our typical average.
Greg McGinniss: Okay. So it sounds like it's just a timing issue then.
Jim Thompson: It really is.
Greg McGinniss: Okay. Great. And second question from me is with the post pandemic migration to sub-cost sourcing suburbs and hybrid work from home seemingly here to stay. How does that impacts foot traffic you're seeing at the centers and decisions around merchandising?
Jim Thompson: Greg, I think the, foot traffic for traffic we're seeing is really back to where we've seen it before. In general our demand is very strong, really across the board, across regions as well as product type, categories are doing exceptionally well. I think are very active our grocery value, apparel, the QSRs, restaurants obviously, we're seeing a lot of good strong demand in the health fitness medical and also the Pet categories. The mix between locals and nationals for the shop space is really relatively the same as what we've seen and really from an overall demand standpoint, I'd say just to give you a flavor on the anchors, we've got 39 available spaces today, 24 of those are either LOI or at lease. So again I think that's what the likes of TJX, Publix, Burlington, Ross, Five Below Nordstrom Rack, so those are the kinds of folks we're talking to and I think that gives you a sense for now we're seeing great shop demand but also the anchor demand is very, very strong.
Greg McGinniss: Great, thank you.
Jim Thompson: I just. I think the only thing I'd add to that I think is, we remain confident in that suburban market in which we operate, kind of anchored by that dominant grocer with the need, necessity type of retailers and we think we believe we're going to continue to see demand shift towards our product type and our quality
Mike Mas: And Greg. I'll just add really well said. But we continue, I think we sound like a broken record, but what the past 2.5 years if that's a long it's been, have really demonstrated and validated is the importance of the neighborhood community shopping center and the retail and service ecosystem and I said and I said we signed a broken record, if you went back and you listen to earnings calls prior to the pandemic and then throughout it, we feel really good about the future of our business.
Greg McGinniss: Sorry, just one point of clear on the foot traffic, are you seeing any increase in mid-week traffic and do you have the data on length of today whether that's changed since pre-pandemic?
Mike Mas: It's basically still the same. And that, remember we did as everybody did, we did get with the pandemic and we recovered really quickly and much more quickly in some markets versus others of it as we always, I said that was indiscriminate but what it was discriminate always the amount of shutdowns and so we there have not been significant differences from pre-pandemic to today.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Goldsmith: Good morning, thanks for taking my question. Maybe to follow-up on Greg's question here. Can you talk a little bit about the demand from tenants and maybe break it down between discretionary versus essentials. I know you have more exposure to the exceptional side but trying to understand if different types of tenants are slowing their demand or still momentum kind of continues on both sides.
Jim Thompson: I would tell you that I see the demand basically staying pretty robust across all sectors of the folks that we do business with, so we're really not seeing a category I can point to say this is falling off.
Michael Goldsmith: Thanks for that. And my second question, the lease spreads accelerated on a cash basis, on a GAAP basis. So, if there is there kind of a continued upward trend here and then I think you also mentioned that you have escalators in 90% of your new leases, where does that stand before and how accepting our tenants in taking on these escalators? Thanks.
Jim Thompson: Sure. Yes. The cash rent spreads are roughly this quarter right at 9%, trailing 12 months is right in that neighborhood. That mirrors what we believe long term is our target for the cash rent spreads and again we'll couple of that cash rent spread with embedded spreads that we're putting in the existing, the new leases. The combination of that really is what and I think judicious CapEx spend that kind of gets us that net effective rent and GAAP rent spreads that we're, we're kind of look at is real answer to whether not where we're making progress in our business. As far as the embedded, we are in this inflationary area right now, we are taking steps to raise our ask were asked between 3% and 4% on deals today which is higher, we've done in the past, and where we have a pretty good success of that, I think everybody recognizes the inflation touches everyone and we're not getting left out of the program. So we're actually having pretty good success getting that higher embedded rent steps.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist. Please proceed with your question.
Ki Bin Kim: Thanks and good morning. So you have a 240 basis point spread between signed and occupied. Could you just talk about what that ABR looks like, and how much of it is actually being accrued in the income statement already?
Mike Mas: On the pre-lease percentage Ki Bin? This is Mike. So that's worth about $34 million up, we actually added some disclosure to our NAV page, I don't have the number, but - 
Christy McElroy: Page 33
Mike Mas: Page 33. Thanks, Christy, and you'll see that we added some disclosure to get you to the value of that pre-leased pipeline. All of that is again it's pre-lease percentage. So that's embedded into our forward outlook of same-property NOI growth. We did. I'll take this opportunity to reconfirm that we've increased our outlook for the balance of the year by 100 basis points. It is largely driven by higher commenced occupancy and lower move-outs in the combination of the two. So we'll continue to deliver space, we're doing so quite successfully. It's not easy, but the team is doing a remarkable job bringing that pre-leased pipeline into production. And then lastly, the other huge element from our same property NOI outlook is uncollectible lease income, we've been just so surprised this year, how quickly that is healing and returning back to classic levels of 50 basis points, last year was 175 basis points of bad debt. We came out thinking it be in the 100 basis points area, now we've lowered our eyes as again about 75 basis points for the balance of the year, so that implies a back half of the year. That's basically on par are getting pretty close to that historical average. So we feel to confirm the points that Jim made earlier I feel really good about the in-place tenancy, and the health of our tenants.
Jim Thompson: I can't help but just make a quick comment that while we talk about, it is extremely important to get the same but not occupied paying rent and to get back to maybe more stabilized level, I'm very happy if it stays where it is as long as our percent rent paying is also increasing because that means we're doing a lot more new leasing and so that's a good thing. So the fact that as SNL moving much and our percent rent paying is increasing, means we're doing more new leasing. So that's a really positive sign.
Ki Bin Kim: Great. And second question from me, when I look at your tenant list is 5.5 years tenant rosters, I can see in the strip center space, it shows your top 30 tenants, so, I'm assuming the rest is by equally as healthy. How do you think about your tenant roster today versus pre-COVID and as there are some concerns about the macro slowdown or inflation impacts on different consumer segments. How do you think your portfolio in your tenant roster handles that situation versus what might have been three years ago.
Jim Thompson: Ki Bin. I think I'll be honestly I think we're absolutely a stronger - in a stronger position today with our tenancy. Obviously, the last couple of years, really split that we, from the chaff our survivors are smarter stronger just like I said in the opening comments, they're savvy, they're reactive, they know how to get things done with a lot of adversity. And that gives me a lot of comfort and it really much going into any kind of slowdown, I feel very comfortable with the folks we've got on the roster right now.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Craig Schmidt: Thank you. My question is on the contractual bumps, you mentioned in the opening comments, I'm just wondering what are your annual contractual bumps generally ranging and do you have any CPI bumps in any of your existing leases?
Jim Thompson: At annual average is probably somewhere in the two to four range. CPI, we do, we've got kind of a mixed bag. We do have some CPI, but generally, I would say that's a pretty small portion. Most are stated - stated rates we have at renewal time, we got some fair market value, we're kind of shifting towards that fair market value window renewal. I think that gives - it's fair both ways and it doesn't block anybody into a predicament if you will.
Craig Schmidt: So I think that's 2% to 4%. It sounds like it's a little bit higher than it was. Are you, I've been able to increase that?
Jim Thompson: I'm sorry. say that again?
Craig Schmidt: This 2% to 4% bumps around a little bit higher than I'm used to hearing and I'm just wondering if you've been able to raise that in the last few years.
Jim Thompson: The 2% to 4% is new and in place is probably closer to the.
Mike Mas: Yes, let me, I'll take that, Jim. So, what you typically hear us talk about Craig is our portfolio-wide impact to growth. So if you look through the entirety of the portfolio, we're at 1.3% or so of growth were teetering on 1.4% as the team Jim articulated. On a deal specific basis, we're getting 2% to sometimes 4% growth on over 90% of our new leasing and that's what's helping drive that 1.3. But it's - there's 9,000 tenants that we're working through. We have move out that actually you can have a tenant moving out that was paying 3% contractual increases. So that's a, it's a mountain to move, but we're making great progress in that regard.
Craig Schmidt: Great. And then if I could, a follow-up there is, I mean, I understand your appropriate caution about the macro environment, but there are articles going around saying that 50% of small businesses could go out of business in the months ahead. I find that I have not heard anyone suggest a recession as bad as the Great Recession. And the great recession had nowhere near that number of damage the small shop. And just, are you seeing anything that would make you unduly worried about your small shops, even given the macro environment?
Lisa Palmer: Craig, I'll take that one. Absolutely not. And I'll just reiterate what Jim just talked about with regards to the health of our tenant base, it sounds a little bit contradictory when we say we're coming into this, what may be what may become ever session, if it's not already from a position of strength and that meaning that the tenants that we have in place, the merchants that are in our shopping centers really have survived, I love that Jim says it's separate the wheat from the chaff, like really have survived a really difficult challenging time from a demand standpoint with COVID-19. And so we have really strong good operators and they - even those that may pull back on maybe new store opening plans, we have the best locations and if they pullback from - okay I'm going to open two stores in this market to one, I don't see an impact to Regency whatsoever in that scenario. I will go out on the limb and agree with you and say and I could I may very well be wrong, but I don't see another GFC in the future, at least not in the next two years.
Operator: The next question comes from Craig Mailman with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
Craig Mailman: Hi, good morning. So this is following up on the previous question on escalators and you guys are running at above average retention rates, getting better resolution here in the past are the retailers who want to keep the space that they have - are you able to, -.or let me ask - are you giving up anything to get the higher escalators or are you getting the face rent increases that you would have wanted regardless along with a better escalators. Can you talk about the kind of the negotiation there with tenants?
Jim Thompson: I don't think we're giving anything up to negotiate market where - we're pretty good negotiators on rents and that's what we believe market is today. We're seeing other landlords moving that direction. So we're just negotiating what we believe is market today.
Craig Mailman: So as we think about kind of long-term trends in same so the structural uptick in escalators here. I mean, what do you think your portfolio could start to post, in the next couple of years as you really churn through and reset leases.
Mike Mas: Yes, hi, Craig, it's Mike. So I'll go back to the 1.3 going 1.4. That's a big change is sound small, but it is a big change. But in the overall picture of our forward outlook on same property NOI growth, we're still the two largest contributors in the near term, will continue to be occupancy increases and lease spreads. Certainly embedding contractual increases is important to Regency's long-term outlook and our long-term growth and we will not stop embedding those increases into our leases which we have been doing for a long period of time at this point. But right now, our eyes are on our ability to push commenced occupancy. We've talked about 2022 achieving plus or minus 100 basis points and commenced and we feel as good as we have six months ago and saying that and we have good visibility to achieving that objective and so this point if we think about even a softer economic backdrop. Given our relative position of strength, we feel like we can grow through a period of disruption and continue to add rent paying occupancy in '23 and on previous calls, we've talked about another 100 basis points plus or minus of opportunity, more to come on when that will - more to come when we put out formal guidance for in our outlook for next year and beyond. But there is at least another 100 basis points of commenced there to get back to our peak occupancy levels, then the other major contributors lease spreads. And Jim, spent lot of time on the 9% range. Mid to high single digits is, where we want to be, where we need to be to achieve our objectives of averaging north of 2.5 certainly 275 before redevelopment contributions and when you add in the investment, the reinvestment to our portfolio, we feel good about averaging 3% are better on a sustained basis going forward.
Craig Mailman: Okay, then maybe on the a similar kind of aspect is right now. FFO growth is a little bit impacted by the demolition collections. But with the higher retention rate you guys should theoretically have less CapEx, higher net effectives. I'm just trying to think if you - maybe it doesn't fully correct itself by '23 with as you look maybe into the outer years and not looking for guidance per se, but just a sense of where that longer-term AFFO growth in the portfolio could start to trend and how that could look relative to peers in the sector.
Jim Thompson: I'll let you handle the peers component better, so let's talk about a couple ways to interpret our got our disclosure first, so core operating earnings. I would point you right to that metric we are unique in this space and we use core operating earnings, obviously we're stripping out the impacts of anything that's non-cash. The only difference being core operating earnings and AFFO is going to be capital and when we think about capitals, we are planning and have been spending about 10% to 11% of our NOI. Every year in maintenance capital is combined with leasing capitals. We don't see that trending materially outside of those bounds, Craig, I would probably point you more towards the upper end of that range at about 11% given the amount of space we have left to lease, it's just going to be a volume business that we probably will spend a little bit more capital, beyond and then to your point on prior year collections, so you got to eliminate the impact of prior year collections from a - to get to more of a core AFFO metric. When you do that as we think about our business going forward, our core operating earnings growth. Therefore, our AFFO growth should match or should match together, should move in lockstep with one another. Because we just don't see any kind of disproportionate moving parts between those elements.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Wes Golladay: Hi, everyone. Just want to go back to you, maybe looking at your watch list. At this point of time, is it more skewed towards and that's with capital structure issues - sounds like everything on the ground levels come pretty good.
Jim Thompson: I think generally that's probably yes the right answer. There are a couple of folks on there that really don't have debt issues as much as they got operational issues. But for the most part, you're exactly correct on that assumption.
Wes Golladay: And would you typically have a much higher recovery rate, when it's just a reorg?
Jim Thompson: Absolutely. As we look, as we look at that watch list and look at the guys that might be towards the top of that list, we do a lot of place or data and things like that to try to understand. Look at sales, where do they fit in the organization and unfortunately for the, for the vast majority of those locations we sit in the top 60% 70% of their, of their locations, which gives us great leverage when it comes to negotiating in a reorganization BK. So in addition to that, we look at existing rents versus what we again believe market rents are. And I think we've got some pretty good opportunity for upside in a lot of those cases. So at this point, we're pretty comfortable where we are in the watch list and our position in that whole arena where it goes from here.
Mike Mas: We have a very detailed investment strategy, but it really comes down to, we like to own, acquire, develop properties were bad news is good news? I guess maybe. I mean it sounds like the anchor space is pretty much spoke while the vacant space. And would it be fair to say maybe you want some space back at this point. I think you mentioned you had some upside at some of these assets.
Jim Thompson: As Lisa said we like opportunity to bad news becomes good news and that's a lot of times getting those anchor spaces back and can trigger the redevelopment that you're waiting on and those are the kinds of things with watchlist tenants. Our strategic plans that we devised for every one of our assets. Our guys are, if I get it back, what am I going to do. So we're not, surprised when it happens or if it happens, but we're ready in the event it does happen that we know where we're headed.
Wes Golladay: Got it. And then for the redevelopment. I think the comment earlier in the call was the development and redevelopment would be a positive contributor next year but more specifically for the redevelopment, do you expect it to be that net positive contribution that you have in your algorithm or is there anything special that's going to come offline that may be a little bit of a detriment to offset the positive from what's coming online next year.
Jim Thompson: More to come details wise, but on balance is going to be a major contribution on a net basis. We will continue I hope to have some opportunities to frankly take some NOI offline to set up new redevelopments, but in particular, The Abbot and The Cross in Clarendon are the two assets that the teams have been working extraordinarily hard on we've been from a financial finance perspective, very excited looking out to when those properties start to stabilize and that time is now. The leases have been executed, great visibility into when we start - we'll start seeing some income start to come in at the very tail end of even this year, providing from this point forward, there's in those two assets and if you put our four in-process ground up developments into the bucket. By 2024, that's another $15 million plus of NOI that we are creating in the portfolio. So the short answer, we do anticipate returning to a positive contribution from redevelopments as we look into '23 and '24.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Ronald Camden with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Ronald Camden: Couple of quick ones. Just looking at the shop occupancy. It's been taking up nicely over the last 12 months. I think I heard you say earlier that there is maybe 100 basis points more to go to get to peak. Just trying to get a sense of just for some context throughout the cycles, how high does that can that occupancy get, could you get to sort of a 93 plus range or do you start trying for some structural factors? Thanks.
Jim Thompson: Yes, so the 100 basis points, by the way, was an online commenced rate. So that's shops and anchors, we look at 92.5%, 93% as a kind of a top end from a shop percent leased perspective. So that's where our eyes are, we believe in the quality of the portfolio, we believe we can replicate those ceilings and the teams are working hard to do that.
Ronald Camden: Great. And then just my next question was just trying to back to sort of the breadcrumbs of the growth algorithm. You have a really great break down sort of the same-store NOI in the sub. I see base rents are 3%. Just trying to get a handle some of the other two big lines uncollectibles. And this is year-to-date numbers uncollectible adding 4.7% recoveries a headwind of 3.9%, as you're thinking about sort of the future and those sort of presumably normalized, is this sort of the right new way to think about it in terms of the long-term growth prospects of the company?
Jim Thompson: Let's first make some short-term comments and then we'll get into the long, but we do see. I appreciate you noted that new disclosure, by the way. So, and I hope everyone takes it takes a look at that. I think it's really helpful, what it first does is highlights that base rent growth as we've been trying to point people's eyes to is the best line item to look at for the health and forward quality of our earnings stream in the near term and what you see there is yes, 3% growth outside of the noise in the first half of this year, we should do better than that to finish out the year on the base rent line. We will, that will not be a decelerating impact, that will be an accelerated impact. We will continue to have tailwind as I mentioned previously from bad debt expense or uncollectible lease income as the portfolio very quickly moves back to historical averages, again 175 basis points last year moving to about 75 basis points this year, 50 basis points around being in our long-term sustained average. There is noise in the other line items. We've got, it was just a lot of COVID era type of adjustments still moving through really 2021 that are impacting all of the other components of growth, but I think looking forward, I would, my our eyes are focused on base rent growth, the amplified impact of recovery income as you lease up space and raise your commenced occupancy, you're going to amplify that growth by picking up margin on your collections and then we add into that the investment and what we just talked about with Wes and the contribution from redevelopments and you put all that in into the bucket and we feel great about achieving our long-term objectives of 3% or better through redevelopments and in the short term we should do better than that from an occupancy perspective, because we have room to grow rent paying occupancy.
Lisa Palmer: And also, that's certainly the same property NOI growth kind of long-term growth model, which is a very large component of the going forward growth for the company and, but we also have the ability to invest the very high level of free cash flow that we generate, which will also be an important part of our long-term growth of core operating earnings per share and point you to our investor presentation, not just a disclosure where we do a very - thank you team, a very nice job of illustrating our growth model going forward. And that's on a stabilized basis, so it's not even actually accounting for the occupancy increases that we are seeing today and we will continue to see in the near future.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Hong Zhang with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Hong Zhang: Yes, hi. I think in the past you've talked about potentially reaching back to 96% leased occupancy as early as late next year. I guess, given your, your commentary about the uncertainty that's in the market right now, has your thinking around that changed at all?
Lisa Palmer: I'm happy to jump in. I will reiterate again that regardless of the macro backdrop, we feel really confident about the quality of our properties and our going-forward health of our business, we were just re-it - just repeating really what we said in our prepared remarks, we have - we're entering this with a position of strength as we have worked through a lot of dislocation and disruption through the past two years, our operators, our tenants, our merchants are in an extremely healthy position and we believe in. Jim talked about how we've watched them to be adaptive and react to and be flexible and I really believe that even if there is softening consumer demand, which we're not seeing because of again our trade areas are supportive of consumers that are able to absorb a little bit more, but even if there is softening demand, we truly believe that they're going to be able to adapt to be flexible as we've seen them already do and then with that retailers and merchants play a long-term game as well. It's not just about the next 12 months and they're also positioning our companies for future growth. And they're going to need new locations for that future growth and they're going to desire to be in the best locations and we feel that we are really well positioned to be able to work with them and help them meet their goals as well.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
Derek Johnston: Hi, everyone. Good morning. And I'm sorry, I know we spent probably too much time on this, but it's important. I'll try to be pointed because investors definitely seem concerned about the forward outlook of the business trends in the second half, much more so than strong results and even pipeline commentary, but know look we believe Regency is very well positioned, but could you speak to actual conversations with tenants and prospective tenants? And I guess the question is are we sensing or seeing any slowdowns in decision making right now or is this exercise really mostly conjecture at this point. That's kind of what I'm trying to figure out.
Jim Thompson: Derek, I would tell you that we're fresh of CSC Las Vegas. Trust me. We have been at this game, a long time, and I'm looking for smoke more than anybody, and just not seeing it today. There is continued positive attitude towards growth, deals are getting done and yes, we're looking hard, but you're not seeing any cracks at this point in the armor.
Derek Johnston: Thank you. That's helpful. And that's also in line with peer commentary just I guess, sticking on leasing. So the Abbott and Boston, I was wondering if you can just get an update on the early leasing there and tenant interest. I know it's stabilized at 24. Right, but you do have some rents commencing. I think in the back half of this year. So it is really any color on the demand, the interest of this mixed use asset and really how you feel about the project and how perspective tenants are reacting as well. Thank you.
Jim Thompson: Sure. The Abbott is nearing construction completion. It looks fantastic. If you get an opportunity up in the Harvard areas please poke your head and I think you'd be impressed with what we've accomplished up there. Leasing momentum is strong, we're 100% leased on our retail, it was, it was a little slow on the office side coming out of COVID, they were, close to go, but we have had great current opportunity on the office side, and I believe we just signed. there we go. just off the press, just signed at least on the majority of our office space in the tower. So very, very positive news. The, like I said, the project looks great, tenants are under construction should be opening up and now that we've got this office lease executed, we will have a good report for next quarter.
Operator: And then next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning. It's Eric on for Juan. I was just hoping if you could talk about how your tenant underwriting has changed post pandemic and kind of your thoughts today given the potential slowdown in the economy.
Jim Thompson: I think our underwriting really is, has been consistent. We our pretty conservative in underwriting we embed contingencies we've increases contingencies as we saw interest rates increase as we saw a slowdown from supplies and other things. So I think our underwriting has continued to keep up with the moving parts in the economy and from an underwriting standpoint we still are able to underwrite deals. It's still meet our threshold from a yield perspective with good visibility towards expectation for costs.
Mike Mas: So, Eric, I'll jump in and add. I don't the way your question was framed I think we look at tenant underwriting whether in the operations side of business or project underwriting in the investment side of business for all seasons and we don't, necessarily look at the economic backdrop and change, where we have a very focused strategy on our merchandising mix and what types of operators. We want to partner with and do business with and that's been consistent through all seasons and all economic cycles. And we make adjustments on the margins in our investment activity to account for or provide for a changing landscape in costs, as you would expect us to do. But really, we don't you push the accelerator or push on the brakes materially in any way we apply our very long long-standing well-honed strategy on both, on both sides.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, Thank you. And then just follow up on foot traffic given your defensive portfolio, I was just curious how you're Centers performing in versus the competition in the respective trade markets.
Jim Thompson: As you would expect them to perform. We are not, we believe we own market dominant centers, trade area dominant centers, that is our objective. We call it our DNA approach to the investment, we use premier high quality as these designations. And, the reason we use those designations as they outperform on several metrics, one of which is tenant demand consumer demand and they continue to outperform on consumer demand. Our centers are the preferred Centers generally in those, in those preferred trade areas, foot traffic levels would support that outperformance, sales would support that performance, tenant demand and rents.
Lisa Palmer: Yes, I think the best or the best scorecard that you can really use for that. Yes, you can look at foot traffic and should, but what are - what our average base rents because that's what the market is demanding. So that's what the retailers are using as their basis for the sales that they can produce and sales and in both cases as we've already talked about earlier today. As Jim did, we talked about bankruptcies. Regency is in the very top percentage in both of those categories.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Paulina Rojas with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.
Paulina Rojas: Hi, you talked about the strength of your tenants but in terms of your small shop cohort I hear from you and your peers, but they are, they are stronger than in the past. And aside of the fact that they are survivors from a period of disruption which is yes itself very telling are you able to track any other hard metric as sales leverage to substantiate that statement, that they are stronger than in the past and I know the access to information is limited, but I was wondering if there is anything at all, you can, that it's more and tangible you can focus on and track over time?
Jim Thompson: Certainly, sales has been a major indicator in the past and we continue to use that with our small shop tenants, we are able to get that kind of reporting. So that's probably our best metric to at least judge historical performance. We obviously look hard to credit going in, but it's also an important factor. Small shop tenants is their past performance. From an operator standpoint, you can walk in a retailer's store and get a pretty good sense of whether they're - whether they're a good retailer not and that's, that's what our folks in the field, do an excellent job of staying close to our, to our tenants and you can read the tea leaves and that's I mean it's hard to put it on paper and give you a metric, but that's how we, that's how we, you have to run your business to be able to stay ahead of that and I think that's one of the, one of the things we do very, very well at the asset manager level is really understanding what's going on behind those tenant doors.
Paulina Rojas: You mentioned sales how frequently can you - can you have access to their sales performance?
Jim Thompson: We generally take a hard dive on an annual basis.
Lisa Palmer: And I think we hear, and I know Paulina you've heard us talk about this as well. We have 22, maybe a little bit more than 20 offices across the country with people in the - on - in the local markets that are working with our tenants really closely. So we absolutely look at our reported sales, but also just having good relationships with our, with our tenants, with our customers is really important to understanding the health of their businesses, the challenges they may be facing, I think it is we really rose above some of the challenges in the pandemic because of that and we will continue to do so in good times and in bad times. And so that's also an important part of it. So it's not a hard and fast metric and nothing that we can actually report, but it's certainly those relationships, those conversations and understanding what's important to them.
Paulina Rojas: Thank you, then my other question is regarding commenced occupancy, sure decreased by 10 basis points sequentially, less than, 1Q, and that is usually affected by seasonality. Right? So and my first question. Is there any reason behind that structure sequential instrument? And the second part is and I think you mentioned you were targeting incremental 100 basis points for this year? So can you please confirm that that refers to the same property in-place occupancy and the average for the year, not end to end? I want to make sure I am understanding the target of 100 well.
Jim Thompson: That's the commenced occupancy increases that we're targeting is a period based measurement, so it will be at year-end we should be 100 basis points up from where we started. I think we're already 40 basis points through the first half of the year, so that speaks to the confidence we have in delivering space from that pre-leased pipeline over the balance of this year Paulina. That's a spot rate. So that what we're excited about is the impact on 2023.
Paulina Rojas: Okay. So yes, occupancy commencements should be stronger in the back half?
Jim Thompson: Yes, it needs to be to achieve our objectives of 100. Yes, it's plus or minus 100 but we feel good about delivering the space that's again already contracted for. So it's just a matter of our tenants building out, I'm not making light of how difficult this could be, the teams are doing, I mean daily hard work delivering spaces building our spaces that we can get to rent commencement.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Linda Tsai: Hi, you've got 12% left on cash basis accounting last quarter it was 14%, just given the trajectory you've been coming out of from the pandemic, how many quarters might it take to get to a normalized level of cash percentage of tenants on cash basis accounting?
Mike Mas: Hi, Linda. It's Mike. Yes, I don't have a discrete answer to your question, but we're making great progress. I do think we do have some visibility to at least another 1% to 3%, kind of sticking with our policy of what a tenant needs to do and how they need to behave for us to convert them back to accrual accounting. So we do see another 1% to 3%, I think in our near-term impact, which by the way would include another, call it two million dollars to five million dollars of non-cash straight-line rent conversions, so we don't guide on that number in the supplement, but we do talk about it on this call. Beyond that and then the question becomes will when it, what is your normal percentage of cash basis tenants and that's again a little bit harder to get a gauge on because the leasing standards also changed as we look at our historical averages. So, but we think our numbers are probably in the mid, mid-single digit area, the 5% to 8% range, somewhere in that area, plus or minus, so we've got a little bit of room to run, but we're nearing the end and we'll continue to - we'll continue to make progress as we have,
Linda Tsai: And I appreciate the question and the concern for, it's a metric that we have all begun to report, but the important thing to really focus on is bad debt expense because tenants can be a cash basis tenant by paying rent. And as Mike said earlier we are seeing our bad debt expense return to more typical historical levels. That's the more important thing that we really, and that's what we focus on here as well.
Linda Tsai: Thanks for that. And then the jobs report came out this morning and was better than expected with decent hiring in retail, including grocery and general merchandise. Are you hearing this as well from your tenants in terms of using labor shortages?
Jim Thompson: I think generally speaking, we have seen in the same conversations that we're having with our tenants that we have seen things is over, I think we even said that last quarter, so it's a little more than even a quarter where we've seen some easing of both labor shortages and also supply chain difficulties, both.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Michael Gorman with BTIG. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Gorman: Yes, thanks, good morning. And we're running a little long, so I'll try to be quick. But stepping back for a minute and looking longer-term Lisa, you talked about ESG and some of the targets you'd laid out in your new report from the spring and I'm just wondering if you could talk about how we should think about the capital commitment to these initiatives over the next eight to 10 years or so and internally how Regency is approaching underwriting the different projects and different initiatives that you have on the emissions front.
Lisa Palmer: It is not going to - there will be an additional cost and incremental costs, but there is also savings as we do implement some of the energy efficiency things that we've already - we've done over the past 13 years from a water conservation LED lighting and we'll continue to do and we'll also continue to perhaps generate some revenues from solar panels. And so from a material standpoint, it's not material. What's more important is the fact that we are really focused on embodied responsibility and corporate responsibility within our company and it truly is a foundational strategy and as we think about and talk about new investment opportunities, it is part of the conversation. Every acquisition, every development, we will look at the impact essentially to our targets into our goals and objectives. But it's not a material cost.
Jim Thompson: If I may just add a little bit more detail, therefore you, Michael, 80% of our objectives can be achieved by really pulling two levers, right? Through 2030. It's LED light conversions and it's addition of solar panels on property. So to Lisa's point, LED light version is already part of our plan. So that is in effect a neutral element of our expense rate and then solar panels is points where that's where you actually save some money, and in fact, you have an ROI you make money on the solar panel installations. So just for a little bit more added color, the balance. So, where the other 20% going to come from? Innovation is going to play a big role and then we might have to buy some racks as well which they'll be high quality racks and we'll be very smart with that.
Michael Gorman: That's great color. Thank you. And just maybe following up on that. I understand that it's quarter Regency anyway, but I'm wondering as the entire market evolves is you're having more conversations around developments, redevelopments, maybe even acquisitions and lease discussions. I'm wondering if you're seeing Regency's dedication to ESG come up in those conversations as may be a competitive advantage is something that maybe helps in these negotiations and then these discussions and for regular way business.
Jim Thompson: Let me start on the capital market side, yes. Whether at the tapping the unsecured bond markets or whether it's - we have a bit of a financial incentive within our revolver, but we're seeing, we're seeing it permeate through the capital markets and we do believe ultimately whether it's access or whether it's pricing reductions there will be some marginal benefit us on the operation side.
Mike Mas: On the operational side, I would say there are Kindred Spirits that appreciate what you do but I don't think it's ingrained in the at the real estate level as much as is the capital market and then we do development.
Lisa Palmer: And then I'll take the transaction side. On the transaction, we've actually we were part of a bid process, if you will, on a portfolio of properties, unfortunately we were not successful in it, it was a major part of the bid as to the efforts that the company is putting into the E in ESG. So yes, it is, it is very important to other stakeholders, as well.
Operator: Thank you, everyone. At this time we have reached the end of the question and answer session. And I would now like to turn the call back over to Lisa Palmer for any closing remarks.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you all very much, appreciate your time with us as some of you may be heading to the, shore or the beach or the Long Island for the weekend. Enjoy your weekend. Thanks all.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a great day.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-05-04 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to Regency Centers Corporation First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Christy McElroy. Thank you. You may begin.
Christy McElroy: Good morning, and welcome to Regency Centers' first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Lisa Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Mas, Chief Financial Officer; Jim Thompson, Chief Operating Officer; Chris Leavitt, SVP and Treasurer; Alan Roth, Senior Managing Director of the East Region; and Nick Wibbenmeyer, Senior Managing Director of the West Region. As a reminder, today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements about the company's views of future business and financial performance, including forward earnings guidance and future market conditions. These are based on management's current beliefs and expectations and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. It's possible that actual results may differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements we may make.

In our discussion today, we will also reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. The comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this quarter's earnings materials, which are posted on our Investor Relations website. Please note that we have also posted a presentation on our website with additional information, including disclosures related to forward earnings guidance. Our caution on forward-looking statements also applied to these presentation materials. Lisa?
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Christy. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. We've had a great start to the year. Our operating trends are healthy, our investment pipelines are active and our balance sheet is strong. With this even further strengthening of our core business and accretion from our transaction activity, our outlook for 2022 has improved from a quarter ago. Our centers continue to benefit from positive structural tailwinds, including the strength of first-ring suburban trade areas, the greater amounts of time that people are spending near their homes as hybrid work becomes more permanent and the growing emphasis among retailers on the importance of brick and mortar locations as a key component to last mile distribution. This vibrancy in the retail environment is evidenced by strong tenant sales and continued robust leasing activity and we're successfully pushing rents higher as we continue to make progress getting our portfolio back to historical high occupancy levels. We do see and acknowledge the risks of inflation and continued supply chain challenges and labor shortages on our business. But so far we and importantly our tenants have largely been able to mitigate the impacts. Jim will discuss this in more detail in a few minutes. We are full steam ahead on our value-creating development and redevelopment pipeline, which remains the best use of our free cash flow. We're excited to have started a new ground-up target and shop right anchored center during the first quarter and not only are we making great progress on this and our other in-process projects, but we continue to build our future pipeline. On the transaction front, the assets that we've purchased over the last year are very indicative and very much like those that we already own, high-quality grocery-anchored neighborhood and community centers, and we will continue to look for opportunities to invest incremental capital accretively in these types of centers. We had a really successful and active first quarter doing just that. And as a result, we've raised our full year 2022 acquisition guidance to $170 million. And our largest acquisition so far this year, just after quarter end, we purchased our partner's 75% interest in four centers in our JV with Castors for approximately $90 million. Similar to the buyout of our USAA joint venture last year, we saw another great opportunity to allocate capital on an accretive basis into high-quality assets that we know well. While higher interest rates could eventually have more of an impact on private market pricing to this point we've continued to see significant capital chasing grocery-anchored neighborhood and community shopping centers. Perhaps even more telling on the acquisitions we've completed in recent months are the other assets that we've seen trade at low to mid 4% cap rates for the type of high-quality, well-located centers that we own, there remains a sizable disconnect between public and private market values for our asset class. Before I turn it over to Jim, I do want to acknowledge our recent organizational announcement that he will retire at the end of this year. There is simply no possible way to appropriately recognize him on this call or future calls for that matters as this is not his last, we are grateful that he'll still be with us for the remainder of the year. Many of you already know Alan and Nick, who will be stepping up next year to take on Jim's responsibilities. They're both on the call with us today and you will see them at upcoming conferences and other events. With Jim paving the way, I'm confident this will be a seamless transition and I look forward to what the future brings. Jim?
Jim Thompson: Thanks, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate the comments and very much look forward to finishing my career here at Regency with strong 2022 results and Q1 was a great way to start the year. As Lisa mentioned in her remarks, the operating environment remains robust. We continue to see healthy foot traffic and strong tenant sales trends, particularly among our grocers and restaurants. New leasing volumes in the quarter were nearly 40% above the historical first quarter averages and we are seeing terrific demand across all unit sizes, both shop and anchor space and across our portfolio geographically with a flight to quality being the driver. We were pleased to cover – we're pleased that over the past quarter, our same-property percent leased rate held firm at 94.3% and our percent commenced rate was actually up 30 basis points sequentially, which is extremely positive in my view as we typically experience a seasonal occupancy decline in the first quarter of the year. Year-over-year, our percent lease rate is up 170 basis points and percent commenced rate is up 120 bps. These positive trends really speak to the leasing progress we've made over the year in addition to the quality of our centers and the hard work of our team. Not only are we making progress filling vacancies, but our renewal retention rate also remains ahead of our historical average. Blended rent spreads in the first quarter averaged 6.5%, which is reflective of the healthy demand for space across the portfolio. We also remain judicious in our leasing capital spend as we continue to be successful in our efforts to embed solid rent steps into leases, which gives us an opportunity to keep pace with market rent growth throughout the life of the lease. This three pronged approach to growing rents, number one, focusing on contractual steps marking to market at exploration and limiting capital spend is reflected in both our GAAP and net rent – net effective rent spreads, which are both in the mid-teens for leases executed in the first quarter. The combination of both our occupancy and rent growth trends is embedded in our same-property base rent growth, which will be the most meaningful contributor to same-property NOI growth in 2022 and going forward. We do recognize the macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds that persist, including inflation, supply chain issues and labor shortages. So far in the trade areas in which we operate most of our tenants have largely been able to pass increased costs through to consumers, so we have not seen a meaningful impact yet from the tenant perspective.  Permitting delays, and the availability and cost materials and labor are potential impacts that we continue to monitor. But so far we haven't yet seen a material impact on rent commitment dates as we've been working hard to try to mitigate these impacts on our business. Examples of this include helping our tenants coordinate permitting, source supplies, phasing some approval processes and ordering long lead time items in bulk. In the context of our development and redevelopment projects and pipeline, we are diligently monitoring pricing trends and are conservatively underwriting cost escalations into our estimated yields. But that has not stopped us from moving forward and we are making great progress on our value creation pipeline, currently with about $350 million of redevelopment projects in process. At our East San Marco ground up development project here in North Florida, we anticipate delivering the public store this summer with rent commencing later this year. The project started just over a year ago and has an expected stabilized yield that it exceeds 7%. Even before delivering the anchor space, we are nearly 100% leased today, with only one shop space for remaining. This project is a great example of the leasing demand we are seeing for new grocery-anchored centers in top trade areas. We were excited in Q1 to commence construction on another ground up development project called Glenwood Green with a pro rata cost of $40 million and an expected stabilized yield of 7%. The project is located 30 miles south of New York City in Old Bridge, New Jersey, and will serve as the retail hub of a new 250-acre master plan community. The 350,000 square foot center will be anchored by ShopRite, Target and a single tenant medical building. All three will be it on a ground lease and construct their own buildings, helping to mitigate our risk of cost escalations over the construction period. Both of these ground up projects reflect our ability to continue sourcing and executing on value-add projects, attractive yields in this current environment. As we consider new development and redevelopment projects for our future pipeline, we are excited to continue partnering with best-in-class grocers and are encouraged as they continue to expand their footprints in top trade areas. Overall, our team remains energized by the robust retail activity we are seeing across all regions and categories. And I look forward to sharing more details over the next several quarters. Mike?
Mike Mas: Thanks Jim. Good morning, everyone. I'll start by addressing the first quarter and then walk through the primary changes in our 2022 revised guidance. We are pleased to report strong first quarter results in operating trends, supported by continued occupancy improvement, rent growth, and accretion from investment activity. Additionally, we continue to collect previously reserved rents from cash basis tenants as uncollectable lease income was again positive in the quarter impacted by about $9 million or $0.05 per share of prior year collections. And given continuing improvement and underlying credit conditions, we also converted more cash-based tenants back to accrual, triggering the reversal of straight line rent reserves during the first quarter, which contributed close to $4 million or $0.02 per share to Nareit FFO. This conversion impact was not included in our prior guidance range. We now have 14% of our AVR remaining on a cash basis of accounting and our rent collection rate was 93% in the first quarter for the smaller pool. As we discussed on last quarter's call, there remains significant noise in our year-over-year, same-property NOI comparisons that will certainly impact the cadence of our growth rate throughout the rest of this year. In the first quarter, we had a relatively easy year-over-year comparison, primarily related to uncollectible lease income in the year ago period. Conversely, over the next three quarters, we are facing much tougher comps, especially in the second and third quarters, as it relates to uncollectible lease income comparisons, as well as on expense reconciliation adjustment that occurred in the second quarter of last year. All of which we have discussed previously. Given this comparability issue, the best indicator of what is truly driving our business this year is same property base rent growth. You will find that for the first quarter and underlying our guidance for the balance of 2022, base rent growth will be the primary contributor to our Same Property NOI and will most closely match our sustained growth trajectory. We wish our classic metrics could be less complicated, but the reality of the accounting impacts resulting from the pandemic, will continue to affect year-over-year comparisons through year end. Turning to 2022 guidance, we hope you've had a chance to review the details in our press release and business update slide deck, both posted to our website. On Page 6 of the side deck, we've added a column to show the drivers of the $0.11 per share increase from our previous midpoint to the new midpoint of our Nareit FFO guidance range. The drivers of the change that related to our operating fundamentals included a $0.03 positive impact from the 75 basis point upward revision to our same property NOI growth forecast. The primary drivers include higher percentage rents in the first quarter, mainly from grocery and restaurant tenants, as well as expectations for higher average commenced occupancy for the year, driven by more favorable lease up progress and lower move outs in Q1 than previously expected. As Jim noted, commenced occupancy was actually up sequentially in the first quarter of the year, where it's typically seasonally lower. We also estimate additional $0.02 per share of accretion from transaction activity, reflecting the net result of our incremental acquisition and disposition activity, featuring the acquisition of our JV assets. The remaining increase in our guidance at the midpoint is related to the cash basis accounting adjustments I mentioned earlier. We increased our forecast for non-cash revenues by $0.03 per share, primary driven by the impact on straight line rent from the conversion of cash basis tenants back to accrual during the first quarter. Recall that we only include these impacts, and results and guidance on an as-converted basis. Additionally, we raised our expectations for prior collections to $18 million from the previous $13 million, driving another $0.03 per share of positive change to our guidance range at the midpoint. From a funding perspective, we raised our acquisition guidance to $170 million for the full year. We also raised our disposition guidance to $210 million. But as a reminder, $125 million of that is related to the sale of Costa Verde in January, the proceeds from which were already used to fund the purchase of a Long Island portfolio we closed in late December. The remaining $85 million of dispositions will in part fund our acquisition pipeline combined with cash on hand and just over $60 million of net proceeds from the final settlement in April of our remaining forward ATM equity. We also expect free cash flow after dividend payments and capital expenditures to be north of $140 million in 2022, which will be used to fund our development, redevelopment pipeline spend. Finally, we are in great shape with our sector leading balance sheet and leverage profile and remain well positioned to continue taking advantage of growth opportunities. We ended the quarter with full capacity in our revolver and our leverage is at the low end of our targeted range of five to five and a half times. While the debt markets have been volatile and all-in costs have risen sharply year-to-date with no unsecured maturities until 2024 Regency to remain patient and opportunistic when accessing the debt markets in a meaningful way. With that, we look forward to taking your questions.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Craig Schmidt: Great. I was interested to see your ground up development at Glenwood Green. Maybe you could tell us a little more about the 250 acre Master Planned Community that surrounds it. And also it sounds like the grocery is still want to open in ground up centers. How are the municipalities receiving that request post-pandemic?
Mike Mas: Craig, good morning. The Master Planned was basically took I think, 19 years to get entitled. So it was a good, hard, long slog, but the landowner has been working a long time, heavy residential be surrounding the retail hub that we're providing. I think the community is very, very excited to have the grocery and the target components. As indicated our leasing activity has been extremely strong, having just broken ground we're LOI or lease negotiation with probably 30% of the shop space. So a lot of pinup demand is how I characterize it. There wasn't a lot of retail growth in that marketplace or any kind of growth. So it's kind of that perfect diamond in the rough that we're able to react to and pull off a really nice retail development.
Craig Schmidt: Great. And then just cap rates for the neighborhood grocery anchored, as well as the larger community centers. Do you see them as still compressing or stabilized or expanding?
Lisa Palmer: Craig, I'll take that. Thank you. It's Lisa here. I would say cap rates had been – had stabilized that as I said, in my prepared remarks, low to mid-4s for the neighborhood grocery, even community grocery anchored shopping centers, the type of centers that we want to own. And they had been stabilized at that level for quite some time. And again, as I will reiterate what I said in the prepared remarks. We are not seeing that move yet. But with the – because there continues to be a lot of significant capital flowing into that our sector, wanting to own high quality grocery anchored shopping centers. But as we continue to see the pressures, the interest rates rise, I would expect that there may be some pressure on valuations. And you may have – it's simply supply demand. You may have the leveraged buyers exiting the market. So with that, nothing yet but certainly wouldn't be surprised if we see cap rates rise, I just wouldn't expect it to go much. I mean 5%. So still in the – instead of low to mid 4s, maybe you're in the mid to high 4s.
Craig Schmidt: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Bilerman with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Bilerman: Thanks. Lisa, I'd say Regency over its history is always been, I think conservative realistic on the outlook. Sort of grounded, I'd say in reality. I guess, given the macro environment today, how did you sort of weigh increasing guidance and benefiting from the core and all the leasing relative to the macro outlook, which you sort of competed a little bit is uncertain, is none of that feeding into any of the data that you're seeing on the ground today. And that's effectively why you had such good confidence to be able to list guidance, just to sort of walk through that a little bit.
Lisa Palmer: Sure. I appreciate the acknowledgement. You put conservative with realistic together. And I think our approach always has been one of reasonably optimistic, the quality of our company, the quality of our properties and the quality of our people overall. And so with that, you're absolutely correct. I mean, we've been talking about it for several quarters now with regards to the pressures that exist in the macro environment with labor shortages, supply chain challenges, and over the most recent quarter’s inflation. Without – with how we have built the company and our portfolio. However, we are positioned to perform well, really through all cycles, whether it's an inflationary environment, whether it's recession and that is our properties are located in trade areas with really compelling demographics that we can benefit from a customer base that is able to withstand some of those cycles. And you've heard us talk about this in the past as well. And in recessionary environments, there's often a case where consumers want to trade down. And instead of going to higher end more luxury, whether it’s department stores or even restaurants, they go to their neighborhood community shopping centers for more value convenience and still want to spend money, but back to close to their homes. So with that, you’ve – the strength in our – in the operating fundamentals really came through in the first quarter. And that’s with all of these macro environment headwinds that we’re already facing. That’s what gives us the confidence. It’s the quality of our properties. It’s what we’re seeing on the ground with the demand for the leasing, it’s our ability to push rents in this environment. It’s the ability for our tenants to continue to grow their sales and pass on price increases to their customers because of the trade areas that we operate in.
Michael Bilerman: Did you have to sort of moderate any of your growth expectations because of the macro environment or is it just as you’re sort of seeing it today, I guess, did you bake in any sort of buffer effectively?
Lisa Palmer: Mike’s given me the – don’t give too much guidance here, Lisa, so I’m going to hand it off to Mike.
Mike Mas: I can take that Michael. If you think about the quality or the context of the raise, the $0.11 raise, it’s really coming from two buckets, right? Core fundamental improvement and then what all characterizes prior year cash accounting impacts. So on the prior year cash collection impacts, those are known items that are under our belt prior – we collected $9 million of the now $18 million expectation that we have. We did raise that expectation. So maybe in light of some of the comments Lisa made, we still have confidence that will have a little bit more success collecting the rents that were previously reserved. The non-cash component we’re taking this day by day. It is us; we’re doing this on an as converted basis. So we’ve converted 2.5% of our ADR back to accrual accounting that came with $4 million of a straight line rent reversal. We will take that incrementally from this point forward. What we’re most excited about and have a high degree of confidence on are the core fundamental improvements in the same property portfolio raising our commence occupancy by 30 basis points in the first quarter. I don’t want to call that a surprise, but was a big confident type of metric for us as we thought about our plan. Do we have buffers in the balance of the year? We do Michael, but by this time your leasing plan is pretty known. Everything we’re going to do from this point forward is going to be about 2023. And we’re equally excited about that year as well. And then lastly bringing home some of these accretive transactions, they’re under our belts a 100 – we did raise our acquisitions guidance by $140 million, the large amount it’s all closed essentially. We do have one property under contract in the Northeast that we are working through due diligence. And we’re confident that we will bring into the fold, but really not a spec – not a lot of speculation there either. And on the funding front, fully funded with a combination of dispositions, we settled our ATM; we assumed a mortgage with some of the property. So we feel good about the quality of that raise and our ability to deliver.
Michael Bilerman: That’s very helpful. Just as a second topic Lisa, just on the transaction market, and you talked about this sizeable disconnect between public and private, you talked about all the capital that’s out there, and I recognize your joint venture partners are all – everyone’s got their own sort of timeline about when they want to sell. But just sort of help reconcile a little bit, I think you and your peers have been very active of buying venture partners out and also continuing on the acquisition landscape, why not increase dispositions even more? And I recognize you’ve lifted it to 210, but you’re still in a – you’ve narrowed your net disposition guidance rather than expanding it. If this disconnected so wide, why not be even more aggressive today at liquidating the bottom of your portfolio. And I recognize you have always sold the bottom of your portfolio, so there’s less of it, but just sort of help walk through why not be more aggressive on the disposition side?
Lisa Palmer: I – we aggressive is the word I would say, because I do want to remind everyone that we have for as long as I’ve been at the company, but 26 years, which is essentially modern era regency, we have remained committed to selling 1% to 2% over time of our portfolio annually. And it’s usually focusing on – as you know, focusing on lower growth non-strategic after the GSC, we actually accelerated some of those sales and sold even more. And since that time, the quality of our portfolio really has improved and the need to sell up to that 2% just wasn’t there. When we looked at what falls into the non-strategic lower growth bucket. So we’ve been more in the 1% area. And in some cases using that non-strategic as a source of capital to trade into the types of centers that we do want to own long-term. So I mean, it sounds like I – it can’t possibly be true, but we really like our portfolio. And there are – we are looking to buy centers that look like what we already own. So in – we get much above that 1%, then we’re starting to sell what we want to buy. And we do want to grow. We believe that there are real economies of scale in our business both from an operations perspective and with – and also with tenant relationships.
Michael Bilerman: All right. Thanks, Lisa.
Operator: Our next question is from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Juan Sanabria: Hi, good morning. I was just hoping you could talk a little bit about the rent growth you are seeing in the markets. You kind of touched on in the couple times in the prepared remarks. And maybe if you could just benchmark the increases you’ve seen versus 2019 pre-COVID levels. And maybe give us a sense of the variability in that growth in markets like is South Florida up 2x of what the Northeast is up, just to get a sense of what markets are really hot and have taken share if you will as a result of the pandemic.
Jim Thompson: Yes. Juan, this is Jim. I’d think – yes, we’re really pleased that the 6.5% where we ended up this year with 8% being attributed to the new leases. Quite frankly, as I step back and look, there really are no outliers this quarter that were driving that, which was impressive to me that it felt like we were across the board in all regions, really hitting kind of a target growth number. I think it’s indicative of a healthy portfolio across the board and really can’t point – I think as I look back over compared to 2019, I think we’re back to those same kind of rent growth that we experienced in pre-pandemic times. I would like to remind as we look at rent growth as a whole, it’s kind of the three pronged approach I talked about, it’s getting those embedded rent steps, which we’ve been very successful. This quarter we had 80% of our deals had bumps them and 97% of new deals this quarter had embedded rent bumps. Obviously, mark the market wouldn’t get the opportunity on expiring leases, judicious spend of capital, all of those kind of combined to that net effective/GAAP rent that’s probably what I look at more than anything is that’s a more long-term real growth kind of metric, and we’re getting back to where we want to be and where we historically operated in that 13% to 15% range right now.
Juan Sanabria: And then just on the leasing versus commenced, you have a 230 basis point spread. How should we think about that being captured over time? And what’s truly additive from a – kind of a base rent perspective as we think about the balance of the year.
Mike Mas: Sure. Hey, Juan, it’s Mike. So you referenced the 230 basis point pre-lease percentage just throw some – I’ll throw some stats actually and then we can talk about how we see absorption going through the year. That equates to about $33 million of rent, when you include redevelopments. We do disclose the amount in the back of the supplement at $6 million for the quarter, as a point that is without redevelopment. So that would the $33 million would be all in through redevelopment. From a timing perspective, we should get about two-thirds of that by year end and the balance we are seeing coming online before the – within the first half of next year. And then to give you some further context on that pre-lease percentage, we are running higher than historical averages, where we’re in the plus or minus 175 basis point range. So we’re very comfortably leasing space and importantly delivering space. As we think about absorption for the balance of this year, last quarter, we talked about 75 to 100 basis points of increased commenced occupancy supporting our plan. I’d say now with really successful first quarter under our belt, we’ve taken that 75 basis points off the table. So we’re looking at a plus or minus 100 basis point rise and commence to occupancy supporting our same property growth rate. And then beyond that, not to dwell on 2023 or to give a 2023 outlook at this point in time, but we’re not at our peak occupancy levels. We – our eyes are on 96% and we think we’ve been there before the portfolios as good as it’s ever been, absence a macroeconomic environment. We don’t – there’s no one around this table that doesn’t believe we can’t get back to those levels, but that’s a lot – I just said a lot in one simple word, absent a macroeconomic environment. There’s a lot – there is uncertainty out there. We all are aware of it, but the team is highly focused on leasing this portfolio to maximum potential.
Juan Sanabria: Thanks very much. Great color.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Rich Hill: Hey, good morning. That last to bit about occupancy is really helpful. Just to expand upon it, at the risk of asking for guidance, what sort of the cadence of getting back to 96%. Is that a late 2023 thing? Is that a 2024 thing? How do you think about that?
Mike Mas: Sure. I think it’s pretty simple. I mean, we’re about 200 basis points from our top end as we see it about in that area. And we looking back kind of post GSC, Rich, we’ve absorbed 100 basis points in our best years, kind of from a velocity standpoint, this feels like that type of environment, we’re at leasing. The teams are busy, the pipelines are full and we’re – and the teams are just putting a lot of ink to paper. So about 100 basis points is how quickly we think we can absorb space on an annual basis. So that would put us in that end of 2023, early 24 type of timeframe.
Rich Hill: Got it. That’s helpful. So as you think about getting back up to peak occupancy, then this becomes a really stable attractive business based upon renewals. What do you think sort of the new normal is for renewals? Is this like a five to six, five to seven? Or do you think there’s some level in which we start to normalize back to, call it a, something lower than that?
Lisa Palmer: I’m not sure. Rich, I’m not sure we understand the five to six or five to seven.
Rich Hill: Yes. I’m throwing – I’m personally just throwing numbers out there based upon some commentary…
Lisa Palmer: So rent spreads, you not renewal, right.
Rich Hill: Okay. Yes, yes.
Jim Thompson: Yes. I think as I’ve always looked at this business, our rent spreads track our occupancy. And as we get closer to what Mike described as full occupancy in 95%, 96% range, if you look over our shoulder, I think those rental rates and expectations rise as that occupancy and that lack of available supply is there. So I would see us as that curve goes up, I believe you’ll see our reps track that.
Mike Mas: And Rich don’t forget that’s cash leasing spreads on top of the contractual rent increase. So most of our renewal activity will be in shop space, we’re getting very high. That’s what we’re getting the highest frequency of contractual increases. So that’s on top of three – 2% to 3% annual.
Rich Hill: That’s helpful. And then one final question for me, I appreciate the cap rate disclosure. Could you have some walk through what unlevered IRRs look like at this point, where are those penciling out?
Lisa Palmer: With regards to – again, in my prepared remarks, I talked about some of the transactions that we observed happened, ones that we didn’t participate in. On our underwriting, we did see some single asset portfolios trade within low 5% IRRs. We’ve been – we were opportunistic in the acquisitions that we’ve closed and we’ve discussed and talked about on our underwriting, where we have been successful. We’ve been north of a 6%. And as we think about our cost of capital, a lot it depends on your underwriting assumptions and what’s your terminal cap rate. But if you remain pretty steady with kind of 50 basis points going over the – going in a 6% unleveraged IRR had been our hurdle given our existing cost of capital. Do we expect that that’s going to creep up? It could creep up. I mean, we’re obviously seeing the cost of debt rising.
Rich Hill: Got it. Thank you, guys. That’s helpful.
Operator: Our next question comes from Samir Khanal with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.
Samir Khanal: Good morning, everybody. Hey Mike, on percentage rents, it came in a little bit higher than we thought in the quarter. I guess how are sales and traffic trending sort of post 1Q and maybe into May here, as we think about that line item? Just trying to see if there’s sort of upside to that number.
Mike Mas: Sure. Hey Samir. We’ll start with maybe take some wind out of sale. Generally, it’s a pretty small line item for us. It’s in the historically $8 million range in total, that’s less than 1% of our total revenues. And interestingly, we get historically about half of that in the first quarter. So we had a great first quarter, restaurant sales were a featured component of our beat internally on percentage rent, grocers were the other component. We are optimistic that the balance of the year will also have similar results throughout the portfolio. But that opportunity to significantly outperform percentage rent I think has largely been taken in the first quarter.
Samir Khanal: Okay. And then I guess my next question is on this $18 million of prior year reserves, which you took up as part of guide. Can you remind us what that total bucket is at this point you can sort of collect from? And what percent of that total bucket is tenants that are still active in your portfolio?
Mike Mas: Yes. So we have that reserve balance on our Page 34 of the supplement, and you’ll see it at quarter end we were at $41 million. So that’s your starting point where your question is targeted. But let’s break that down. And first and foremost, we’re guiding on the number. So our expectations are plus or minus $18 million. So please start with that. Can we do better than that I think is the question. About half of that $41 million reserve, I would characterize as normal course. If you think about our reserve as a percentage of our open AR historically that’s about normal course activity. The balance of that I put in the two buckets, a quarter of it is in our guide. We are expecting about $9 million in the balance of the year. So that’s about a quarter of that reserve. And then the other quarter Samir, that’s the “wild card” that I think you’re looking for. Again, we’re guiding on the number, because we want folks to be careful with their expectations. We are making a ton of progress in working through the resolution of receivables. It’s primarily a West Coast ballgame at this point in time. Nick and the team out west are doing a great job working through the pile and we could have some more abatements in that number. So we are characterizing that as an unknown, as a wild card for that reason. We could also experience those collections in 2023. Half of that 25%, so about $5 million has already been agreed on with the tenants to defer into 2023. So I think we’re getting to the point where the outperformance on that guided line item is certainly going to start to shrink and the opportunity will start to diminish from this point forward.
Samir Khanal: Got it. That’s very helpful. And the last one, if I can – and if I can take one more here. I guess it’s for Lisa. Regency is one of the landlords to Whole Foods. I guess, what is the real estate strategy for them at this point? There’s been some headlines about closing a few stores, not many. But just curious as to what you’re hearing from them, especially with Amazon making the headlines recently.
Lisa Palmer: Samir, my first advice to you would be that I think it might be better to get on a Whole Foods conference call and ask them their question what their real estate strategy is. What I do know is that we have a great relationship with Whole Foods and with Amazon as well. And they are certainly as you know committed to physical locations and growing their footprint in both brands. They like every other retailer are going to ensure that they are operating the most productive stores and the most profitable stores. So we still have great confidence that we’re going to continue to be able to grow our footprint with Whole Foods and also as Amazon grows their footprint with them as well.
Samir Khanal: Thanks for that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Goldsmith: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. As your leasing momentum continues and seems on track to return or exceed prior level. How do you think about passing the return to grow through acquisition development or redevelopment? And does some of the announcements that you did with this quarter kind of reflect this forward looking opportunistic view?
Lisa Palmer: So let me start and I’ll open it up to Mike or Jim if they want to, to add to it. When we think about our business model and how we think about growing, it starts with our free cash flow. And we are estimating that to be in the neighborhood of $140 million. So if you just assume that we even add debt to the extent that we remain leverage neutral, we essentially can – that grows to over $200 million of capital that we can invest and grow the company. We’ve said it numerous times. I said it again today; the best use of that capital is into developments. And we – I do believe that we have the best development platform in the business. We've got a successful track record, and we're going to continue. I mean, and as we talked about this quarter, we started Glenwood Green, [indiscernible] started just over a year ago, in the middle of the pandemic. We continue to rebuild that pipeline. We did hit the pause button. It was very brief, but we continue to rebuild that pipeline, and that will be the best use of our cash flow. And especially when we're looking at returns that are 200 basis points to 250 basis points and sometimes 300 basis points higher than acquisitions. So, we will continue to do that. We also will invest back into our own shopping centers and redevelopments. We've had a lot of success with acquisitions. And when – we will always be opportunistic with acquisitions, as I've talked in the past, it has to check really three boxes. It's going to be accretive to or at least looks very much like the quality of our portfolio, accretive to our future growth rate, accretive to earnings.  And then once we find those opportunities, we have those presented to us, we look at how can we fund it with our free cash flow going to development. And that's when we will then evaluate other sources of capital. And you've seen us use dispositions, both low cap rate, dispositions, monetizing assets that are nonstrategic and then also tapping the equity market when it makes sense. We also have positioned the balance sheet intentionally to be able to use it at times when we can't tap those other sources of capital, and we need to lean in. As Mike said in his remarks, we are operating now at the low end of our target leverage. So, we have capacity. We can continue to buy and buy accretively.
Michael Goldsmith: That was very helpful. And my follow-up is on kind of the evolution of trade areas, the pandemic has generated some population migration and that's probably helped your suburban trade markets. And then now we're at a period where there's been elevated gas prices. So, I was wondering, as you look at your traffic data and where your customers are coming from to visit your centers has that changed since the increase in gas prices? And if so, what are the implications from that?
Lisa Palmer: I don't know that there's enough data yet to really make any conclusions as to what increased gas prices have done to our traffic because we're not seeing any significant changes. So that – but it's still early. But I'd like to – you asked that question in such a way that I'd like to just remind everyone. What we have seen, because of not necessarily increased gas prices, but with pandemic-related kind of structural trends, but that's a tailwind. It's been a – it's a tailwind for our first ring suburban trade areas. We continue to see people staying at home more often and staying close to their home. I saw a research report for another company as a health system that I'm involved in. People spend 90% of their time within just a few miles of their home. So if they're home more often, that number could even grow and then they're going to essentially visit our shopping centers for their needs for their value convenience. And we've actually seen those trends provide tailwinds. The second thing is the renewed confidence with the retailers. Because if you go pre-COVID, and we've talked about this before, there were still a lot of question marks about last mile distribution and how could they service their customers. A lot of those questions have been answered. The best way to do it is from locations close to the consumer's homes, it's the most profitable. They really – they knew they wanted the customers to walk in the door. That is the most profitable, but a lot of them had a little bit of work to do to figure out their overall systems and supply chain so that they could service their customers from the stores and they've made great progress. And that's also – that is a significant tailwind for neighborhood community shopping centers.
Operator: Our next question comes from Derek Johnson with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
Derek Johnson: Hi, good morning everybody. You executed more meaningful JVs this quarter for property portfolio, and that follows the USAA JV last year. Is this strategy taking into account the macro backdrop and really the currently compressed cap rate spreads to the 10-year? Are you viewing JV acquisitions as more accretive and less risky versus traditional acquisitions, especially given private market cap rate question marks?
Mike Mas: I'll take it. Derek, its Mike. I would characterize our JV acquisition opportunities is more circumstantial than strategic, but I don't want to dismiss the strategic part of it. We had two smallish JV entities in effect with – that were long standing. I think the Regency style [ph] JV; this is over a 15-year relationship between the two entities. And when they – given their size, given, to your point, maybe some of the backdrop elements, it just became clear that monetizing and reallocating the capital was the best choice for our partners. And then when that decision is made, we're likely the best buyer for those assets. So does it derisk our underwriting? Yes. We've known these properties for a long time. In fact, the properties in the USA partnership, although the partnership wasn't that long dated, we've owned those properties for nearly 20 years. So we know them extraordinarily well. It does make for an easier underwriting. There is an end to this strategy. That's why I'm not calling the strategy. We have – we still have remaining joint ventures. We have great partnerships with those partners, long-standing relationships. These are much bigger vehicles. I think we've got about $4 billion in gross asset value across two primary structures, one of which we just bought into through the Naperville, Chicago transaction. So obviously, two partners who are dedicated to the space really like the partnership to service that Regency is providing, really like the grocery-anchored shopping center arena. So I don’t know that we see this – these two circumstances extending much beyond what we’ve transacted today.
Derek Johnson: Thank you. That’s helpful. And can we take a second on leasing really where the demand is coming from? What categories are leading and more so, how does the pipeline differ between anchor and small shop demand right now are both firm or somewhat evolving and have you loosened underwriting standards for small shops to drive occupancy towards 96 at this time? And the current demand you’re seeing, does it really seem to have runway in your view through this year and beyond?
Jim Thompson: Derek, yes, I think, the pipelines to start with the pipeline question. The pipelines are continue to be robust and in line with, as we look over our shoulder, the great leasing we’ve done year-over-year. The pipeline appears to support that continued level of production. It’s equal in shops as well as anchors as we look at what our availability is. We’ve got good names associated with the vacancies and targeted uses least indicated the work from home has been I think a structural change to our business. And it has really been a driver to our demand, I believe. Uses, it’s the ones we’ve talked about in the past. Its health and wellness, the medical sector, cosmetics like the Sephoras, restaurants, especially the fast casuals, very high demand, pet uses off price players and certainly as we discussed our grocers. And again, I think I mentioned it earlier, it’s really across all regions. We’re not seeing one market that’s hotter than others. There’s really good, solid demand across the board. And again, the leasing production has been steady across the boards. So it’s really feels right now feels really very strong, the direction we’re going and the level of production that we’ve experienced.
Derek Johnson: Thank you everyone.
Operator: Our next question is from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.
Greg McGinniss: Hey, good morning. You always give such comprehensive opening remarks and answers to questions. So I apologize that some of this has already been covered. But in regards to the increasing store, NOI growth expectation as driven by increased commenced occupancy, was that driven by greater than expected tenant retention so far this year, or have you been able to get tenants in the spaces faster than originally anticipated?
Mike Mas: I think it’s – hey, Greg, probably more the former than the latter that 30 basis points of sequential increase in commenced occupancy. That was a really positive sign for what 2022 had offer to us. And remember in the context of our opening initial guidance, and it’s hard to remember three months ago, you still have an Omicron wave kind of rolling through Q1 is traditionally a weaker quarter from a volumes perspective, as well as a retention perspective. But that’s four consecutive quarters now of greater than average retention rates at Regency. So that really is what’s underpinning that 75 basis point move up together with what the previously discussed benefits from percentage ramp.
Greg McGinniss: Right. Okay. Thank you. And then how are you mitigating the impact of supply chain delays and increased costs when preparing spaces for new tenants?
Jim Thompson: As I indicated in remarks, I think we’re trying to use every lever we can find to try to expedite and help our tenants. We’ve got tenant coordinators. We’ve got expeditors. We’re trying to get demo permits before anything else we can get in there and make sure we can stay ahead of the curb as much as we possibly can. And one thing about the pandemic, everybody has learned to be quick on your feet to pivot and to make do with what you have. And that’s what we’re seeing in this environment as well. That retailers need to be open, they’re going to find a way to get open. We’re going to help them find that way as fast as we can. We’ve got a real sharp eye on our CD dates. That’s kind of our Bible. So we are trying to do everything in our power to make sure we can help expedite the best we can to make sure those tenants get open and start paying the rent. And so far we’ve been successful. We’re not seeing a slide.
Greg McGinniss: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Linda Tsai: Hi. A collection of prior period reserves is 18 million. I assume there’s a minimum amount of perversion to straight line back to accrual that’s associated with the 18 million. Is there a rough guideline for how much might not be baked into guidance?
Mike Mas: Yes. Linda, a good question. Let me clear that up a little bit. So the 18 million guidance is cash collections on previously reserved rents. So nothing to do with conversions of straight line rental income. That is a separate line item. We are – our guidance on that line item is effectively zero. We are on as converter basis. We had $4 million in the first quarter. I will offer, as I did last quarter, a little bit of a heads up or head nod as to what could potentially come through on straight line rent. We – as when we look through our AR and look through our receivables, there’s some visibility of maybe $2 million to $5 million of potential conversion impact on the non-cash FFO line item. From a cadence perspective, I can’t necessarily predict which quarter that’ll occur in, but we do have some level of comfort with that range that I would encourage you to think about that with respect to that as converted guidance that we're offering.
Linda Tsai: Thanks for that. And then in your February business update, you showed traffic being above 2019 levels, but having dipped in January. Any color on how traffic has trended since at your centers?
Jim Thompson: It's essentially - it's essentially flat, and we're not trying to take away any color, and in fact, a lot of that data is pretty widely available to the public at this point. But as Lisa indicated it earlier we're not seeing any dramatic shifts in our traffic patterns and very comfortable with them having return to 2019 level.
Linda Tsai: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Mike Mueller: Yes. Hi. Just a quick one here. Wondering, are you seeing any significant differences in national versus local leasing dynamics? And as you move your shop leased rate above 90%, I think it's 90.3% right now. I mean, how should we think about the mix of national versus locals driving that?
Mike Mas: Mike, our mix is really the same as we've always had. We're seeing good local operators. They're kind of bread and butter for small shop space, and we continue to see good entrepreneurial players in the marketplace that that are really, that's their livelihood, that's the beauty of small local operators that is their livelihood. National folks are certainly national regional certainly have a good open to buy demand as well in growing their footprint. So, but our mix is really very, very similar to what we're used to seeing. No real change.
Mike Mueller: Got it. Okay. That was it. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Tammi Fique with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Tammi Fique: Thank you, and congratulations, Jim. You mentioned a flight-to-quality being a driver of leasing volumes. I'm wondering if you are seeing your lease rates in your submarket, while performing other properties in those markets and then curious if you are seeing new demand coming from tenants that are moving locations or opening new stores, and if there are any interesting trends to note there?
Jim Thompson: Thank you for the comment first. Flight-to-quality it's hard to judge, but that intuitively and what we're from a color standpoint. We see people trying to upgrade that's anytime there's any kind of downturn in the business. People like to take advantage of that and move towards quality and we see it in the office side, retail side, it really doesn't matter. As far as our ability to grow rents, I think its evidence in what we put out there. Yes, we're seeing opportunities to kind of grow rents as those tenants move towards our marketplace.
Mike Mas: Yes. And the only thing I would add Tammi is, if you – when you, I think you asked the question about comparable to other kind of – other the competition if you will. If you were to layer historic regencies percent leased against the market percent leased, there's a – there will always be a pretty large gap and that's just based upon the quality of our portfolios. We are much more highly leased than the market generally. And then through the cycles, and I haven't done this, but my guess is that when you look at cycles because I can go back to the GFC and I do remember that we lost the least amount of shop space versus our public peers that reported. Not everyone reported that at the time, so as my guess is that in tougher economic times, that GAAP actually widens and our percent lease is even higher.
Tammi Fique: Great. Thanks. And then Mike, I know it's not in guidance going forward, but maybe going back to the conversion to accrual and as we think about the 14% ABR on cash basis. Can you just remind us how that compare with where you were pre-COVID and then the $2 million to $5 million you just mentioned? And is that a number for this year or the total potential and then maybe just one more on that given the macro backdrop; are you likely to keep more tenants on a cash basis at this point?
Mike Mas: Yes, that's a packed question there, Tammi. I think your third – your first and third pieces of that kind of go-together. I appreciate the question, what was your cash basis percentage pre-COVID? It's a very good one. The part of the challenge here, historically speaking, but the rules have changed. The gap application has over the course of time too. So it is hard for me to look back at those numbers and think of them as a comparable type of target, so to speak. But I will say it was in the, it was in the mid-single digit range from a percentage of ABR perspective. So 14% going to somewhere in that mid-single digit is what I would expect to happen over time. The comments on the $2 million to $5 million those could easily slip into 2023, but I'm getting that number with, I mean, we're knowingly given that that outlook out there because we do think there's a potential for that to impact 2022. I wish I could give you more clear guidance on which quarter, unfortunately we just can't. When those tenants meet the thresholds and the policies that we've embedded into our accounting infrastructure, they will convert to accrual and then the resulting impact will occur on the non-cash side.
Tammi Fique: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then you have been obviously acquiring interest from your JV partners and you also did some secured loan JV refinancing in the quarter for other JV assets. I mean, it sounds like you don't have a particular interest in acquiring additional partner assets at this time, but it does look like you have some additional maturities on the unconsolidated side next year. So I'm just wondering if you can talk about your discussions with those partners, and if you expect to refinance those or will those be assets that will be sold? Thanks.
Jim Thompson: No, I appreciate that. Yes, the expectation largely is that we would refinance those maturities when they do come to. Let me give you an interesting point there with respect to you tying that into our appetite for JV acquisitions, these are single asset mortgages, and there is permitted transfer language within those mortgages. So there is no – from a partner's perspective or Regency's perspective, there's no downside to placing that financing on the asset. It doesn't inhibit either one of our ability to transact. They're just assumable later party. Goes back to my comments before, oftentimes, Regency is the best buyer for these portfolios. That is one of the reasons why that's true. There is – the vast majority of our exposure is in 2023, not 2022. And I would say that there's good demand as there is on the equity side and buying shopping centers, there continues to be good healthy demand for financing, grocery-anchored shopping centers. We fit the product type. We fit the credit profile that many of the life companies are looking for on the secured mortgage side, and we had success in Q1. I don't see why we wouldn't have success refinancing those maturities when they occur.
Tammi Fique: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question is from Chris Lucas with CapitalOne. Please proceed with your question.
Chris Lucas: Hi, good morning everybody. Just a couple of follow-up questions. As it relates to the cap rate commentary, at Lisa, that you made earlier in the call. Just curious as if there's any geographic differences. In other words, have the coastal gateway markets maintain their sort of lower cap rate at relative to the primary Sunbelt markets? Or is that gap has effectively gone away?
Lisa Palmer: It's still very much trade area driven. If the trade areas look similar, cap rates are going to look similar. So there's really not much of a difference for the type of quality that we're looking to acquire. 
Chris Lucas: Okay. And then you mentioned the strength of the tenant retention this quarter and trailing a couple of quarters. I guess just curious from your long historical perspective there. Has there been a better time for tenant retention? If so, what was that comparable period? Just kind of trying to figure out where we are relative to cycles.
Jim Thompson: I don't think there's – on the margin, it may have been a little higher.
Lisa Palmer: I could see Jim or taking back on his 41 years. That's a long time to think about.
Jim Thompson: But I guess in my experience, what I would suggest. I think tenants are a little stickier in the last four quarters because of what we've been through. As I look to the future, I think that 75% is our – has been our typical average. I kind of look at that as a reversion to the long-term stabilized at least for our portfolio. I think the way we asset manage the amount of internal redevelopment we do. There's always going to be a level of, what I'll say, churn or turn within the portfolio that 75% seems to be the right number from a retention standpoint. So I'm happy to see that we're a little above that today because I think today's environment really is appropriate for that. But as we – as that supply goes away and we get back to that 96% lease level, and we're doing the things we get big proactive asset management perspective, like I said, that the 75% is probably a runway that I'd look at it.
Chris Lucas: Okay. And then I guess maybe this will be for Mike. Just on the percentage of rent number and then just sort of the outlook. I mean, we've seen, obviously food inflation a pretty high level. Restaurant inflation, particularly for sitdown has been significant. I guess when you look at your lease structures, are there – if this persists, is that an opportunity for a meaningful increase in percentage rent collections over time? Or is that really just not part of the lease structure that is an impactful component of potential future revenue?
Mike Mas: I'm going to turn that back to Jim. I think it is probably more appropriate for him to respond. Percentage ramp in light of the inflationary environment, becoming more of a discussion item from your perspective in your lease negotiations.
Jim Thompson: Yes, I think – I would say probably it is. I think, quite frankly, reporting sales in general is – rather than percent rent, but just reporting sales in general is what we've seen over the last 10 years has become more proprietary from anchors perspective. It used to be a given in the grocery business. But of late, tenants don't want other people to know how they're doing. So it's challenging. So I think over time, the percent rent, we still try to push it. I think restaurants is still probably a very good industry that we can get that. But over time, I think that will become and even less, as Mike indicated, it's not a big piece of our business today, and I think that will continue to dent a little bit over time. And the other thing that happens is as we have an opportunity to redevelop or restructure an anchor deal and they were paying percent rent, we roll that into new base rent and reset the bar. So that also is another avenue that just continues to reduce the amount of percentage rent that we can expect to get long term.
Chris Lucas: Okay, thank you. Appreciate it.
Operator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Lisa Palmer for closing comments.
Lisa Palmer: I just want to thank you all for joining us today. And I'm so used to having a call on Friday, it's Wednesday, but I'm going to say it anyway, even though we're days away. Happy Mother's Day to all the mothers out there and enjoy your weekend. Thank you all.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-02-11 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to Regency Centers Corporation Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2021 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Christy McElroy, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets. Thank you. You may begin.
Christy McElroy: Good morning, and welcome to Regency Centers' fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Lisa Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Mas, Chief Financial Officer; Jim Thompson, Chief Operating Officer; and Chris Leavitt, SVP and Treasurer. As a reminder, today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements about the Company's views of future business and financial performance, including forward earnings guidance and future market conditions. These are based on management's current beliefs and expectations, and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. It's possible that actual results may differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements we may make. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements may be included in our presentation today and are described in more detail in our filings with the SEC, specifically our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filings. In our discussion today, we will also reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. The comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this quarter's earnings materials which are posted on our Investor Relations website. Please note that we have also posted a presentation on our website with additional information, including disclosures related to forward earnings guidance and the impact of COVID-19 on the Company's business. Our caution on forward-looking statements also applies to these presentation materials. Lisa?
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Christy. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Reflecting back on 2021, Regency accomplished a great deal over the course of the year, and we have a lot to be proud of. With the disruption caused by the pandemic, it was a year of recovery, but the pace of our progress is a testament to the resiliency of retail properties like ours. As we sit here today, we feel really good about the financial health of our tenants. Our leasing activity is robust. Our investment pipeline is full, and our balance sheet is back to pre-pandemic strength. And of course, this didn't just happen. We wouldn't be where we are without the tireless efforts of our people. So if you would, please just give me a moment to thank the Regency team. Thank you, team. It truly takes all of us. So as we transitioned into 2022 and look ahead, our story is no longer about recovery. We move forward with a focus on growth and also with the benefit of hindsight from the last two years. While we do see lingering effects of the pandemic on our tenants, specifically the impacts of inflation and labor shortages, these headwinds have thus far not impacted demand for our space. This focus on growth did begin last year with regards to our capital allocation strategy, as we've discussed on prior calls. We pivoted to offense in 2021. We completed nearly $500 million of acquisitions last year on an accretive leverage-neutral basis. During the fourth quarter, we not only closed on the acquisition of our Turducken, Blakeney Shopping Center, but we also announced the purchase of a four-property grocery-anchored neighborhood-centered portfolio on Long Island. You've heard me say it before, these types of investments are the bread and butter of what we do, what our company does. Our focus is to invest in strong, well-located grocery-anchored shopping centers. Overall, the private transaction market for the centers we want to own remains really strong. We continue to see cap rate compression and value appreciation and even steeper competition for deals. But despite this, our acquisition pipeline remains active. That's because our balance sheet and access to capital give us a competitive advantage as does our reach, given the boots on the ground in most of our target markets. Our Long Island portfolio acquisition was an off-market transaction. It was a group of family-owned assets. Kudos to our team in that market for sourcing this deal. We will continue to look for opportunities like these where the assets meet our criteria for location, quality, format and growth. We also announced recent dispositions. And in that context, I want to spend a minute on our sale of Costa Verde since this was previously a part of our redevelopment pipeline. As most of you know, we have been really excited to undertake a mixed use densification project there that featured retail at its core. We worked for years to entitle the asset, de-leasing the property, all in preparation for future redevelopment. But as time went on, the project evolved into predominantly life science, and the highest and best use was no longer a retail-centric asset. This changed the nature of the project and the risk profile materially. We made the decision to sell as it became clear to us that this was the best path to maximize value and manage our risk for the benefit of our shareholders. Importantly, we did get paid well for the value we created at that site, and we immediately reinvested the proceeds. To be very clear, we don't see another Costa Verde in our portfolio. This asset was somewhat of a unicorn. But we do own really great real estate, and there will be other opportunities to add non-retail uses or to densify our properties. To the extent that makes sense, we will again pursue a similar path. This could mean partnering with experienced operators, a ground lease or a sale of a non-retail component, but always with the goal of extracting and retaining control over the retail. As an example, we have our Westbard Square project currently underway in Bethesda, Maryland. The redevelopment of this shopping center essentially features a refresh of all the retail, including a new store for our already successful giant grocery anchor, but will also include the development of senior living and apartment components on which we have partnered with others. Before I turn it over to Jim, I'll conclude by saying that Regency emerged from 2020 a stronger company. And we and our tenants spent 2021 adapting to position ourselves for success in the new normal, and we've done just that. We've recovered from the pandemic, we maintained and even raised our dividends, and we are on our front foot today. This consistency that you've seen from us over the years, even through the toughest of times, is evidence of the quality of our assets, our investment discipline, the strength of our balance sheet and most importantly, our people. Jim?
James Thompson: Thanks, Lisa. Good morning, everyone. Our teams are encouraged by the positive trends we are seeing in our portfolio and in the overall retail environment. We saw record new leasing volumes during 2021 at 20% above historical levels. For the fourth quarter, rent collections are 99% and tenants are reporting positive and often record sales. With continued strength in our leasing activity and lower tenant move-outs, our percent leased rate again rose in the fourth quarter, ending the year at over 94%. We've made good progress from our COVID lows, but we continue to see further upside to occupancy from here, having achieved historical highs north of 96%. Additionally, our teams have an opportunity to further upgrade merchandise mix in this environment, and our new leasing pipelines are healthy and building. The most active categories include grocers, medical, health and wellness, restaurants, cosmetic, home and off-price. Importantly, we are seeing good activity across all regions for both anchor and shop space. We are also having success keeping our current tenants in place. Our fourth quarter retention rate was 85%, well ahead of the historical average, and shop tenant retention was our highest on record in the quarter. Our blended rent spreads were nearly 13% in Q4, positively impacted by the execution of a new anchor lease with Target and a property in Connecticut. As we have often discussed on prior calls, our ability to recapture and mark-to-market legacy anchor leases can often be one of the largest contributors to our rent spreads over time. We also remain successful at driving contractual rent spreads, achieving over 2% annual growth in the vast majority of our leases executed in the fourth quarter, while continuing to remain judicious in our leasing CapEx spend. Our consistent focus on embedded rent increases resulted in GAAP rent spreads of 13% in 2021, while also achieving attractive net effective rents. That said, we are cognizant that tenants are continuing to be impacted by inflation, supply chain issues, permitting challenges and most notably, labor shortages, both in operating existing stores and getting new stores open. We are seeing and planning for an impact to rent commencement timing on the margin. Importantly, these pressures have not yet impacted demand for space, but we also recognize that may not be sustainable as labor shortages continue to adversely impact businesses around the country. For now, many tenants are showing an ability to adapt, including in-store tech advancements, reuse of equipment and improved e-commerce and curbside platforms. We continue to monitor these trends closely, and our teams are actively working with current and future tenants on these issues when and where possible. Moving to our development and redevelopment pipeline. Much like what we are acquiring, our teams are focused on creating value within our core competency of grocery-anchored neighborhood and community centers. We are proud of our track record and our proven ability to do so throughout cycles. Even with the pandemic-related challenges facing our industry over the last two years, we continue to start and deliver projects and currently have $300 million in process. To highlight a few. In the fourth quarter, we completed the first phase of our ground-up H-E-B-anchored Baybrook development in Houston, and look forward to starting an additional phase of this successful project in the near future. We completed the redevelopment of the Publix-anchored West Bird Plaza in South Florida this quarter. This project included a complete teardown and rebuild of an older Publix store as well as facade and site work improvements to the entire center. The immediate impact of significantly enhanced sales volumes of the grocer over pre-redevelopment volumes, coupled with the modernization of this very well-located asset, will enable us to significantly upgrade the merchandising mix and keep the center competitive and relevant for years to come. At The Abbot in Cambridge, Massachusetts, we have seen increased leasing activity and anticipate tenant openings later this year. The Crossing Clarendon outside of D.C., we are nearing construction completion, and happy to report that we are now over 95% leased. Looking ahead, we continue to target project spending in the range of $150 million to $200 million annually. While our development teams are seeing inflationary pressures on material and labor costs, we are carefully monitoring these increases and adjusting our underwriting. Importantly, we have been able to maintain our targeted project yields. Our teams are being proactive on securing bids, ordering materials early and utilizing our scale, relationships and connections to mitigate our risks as effectively as possible. In summary, our team is optimistic about the current retail environment and the positive momentum we are experiencing across all regions in leasing, development and redevelopment. Mike?
Michael Mas: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by addressing fourth quarter results, provide some color around sources and uses relating to recent transactions, and then walk through some highlights of our initial 2022 guidance. Fourth quarter NAREIT FFO was positively impacted by a few items worth mentioning. Uncollectible lease income was a positive $6 million in the quarter, and you can see the components of this detailed on Page 33 of our supplemental. Additionally, similar to last quarter, straight-line rent benefited from the reversal of reserves triggered by the conversion of some cash basis tenants back to accrual. This non-cash accounting impact benefited uncollectible straight-line rent by about $7 million. To reiterate, straight-line rent does not impact our core operating earnings, but these conversions created an outsized benefit to NAREIT FFO in each of the third and fourth quarters. Following the conversions back to accrual, we now have 17% of our ABR remaining on a cash basis of accounting. For this smaller pool, our cash basis collection rate was 94% in the fourth quarter. From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the year with full capacity on our revolver and we have no unsecured debt maturities until 2024. Total leverage is back to well within our targeted range of 5x to 5.5x. The acquisition of Blakeney, which closed in November, was funded with cash on hand and our share of proceeds from dispositions completed in the fourth quarter. The acquisition of the Long Island portfolio, which closed just prior to year-end, was funded with the sale of Costa Verde in early January. Notably, and the challenge that often goes under the radar with dispositions of long-held assets, in the last year, we've been able to sell nearly $250 million of properties on a tax-efficient basis by structuring 1031 exchanges. Turning to guidance. Please be sure to review the very helpful detail in our press release and business update slide deck posted to our website. While our earnings have historically been more visible and predictable, our 2021 earnings were impacted by a few cash basis accounting adjustments that complicated the picture heading into this year. These include prior year reserve collections and straight-line rent reversal impacts, where it appears as if expectations around these items resulted in meaningful variability in Street estimates. To add some clarity, we've increased the transparency even further in our guidance disclosure relating to these items. Regarding the collection of prior year reserves, last year, we collected $46 million that we had billed and reserved in 2020. This year, we expect to collect about $13 million of revenues billed and reserved in prior years. These impacts are only related to the timing of revenue recognition, and this timing difference represents a $0.19 per share decrease in NAREIT FFO year-over-year in 2022. One of the other big variances, as I mentioned, is the non-cash impact of straight-line rent reserves. Last year, we recognized $43 million of non-cash revenues, which included $13 million driven by the conversion of tenants from cash basis back to accrual. This year, we are forecasting roughly $28 million of non-cash revenues. That's a $0.09 per share difference impacting NAREIT FFO. And as we've mentioned on prior calls, we only plan to include the cash to accrual conversion impact and forward-looking guidance as tenants are converted. So right now, we have zero impact in our 2022 guidance relating to future conversions. We mentioned on the last call that the JV Promote was recognized in Q3 2021, would not recur in 2022. And we also discussed that our quarterly net G&A run rate would be higher in 2022, driven by annual salary increases, filling open positions and returning to more normalized levels of T&E. Collectively, these impacts are another $0.14 at the midpoint. We hope you find this walk-through of material and unusual impacts helpful. Pivoting to same-property NOI growth, after adjusting for prior year collections, we are forecasting growth of 3.5% at the midpoint. That's $0.16 per share of incremental positive FFO growth. We will continue our practice of disclosing the same-property NOI growth range, excluding prior year collections for as long as they meaningfully impact our results, providing some reflection of a more normalized growth rate where the primary contributing component is base rent growth. One last reminder on same-property NOI. Recall that in the first quarter of last year, we were still recording meaningful uncollectible lease income at nearly $18 million when excluding any impacts from prior period collections. This compares to roughly $2.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. So as we look to the cadence of growth by quarter during 2022, we are anticipating a higher growth rate in the first quarter relative to the other three. Also included in guidance, we expect transaction activity will be accretive to earnings this year. And while on the surface our disposition guidance exceeds acquisitions, remember that the acquired Long Island portfolio closed on December 30. So the impact is really that of a 2022 purchase. We have about $65 million remaining of unsettled forward ATM equity, and expect free cash flow from dividend payments north of $130 million this year, all of which supports and funds our investment pipeline and future growth opportunities. Finally, a quarter ago, we talked about NOI getting back to 2019 levels on an annualized basis during the first half of 2022, and that was six months sooner than we had originally anticipated. But we are pleased to report that in the fourth quarter of 2021 and after excluding prior year collections, total NOI has now recovered back to 2019 levels. As Lisa alluded, with the recovery behind us, we've now pivoted our mindset toward growth in 2022 and beyond. And with that, we look forward to taking your questions. 
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Richard Hill: Hey. Good morning, guys. I suspect you're going to get a lot of questions about the guide, but I'd like to start off by saying, I think you've done a really good job of bridging that. So thank you for it. I have maybe more of a strategic question to kick us off. Occupancy looks like it's around 100 basis points below 2019 levels. Curious if you can give us the time line for full recovery. And more importantly, when does your calculus begin to change from occupancy recovery to gains on pushing rents more. So it's sort of like Lisa, what you were talking about pivoting to offense, just a strategic question, how close do you think you are to really pivoting?
Michael Mas: Hey, Rich. This is Mike. Let me start and then Jim will provide some color at CC's releasing environment. Let me first say, I appreciate your comments on the disclosure. We absolutely understand the complexity and the noise that we've lived through in 2020 and 2021 and anticipated that and are trying to help as best we can. From an underlying assumption perspective on our same-property NOI growth range, we are planning for increases in both topline percent leased as well as commenced occupancy rates in the 75 basis point to 100 basis point range, that is what's underlying and supporting our midpoint of 3.5% growth, which largely is coming from base rent growth. Recall, we're also getting about 1.3% of contractual increases contributing to our topline NOI as well. With respect to pricing power, I'll let Jim jump in and provide some color on how the teams are attacking our rollover.
James Thompson: Yes. Rich, as you saw, our spreads are getting better. We had roughly 13% this quarter on a blended basis. When you couple that with the embedded rent steps, we continue to get it over 2% in the vast majority of our spaces. The prudent leasing capital spend that we're doing is driving really good GAAP rents as well as net effective rents. And combined, when you look at that whole package, that's what we're looking at as far as the positive direction for long-term growth in the portfolio. The demand continues very strong across all regions, like I indicated in the prepared remarks. We think that will continue to – at least in our portfolio, continue to have the leverage shift more towards the landlord side, we believe, as spaces do get more occupied, I think we'll be able to drive even harder deals. But I think the stay-at-home change in the entire retail landscape, I think it's been very positive for us and our product type. We are close to homes. We are in generally very strong demographic, high-density marketplaces, not a lot of urban locations. So that has played well for our product type and we continue to see that as a positive vehicle to help support our demand going forward.
Michael Mas: Hey, Rich, one last comment because I realized you were asking a little bit about forward total recovery. Importantly, to highlight our top-end and how we think about kind of maximum occupancy, we are 96% is where our eyes are. We think our portfolio and the quality of our assets and the historical performance of them would support a 96% occupancy rate. You drop about 150 basis points off of that for a commenced occupancy rate. So not only do we see 75 basis points to 100 basis points supporting our 2022 growth, we see growth beyond that of similar rates of increases. And if you think about our post GFC recovery progress, this recovery is – 70 to 100 is a little bit below what we experienced post GFC, but we did have more vacancy coming out of the GFC, more space to fill than we do now. This trajectory feels right to us, feels healthy and feels appropriate for that long-term recovery.
Richard Hill: Got it. So as I think about this, it sounds like to me, a year from now, knock on wood, you're going to have – you're going to be in a pretty good place back to where you were prior to the GFC. 2021 was obviously a remarkable year of recovery. 2022 is sort of blocking and tackling and a little bit of a transition to get back to that level where we were prior to – we always said the GFC got COVID. It sounds like you're going to be in a really good place 12 months from now. Is that fair?
Lisa Palmer: Absolutely. And I think that, that's a really good point, Rich. So our NOI really has recovered. Our total NOI has recovered. And I have the utmost confidence that when we look at how we will perform in 2022 from an earnings perspective, despite the complexities that we talked about with the guidance that our recovery will stack up really well versus 2019 versus everyone else in the sector. And that's with our balance sheet actually being even better positioned today. Our net debt to EBITDA is lower today than it was with going into COVID, and that was with maintaining and raising our dividend. So we feel really good about it, and we feel good about 2022.
Richard Hill: Great. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Katy McConnell with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Kathleen McConnell: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So I just had two more questions on guidance. And the first is within your same-store guidance range, what are you assuming for new bad debt expense this year versus 2021? And secondly, understanding the straight-line guidance will only be updated as those cash tenants are converted back to accrual, or can you maybe help us quantify how large that total impact could be in theory if that entire pool was converted back to accrual method tomorrow?
Michael Mas: Sure. I appreciate those questions, Katy. From a bad debt expense perspective, so let's talk about current year billings is the question. In 2021, we ended the year at about 175 basis points of bad debt expense on 2021 billings. As we think about our underlying assumptions going into 2022, we see improvements in our cash collection rates. And we're calling for about in the area of 100 basis points on a comparable basis in dollars, that's equating to about $10 million of improvement. We could do better than that on the top end, and we provided for maybe a little bit less collection on the bottom end. But at the top-end, we could see us returning to our historical averages by year-end – so not on an average for 2022, but by year-end. And that historical average to remind you is about 50 basis points of billed revenues. And that is where we anticipate ultimately recovering to. The question on straight-line rent is a good one, and I'd point you to Page 34 of our supplement, where we've been breaking down our – more diligently our COVID disclosures. What you'll see there is a reserve on our straight-line rents of $33 million. So this is getting to your point of what is the maximum potential in theory, that $33 million is the maximum potential, but a heavy dose of caution there, Katy, on whether we can – whether we will ever eventually convert all of those tenants back to accrual. Recall, we have 17%, as I indicated, on a cash basis of accounting today. There is some visibility as we sit here in mid-February to converting more tenants in the first quarter. I think just to give you a number on that, our outlook calls for in the area of $5 million of potential conversion income on an FFO basis, non-cash. We're on an as-converted basis, and we'll continue to update everyone as those conversions occur.
Michael Bilerman: It's Michael Bilerman here with Katy. Maybe Lisa or Mike, maybe just stepping back, overall, and I recognize there's a lot of complexities with the prior reserves and non-cash income that clearly, at least, it appeared as though the Street got a little bit ahead of itself and it's not only to you, obviously, other companies across other sectors as well that impacted. But when you sort of compare your line item guidance relative to the Street, it would seem at least half of it is more core related, lower core NOI, bit higher interest expense, higher G&A, even above the levels that you had sort of previously indicated. And so missing the Street by 5% or 6%, half of that being core, how do you look at that item because I don't think all of this is truly just reserves and non-cash? There seems to be some either conservatism in your views or that the Street just got way ahead of itself. And so I'm just trying to understand from your vantage point, how you look at things and how you're going to pivot to stronger FFO growth as we roll into 2023 and 2024?
Michael Mas: I appreciate the question, Michael. And I would agree a little bit with Street maybe getting a little bit ahead. Just to walk through some of the details just that we're all on the same page, yes, the non-cash conversion item is a major component of the decelerating growth, right? So if you just look at the fourth quarter on a run rate basis, that's $0.05 of our issue going forward. And again, we're not guiding on future conversions, although let me reiterate the potential Q1 conversion of about $5 million. Then we get into what we still call our core, which includes prior year collections, and that is an unusual and material moving item. That component of ULI is going to be about – is about a 3% impact to the fourth quarter. So that is impacting our run rate going forward. And as effectively, Michael, absorbing our good, healthy growth in base rent and NOI going forward in our 3.5% guide on that line item, which leads and isolates on the core or increase in G&A as a drag. And again, that's an item that we identified in the third quarter call. We wanted to make sure that people's run rates for quarterly G&A was in the $20 million range, which was about a $2 million increase per quarter over what we experienced in 2021. On that line item, just for some context, as I said on the call, we're filling open positions. We've increased our – we had our annual salary increases. A big component of our increase is returning to normalcy on the T&E front. Our teams are back on the road. We are reinflating those line items to 2019 levels. That's about 40% or so of our forecasted increase in G&A. And then I need to mention that and remind everyone, we did have an unusual onetime negative G&A impact in 2021 related to LTI forfeitures. We had some departures, most notably at the CIO level, and there was a onetime impact that benefited 2021 that will not recur in 2022. You put all that together, and I think you want us to boil this down and think about and hear how we're thinking about the business. Looking through prior year collections and thinking about the midpoint of our core range, that's a 3% increase as we're thinking about our core operating business. And if you think about the upper end of that range and try to compare it to 2019, we're only 2% off of that reported number as a – if we want to put a line in the sand as 2019 recovery. So we feel – as Lisa said, we feel great about the outlook for 2022. We are on the right vector of recovery on the leasing front, and we're looking forward to growth from this point forward.
Michael Bilerman: And you feel like it's an accelerating growth into 2023 and 2024 because...
Lisa Palmer: I think that it goes back to what we just answered with regards to the continued ability to increase our occupancy. And we do feel – we feel good about that. We still have room to run. And the fact that also, I think – I appreciate the question, Michael, about the different line items, if you will. But as I think about it, and Mike, I can't articulate it better than Mike did. The core business is the same property NOI guide, excluding all of that prior year noise, and that's a midpoint of 3.5%. That's growth to me and continued growth. And I think it's really important to not brush over the fact that I said our net debt-to-EBITDA is lower today than it was entering COVID. We have capital, we have room to run. We are looking for opportunities. Our development pipeline is refilling, and we are really active in the acquisition arena, $500 million last year. So yes, I believe I have a lot of confidence on the future growth of – for our company.
Michael Mas: And philosophically, as you know, we don't guide on speculative transactions on the acquisition front. We have $30 million in our 2022 guidance. That is an opportunity in the Pacific Northwest that is under contract, and we feel great about closing. But as Lisa said, and we've indicated throughout 2021, with our balance sheet and our free cash flow levels exceeding $130 million, we're on our front foot on the investment front and looking forward to putting that – those opportunities to work.
Michael Bilerman: Yes. I think investors are just trying to understand to my last comment, I'll yield the floor. But just trying to understand, Lisa, exactly what that top line positive growth, and you can see the occupancy going up and all the initiatives, the transaction activity, the development and redevelopment that it should ultimately translate into better growth and with a disappointing guide, I think investors are sort of questioning that it may make sense to build a federal route and sort of lay out the multiyear building blocks to your growth so that people can get comfortable that, that top line same-store growth is really going to drive bottom line earnings growth and dividend growth. And I know the dividend was never cut and that's an important part of everything and the balance sheet is in good position. It may just need a little bit more guidance to the Street so that we can see this multiyear growth platform come into effect.
Lisa Palmer: Sure. Absolutely. And I want to make sure, I think the team has done a tremendous job of providing the individual components. So I want to make sure that I recognize that of the team. And it is a lot of onetime things in 2021, which I believe that we have very specifically already laid out, but I appreciate the comment, Michael. We not only maintained the dividend, we actually had a pretty significant increase, too.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Goldsmith: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Lisa, 2021 is a pretty unique year for retail where the consumer benefited from stimulus and Child Tax Credit. There was a shift from services to goods. As we enter 2022, we're facing with some of these factors reversing plus we've got inflation, which could leave into discretionary dollars. What is your outlook for kind of the consumer and retail for the year? And given your focus on grocery-anchored centers, do you feel like you're really well positioned to kind of stay the course even if this 2022 becomes a little bit of a volatile year for retail and the consumer?
Lisa Palmer: Mike, I think you answered the question for me yourself. I do feel – I believe that there's no question that there's a lot of impacts to the consumer. But with regards to the part of the retail sector that we are playing in, if you will, is the best positioned. So Jim said it, in his, answering the occupancy question, being close to people's homes. So there's no question. I mean, we all read the same data and news articles. Some of the largest increases for – that are impacting families are in gasoline and in energy and people are staying closer to home, which is a little bit of a tailwind, if you will, even in spite of the headwinds of rising prices, it's a tailwind for suburban shopping centers and for grocery-anchored shopping centers. People are eating at home more often. And when they're not eating at home, they're staying close to home to eat. So again, it's benefiting our product type. We're seeing it in sales at our shopping centers. Our sales are up not just over 2021 and 2020, but over 2019, kind of a more normal environment, if you will. So our outlook is still really bullish on grocery-anchored shopping centers, and you're seeing that translate into the demand for that product type as well in the transaction market.
Michael Goldsmith: That's helpful. And then, Mike, on the guidance, thanks again for the detailed breakdown. Can you outline some of the items that may not be included in your guidance, you talked about future transactions and acquisitions? And then at the same time, your guidance calls for same property NOI growth of 2.75% to 4.25% ex the term fees in the prior year reserve collections. If we back out some of the outsized expense recovery from the prior year, does that kind of reflect the go-forward growth algorithm of the core business? Thanks.
Michael Mas: Sure. I think much like you did with Lisa, I think you answered some of that there, Michael. We do exclude transaction activity, again, kind of as a rule at Regency philosophically, and we just don't want to set those expectations for us internally into making poor investment decisions. So those will all be incremental as we move forward. Within the same property NOI line item, I appreciate you bringing up the tough comp in Q2 from 2021. We did have an outsized recovery experience in 2021 that will not recur in 2022. That's about a 50 basis point drag. What we're – essentially, there's three big components to the same property growth at the mid. It's 400 basis points total, 300 basis points coming from base rent growth and 100 basis points coming from improvement in ULI and I went through that assumption on bad debt expense on a previous question. And then that drag of 50 basis points is bringing us back down to the 3.5%, 4% compared to historical averages is pretty healthy. You've heard us and followed us and heard us talk about 2.5% to 3% on a stabilized basis being a normal rate of growth annually for Regency. So 4% would reflect a rising level of occupancy, which we articulated in that 75 to 100 basis point range.
Michael Goldsmith: Thank you very much. Good luck in 2022.
Michael Mas: Thanks Michael.
Lisa Palmer: Thanks, Michael.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Floris Van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please proceed with your question.
Floris Van Dijkum: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I had a question on the – obviously, we saw the – we've heard about the Donahue Schriber transaction going at a very low cap rate, and we've heard some of your competitors and peers talk about that cap rates are going lower. As you think about allocating capital over the next year or two, Lisa and Mike, how are you thinking about that when you're weighing developments versus new acquisitions because new acquisitions clearly are going to be at lower cap rates than what they've occurred over the last 18 months. And then also maybe talk a little bit about your differentiated approach to development relative to your two large cap strip peers? And can you put enough capital to work in that space in your view?
Lisa Palmer: I'll start and allow Mike to add any color as needed. So Floris, we strategically and how we think about putting capital to work, we have not changed our point of view and we do look at investments holistically. And we always say the best use of our capital is to reinvest back into the centers that we already own, and we know really well, and we are constantly, intentionally and intensively managing those assets to do that. And we have a pretty good track record of doing so and putting capital to work there and getting really good risk-adjusted returns with that capital. But those opportunities are limited, as you pointed out. I mean, that is not an unlimited open check, if you will. And then we also use our free cash flow and balance sheet capacity to invest in ground-up developments. And again, I think we have the best team in the business. We have the best track record in the business. We have as we said – as the Costa Verde sale will show you, we have once again really refocused on our bread and butter on what we do best, which is grocery-anchored shopping centers. And we've had – we still are enjoying a lot of success there. Just in the past, I lose track of time, but we have a Publix underway here. I can almost see it outside of my window. In Jacksonville, we just – we're ready to potentially start Phase II of an H-E-B that we actually greenlighted during COVID. Many of you have had the opportunity to see our recently completed Wegmans in Raleigh. We've got a Publix underway in Richmond, and I can go on and on and on. We've got a fantastic team, and we will continue to get more than our fair share of those opportunities. And as we all know, grocery is growing, and we're going to continue to have the opportunity to do that. And then with acquisitions, I think Blakeney, Long Island, again, success, Pruneyard prior to that, when we have boots on the ground. We have the team in the ground, we have relationships, really important that help bring opportunities to us and we do have a cost of capital advantage when we're able to use that and use our expertise and see an opportunity to add to the quality of our portfolio and add to the future growth rate of our portfolio, we're going to take advantage of it, and I feel really confident that we'll do that.
Floris Van Dijkum: Thanks, Lisa. If I can add – maybe I have another question here in terms of technology and data. I mean you are – you were the largest owner, you're now the second largest owner, but you've had this wealth of information at your fingertips. Maybe if you can talk a little bit about how all of that information and getting the new information, particularly regarding cell phone usage or traffic at your centers? How is that helping the business? How is that helping your small shop? And does that actually allow Regency to maybe boost in particular, small shop occupancy, which has always lagged or anchor occupancy. Are there things where you can actually monetize some of that technology and data and improve the economics of the business?
Lisa Palmer: I'll start and Jim can add to the extent that he has any little nuggets. But it is – I appreciate the recognition of the size. I do think that scale matters. We talked about that going back to 2017 when we merged with Equity One. Just that one combination made a difference with relationship with tenants, with our ability to mine data, as you said, and also just the absolute levels of free cash flow that we have allow us to invest back in the business as well. And that is in technology and in data analysis and in being able to do a little R&D and what can we do to help drive occupancy and drive higher rents in our shopping centers. And I think you continue to see that. And I mean our peers are doing some of the same as well. It's not as if we have a secret sauce. I think we have all gotten better and more sophisticated, certainly over the 25 years that I've been here. And I think we're going to continue to do that. We're going to continue to be able to help our tenants and further drive occupancy, the higher the quality of the shopping center the more ability you have to do that. And I think, again, we are well positioned to do so.
Floris Van Dijkum: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Samir Khanal with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.
Samir Khanal: Hi, good morning everybody. Hey Jim, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think in your opening remarks, you talked about labor shortages and I think the impact on rent commencement times. Maybe just expand that on a bit kind of what you're seeing in your portfolio? Just trying to understand that a little bit more?
James Thompson: Yes, Samir. Obviously, it's a headwind that we see out there. I would say it has not been impactful to date. But we're cognizant of it and prepared to expect some delay on rent commencement. Probably the biggest challenge as I look at it today is still probably on the front end from the permitting perspective. The municipalities are still working from home from a lot of perspectives. It's hard to get plans approved. It's hard to get inspectors out. So that's probably the one thing that we're having the hardest time circumventing and figuring out better ways to solve the problem because it's – we really – that's the toughest issue. Everything else we're getting creative like our – we're figuring out ways to multiple options for different product types, how do you preorder items, preparing white box well before you need it. Things that we've always done on the margin, but now are just absolutely critical to think about what's Plan B and be ready to snap to Plan B, know what it is, execute on it without losing time. So far, like I say, it hadn't been an impact, but eyes wide open, I think the labor issue is the one that kind of keeps me thinking about. And the impact, I think, is basically there. Supply chain, we're kind of working around, but the labor, hopefully, knock on wood, is starting to sort itself out.
Samir Khanal: Okay. Thanks for that. And I guess, just my second question, Mike or Lisa. I know you don't guide to transactions. But is there a way to sort of give us an idea of what that pipeline looks like today? I mean, how active is that maybe the volume of product you're currently looking at, whether it's portfolios, one-off assets. Just trying to get a sense of how much on the offense you can be this year considering where pricing is and you did that $500 million last year, and the ability to repeat that? Thanks.
Michael Mas: Let me Samir, start a little bit from a financial perspective, and I'm going to let Lisa to speak to our pipeline and our activity. And this dovetails a bit with question from Floris previously. We've talked a lot about growth. We talked a lot about continued recovery in 2022 and beyond. And Lisa has been great about mentioning our balance sheet position. So if you put all that together that organic EBITDA growth and us intentionally wanting to operate within this 5% to 5.5% balance sheet range and a starting point at 5.1% today that is going to provide us with that capacity and firepower to continue to be proactive and on our front foot on acquisition activity. You could – I think the numbers, absent any more disruption and a more continual rate of growth, much like we're projecting in 2022 in that 3% to 3.5% range, you could pretty easily rationalize a $200 million to $300 million acquisition pipeline that Regency can afford to bring on without undue pressure from our perspective to our balance sheet. And we're excited, and we think that capital – so effectively, you're over leveraging those acquisitions without over-leveraging your total balance sheet, which is allowing us to be competitive.
Lisa Palmer: I don't know that I have that much to add, but I think that if you do think about the guidance, and we did guide slightly. It says that we feel really – we're really close to being able to announce that $30 million acquisition. But there's a lot behind that as well that we are actively pursuing. It's just that it's never definitive in that world until it's definitive. And so to the point about not wanting to get ahead of ourselves with guidance because when we do acquire, it will be accretive. So to the extent that we couldn't meet the guidance, if you would, then we would be walking backwards. And instead, when we announce an acquisition, it's going to be accretive. And we are actively pursuing, and I feel confident that we're going to have some success this year.
Samir Khanal: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Juan Sanabria: Hi. Thanks for the time. First question would just be cap rate expectations, maybe a range of recognizing you don't want to negotiate against yourself. But how should we think about cap rates? I know you just said that they're going to be accretive, but just from a – given you're using debt to fund it, it sounds like, but just what expectations do we have in mind for cap rates?
Lisa Palmer: That's a great observation, Juan. That is the point about being able to lean in with our balance sheet is that when we look at our weighted average cost of capital for new acquisitions, we can lean in a little bit more. But with that said, cap rates continued set it in our prepared remarks, compressed valuations rising. Floris indicated the report about one large portfolio that is in a sub-5% cap rate range. And as I spoke about, the demand for grocery-anchored shopping centers is really strong. The competition is steep in the transaction market, and we continue to see cap rates in the 4.5% to 5.5% range depending on how stabilized they are, how much growth there is to still harvest coming out of kind of the disruption from the last two years. But with that said, I go back to the team, we have 22 offices across the country. We have boots on the ground. We have a competitive advantage with our cost of capital. We have a competitive advantage with our experience and our expertise. And where like the Blakeney’s that were sub-5% or like the Long Island portfolio that was north of 5%, there's going to be a little bit of a range, but it's going to be in that – basically that band, if you will, for the quality that we're looking for.
Juan Sanabria: Helpful. Thank you. And then just a bigger picture question. Hoping you could help us frame how rents have moved or grown and kind of what you're expecting going forward on that front? And compare that to cost growth and is the difference maybe costs are outpacing rents at least for now a limiting factor in truly ramping up more significantly your development pipeline, or how are you guys seeing that and thinking about those two variables as drivers of capital allocation?
Lisa Palmer: Let me open I'm going to toss to Jim to talk about the rents that we're getting. And the fortunate thing with our type of product, we do have 10% to 14% of our space turn on an annual basis. So you do have an opportunity to kind of keep up with inflation, if you will, and mark rents to market. In addition to the fact that we're getting annual contractual rent steps and already getting 3% annual increases. So that's also helping us move towards inflation. But from the actual experience of 2021 and results with net effective rents, which also capture some of that cost increases for the capital that you're spending, we have great success. And the same with our developments in terms of underwriting, our costs, capturing that as we're thinking about the go forward, we're incorporating that. And we still have – we are still building that pipeline and anticipate being able to achieve the returns that we need to achieve.
James Thompson: Right. I would just pile on there on the inflation side. As I mentioned, in our redevelopment and development pipelines, we're continuing to perform as advertised on yields and as we're underwriting new deals. Again, eyes wide open on the inflation, the timing delays, all those things are being built in, and we're maintaining what we believe are appropriate yields going in.
Juan Sanabria: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Jeffrey Spector: Hi, good morning. One follow-up on the guidance, and I apologize if I missed this, but again, just thinking about, I guess, the low end of the same-store NOI guidance at 2.75%, what would cause you to be at that low end? Is it simply thinking about more of a flat occupancy? Like what would cause your bottom end to occur?
Michael Mas: Hi, Jeff. Appreciate that. It would be a different view on move-outs primarily to your point. And it would also include maybe a bit of a delay on contributions from some of our redevelopments as well, a timing delay. In combination, that would be the support for the low end. We have planned for move-out activity in 2022 to be consistent with our historical averages. Jim mentioned our higher retention rate. But the plan for 2022 would be that we revert on the margin down into kind of a more normalized level of move-outs. And that's part of the business. Tenants will move out in our best of times or in normal times, a 75% retention rate is considered pretty normal. So that downside would include a little bit worse environment, if you would, on the move-out front. I think I'm looking around the table at Jim and Lisa, we're very confident with the midpoint of this range. As we sit here in mid-February, and think about the environment we're in, coming out of this Omicron wave, all else being equal, and if we continue on this path, we're pretty confident in delivering at that midpoint. And hopefully, our eye level is north of that.
Jeffrey Spector: Thank you. And then just a big picture question. Lisa, you've mentioned grocer-anchored centers. And we still receive a lot of incoming questions on brick-and-mortar grocer. I guess, just big picture, like what are your latest thoughts on that business? What are you hearing? What are the grocers doing to keep the brick-and-mortar relevant versus, let's say, this more elevated e-commerce for grocer?
Lisa Palmer: I don't appreciate the question, Jeff. But I don't know that it's really changed very much in the last 12 to 18 months. There was certainly a lot of acceleration in the early parts of the pandemic with regards to how grocers were reacting and how they were adapting, if you will, to the new challenges. I think that – you've heard me say this before, and it's not just for grocers, it's for all retailers, the most profitable way for them to get their goods into a customer's hands is for the customer to come into the store. So they continue to invest in the store as well and that experience. But at the same time, they understand the competitive need to be able to serve the customer and through the other methods, if you will. And that is curbside, which a lot made really, really quick advances because they had to during the beginning of the pandemic, and the successful operators are now doing that extremely successfully. And so curbside is one, no doubt. And then last is the home delivery. And again, they recognize the need, though it's clearly the least profitable for all. And we see that, that is – I mean, look at what Amazon is doing with opening stores so that they can also complement their home delivery with curbside and with pickers, if you will, anything to get closer to the customer, that last mile. And our grocery stores, our shopping centers or that last mile – have that last mile distribution capability. And so a lot of the operators are then investing into that. And you're seeing different means of testing R&D, right? Kroger is doing more as we know, right, the Ocado. You're seeing Albertsons is probably the – investing the most right now in micro fulfillment. H-E-B is doing a kind of a combination of both, and all of the better operators are investing. They're investing in technology. They're investing in the customer experience. They're investing in delivery, if you will, whether it's from their store curbside or whether it's to the homes. And again, the last mile matters, and that's where we're positioned.
Jeffrey Spector: Thank you. And then just my last question. I guess, whether it's dispositions or as you think about the portfolio positioning for the next few years, can you just talk about regions? And are there any regions you're hoping to maybe lighten up on or add to?
Lisa Palmer: We like the markets that we're in. You've heard us speak in the past that I do think that the pandemic has actually provided a lot of tailwinds for suburban shopping centers, which, again, is where we are located. There have been some migration patterns, and markets are seeing accelerated population growth that they weren't seeing before. I love to talk about my hometown as one of those. Jacksonville is seeing quite a bit of population growth. It is a market that we will be looking more aggressively for potential new investment opportunities. You've heard us talk about Phoenix as a market that we are currently not in. It is one that we've added to our target market list, if you will. But beyond that, we like the markets we're in. We're going to continue to invest capital in compelling opportunities. Trade areas matter, and that is really where we focus our attention, so on trade areas.
Jeffrey Spector: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Anthony Powell: Hi, good morning. Just a question on this development. And I guess there seems to be more interest in doing things like life sciences, apartments and office and suburban, I guess, areas. Have you looked at your portfolio to see if there's an opportunity to systematically mine these development opportunities like you have done with Costa Verde, or are there going to be kind of more one-off deal?
Lisa Palmer: We are constantly evaluating how we can maximize the value at all of our properties, whether that is specifically just harvesting and growing retail NOI or whether there is an ability to add different uses, it is a daily conversation at our asset management level. And we do have future opportunities. We've alluded to some in our supplemental disclosure, and we'll continue to have some. I mean, we have a portfolio of over 400 shopping centers across the country, and we own really great real estate under the shopping centers. We will continue to target development spend in that $150 million to $200 million on an annual basis. And some of that's going to come from properties that we already own.
Anthony Powell: Got it. I guess, do you see, I guess, a higher mix of new mixed-use development or, I guess, things like that relative to prior levels, or is it going to be kind of similar to what you've done before?
Lisa Palmer: No. And again, I mean, looking at Costa Verde as an example, we are going to be focused where we can extract the value from the retail to the extent that the capital to be invested for other uses, our goal would be to use an experienced partner, perhaps ground lease that or sell it like we did with Costa Verde. So our dollars invested are going to be focused on retail.
Anthony Powell: Got it. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist. Please proceed with your question.
Ki Bin Kim: Thank you. Good morning. A quick question on your non-same-store NOI projections for 2022 is expected to be a $0.02 drag. I'm just curious about that. Is that because of the J curve nature to some of the development were dilutive in the beginning that you should regroup later. Just if you can help us understand that line item better?
Michael Mas: No, I appreciate that question, Ki Bin. Actually, the same property pool basically is all of our assets at this point in time. So we really don't have much remaining in the non-same pool. This is our captive insurance program that we have classically held in our non-same-property pool. And what you're seeing here is an incredibly positive 2021 from a claims perspective. We are anticipating in this guidance that, again, we revert to more classic or historical levels of claims. But what you had was a year in 2021, absent any hurricanes, absent any tornadic activity. So we're planning for knock on wood, but that would not recur this year.
Ki Bin Kim: Got it. And can you help us understand how the mechanics of your expense reimbursement that you're recouping given the inflationary environment that we're in? I'm curious if expenses go up 10%, like how much of that are you actually able to pass on to tenants versus creating maybe some additional leakage that might be dragging since NOI?
Michael Mas: Yes. I mean, on a current year basis, our recovery rates, we anticipate maintaining at historical levels and growing as we grow our commenced occupancy. We do have that unique one-time item in 2021 in the second quarter, which was really a follow-on from 2020. If you really trace it back, we were concerned about collecting on recoveries in 2021 coming out of the depths of the pandemic in 2020, and that's reverberating through our 2022 results. So again, unfortunate some noise – that's in that noise category. But on a current year basis, we feel confident in whatever increases are to occur on the expense line items, which we are not anticipating to be material. I think our expense growth is in line with historical averages. We are anticipating an ability to pass that through and maintain our recovery rates.
Ki Bin Kim: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.
Greg McGinniss: Hey, everyone. Obviously, a lot has been covered. So just one for me, and I apologize if this is already been discussed. But regarding the $85 million impairment this quarter, where Potrero was expected to be a transformative redevelopment project within the Equity One portfolio and appears you're now looking to offload that property. Can you just provide some background on the evolution of that site why it's no longer fit for the portfolio?
Michael Mas: Sure. And good morning, Greg. So really – let me handle it from an accounting standpoint first. And then Lisa or I, we can talk about the future prospects of the project. But it really – impairments are really about whole period analysis. So as we do our work to essentially measure all of our assets, the assumption of whole period is the biggest assumption towards whether or not you'd have to mark your assets to market. So obviously, sales are a classic example of when you mark your assets to market and you recognize an impairment or a gain. In this case, together with some of our movement on an asset like Costa Verde, together with some movement in that center city, particular trade area, San Francisco. The probability of sale increased to a level where that trigger from an accounting standpoint resulted in a requirement to mark the asset to fair market value. So you go through that exercise as you're required to do and the valuation that is supporting that mark is a current valuation as supported by market participants and brokers on what I would deem a retail-only long-term basis. So that's what happened from an accounting standpoint. Potrero is a great asset. It's a very good retail center. At the time of the original allocation of basis post merger with Equity One, there was a near-term plan in place that involves a material densification project. And to Lisa's point previously, if you think about the allocation of retail to non-retail, it was a significant amount of non-retail densification and she articulated very well our plans going forward, which is to mine to the best of our ability and extract where we can, the retail component of projects, but to use other means of extracting value on non-retail. So that could, again, include selling air rights. It could include joint ventures. It could include ground leases. It could include monetizing assets and redeploying – maximizing land value and redeploying that capital as we did from Costa Verde into the Long Island portfolio.
Lisa Palmer: I don't have that much to add. I think, Mike, you covered it. It becomes essentially a financial analysis decision. It's similar to Costa Verde, similar to Sequoia. It's a great retail site. But what path maximizes the value while managing the risk. And we haven't made a decision, I mean, it's not held for sale, but the probability of the whole period, that changed, which triggered the impairments evaluation and analysis. But still more to come. We have not made a decision on that asset.
Greg McGinniss: All right. Thank you very much for the clarity there.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Mueller: Just have a quick one. Just given the demand picture, is there any chance we could see the $150 million to $200 million development spend accelerate?
Lisa Palmer: It's for 2022. The probability that's not very high because it does take time. And remember, while we have the best team in the business and they were working throughout kind of the disruption period, we did pause for a period of time when there was no visibility to how long this would last, if you will, starting in April of 2020. We switched back on pretty quickly. But that pause still created a little bit of a delay, if you will. And we are rebuilding and there is a potential for it in future years, certainly not for 2022.
Michael Mueller: Yes. I was thinking more over the next three years or so.
Lisa Palmer: Mike, I'd love for you to come set goals for my team and speak to them and let them see if they can do more. The more we can do, the better because we can fund it.
Michael Mueller: Okay. That was it. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Linda Tsai: Hi. In terms of the comments that 1Q would see a bigger benefit, I think, from prior period, collections. In terms of the percentage of that 1Q will comprise, what would that look like? I think in the past, it's ranged from like 23% to 25% in recent year's pre-COVID.
Michael Mas: Yes. I'm going to go back to the comments, Linda, and just kind of leave it there, but we're coming off an $18 million Q1 charge from bad debt or uncollectible lease income in Q1 of 2021. And recall, Q4, we're down to about $2.5 million of a quarterly charge, which could replicate in Q1 2022 could improve as we continue to see improvements in cash collection rates. So that's going to be the difference. And what we wanted to do is very – was be mindful of the fact that there's going to be continued variance in that percentage. And that Q1, there's a probability that Q1 could have a rate of growth that's higher than the top end of our range and will float back down to within our range over the course of the year.
Linda Tsai: Thanks for that clarification. And then just in terms of higher energy costs and consumers staying closer to home, sorry about the drilling. Are you seeing any bifurcation between the high and low end consumer in terms of spending strength?
Lisa Palmer: We don't – I mean we have a pretty consistent investment philosophy. We don't actually have that wide of a kind of a range, if you will. But I think it is more about suburban close to home than it is necessarily about the high-end and low-end consumer. Dollars are being spent within a relatively small circle around consumers' homes. Although travel did pick up to, I'm sure you've seen that as well in December of 2021, topping 2019. So we are seeing the return of the consumer despite inflationary headwinds. The consumer is spending.
Linda Tsai: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Christopher Lucas: Hey, good morning, everybody. Mike, thanks so much and your team for all the detail, really help me narrow down some of the gap between my expectations and your guidance. But I did want to sort of maybe dig into one other area or two other areas along those lines. On the higher period rent guidance number. Is there a upside to that number that you can quantify for us that could happen in 2022?
Michael Mas: It's a great question, Chris. Let me show you where to look and then we'll talk a little bit about prospects. So we have $13 million of prior year collections, plus or minus in the plan. If you look at our reserved AR again on that very helpful Page 34 of the supplement, it's $50 million. So that's, in effect, largely cash basis reserves. I'd be very careful to think about that as a maximum potential collection opportunity. We've talked at length through 2021, and we believe this into 2022 what's remaining to be collected and what has been reserved is largely for Regency, a West Coast shop space, local type of lean – we like the tenants we had in those shopping centers, pre-pandemic. We continue to like those users and those tenants post and the team, as directed by Jim, is going to probably more diligently use abatements as a tool. They were down for longer. The hole was deeper, why go through the pain and the cost of replacing a tenant and absorbing the downtime in the capital. So that is – I would just – some caution as we think about what is the outperformance potential of that $13 million assumption? That being said, it's been a hard number to handicap into 2021. Clearly, I think our initiating guidance in 2021 was sub-$10 million, and we ended up at $46 million. So I fully – it's a tough number to get arms around. We've done – we think 13% is a really good estimate. Importantly, we've collected about nearly 30% of that through January. But as time goes on, that collection rate will continue to grind down.
Christopher Lucas: Okay. That's really helpful. And then just thinking about your cash basis tenants, any – again, relative to what you were able to collect on a percentage of billings last year. Was there any delta to that in terms of your guidance assumptions for 2022?
Michael Mas: On the cash basis collection rate?
Christopher Lucas: Yes.
Michael Mas: I mean, again, that's going to come through our ULI assumptions initial from 2021 and 2022, but we're collecting 94% on our existing cash basis tenancy, which again, today is 17% of our overall ABR. That is a pretty healthy rent. That's on current billings. I don't want to – don't take that 94% and apply it what we just talked about from a prior previously reserved amount. But we are – if you think about what I said from a ULI perspective, that would imply going from 175 basis points of bad debt to – in the 100 area, that would imply that we think our cash basis collection rate is going to improve from here. So we feel good about growth starting in 2022 and beyond and moving occupancy in the right direction and moving uncollectible lease income in the right direction and moving commenced occupancy in the right direction.
Christopher Lucas: Thanks for that, Mike. And then Jim, just wanted to follow-up on the permitting delays question or is that mostly a West Coast phenomenon, or is there – is it more widespread than just the West Coast?
James Thompson: Chris, I would say it's probably more predominant on the West. As they've been the slowest to recover, they're kind of – doesn't laggards on things like this. So in most of the country, we're getting better service. And quite frankly, the West is catching up very, very quickly in all the major metrics. So I feel like there that too will get cleaned up here pretty quickly.
Christopher Lucas: Okay. And last question, Lisa, on your acquisition underwriting, and this may be way premature, but just wanted to understand, given the backdrop of inflation, does replacement costs become part of the underwriting criteria at this point? Or are we well away from that?
Lisa Palmer: It really does. And the way we – when we are looking at evaluating opportunities, we are certainly just looking at what is the NOI growth profile, if you will. So the going-in return plus growth. So essentially getting us to our unlevered IRR or a total return because our intent is to hold these assets forever.
Christopher Lucas: Super. Thank you guys for your time.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tammi Fique with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Tammi Fique: Thank you. Maybe just following up on Chris' question. What is happening with that bucket of tenants that is giving you confidence in collecting that $13 million of prior period rents? And maybe what isn't happening with the remaining portion that doesn't give you confidence in collecting that? And does that full $50 million remain in occupancy today?
Michael Mas: Yes. It's really timing, Tammi. And Jim has hit on it, and we've hit on it kind of repeatedly through 2021. It's the West Coast just being a couple of months, three months behind. And it was a very deliberate snowflake tenant-by-tenant approach that Regency is employed into working through and resolving outstanding obligations. So we worked through a large component of what was an original $85-or-so million reserve on 2020 rents looking back at year-end 2020 into the rapid – more rapidly recovering on the East Coast, specifically the Southeast moving into the central more rapid recovery. And now the West behaviorally has been very similar to those regions. But again, the difference has been just the time that they were down. The hole that was dug was deeper. And it's just – we've made the assessment that it may not be appropriate to chase after previous rent at the risk of future rent. And again, making these – literally case-by-case going back through your rent rolls, do you have the right operator? Do you have the right use? Do you want this use in your space going forward? And do you want to avoid the downtime? I think I'd leave it at that, Tammi, for the color as to why that – that, why that difference to the $50 million exists.
Tammi Fique: Okay. Thanks.
James Thompson: I think when you look – to me, when you look at the cash collections and where we are in the West Coast at 98% and you look at some of the tougher categories, the personal services up to 97% collection. You're looking at fitness up to 95%. The way I interpret that is we have picked the ponies we want to ride going forward. And to Mike's point, we are now in the delicate balance of how much more do you want to push on collecting really old rents. And we're looking more forward than we are backwards quite frankly.
Michael Mas: At no financial impact because of the reserve, right.
Tammi Fique: Got it. That's helpful. And then just one more. I'm thinking about the 1.3% annual contractual rent increase in embedded in same-store NOI growth. I know, Jim, you mentioned 2% on new leasing activity. I guess are you able to drive that portfolio level higher over time, particularly given the inflation levels today.
Michael Mas: We hope so. But Tammi, it's a tough mountain to move. We have long targeted 1.5% at the upper end of our ability to get there over time, and it's going to take a lot of time, to Lisa's point earlier, only turning about 10% of your portfolio annually. What's happening is we've had such great success over the last eight plus years embedding contractual increases into the majority of our shop space is really that as those tenants are replaced with tenants, you're just replacing like-for-like contractual increases. So that is the ability to push that number really ends up coming down to your recapture of anchor spaces and your ability to embed contractual increases there. So 1.3% today, a really healthy number. It's moved off of 1.2% over the last several years. 1.4%, I think is visible and 1.5% is an ultimate target, but that's going to take some time to get to.
Tammi Fique: Great. Thank you. Appreciate the time.
Operator: There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you. I just want to thank you all for your time. It was a long one this morning. And I look forward to seeing hopefully most of you live and in person this year. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Christy, and good morning, everyone. Thank you so much for joining us. We feel really good about the progress that we've made toward recovery and also with the improvement we're seeing in our operating trends. Our third quarter results are reflective of a healthy environment for open-air, grocery-anchored shopping centers. And not only are we feeling closer to normal, but we're excited about what the future holds. I'm also really pleased to report that despite the recent concern about potential impacts from the Delta variant, we've continued to make meaningful progress on rent collections, narrowing the gap further as nearly all of our tenants are in a position to pay us full current rent. Steady retailer demand is driving strong leasing activity, which combined with reduced tenant move-outs, has moved the needle and occupancy. We've also had success maintaining leverage in our lease negotiations, driving contractual rent growth and remaining prudent on CapEx, while further improving our rent spreads, our team has been working really hard to drive deals that will lead to long-term growth in the value of our assets. As a result of these positive trends and an increased pace of improvement, we're again raising full-year guidance for 2021. In recent quarters, we've discussed that we believe the recovery of NOI back to 2019 levels would likely occur in the second half of 2022 on an annualized basis. But given the rate of progress we've seen in recent months, we are now pulling that forward to the first half of 2022. We've also increased our dividend by 5%, a reflection of our confidence in a return to sustained growth over the long term. You'll recall, and I know you're probably sick of this, but I can't possibly remind you enough, that we never cut our dividend during the pandemic. We're committed to growing our dividend while also accretively investing our sector leading free cash flow to drive solid total returns for our shareholders. And that's a good segue into our investment and capital allocation strategy where we remain on our front foot. The private transaction markets are competitive, they remain competitive, and we've continued to see downward pressure on cap rates as more buyers have emerged for high-quality, well-located grocery anchored centers. But our strong Balance Sheet and access to low-cost capital provide a competitive advantage that allows us to be opportunistic. And we do have a long track record of investing with discipline on a leverage neutral and earnings accretive basis. Our pipeline is active and we continue to see good opportunities. With that, we just announced that we are under contract to acquire Blakeney Shopping Center, a dominant grocery-anchored community town center in South Charlotte. This is a high-quality, well-leased center with strong demographics and a tenant mix that fits well with our strategy. Our Southeast team is excited to bring this exceptional asset into the Regency portfolio. And we expect the transaction to close this month. The addition of high-quality standards like Blakeney, along with our development and redevelopment program, are important to portfolio enhancement. At the same time, we remain committed to selling centers that are lower growth or non-strategic or when it's clear to us that maximizing the value of a property involves a predominantly non-retail use. For example, our recent sale of the former Sears box adjacent to our Hancock Center in Austin was in that last bucket where we determined that its highest and best use was medical office. The addition of this office component and the traffic that it will generate to our site will enhance the value of this well-leased center where HEB is currently expanding its highly productive store. But our best risk reward proposition is to invest capital into strong grocery -anchored neighborhood and community retail, which is the bread and butter of Regency Strategy. This commitment to portfolio enhancement has proven to and will continue to fortify our future NOI growth. In closing, our shopping centers are well-positioned to benefit from long-term migration and flexible work trends that favor suburban trade areas. And we are actively positioning our portfolio to thrive today and into the future. If the industry has learned anything over the last 18 months during which we saw hyper-accelerated digital commerce and fulfillment and distribution challenges, it's that having brick and mortar locations close to where consumers live is critical to retailer success. Jim.
Jim Thompson: Thanks, Lisa. Good morning everyone. We remain encouraged by the continued improvement in our portfolio operating trends accelerated by the reopening of the West Coast this summer. Our tenants are generally fully open and operating in all markets with the lifting of restrictions translating into higher rent collections, and continued strong leasing activity. Portfolio foot traffic rebounded back to a 100% of 2019 foot traffic levels as of late October. despite the slight dip in September related to the Delta variant. Many of our tenants are experiencing positive sales trends in 2021, with groceries holding their gains from 2020, and many restaurants reporting record high productivity. We continue to see further sequential improvement in rent collections with Q3 collections at 98%. Notably, our collection rate for deferrals remains high at over 95% year-to-date. Translation, tenants are honoring their commitments. Our leased occupancy rate is up 50 basis points over the second quarter after adjusting for the sale of the vacant former Sears Building at the Hancock Center, Lisa just mentioned. These gains were driven by strong leasing activity and fewer tenant move-outs. Most importantly, our net effective rent paying occupancy also rose this quarter and is now over 90%. As we've noted previously, this metric is the best indicator of our recovery progress. As noted, leasing activity continues to be robust and we remain encouraged by the strength of our pipelines. Q3 total leasing volumes were 125% of 2019 quarterly averages. Shop renewal rates were 80% elevated over historical trends. Rent-spreads continued to improve to a blended rate of over 5%. While our GAAP rent spreads also continue to get closer to pre -COVID levels at over 12%. We are maintaining contractual rent growth on leasing activity in line with recent years with embedded rent steps on more than 80% of our leases executed this quarter. Additionally, our weighted average lease term for deals has risen back above pre -COVID levels. To summarize, our leasing trends are moving in the right direction, enabling us to maximize NOI growth for the long term. All of that said, we are fully aware and acknowledge that retailers today are facing challenges related to labor shortages, cost inflation, supply chain disruptions, and permitting backlogs. While these issues are impacting build-out costs and tenant rent commencement timing, so far, this has only been on the margin for regency. That said, we will continue to monitor these issues and we'll work closely with our tenants to help them manage through them where we can. Moving to development activity. We continue to make good progress on our in-process ground-up and redevelopment projects and we completed a $21 million Bloomingdale's Square redevelopment in Tampa this quarter. We reimagine and modernize the Center by repurposing a former Walmart box to accommodate an expansion and relocation of a highly productive existing Publix and backfilled the former grocery box with a new LA Fitness. We added more visible and functional shop space and made enhancements and renovations to the remaining portions of the Center. This successful project helped to cement this Centers relevancy and dominance in its trade area, while generating a return of over 8%. Construction cost, inflation, and labor shortages are real and are creating some pressures, but are not materially impacting the current yields and cost in our in-process projects. We're keeping our finger on the pulse from these trends and are being very thoughtful in our cost projections and delivery timing. When underwriting new and potential pipeline projects. In summary, we're very pleased with the positive momentum that we continue to experience in our operating portfolio and in our value creation pipeline, driving us closer to full recovery and supporting our future growth. Mike?
Mike Mas: Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. I'll provide some color around third quarter results, walk through the changes to full-year 2021 guidance, and offer some helpful reminders when thinking about next year. Third quarter NAREIT FFO of a $1.12 per share was helped by several items. Uncollectible lease income was a positive $10 million in the quarter. The details of which we've broken out on page 33 of our supplemental. We reserved over $4 million on third quarter billings, which is down from over $10 million a quarter ago associated with uncollected revenues from cash-basis tenants. This was more than offset by the collection of nearly $6 million of amounts reserved during the first half of 2021, as well as the collection of close to $9 million of revenues that were originally reserved in 2020. Our full-year '21 guidance calls for a $46 million positive impact from the collection of 2020 reserves, of which we have recognized $41 million through the third quarter. We also recognized close to $14 million of one-time promote income in the third quarter related to USAA JV transaction, which positively impacted NAREIT FFO, but is not included in our core operating earnings metric. Finally, straight-line rent in the third quarter benefited from the reversal of reserves triggered by the conversion of some cash-basis tenants back to accrual accounting, as reflected in non-collectible straight-line rent at a positive $4 million. This is a non-cash accounting impact that contributes to NAREIT FFO. But again, did not impact our core operating earnings. Following these conversions, which represent about 5% of ABR. We now have 22% of our ABR remaining on a cash basis of accounting. For the smaller pool, our cash basis collection rate with 91% in the third quarter, a 700 basis point increase from a quarter ago. The collection rate on the old pool before the conversions was 93% in the third quarter, up from the 86% in the second quarter that we disclosed on the last call. As Jim mentioned, our net effective rent-paying occupancy now exceeds 90% as we've continued to narrow the spread between rent paying and our commenced occupancy rate, due to the progress we've made increasing collections on cash-basis tenants. We remain in a great position from a balance sheet perspective as cash flows continue to recover and leverage even after excluding prior year reserve collections has returned to pre -pandemic levels. We ended the quarter with full capacity in our revolver and we have no unsecured debt maturities until 2024. You'll recall that we issued about a $150 million of equity in Q2 through our ATM program on a forward basis. We settled a portion of that during the third quarter to fund the USAA transaction, generating $83 million of net proceeds. The remainder is unsettled, which we view as capacity for future investment opportunities. And we have until June of 2022 to issue the shares. We did not raise any additional equity capital during the third quarter. Turning to guidance, we point you to the detail in our business update slide deck posted to our website. A big driver of the $0.12 increase in the midpoint of our core operating earnings range comes from a higher same property NOI growth forecast, as we increased the range by a 150 basis points at the midpoint. This increase was driven almost entirely by core improvement, including a higher cash basis collection rate on current year billings, and lower move-out activity. As I mentioned, our forecast for the collection of prior year 2020 reserves is up only slightly at $46 million. Other drivers of the increase to full-year core operating earnings expectations include higher lease termination fees and lower G&A. Our NAREIT FFO range has increased by an additional $0.05 at the midpoint on top of the change I just described, primarily driven by the increase in straight-line rent associated with the conversion of tenants back to accrual from cash basis during the third quarter. While it's possible that we may convert additional tenants back to accrual during the fourth quarter. Our guidance does not assume any additional reversal of straight-line rent reserves. I like to point out that these non-cash accounting impacts are a big reason why we provide and guide to core operating earnings. In addition to NAREIT FFO, this metric excludes non-cash amounts, such as straight-line rent and mark-to-market adjustments and can provide a much cleaner picture of our earnings trajectory. We will provide 2022 guidance with Q4 results in February, as we normally do. But we wanted to remind everyone that some of the bigger non-recurring moving pieces that haven't been disclosed and discussed throughout the year when thinking about modeling for next year. First, our $46 million guidance for collection of 2020 reserves is a prior-period adjustment not associated with 2021 billings. Second, we recognized abnormally high expense recoveries of about $3.5 million net of reserves in the second quarter related to the 2020 expense reconciliation process. Third, G&A during the first quarter benefited by about $2 million from the forfeiture of previously expense share grants related to the departure of our CIO earlier this year. And lastly, although not impacting core operating earnings, we recognized close to $14 million of promote income in the third quarter. We look forward to discussing our 2022 outlook in more detail together with next quarter's results. As Lisa mentioned, given the pace of improvement we've experienced to this point of the year, we now expect the recovery of our NOI back to 2019 levels will occur on an annualized basis at some point during the first half of next year. That's about 6 months earlier than we had previously expected. With that, we look forward to taking your questions.
Operator: Thank you. And at this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] One moment please, while we poll for questions. Our first question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Goldsmith: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Your third quarter benefited from the strengthening of the core business in conjunction with collecting some of the past rent. So presumably and as your guidance suggests, recovery of prior reserves is going to decrease in the future. And as that why it's down, can you talk about the -- you're going to be passing from collection of pass-through to continued growth of the core business. So can you talk about the trajectory of those two businesses and whether that means an FFO acceleration in the future?
Mike Mas: Sure. Hey, Michael, good morning. I appreciate it.
Michael Goldsmith: You're welcome. Yeah.
Mike Mas: You bring up a good point. First, the deceleration in the implied guidance for the fourth quarter. I just want to make sure we get that out there and explain some of the pieces here about -- as you have, you've done the math, it's about $0.06 per share at the midpoint. About a third of that, and again, I'm speaking to core operating earnings, not NAREIT FFO, about third of that is going to be, as you mentioned, a result of 2020 our prior-year collections decelerating. So the trajectory there, as you can see, has gone from $20 million -- over $20 million in the first quarter to roughly $9 million in the third. We have guided to that number being about $5 million in the fourth, about a 1/3 of that deceleration in the fourth quarter comes from other -- what I would call other NOI line items, percentage rent, settlement income. We did have a bit of a frothy third quarter, so that should decelerate in the fourth. And then we do -- as you look at the G&A guidance, you'll see that the fourth quarter from a run-rate perspective will be slightly higher than the third. So those are the drivers decelerating into the end of this year. As we think about next, it's -- uncollectable lease income is going to continue to be a story of accelerating our earnings path. We're at about 250 basis points on current year collections through the third quarter, as a bad debt charge or an uncollectible lease income charge. If you think about how we finished the year, we're anticipating that our cash-basis tenancy continues to climb from a collection rate perspective. I think we might end the year in a plus or minus 170 basis-point range as a bad debt expense charge on current year billings. And remember our historical run rates in the 50 basis point range. So we see a tremendous amount of opportunity to continue to close that gap. That's why we keep talking about net effective rent-paying occupancy. We increased that by 200 basis points this quarter. We anticipate that to continue to grind higher into 2020. Much more to come on 2022 guidance, I do want to hold that back until February. I don't know that we'll get back to our 50 basis point historical run rate by the end of next year. But we do feel pretty confident that we'll just continue to close that gap from that 170 where we think we'll end in the current year.
Lisa Palmer: And Michael, I like how you ask the questions, so I'll -- and with all of those, there's a lot of numbers and a lot of facts there and a lot of moving pieces. What I want to make sure doesn't get lost is the really vast improvement and the demand for leasing and for space in our properties because we did lose occupancy. And what is going to drive the acceleration is going to be our continued ability to release that space. And that's really important and we're seeing that demand come through.
Michael Goldsmith: Incredibly helpful. And just as a follow-up in your guidance, the expected cap rate for dispositions fell from 5.5% to 6% last quarter to 5.5% this period. In addition, your acquisition cap rates decreased from 5.5 to 5.1. Is it fair to say that industry cap rates have compressed 40 to 50 basis points since last quarter? And how does that make you change -- or how does that make you think about doing acquisitions, dispositions, development, and redevelopment going forward? Does that 'change your view?
Lisa Palmer: I don't believe that the cap rates are necessarily compressed by 50 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Our guidance as a result of the mix. So we did announce the acquisition of Blakeney which is an exceptional asset. And that -- obviously the negotiation of that was even prior to last quarter so the cap rates were already there. With the Blakeney acquisition, we are also, if you will, match funding that with very low cap rate dispositions, non-strategic in the fourth quarter and that's what drove that the increased guidance for dispositions with that lower cap rate for that. So it's a mix of properties on both the acquisition side and the disposition side specific to Regency. Cap rates have compressed all year long and as I said quarter-over-quarter, I don't think that there's been much of a change, but there's no question that for the type of property that we already own and therefore are looking to add into our portfolio, it's going to be in the 5 -- 4.5 to 5 cap rate range. That's high-quality grocery anchored shopping center pricing today. It does not change how we think about acquiring and how we think about adding, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. Portfolio enhancement has always been a really important part of our strategy, and we do believe that continuing to grow with premier high-quality assets like we already on will help fortify our future NOI growth as we dispose of those that perhaps may have a lower growth profile than our average, or may be non-strategic.
Michael Goldsmith: Thanks again and good luck in the fourth quarter.
Lisa Palmer: Thanks, Michael.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Katy McConnell with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Katy McConnell: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So I'm the Carolina deal, can you provide some more background on how the deal was sourced and what you're underwriting for upside opportunity to the property. And then lastly, just wondering how dispositions [Indiscernible] your funding plans for the beyond fourth quarter?
Lisa Palmer: There's so much in that question. I think it's going to take three of us to answer it. I'll start and then I'll pass to Jim, and then Mike may tap into the funding. It was a market at deal. However -- and that we've talked about this in the past, there is. No question that we typically have had more success when we're able to get in front of marketed fields and do things off market use our relationships. But there are a select number of assets that do come to the market that are market -- that we also have success in where we're able to leverage, really leverage our local teams. I'm a little bit biased here. I believe that if not the best, we're certainly really close to the best in the business, and we have an exceptional Southeast team. We have assets that look a lot like Blakeney already in the portfolio, and we have a lot of conviction around the quality of this asset. And then from the funding piece that Mike 's going to talk about, that allows us to add this to our portfolio on an accretive basis. So we're adding an exceptional asset that is going to have a growth rate that's above our average on an accretive to earnings basis. To me, that is why we were able to be aggressive on a market appeal. And I'll look to Jim to talk specifically about how we think about the growth rate here.
Jim Thompson: Yeah, Katy, I can't I can't overstate how excited our team is about this asset. It's truly a center gravity for retail and restaurants offerings in that affluent South Charlotte market. But as we look at it, we have a lot of respect for the current ownership. They've owned the asset for good long while and have done a really nice job in merchandising. But we believe we see a great opportunity to really apply our asset management skill set and eye towards fresh remarketing, remerchandising, and a fresh look, if you will, on the Center to really drive what we will believe our higher-than-normal NOI growth out of that asset, and that's the bottom line. We looked at that as an opportunity to get into a great Center and have outsized earnings opportunity.
Lisa Palmer: Before Mike gets into the funding, I don't want to miss the opportunity to -- we, very affectionately, call the asset of turducken, as we're nearing the month of thanksgiving. That came -- that was tabbed out away by our investments Officer in our Carolina market. And for those of you that don't know what a turducken is, turkey, chicken and duck. And this asset really, as Jim said, as a center of gravity and it offers there's, there's a target piece with more of a community center feel. There's a neighborhood center with Harris Peter anchoring that and then there's a main street retail. You can choose how you -- what you think is the turkey, the chicken, or the duck, but is it truly is a center of gravity and exceptional asset.
Mike Mas: Hey, Katy, just following up and clean that up from a funding standpoint. You're right. And this is a little bit to Michael's question as well. When you think about recycling, you typically think about dilution. And we're not -- we're familiar with that. We had some dilutive recycling in our history. We're in a unique period of time. Where we're adding to our disposition pipeline is actually low cap, low -- at the same time, low growth, non-strategic assets. And if you click through and just look at our dispositions on a year, you see Pleasanton Plaza, you see Hancock Sears Pad, non-income producing assets. Obviously, this is an ability to put that capital back to work. You see Gateway 101, it's basically two boxes, very low cap, very low growth, if any, it's flat as a board. And then we were recently able to sell the Parnassus Height Medical Center. Again, highly sought-after asset class, not consistent with Regency strategy, low cap rate. We're adding a couple more to the dispo guidance and what that blend of capital provides us is actually an opportunity to invest that accretively into a property like Blakeney, with on -- which has a headline and on the surface looks to be quite an aggressive cap rate and it is. But Regency at this unique period of time was able to make sense of that economically.
Michael Bilerman: Just as a follow-up, it's Michael Bilerman, good morning. Lisa, you've used institutional capital for a very, very long time. I can remember sitting down with you almost 25 years ago when you were running a fund platform with Bruce. Can you talk a little bit about where institutional capital is in partnering with you for further acquisitions, I see you looking at a lot of stuff right now, or whether you'd want to do it wholly-owned. And conversely, whether you would sell more into JV or institutional capital. Maybe just talk a little bit about the appetite, just given your deep history and relationships with that capital.
Lisa Palmer: Of course. Thank you, Michael. And I think I do remember that meeting 25 years ago. We have spoken with many investors about this over the past few years, especially in light of some of the buy-in of the USAA and some other dispositions. And back 25 years ago, we really utilized third-party capital as -- we've always said, there's 3 reasons, access to capital, access to opportunities and access to expertise. And 3 years ago, it was a combination of access to capital and access to opportunities. We were much smaller Company then. Today as we think about it, I just said, I believe that if we don't have the best, we certainly are really darn close to the best of the team in the business. So we don't necessarily need to access to expertise and the capital markets can be a little volatile. We haven't had the need for access to capital. We don't have it. We don't have that need today. But never say never. Maintaining good relationships with our partners is still an important objective for us and we continue to do that. However, at this time, that the access to opportunity would really be the biggest check for us in terms of where we would need to access third-party capital, That’s how we're thinking about it today. We have great partners really appreciate our partners. We appreciate the relationships with our partners, and we will continue to sit side-by-side with them. But for new capital at this point, it's not necessarily high on our priority list.
Michael Bilerman: Alright. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist. Please proceed with your question.
Ki Bin Kim: Thank you. Good morning. You guys have been able to achieve a high level of leasing velocity. I'm just curious about how deep that demand is and is the velocity at which the top of the funnel is being fed with additional pipeline. Is that -- how is that looking compared to the number of deals you've been signing to-date?
Jim Thompson: Yes. Ki Bin, this is Jim. Yeah, the velocity has been really good. And as I look at it, I think it's a combination of basically a renewed confidence in the brick and mortar business from retailers certainly pent up demand for -- from a year-and-a-half of really not a lot of activity that's opening up. And obviously, we continue to see a nice migration to quality, which we believe we are that answer to migration. But the categories that we're seeing are the ones we've merchandised to for the last 20 years. So we're doing a lot of medical deals, pet deals, restaurant, fast-casual, banks, personal service, and the demand is really across all regions. It's really -- it's almost imperceptible where there's more demand than others because it's coming from everywhere. Like I said, the pipeline as we look at our existing pipeline into the 90-day future, if you will, it continues to look very robust. We have more vacancy than we've had in a long time. We have product, we have availability, and there appears to be good solid retailer demand for that and so I'm cautiously optimistic we stay on a nice trajectory.
Ki Bin Kim: Great. And want to ask about your leasing spreads. The new lease spreads were essentially flat, but you are using less Capex than many of your peers as a percent of rental value or just whole dollars, just help us better understand this dynamic and the choices behind it?
Jim Thompson: Yeah, Jim again. I'll take that, and I appreciate you recognizing that the blended spreads is up to -- for this quarter was 5.1%, so we are on a nice trajectory there. But, in addition to those initial spreads, I think it's important, which is obviously an important metric, I like to step back and kind of take a broader look at what really is going on long term -- to create long-term sustainable NOI. I think one of the components, contractual rent steps and our ability to manage expense recovery ratios are our key contributors. I think appropriate and prudent leasing CapEx which you touched on. That's a major factor I think in long-term earnings growth. Tenant selection, really making sure we're picking the right mix to drive synergy and traffic at our Centers but also having a mind coming out of this pandemic environment, make sure we have an eye towards relevancy and survivability of the folks we're dealing with. We want people that's going to be here with us. We don't like to churn space. And all these things matter. And in combination with what we're seeing from a GAAP and net effective rent growth at the 12% number I referenced in the remarks, I'm confident that our overall results have us on a very good vector towards the long-term NOI and earnings growth objectives that we're looking for.
Ki Bin Kim: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Derek Johnson with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
Derek Johnston: Hi, everybody. Thank you. In this environment, which is more attractive, development at tighter yields or strategic acquisitions like, Blakeney, add compressing cap rates and just given the competitive backdrop, which do you feel as Regency's wiser capital allocation call?
Lisa Palmer: Derek, I'd actually don't view it as an either-or choice. We like all and we are not -- fortunately, the position that we're in as I just responded to Michael not in a position where capital is scarce for us. So we are trying and continue to make progress on rebuilding our ground-up development pipeline. We are making progress on our redevelopment pipeline, and we are in the market and see a good pipeline of opportunities for acquisitions. As long as we are able to invest accretively and grow the Company's future trajectory for NOI growth and earnings growth. That's the box that needs to be checked.
Derek Johnston: Got it and thank you. And maybe back to Jim or whoever wants to talk about demand. How is small shop demand stacking up? Just looking at small shop leasing pipeline now versus pre -pandemic and really, how does it compare? And if you We're seeing outside demand, is it providing the flexibility to bring in the right Regency style merchandising mix? Of course, given the Center or are you feeling the need with the occupancy hole to be a little more flexible on concept or maybe TI is going forward? We haven't seen it yet, but just looking ahead. Thank you.
Jim Thompson: Yeah, Derek. I think as I previously mentioned, I think the demand is there. We continue to asset manage no different today than we did pre -pandemic. We are always looking to get the right merchant at the right price to make sure they are successful and in turn, drive sales and make us successful. So, again, we -- right now the demand seems to be pretty deep. But we continue to be selective. We are generally never have been and don't intend to be fill it up with anything and hope they stick. We're very specific in our merchandising mix and really try to make good long-term decisions.
Derek Johnston: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Craig Schmidt: Thank you. I was wondering if I could get an update on the Serramonte Center, particularly with J.C. Penney space and then the Crossing Clarendon.
Lisa Palmer: Craig, we're going -- I'll have Jim address both. I think.
Jim Thompson: Yes. Serramonte with the J.C. Penney space. we are investigating several different redevelopment opportunities. So we're we're early in the process and trying to identify the best direction for that replacement box. And as far as the -- was it Crossing Clarendon?
Lisa Palmer: Crossing Clarendon. Yes.
Jim Thompson: Really in great shape there. Our retail ground floor space is fully spoken for either, either at lease or in lease negotiation. As we mentioned last quarter, I believe the lifetime fitness deal is executed. We're waiting on a use waiver which we expect to get in the next 30 days which will clear all contingencies and by year-end, we should be posting over 90% leased. We are -- it's come together nicely and excited to be lifetime over [Indiscernible]
Lisa Palmer: I think was I knew I wouldn't be out to help myself from jumping in. Those are both tremendous assets and we're, as Jim mentioned, we're continuing to harvest value from those and grow NOI and both of those assets are going to have outsized NOI growth in the near future.
Craig Schmidt: And that's good. Its over a 30-year redevelopment dollars. So the other question I had -- and I love the truducken reference.
Lisa Palmer: Truducken.
Craig Schmidt: Truducken yeah. I was -- when I was examining it during our time putting all 3 pieces together. But you guys did it. Hats off.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Craig.
Craig Schmidt: Anyway, the G&A costs, I'm just wondering, we expect a pretty decent increase in 2022 with increased travel or have you guys been relatively active throughout 2021 that's not going to have a significant pickup.
Mike Mas: I lost my life status on Delta. That means that thing. So we are anticipating a significant increase [Indiscernible] I was just going to say I appreciate you asking the question. It does give us the opportunity to put this out there. 2021's run rate on a quarterly basis is in the $19 million range or so. And again, I'll refer to my remarks, recall that we are benefiting this year from that $2 million forfeiture benefit upon max departure. Next year's run rate is probably going to be closer to the $21 million range on a quarterly basis. What we're capturing in that number is compensation increases together with filling open positions, some of the benefit we've been occurring in '21 as we've been running a little bit lighter from a headcount plan perspective. Increases the T&E, as you mentioned, the entire Company is -- we're starting to get back on the road and there's more conference is being held, businesses being conducted more in-person than on Zoom going forward. And so we're planning for that to return to pre-pandemic levels. And then the point I'd make is development overhead. Probably going to be in the flat range '21 as we continue to build our pipelines. We have the development spend will look a lot in 2022 like it did in '21. And then we anticipate growing that ability to capitalize '23 and beyond.
Craig Schmidt: Great, that's helpful. Thank you.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Craig.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Richard Hill : Hey, good morning, guys. First of all, thank you for being strategic when you're hosting this call. This is a first call I've had in a while where I'm not double or triple booked, so thank you very much. I have 1 key question about 4Q, and then 1 sort of bigger picture question. On 4Q, can you maybe provide us any thoughts on rents becoming straight line and how that will look in 4Q? I noted that moving tenants from cash basis to accrual accounting was around $0.03 in 3Q. So any thoughts on what that might look like in 4Q?
Mike Mas: Rich, we don't guide on it. I would say as we look at -- we have a very strict policy and we want it that way. Bringing tenants back to accrual accounting is going to take them to prove to us that the credit is there to meet that GAAP standard, right? So the bar is relatively high. You got be current on your rent for an extended period of time. And then I would add to that there's an overlay of what business are you in and I'll be frank. Some of the labor concerns that we're looking at today are impacting how we think about bringing tenants back to accrual accounting. As I look at our AR and our open AR and think about what tenants may or may not qualify. It could be in the 5% of ABR range in the fourth quarter that converts. I don't have a precise number for you on what that could mean from a straight-line rent perspective. But generally speaking, it works pro rata. So every percentage point that we convert is about worth, on a pound-for-pound basis, the same. I hope that helps. We're going to have to take these as they come Rich, unfortunately. And I do look forward to being back to normal when we have everyone nearly everyone back on accrual accounting
Jim Thompson: From your lips to God's ears. I completely agree with you on the complete understand [Indiscernible]
Richard Hill : So bigger-picture question, occupancy. Look, we've noted in the past, and very correctly, that occupancy is the key to getting back to normal. You continue to have really good leasing trends. Can you maybe talk about where you feel occupancy is going to get back to normal? Is that a year, 2 years, 3 years? I recognize I'm asking the shake your crystal ball here, and my crystal ball is not great right now, so hopefully yours is a little bit better than mine.
Lisa Palmer: We haven't given guidance in occupancy. I think one of the best metrics or measures is when we expect to get back to 2019 annualized levels, and that is now in the first half of 2022. So we are getting the benefit of some contractual rents along the way, which may offset a little bit of the occupancy, but I don't want to get out of -- get in trouble with any future guidance, but I think next year and into 2023, we should continue to see some occupancy left. So maybe sometime in 2023.
Richard Hill : Yeah, that's great, Lisa. I'm sorry. I wasn't trying to get you to talk about '22.I was just
Lisa Palmer: I was looking at Mike the whole time I answered that Rich to make -- making sure I wasn't getting in any trouble.
Richard Hill : No, I was really just talking about the cadence of occupancy returning to normal. Not as a comment.
Lisa Palmer: 2022 we'll benefit from some of the redevelopment, NOI growth that we talked about and contractual rent steps that are already embedded. While we'll be back to that 2019, it doesn't necessarily mean that occupancy is all the way back at that time, which is a good thing, because that means we still have more room to grow.
Richard Hill : Got it. Look, as someone that grew up in the South, I certainly know what a Turducken is. Thanks, guys. Congrats on a nice quarter.
Lisa Palmer: Thanks Rich. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan, please proceed with your question.
Michael Mueller: Hi. Lisa, I think you talked about cap rates on high-quality centers being 4.5 to 5. Looking at your dispose this year, they're 5.5% to 6%. I guess, how much of that 5.5 plus cap rate product do you still have in the Company?
Lisa Palmer: So I think we updated our guidance to be 5 to 5.5
Christy Mcelroy: On dispositions.
Lisa Palmer: On just on dispositions, Mike.
Michael Mueller: Okay.
Lisa Palmer: Make sure that that's clear because generally speaking, as I said, when we think about portfolio enhancement and the centers that we are selling, they are going to typically have a lower growth profile and/or be non-strategic. And so you would expect that especially with the lower growth profile that cap rates would be a little bit higher than the 4.5 to 5, because we as long as everyone out there looks at total returns, and whether it be going in cap plus growth or unlevered IRRs. So that's why you see a little bit of that discrepancy. I think for the 5 to 5.5, that's when we -- as Mike talked about our funding, that works for us, if you will, from a portfolio enhancement standpoint.
Mike Mas: And the details that actually doesn't include the non-income producing land that we're selling, so our effective earnings base cap rate is low.
Christy Mcelroy: [Indiscernible].
Mike Mas: In the low 4 range.
Lisa Palmer: The second half of your question.
Michael Mueller: Okay. And then maybe just switch gears for a second here. Do you see any other JV winddowns or buyouts over the next few years.
Mike Mas: I think building on the comment Lisa made earlier to Michael Bilerman question, there's nothing to count on there. We'd like our partners a lot and they've been good to us for a long period of time. And it's been a very symbiotic relationship. And so we -- I don't know, Mike, that I'd count on our ability to do a trade like the USA transaction, but never say never, and we can't predict what their plans are from a retail exposure perspective. And there may be an opportunity that Regency is presented with to consider buying in a JV partnership and we would do that. We like the assets equally that are in those portfolios. There is no fundamental kind of qualitative difference between the assets in our JV portfolios and what's on Balance Sheet. So we'll take it day-to-day, quarter-to-quarter. But it would take a shift in our partners mentality right now. Today, our partners are committed to the space, very specifically to the grocery -anchored neighborhood shopping center sector.
Michael Mueller: Got it. Okay. That was it. Thank you.
Lisa Palmer: Thanks, Mike.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please proceed which your question.
Anthony Powell: Hi, good morning. Question on I guess, base rent collections, the 2 laggers are personal service and fitness, but we're seeing some pretty big improvements in activity in those sectors real - time. So just curious, could you see an improvement in those 2 categories really by the first half of next year do you think?
Jim Thompson: Yeah, I would say the answer that is yes. And really the lag that you're seeing today is predominantly West Coast where they were the most impacted and the last to recover and with some certain mask mandates and COVID requirements that has still probably impacted those two categories in the West Coast more than anywhere else. But they're all -- they're basically on the rise. Large format fitness has bounced back very nicely. It's really more than smaller boutique folks that have been with limits. And again, predominantly West Coast. But what we see strong -- strong growth in that sector and fully expect them to bounce back.
Anthony Powell: Got it. Thanks. and how much of the strong leasing demand has been driven by retailers trying to expand their last-mile distribution capabilities? We've heard some of your peers talk about that and it seems like a pretty strong secular tailwind for the industry. So what are you seeing on that front?
Lisa Palmer: Let's rewind back to pre-pandemic. You would have heard us speaking about retail headwinds, and -- but that we were confident that retailers placed a very high value on the right real estate, on the right bricks-and-mortar locations. And that the -- if you're on the -- if you are in the right trade area and the right market, retailers would be willing to essentially pay full market rents for that real estate. And that, I would say, is what's happened over the past 20 months with the disruption -- with the hyper accelerated digital commerce, that's only been validated even further that it is really important to be close to consumers homes in quality real estate. I do believe that there has been an increase in demand, maybe a little bit pent up as people were were a little cautious as to how the pandemic would play out. But now with hindsight being 2020, the retailers have even more confidence in the importance of being close to the consumer because they do need to be more intentional about last-mile distribution. And the quality of that real estate matters. And I think that there is no question. That is what is driving increased healthy demand to Regency shopping centers.
Anthony Powell: All right. Thank you.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Linda Tsai : Hi. At this point in the cycle would you consider slightly higher leverage to generate higher returns given your low leverage, the positive retailer environment, and access to capital?
Mike Mas: It's a great question, Linda. We want to operate where we are. We want to operate in the band of 5 to 5.5. We're in the low 5 times area now. Let me just make a point that we use on a -- we used to have 12-months, the $46 million of prior period collections is in that number. It's worth about a quarter return, not material. So we're still in a very healthily in the band. But this is a big point for us moving forward on our growth trajectory. We have -- with our free cash flow and our Balance Sheet position, we're going to have -- and growing EBITDA, recall we're at the low point of this, we're coming out, we're going to start growing EBITDA, we believe at a more accelerated rate. We're going to have the opportunity to use a little bit leverage to that free cash flow to acquire shopping centers or build shopping centers or redeveloped shopping centers to amplify and accelerate our growth rate in the near-term going forward. All while not putting our Balance Sheet at any more risk than it is today and operating within that, the low-end we think of that band where we want to be. So it's a -- we're in a -- we're perfectly positioned, we believe to remain as we said on our front foot from a growth perspective and look at opportunities across all 3 bands, acquisitions, redevelopments, and developments.
Lisa Palmer: Mike might be a little bit too humble, so I'm going to pound our chest a little bit more. And I think it's something we are really proud of. The fact that we're at 5 times, with or without prior period collections and with not -- with maintaining our dividend throughout the pandemic. So we did not cut our dividend. And in fact, if you read the press release and listen to our prepared remarks, we just raised it another 5%. Sector leading free cash flow without reducing our dividend, increasing our dividend, and still having 5 times net debt-to-EBITDA, I'm really proud of that.
Linda Tsai : That's impressive for sure. And then also, I read about OP drive-thru grocery opening its first sight in South Carolina. Our existing Brewster's considering adding drive - thrus, I realized both these is similar in concept, but do you see this as emerging trend? And is this an added benefit having this type of offering at a center?
Jim Thompson: I think maybe on the margin. Quite frankly, there are -- there have been Publix
Lisa Palmer: Publix tried it.
Jim Thompson: Has drive - thrus and they lay fallow, quite frankly. So I think if it catches on, you may see something, but I think what the other form of distribution not much sure to drive through is going to be a game changer.
Lisa Palmer: I don't know if that it's that much more effective than the curbside
Jim Thompson: Pickup is really pretty efficient effective.
Linda Tsai : Thanks.
Lisa Palmer: Thanks, Linda.
Operator: And our next question is from Wes Golladay with Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Wes Golladay: Hey, everyone. I want a quick question on the uncollected rents, huge improvement going from 10 million to 4 million in the third quarter from the second quarter, do you have any expectation that we'll come down further in 4Q and then when you guide to next year by the midpoint of next year being back 2019 levels, how do you see this $4 million number playing out?
Mike Mas: Hey, Wes, I think it ties into the comments I made at the top. It's effectively the result of that bad debt expense ratio or that uncollectible lease income rate, finishing the year at 1.7%. We're at 2.5% now, so, yes, we are anticipating that number will decline in the fourth quarter. And then I would anticipate that it would continue to decline next year. We're do -- we're moving that net effective rent-paying. I can see a, again, 200 basis points this quarter. We need to compress that to within 50 basis points of commenced occupancy, at which time we can stop talking about it. Because 50 bps spread to commence is historically average. So yes, I do anticipate that number to slowly grind down from here.
Wes Golladay: I guess maybe, building off of that comment, so you have -- would you assume all these people to stay in occupancy but just become paying [Indiscernible] attrition from this group.
Mike Mas: Yes. I think we believe around this tale that more of those will be survivors than move outs. And to Jim's point earlier, some of this is category-driven and geography-driven. Getting into West Coast, a couple of months behind, getting them back up on their feet. These uses that are more impacted than others in that geography. I think it's just a matter of time. We will have some move outs, but we don't -- we anticipate on balance more of those just converting back to rent-paying status.
Wes Golladay: Got it. Thanks for the time and look forward to catching up next week. Yeah.
Lisa Palmer: Thanks.
Operator: [Operators Instructions] Our next question is from the line of Paulina Roadhouse Smith with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.
Paulina Rojas Schmidt: Good morning. I will imagine high labor costs or lack of labor availability is accelerating retailers focus in technology to make their businesses less labor-intensive. Of all the potential disruptors ahead, and there are many, and more massive adoption of cashierless stores, farther warehouse automation, driverless cars, etc., what these think are the most relevant for you as landlord, of course? Are you keeping a closer eye on any one in particular? Of course, there is no good or wrong answer. I'm only looking for your general thoughts.
Lisa Palmer: Yeah, I appreciate the question, Paulina. We're really making sure that we are thinking about being proactive to the extent that we can be proactive whether it be with simply relationships with our retail tenants and our merchants, or whether it's what we can do internally. It's all of the above. I'm going to try to -- there's no question that the most impactful because I believe it's permanent is more of the BOPIS and the last mile distribution. And we have seen that accelerate over the past 24 months. And our retailers and our merchants, as you alluded to, are getting smarter about it and are investing more money in technology. But at the same time they also, as I just said in my prior response, they also appreciate and value that last mile distribution being close to a consumer's home. And I've said it on other calls, and if you would listen to a panel with something that I did at a conference in September, we had a target real estate representative on the panel and he said it was like 90% of their orders are fulfilled from the stores. So that is probably the thing that we think about the most to make sure that we're staying as close to in evaluating how can we take advantage of those opportunities, how can we actually play a part in that and play a role in that and partnering with our retailers. And then of course, supply chain disruption, as Jim talked about, and labor shortages are something that we hope are temporary and transitional. I think that there's probably a little bit more evidence that the labor shortage may be recovering a little bit faster. And that really does impact us and impacts our -- by impacting our tenants so far more than the supply chain has. So it's all the above and we used the terms we.re on our front foot for investments. We're on our front foot for ensuring that we're staying ahead and evolving with not just changing retailer and merchant preferences, but also changing consumer preferences. Really thinking about the next 10 to 12 years.
Paulina Rojas Schmidt: Thank you. And then another question, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, I think embedded rent lease bumps for 80% of the leases executed this quarter. Is the remaining 20% exclusively comprised by anchors or you also have flat at rent for some small shop?
Mike Mas: It's really just a kind of across-the-board split. It's not -- It's predominantly presently anchor driven. You're getting increases from that vast majority of your shops.
Paulina Rojas Schmidt: Thank you.
Mike Mas: Thank you, Paulina.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tammi Fique with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Tammi Fique: Thank you. I'm curious with the fallout from the pandemic that you experienced and the importance and cost of omnichannel. Has there been a general shifting to more national tenants across your portfolio or has the local small shop tenant as a percent of GLA or ABR remained steady versus pre -pandemic?
Mike Mas: I think the mix is really about the same as it was pre -pandemic quite frankly. I think we're roughly 20% local.
Lisa Palmer: Yes.
Mike Mas: So we haven't seen a real shift from that.
Tammi Fique: Okay thanks And then I'm curious on. On the acquisitions, what are the unlevered IRRs that you are targeting today and has that changed at all as cap rates have compressed?
Lisa Palmer: The thresholds for us are really going to come back to again as I spoke about earlier, it's going to -- it will certainly depend upon our cost of capital that we're using to fund the acquisitions. Because whatever we are acquiring and adding to our portfolio, in addition to being accretive to our future growth rate, also should be accretive to our earnings growth rate, so with that said, I mean today we can, with our cost of capital, we could make unlevered IRRs in the 6% range work. And that's been relatively consistent for quite some time now.
Tammi Fique: Great. Thank you.
Lisa Palmer: Thanks, Danny.
Operator: And we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call over to Lisa Palmer for closing remarks.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you all for your interest and participation today. Always appreciate our conversations. Look forward to talking again soon. I think next week with a lot of you. Have a great weekend.
Operator: And this concludes this conference and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-08-06 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to Regency Centers Corporation Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Christy McElroy. Thank you. You may begin.
Christy McElroy: Good morning, and welcome to Regency Centers' Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Lisa Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Mas, Chief Financial Officer; Jim Thompson, Chief Operating Officer; and Chris Leavitt, SVP and Treasurer. As a reminder, today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements about the company's views of future business and financial performance, including forward earnings guidance and future market conditions. These are based on management's current beliefs and expectations and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements we may make. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements may be included in our presentation today and are described in more detail in our filings with the SEC, specifically in our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filings. In our discussion today, we will also reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. The comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this quarter's earnings materials, which are posted on our Investor Relations website. Please note that we have also posted a presentation on our website with additional information, including additional disclosures related to forward earnings guidance and the impact of COVID-19 on the company's business. Lisa?
Lisa Palmer : Thank you, Christy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning. We are pleased to report another quarter of results reflecting strong progress toward recovery. The tide has continued to rise following the removal of most capacity restrictions across the country. Our portfolio of foot traffic is now back to at least 100% of pre-COVID levels in nearly all of our markets, and we've made meaningful progress on rent collections. Retailer demand is healthy. This is reflected in our strong leasing activity. And we're seeing fewer tenant failures and, therefore, lower move-out activity than we expected. We acknowledge that we are not completely out of the woods yet. We are all keenly aware of rising virus cases in many cities across the country as we experience another wave of the pandemic. New mask and vaccine restrictions are emerging, with the risk of perhaps even the return of capacity restrictions in some markets. But with the knowledge and experience that we and our tenants have gained over the last 1.5 years, we feel good about where we stand long term and our ability to weather additional storms. And importantly, if we do see new restrictions, we believe that, that impact will be short term. Our industry and specifically Regency's portfolio have proven its resiliency, and this is most evident in the meaningful improvement in our West Coast markets in recent months as all of our tenants were finally allowed to fully operate as the market opened up. I've said this before, and I'll say it again, the best shopping center assets will continue to thrive in the post-pandemic world. On last quarter's call, we discussed pivoting to office. We are confident in our path to recovery, and our strong balance sheet and access to low-cost capital give us a competitive advantage in developing and acquiring on an earnings and quality accretive basis. We have a really successful track record in that regard. And so with this pivot, we started our multiphase Westbard project in Bethesda, Maryland, and we expanded our existing project in Richmond, Virginia, which I might add is experiencing robust tenant demand. Looking forward, we remain encouraged and excited about additional opportunities in our pipeline. Earlier this week, we also purchased our partner's 80% share in our USAA joint venture, a great opportunity to allocate capital on an accretive basis into high-quality assets that we have known and operated for 20 years. We raised equity during the quarter through our ATM on a forward basis, funding this transaction as well as providing additional capacity for future investments. As always, we are active in pursuing and evaluating acquisition opportunities. In today's transaction market, however, we do continue to see even greater competition for deals. There's been meaningful capital formation targeting high-quality grocery-anchored neighborhood and community centers as the investment market appreciates the demonstrated performance and resiliency of these high-quality assets. So as a result and as you would expect, we've seen continued compression in cap rates for these types of assets across all of our target markets. Before I turn it over to Jim, I'd like to take just a moment to touch on something that's extremely important to Regency and to me. One of the highlights of the second quarter for us was the release of our 2020 Corporate Responsibility Report, which allows us the opportunity each year to showcase our leading ESG practices. We are proud of our accomplishments across all 4 pillars of our strategy, our people, our communities, governance and environmental stewardship. So please allow me this opportunity to share several highlights from this report and our progress over the last year. And again, these are just highlights: the development and implementation of a more robust diversity, equity and inclusion strategy; a gender pay gap that is now essentially zero; impressive philanthropic efforts by our team members in what was a really challenging personal environment as well as professional; increased tenant and community engagement during the pandemic, for which we were recently recognized by ICSC with 3 MAXI awards; further progress on Board diversity and refreshment; the introduction of an ESG metric for executive compensation; the issuance of our first TCFD report on climate change risk; and finally, outperformance in our reduction targets for greenhouse gas emissions, energy efficiency and waste diversion. Strong corporate responsibility is a foundation of our company. It's ingrained in our culture. And no doubt, it's part of what makes us great. And just as we approach all aspects of our business, we look to continue to improve and evolve our best practices over time. Jim?
Jim Thompson: Thanks, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. We remain encouraged by continued improvement in operating trends in our portfolio, including increased foot traffic, higher rent collections and strengthening leasing activity. We took another big step in our recovery during the second quarter as many more operating restrictions were lifted, providing a necessary catalyst to convert many more of our tenants back to rent paying status. While the progress and results are very rewarding, we realize it's not all clear sailing. We continue to monitor the implication of rising COVID case levels and implementation of mask and vaccine mandates in certain geographies around the country. But in contrast to earlier periods of the pandemic, vaccines are now widely available. Consumers are resuming more normal behaviors, shopping at stores, eating at restaurants and working out at fitness clubs. As of mid-July, nearly all of our 22 markets are now at or above 100% of 2019 foot traffic levels. And after nearly 1.5 years of operating in this environment, many of our tenants have learned to roll with the punches, demonstrating resiliency and creativity in adapting to an evolving normal. Moving to rent collections. We again saw improvement in all regions with Q2 and July collections both at 96% at this point. Our unresolved rent bucket continues to shrink. As tenants have been able to get back to fully operating, our teams have been successfully working to get them rent paying again. Our leased and commenced occupancy rates ticked up this quarter, reflecting reduced move-outs but also strong leasing activity, which I'll touch on. But more importantly, our net effective rent paying occupancy, which we discussed previously, is up over 150 basis points sequentially to north of 88%. We continue to believe this is the best indicator of our recovery progress. We also had another strong leasing quarter, exceeding 2019 levels on both new and renewal leasing as our teams are working tirelessly to get vacant space backfilled to accommodate the demand we are seeing. We are pleased to see great activity across all regions, including the harder hit states out west. Our leasing pipelines look healthy for the remainder of the year, with active interest from tenants in categories such as grocery, medical, restaurants, fitness, pet-related uses, off-price, health and wellness and some traditional mall retailers like home, athletic, eyewear and cosmetics. Although activity is strong, we are seeing some impact from rising material cost, labor shortages and permitting backlogs at local municipalities, all contributing to continued pressure on rent commencement timing. Our tenants are also experiencing inflationary cost pressures and staffing shortages in the normal course of operating their businesses. But we're hearing when we speak with our tenants that they are generally able to pass on many of these higher costs to consumers, especially in the trade areas that we operate in, reflected in strong sales among many of our grocery and restaurant tenants. We saw improvement in rent growth in the second quarter as well as we are making fewer short-term pandemic-related concessions to bridge our tenants. We continue to push embedded rent steps to maximize revenue and cash NOI growth over the life of the lease. And our GAAP rent spreads are back above 10% and closer to our 15% historical average levels. As our leasing activities ramp back up, we also remain focused on maintaining a prudent level of CapEx spend. Our positive momentum in leasing activity also extends to our end process, ground-up development and redevelopment projects. At our crossing Clarendon redevelopment in Arlington, Virginia, we're very excited to announce that we just signed a new lease with Lifetime. This premier health and wellness club with a co-working component will take over 100,000 square feet of the 4-story Loft building, reducing lease-up risk by bringing the project to over 90% leased from 3% a quarter ago and providing an earlier-than-expected rent commencement date. At the Abbot in Cambridge, Massachusetts, we have 4 signed leases and we've seen significant increase in office market tours now that restrictions have lifted, employees are returning to offices in Boston and students are returning to Harvard. As mentioned on our last call, in the second quarter, we started Phase 1 of our mixed-use Westbard project in Bethesda, Maryland. The first phase of this project will include a new giant-anchored 120,000 square foot podium-style retail building with structured parking and about 100 senior living units being developed in partnership with a best-in-class senior housing developer operator. Regency's net project cost for this phase will be about $37 million, net of land sale proceeds. We are seeing some modest impacts from higher construction material and labor costs, but our underwriting had cost escalations built in for that. And thus far, the impacts to our rejections have been minimal. In summary, we have a lot of good things happening. We're very encouraged by the trends we're seeing and the progress we've made, due in large part to the hard work of our management, leasing and development teams in the field. Mike?
Mike Mas : Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll begin by addressing second quarter results and then walk through the changes in our full year guidance as well as the moving parts of the JV portfolio transaction and capital raise. Second quarter NAREIT FFO was $0.99 per share, helped by several items. Uncollectible lease income was a positive $7 million in the quarter as reserves on current period billings of approximately $5 million were more than offset by the collection of 2020 reserve revenues associated with cash basis tenants of close to $12 million. You can see this breakout of our uncollectible lease income on our COVID disclosure, Page 33 of the supplemental. As you may recall, our previous full year guidance range assumed about $30 million collection of 2020 reserves during '21, while we have already exceeded that as of quarter end. We also benefited from a higher recovery rate in the second quarter following a better-than-anticipated outcome from our annual reconciliation process. We do expect our recovery rate to revert back to more normal levels going forward. Most importantly, we are seeing higher-than-expected collection rates on our cash basis tenants of 86% in the second quarter. That's up from 78% in the first. During the quarter, we raised close to $150 million of common equity through our ATM program on a forward basis at an average price of about $64.50 per share. We currently plan to settle in the third quarter roughly $85 million to fund the equity component of our recently completed USAA JV buyout and view the balance of the capital raise as capacity for future funding of investment opportunities. We can settle the remaining shares at any time before June of 2022. The buyout of our JV partner's 80% interest in the portfolio closed effective August 1. As Lisa mentioned, this was a unique opportunity to invest in high-quality assets on a leverage-neutral and earnings-accretive basis. The cap rate was about 5.5%. In addition to the partial settlement of the forward ATM, funding for the transaction includes our assumption of the partner share of mortgage debt and $13 million of promote income received upon liquidation of the JV. Turning to guidance, we point you to the detail in our earnings slide deck posted to our website. We've previously discussed the larger needle movers to our earnings. And they certainly continue to move in the right direction, resulting in another healthy increase to our full year expectations. The most meaningful change that we made was to our same-property NOI forecast, up 725 basis points at the midpoint, and we reconcile the components of these changes in our slide deck. Of this change, 225 basis points is attributable to an increase in our forecast for the collection of rent previously reserved in 2020. Our forecast for the year is now $45 million up from $30 million previously. Of the $45 million, as I mentioned earlier, we have recognized about $32 million through quarter end and have collected another $3 million in July. The other 500 basis points of the guidance increase is driven by fundamental current year improvement, supported by higher collection rates from cash basis tenants and lower move-out activity, reflecting the progress we experienced through the second quarter and raised expectations for the balance of the year. Please also note that we've added the $13 million promote income tied to the JV portfolio transaction to our NAREIT FFO forecast, which will be recognized in the third quarter. We will not include this onetime transactional income in our core operating earnings metric. While we have not yet moved any tenants back to accrual basis accounting from cash basis, we are continuing with our evaluation and expect a subset of tenants that have remained current on rent to qualify in the second half of this year. While conversions may have a positive impact on straight-line rent and NAREIT FFO, we have not yet included any of this movement into our revised guidance range. From a balance sheet perspective, we remain on very solid footing as our free cash flows continue to grow meaningfully. Benefiting from a low payout ratio without having reduced our dividend, our leverage continues on a visible path back to pre-pandemic levels. We have cash on hand, full revolver capacity, no unsecured debt maturities until 2024 and balance sheet capacity remaining from our forward equity raise to be opportunistic. As we have discussed previously, we continue to expect our recovery back to 2019 NOI levels by the end of next year on an annualized basis, primarily due to the time it takes for rent to commence on backfilling vacant space. So with every dollar of reserved rent that we are able to recover and with every tenant, we can convert back to rent paying rather than absorb the vacancy, the shallower the trough and the higher the level from which we will continue to grow.  With that, we look forward to taking your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Katy McConnell with Citi.
Katy McConnell: So first, just wondering if you can provide some more background on how the USAA transaction came about? And then how you're thinking about acquisition opportunities going forward?
Mike Mas: Katy, this is Mike. I'll start, and I think Lisa will jump in to talk about forward opportunities. The transaction was presented itself, I mean, obviously, not too long ago. USAA is really a real estate adviser. They're representing a consortium of investors. So I think what they -- and to give you a little bit of history, that JV was formed in 2009. So if you think about that buying opportunity, this was a really good opportunity for that consortium to crystallize a return. And we were able to take advantage of that.  And as with any JV, whether single asset or portfolio, the partner is likely your best first option as a buyer. And we were there ready for that. We were very happy to buy in these properties. We've owned them and operated them for 20 years now, know them extraordinarily well. They fit in very nicely with the portfolio. I'd characterize them as very consistent with our high-quality assets and very happy to move forward with that transaction.
Lisa Palmer: And just thinking about forward, and I think I'll take you back 3 months when we talked about turning the corner, because that's really when we really had the confidence. And we talked about the pivot to offense, that we had a much clearer path to continued improvement, and we continue to see that, which is great. And with that and free cash flow in excess of $100 million, the really strong balance sheet that we have, access to low cost of -- other low-cost capital, just as I said in my prepared remarks, we have a really successful track record in not just acquiring, Katy, but also developing. So using that access to capital and that low-cost capital is a competitive advantage to continue to have accretive investments going forward, and we're always looking.
Katy McConnell: Great. And then maybe on the development side, now that you've started the second phase of Carytown and the Westbard project, can you comment on how pre-leasing is going so far for the retail components? And then for Westbard, where you stand on future basis for resi as far as securing partners?
Jim Thompson : Yes, Katy, it's Jim. On Carytown I'll take that 1 first. We've had really good activity and a couple of executed leases, some names you may know, Torchy’s Taco out of Texas has migrated to North Carolina and opening days in 1 of our other centers in that marketplace, have 100 people deep. So North Carolina people like tacos as much as they like barbecues, what it appears. Also, we've got Virginia ABC Liquors executed deal. Prospects, probably the most iconic high-end jeweler in the Richmond marketplace is in dialogue with us as well as Lululemon. So that gives you a flavor of the type of tenants we're talking to there. As far as Westbard, we're very, very early, obviously. We've just started construction. We've got a ways to go. But we've had some good early dialogue with some tenants that have expressed interest. But we feel very confident that, that product is going to be very, very well received in the marketplace. As to the partners, we have continued dialogue with some folks that we've been engaged with for the last 2 years, and we're working towards finalizing agreements at this point on Phase 2.
Operator: Our next question is from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank.
Derek Johnston: So how have conversations gone with key political leaders in your markets, especially the West, given your exposure? I mean, I'm sure you guys have had them. Do you get a sense that they have learned from the shutdowns last year and are perhaps more comfortable with local retail preparedness and ability to maintain a safe environment for shoppers and tenants. Have any conversations given you greater confidence in the officials and maybe their evolved possible handling of any pandemic-related spikes? Anything you could share would be helpful.
Lisa Palmer: Yes. I don't know that I can speak to what political leaders may or may not do because that could change even regardless of what they say. I think, but just the confidence in what we have seen in terms of when markets are open and how our tenants, our retailers, our service providers are still operating safely, even when there were restrictions, when there were more protocols, if you will, that I do believe that, that has given the confidence to the tenants who have really big voices in their local communities as well, speaking to their -- to the local leaders and the political leaders. It's not just the shopping center owners that are speaking. It's their real constituents that own businesses, operate businesses and live in the communities that have the loud voices. And I think that's what they're really hearing. So we do have confidence that -- and I mentioned this in my prepared remarks. Even if we do see increased restrictions from masking or vaccine restrictions or even potentially some new capacity restrictions, the better operators have learned, they've adapted. And we believe that we're going to continue to see improvement as we go forward.
Derek Johnston: Can we just, Mike, maybe run through the reserve collection assumption embedded in guidance a little bit. I believe you collected $32 million versus $30 million we were previously expecting year-to-date. And then the positive change to $45 million in recoveries throughout the second half. It indicates a run rate of around $6.5 million per quarter in the second half. Should we anticipate a higher collection rate in 3Q for modeling versus 4Q? Or should we kind of just balance it out in the second half of the year? And clearly, it seems like there's an opportunity to hopefully surpass the $45 million level? Any color is welcome.
Mike Mas: Yes. I appreciate it, Derek. And I'm going to do the best I can, but it's very difficult to predict the timing of those collections. And we did offer the $3 million in July. So at least we have that kind of larger pop that everyone can put into their models. But I think beyond that, my advice would be to kind of consider it on a straight-line basis as we finish out the year. We do obviously feel confident in that $45 million midpoint number. It can move around within the range. We could collect a little bit more. We may collect a little bit less. It is an unpredictable -- it is a challenging number, obviously, to get our arms around given the changes we had throughout the year.  As I think about the same property range, just to bring it up a little bit and maybe these bookends will be helpful for everyone, is we -- the midpoint of the range is essentially assuming that, that net effective rent paying occupancy level, which we described as about 88% today, just continues to grind higher through the balance of the year. So said another way, cash basis tenants, we are anticipating a slow northward trajectory on their collection rates. They're at 86% today. That's 20% higher than they were coming into the year in January. So we've had a remarkable level of increase there.  I said this on last quarter's call, I just reiterate it. If you -- to think about that range, 1% collection rate on our cash basis tenants is worth about $3 million on a full year basis of income. So that can also help us -- help everyone think about the tolerances in the range. And I think with that book end of the 1% equals $3 million, I think with the $45 million of which all but $10 million has been accounted for and collected at this point in time, I think with those 2 pieces, we're just trying to be as transparent as possible. That will help everyone think about that full year range that we've offered.
Operator: Our next question is from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America.
Craig Schmidt: I know you've been touching on external growth and its acceleration. But with acquisitions, you have the lower, more competitive cap rates. With redevelopments, you have higher construction cost, labor and material. I'm just wondering which of those levers is the most appealing in terms of driving external growth, acquisitions or redevelopment?
Lisa Palmer: We need an end, Craig, because I'd love to say all of the above. We've always said this that very consistently that if you make me choose, clearly, I'm going to choose the one that has the higher returns. And so the best use of our capital is on redevelopment and investing back into assets that we know and we are able to -- that we've owned and operated for quite some time and get really accretive returns.  But with that said, I do -- I like the end word, and I'd like to be able to say that we can do all. To the extent that we can leverage our platform, our knowledge in the markets and our low cost of capital and add to our portfolio base high-quality assets that are accretive to our quality and accretive to earnings that allows us to then further grow our cash flows and further grow NOI, I'd like to do it all.
Craig Schmidt: And then just looking at the percent leased at Costa Verde at 66%, I assume that retailers are interested in redevelopment/development and pursuing those as new location opportunities?
Lisa Palmer: Yes. I mean Jim can add some color if he'd like, but Costa Verde is an exceptional location and real estate asset. And the fact that we have the ability to add as much value as we're going to add there really speaks to that and validates that. There will be -- when we do commence the full redevelopment, there already is and will continue to be a tremendous amount of demand for the retail space there.
Craig Schmidt: Great. And then one last question. I don't know if it's mix related, but I'm wondering why the new leasing spreads on new leases is flat in 2Q '21.
Jim Thompson : Craig, it did have a little bit to do with mix. We had a heavier than normal mix of shops versus anchors this quarter. But importantly, I think I'd like to stress, the trend line is -- for spreads is really moving in the right direction, as are all our operating metrics. Our philosophy on prudent CapEx spend certainly impacts this metric. And having said that, I'd say our CapEx as a percent of total NOI tends to be at the lower end of the peer group, which does allow us to maximize free cash flow. As we sit there and look at our business and try to make asset management decisions, we look at total rent. And total rent includes, obviously, these initial spreads, embedded rent steps which we continue to be very successful in achieving, growing expense recoveries which we, I think, do very well year in, year out and continue to lease up our space back to historic levels. I think in combination, all those actions are going to result in the larger objective of creating sustainable NOI and earnings growth in the long run.
Operator: Our next question is from Greg McGinniss with Deutsche Bank.
Greg McGinniss: Me, I guess, Scotiabank. So you've shown a sequential lease, occupancy growth, accelerating leasing volumes. What are some of the tailwinds and maybe headwinds to tenant retention and demand? And how should we think about the cadence of potential recovery in economic occupancy or the net effective rent paying occupancy, I guess?
Mike Mas: I'll start with our goalposts, which we did reference on the call. But we continue to see a return or a recovery to 2019 levels of net operating income in the -- on an annualized basis, sometime, I'd say, back half to the end of 2022. We're very hopeful, Greg. I mean we're working hard to pull that forward. But one of the challenges there, if it is a headwind or it's just a threshold issue is, we lost about 200 basis points of occupancy as a result of the pandemic. We need -- and we are making progress leasing that up, but that does take time. And it's pretty visible to see how much time that takes to lease, to build out, to commence rent. So that -- to bring that forward meaningfully is more challenging, but we are working as hard as we can to do that.  Maybe Jim can talk a little bit about some of the headwinds that he sees from the operator side in the leasing activity.
Jim Thompson : Yes, Greg, before I go on the headwinds, I think I would like to touch back on the activity we're seeing today is very strong across all regions. I think when I look at the pipeline and look forward, it continues to be robust. So I think from a tailwind standpoint, I think the leasing opportunity is in front of us, and we're going to take advantage of it. As Mike indicated, we've got more vacancy than we've had historically. So I think we've got product, we've got demand, and we're going to make those 2 things turn into rent-paying occupancy.  Headwinds, obviously, are what we've talked about. I think there's labor issues, there's pricing, supply chain issues. How those shake out, we don't know. I will say today, the tenants, the retailers are dealing with that. A lot of them are able to pass through those costs to consumers at this point. So it really feels like things are blowing our way right now. They're headwinds, and we're watching them, but they're not stopping progress.
Lisa Palmer: I think that's the best way to think about it. If you think about -- we had -- headwinds were far greater than tailwinds in 2020, and it has flipped. And the tailwinds are clearly stronger than any headwinds that we're facing right now.
Greg McGinniss: So maybe to dig into that a little bit more, and I appreciate the color. So our tenant watch list analysis highlights a much improved environment compared to the last few years. I'm just curious what is your view on that, how has your watch list exposure improved over the last 18 months? And what are you still viewing as maybe some of the higher-risk tenants or industries?
Mike Mas: Let me start with the watch list, Greg. I think our view would mirror yours. And as we look back at our watch list over years and consecutive quarters, it's meaningfully improved much by subtraction, right? So we've had a lot of tenants who have kind of worked through the system and have filed bankruptcy and moved out of our centers and we are finding opportunities to re-lease those spaces. Those that have remained, many of them have improved their credit quality, whether through operations, where this pandemic may have been a tailwind for certain necessity-based retailers and essential retailers or through access to capital markets, whether privately or publicly. There's been a lot of just improvement from a credit quality perspective there. So our view is much like yours, a much different landscape and an improved landscape. Jim, anything on the --
Jim Thompson : Not really. You hit it on the head, Mike.
Operator: Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets.
Juan Sanabria: Just hoping if we could talk a little bit about just market rents and how those have trended for, I guess, both the anchor and small shop space just generically across your portfolio, and whether or not rents are truly in fact, rising? And if so, if you've seen any degradation in maybe inferior space as people look to improve the quality of where they're located and the stronger, getting stronger. But just curious on what the actual market rent growth has been maybe over the last 6 months or relative to 2019.
Jim Thompson : Well, I would -- I guess I would tell you that from my seat, it appears market rents are really pretty steady from what we've seen before, pre-pandemic. Strong centers attract good retailers and good retailers want to be next to other good retailers. So it's a system we're used to thriving in. We're, as I said a minute ago, we've got more space than we've had before, and that is generating a lot of interest and activity from retailers who want to be in our product type. But to answer your question simply, I think market rates are what we were used to seeing pre-pandemic in general.
Juan Sanabria: Okay. Great. And then just on the joint ventures, any other opportunities with existing partners to buy out their interest in over the next 12, 18 months? Or any funds maturing or things like that where you could have some goalposts that are -- you can see that you could maybe convert on?
Mike Mas: Juan, all the ventures are long lived, so there's no finite lives to any of them. So there's nothing kind of contractually that would bring an opportunity to the horizon. As we mentioned, this was a unique opportunity with a particular joint venture and a group of owners. That could change from our other JV partners going forward. But at this point in time, they are all very well committed to the space. They enjoy their allocation to grocery-anchored retail. Their portfolios are performing well, very consistent quality to Regency's overall quality. So we're there, and we could be there as a potential buyer as we have with USAA. But it's going to take a willing seller at this point. We don't have that right now.
Lisa Palmer: And I think that, that's really probably one of the most important points that if they do become a willing seller, we have the capacity and the ability to act.
Operator: Our next question comes from Richard Hill with Morgan Stanley.
Ron Kamdem: You got Ron Kamdem on for Richard Hill. Congrats on a quarter. Two quick ones. Just on the foot traffic, impressive recovery back to pre-COVID levels. Just curious, is there any discernible change in spending patterns? Are people spending more? Is it a different demographic base? Just sort of any -- curious if you've seen anything different on the spending path and intentions from now versus pre-COVID?
Jim Thompson : I think initially, what we were seeing were bigger -- fewer baskets but bigger baskets. So people were, as I've described, they were probably trying to come less often but buying equal or greater. I think my impression is that is leveling out to kind of -- the foot traffic obviously is coming back, so I think the basket size is likely coming down slightly. But when you look at the sales of grocers and when we listen to all the teams report quarterly activity, the number of restaurants that across the country were really generating significant increases above 2019 levels during this summer. It was impressive. So it clearly, to me, anyway, indicated that the traffic is coming back. And they're not just showing up and walking through the center, they're buying. So we're pretty happy with what we're seeing.
Ron Kamdem: Great. And then my second question was just going to the guidance change. I think the commentary from the cash basis tenants is pretty clear. But just a little bit more, Carl, on the lower move-out activity sort of -- What did you see in the first half of the year? And maybe what are you assuming in the second half? And how does that compare to a normalized year?
Mike Mas: I'm going to limit my comments to net effective rent paying occupancy, Ron. Really, we don't see a better measure for '21 performance than that. And the reality is because of the uncollectible leasing component, so the inverse of our collection rate, that's the biggest needle mover in the numbers. At the same time, we were gratified to see higher levels of leasing activity and forecasted lower levels of move-outs. So that's going to speak more to our belief that we will continue to grow into '22 and beyond. But from a -- giving guidance on where we're in from a percent lease perspective, I think we're going to limit it to just net effective rent paying occupancy. Today its 88% or so. We think that will continue to grind higher through the balance of the year.
Operator: Our next question is from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.
Mike Mueller: Yes. Your development, redevelopment pipeline is very heavily skewed towards redevelopment. I'm just curious, is there a shadow pipeline of new opportunities that we could see start off over the next few years?
Jim Thompson : Yes, Mike, absolutely. As the world recovers, there is an appetite from the grocery sector for growth. We're certainly in tune with that and working hard to locate sites. Our shadow pipeline is building, in my opinion, nicely. And we're talking to the type of traditionals and groceries that we are historically used to doing business within our portfolio. So yes, we feel pretty good about what we're seeing out there from an activity standpoint.
Lisa Palmer: And Mike, you've heard us speak to that before, right? Development is not a switch, you don't turn it on and off. And even throughout 2020, while we may have paused spending, we did not pause advancing the ball on projects we are already working on. And the team was working really diligently to ensure that we continue to move those forward. So we do expect that you'll continue to see that shadow pipeline convert to a real in-progress pipeline.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies.
Linda Tsai: Given consolidation in the shopping center space, does having 2 larger peers in the space change the competitive landscape? Like maybe in terms of acquisitions or conversations with tenants from a leasing standpoint?
Lisa Palmer: I'll hit from the competition from acquisitions, and I'll let Jim touch on leasing. I don't believe that it does. And the acquisition landscape has always been competitive regardless of the size of those competitors. I mean, there are times depending upon which market that you're -- that we're looking in, we could be going up against some of our larger public peers or we can certainly be going up against smaller, and then also private capital as well. The competition is really coming, and the capital for investing in high-quality grocery-anchored shopping centers is really coming from many sources, small, large, private, public. And from a leasing --
Jim Thompson : From a leasing standpoint, I'd…
Lisa Palmer: The quality of the asset…
Jim Thompson : The quality of the asset, it really does get down to the individual asset. And so I don't think the competitive set changes, quite frankly, from an owner's perspective.
Linda Tsai: And then, Mike, relative to your comments about cash basis going back to accrual, potentially benefiting the second half of '21 but not being factored in estimates in your forecast, what's the best way to think about the magnitude of the potential benefit? Is it like a couple of pennies or a far greater slug like the benefit, cash basis tenants helping 2Q?
Mike Mas: Linda, I appreciate the question, believe me, and -- it's unfortunate that we're in this position of the accounting requirements, and it is providing volatility and potential for volatility in our FFO guidance and forward-looking. But I can't -- it's equally hard for me to give you an estimate there.  The best we can do is be as transparent as possible, which includes really 2 things. One, is likely that some tenants will flip back to accrual accounting this year. And as I talked about last quarter and then this, there's about 13% of our ABR that's current on rent -- that is currently classified as cash basis tenants. So that would be an indicator of how large that potential population could be. And I'm not saying that all of those will flip in because we are setting pretty high thresholds and standards before we will convert a tenant from cash basis to accrual.  And then lastly, let me just add, this is why we continue to report on and use core operating earnings as an earnings metric. We are eliminating the impact of the noncash. This is how we're running our business. This is how we talk about making decisions internally. This is what we've talked to our Board about. We continue to believe that, that is the best operating metric to keep a finger on the pulse of our success.
Operator: Our next question is from Wes Golladay with Baird.
WesGolladay: Can you talk about the series you sold this quarter? Did you get credit for the entitlements you had in place? Or was this something you were still entitling?
Lisa Palmer: Thank you. Hancock.
Jim Thompson : Hancock. I'm sorry. Yes. We were going down the path early on, on the Sears building, we determined that the alternative use other than retail was probably higher and better use. So we absolutely did go down the path of entitling for office. And that's the direction we were headed. We ended up engaging with an office/medical user, which really wanted to be an owner versus a lessee. So that was the pivot we made. We're looking to transform that asset into the highest and best value we could, and we determined that selling to this end user was the best way for us. The good thing is they're still a neighbor. They're going to be generating high daytime pop traffic for us or our soon-to-be redeveloped HEB expanded store. And so it's very good win-win for us. We sold an asset to a great operator, and they're going to be a terrific neighbor.
Wes Golladay: Got it. And then you mentioned more capital coming into the space, looking at shopping centers. Would you look to do more joint ventures or more with your existing partners on the acquisition front?
Lisa Palmer: I mean, we've always spoken about our joint ventures in -- joint ventures will serve the purpose of access to capital, which knock on wood, we don't need right now from them. Or access to expertise, there could perhaps be some scenario where that's the case, but also that's probably also unlikely. More of the opportunity will come in when it's actually access to properties or access to actual opportunities. And so to the extent that a joint venture partner allows us to have access to an opportunity that we may not otherwise have, then absolutely, we would entertain it. And that's how we think about it.
Operator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Lisa Palmer for closing comments.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you all for joining us on a Friday. I appreciate your time, and I also do want to just give a quick shout out to the Regency team. And thank you for a great quarter and great results. And everyone, have a nice weekend.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-05-07 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to Regency Centers Corporation First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Christy McElroy, please. Thank you. You may begin.
Christy McElroy: Good morning, and welcome to Regency Centers' first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Lisa Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Mas, Chief Financial Officer; Jim Thompson, Chief Operating Officer; and Chris Leavitt, SVP and Treasurer. As a reminder, today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements about the company's views, future business, and financial performance including forward earnings guidance and future market condition. These are based on management's current belief and expectations and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements we may make. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements may be included in our presentation today and are descried in more detail in our filings with the SEC, specifically in our most recent 10-K. In our discussion today we will also reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, the comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this quarter's earnings materials, which are posted on our Investor Relations website. Please note that we have also posted a presentation on our website with additional information including additional disclosures related to forward earnings guidance and the impact of COVID-19 on the company's business. Lisa?
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Christy, and good morning everyone. Thank you so much for joining us at the end of what I know has been a long week in earnings season. It's also been a long and oftentimes difficult past year. But as a company and an industry, we've really come so far. First, as always, I'd like to thank the entire team here at Regency. I'm really proud and an appreciative of what we've been able to accomplish over the last year. A quarter ago, when we spoke to you, we were facing rising restrictions in parts of the country, contributing to continued uncertainty about the future. We are gaining ground, but still playing defense. As I sit here today, I'm really pleased to report that we've turned the corner over the last three months. We are encouraged by continued improvement in the retail environment and in the health of our tenants. And you can see the evidence of that in our first quarter results, as well as in our revised forward earnings guidance. We've seen a continued trend towards easing tenant restrictions, which is especially impactful for our California properties. Some categories and geographies still continue to lag. But overall, we are on an improving trajectory. These lifting restrictions that allow our tenants to open and operate are having the waterfall effect of improving foot traffic and tenant sales, as consumers are re-engaging when they're able to. And in turn, we are collecting more rents and have seen an improving trend of rent collection. Michael will discuss this in greater detail, but the main drivers of our earnings guidance increase results from this improvement. We expect higher collections on cash basis tenant, as well as some additional recovery of 2020 rent that we had previously reserved. And we're also encouraged by continued demand with regards to leasing. Thinking a bit longer-term, we believe there are clear tailwinds for our company and our sector as the pandemic has shined a spotlight on our business in a positive way. As we all have experienced the world with e-commerce, retail sales spiking meaningfully, our tenants will clearly see and appreciate the value of the last mile distribution capabilities that their stores in our centers offer. And after spending months at home facing restrictions on interactions, consumers have a new appreciation for the environment and convenience of our open-air and neighborhood and community centers. But all that said, our heads aren't here in the Jacksonville tents, we acknowledge and appreciate that real challenges in brick-and-mortar retail still exists, and that will continue to be shrinking of retail GLA in the U.S. But well located, well operated centers, like we own will still be a critical component of the retail ecosystem, meeting the demands of retailers, service providers and consumers. This renewed appreciation from both sides fortifies the long-term needs for physical locations close to consumers home. And then, also the micro migration that's occurring with more people moving into the suburbs this should provide a long-term benefit to our suburban shopping center portfolio. As should a more permanent shift towards part time, remote work, increasing daytime population foot traffic close to the consumers' homes. Finally, as the macro-economic and retail environment has shifted toward a definitive trajectory of improvement. As a company we have pivoted from defense to offense. We are on our front foot. We're focusing on growth, not just organically but putting capitals to work externally. We are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities. We continue to have one of the best balance sheets in the sector with low leverage, over revolver capacity and access to low cost capital. Additionally, as you know, I'd like to remind you, even with no reduction in our dividend throughout the pandemic, we are generating solid free cash flow, which we expect will only continue to grow with our revised outlook. From this position of strength, we continue to focus on value creation within our development and redevelopment pipeline. Recall that we added two new ground up projects to our in-process pipeline a quarter ago, and in the near future, we expect to add a couple more. With the success we've seen with phase 1 of Carytown, we plan to move forward with phase 2. We also plan to move our mixed use multi-phase Westbard project in Bethesda, Maryland into the in-process pipeline. To finish up, we are still on the recovery path back to our 2019 NOI. But the pace on that path feels better. The environment is healthier and more certain today. And as a result, we have greater conviction and are more positive in our outlook. We are pivoting to office. We remain bullish on open-air grocery anchored neighborhood and community centers. As I've heard several times over the past month or so, today is better than yesterday. And I'm confident that tomorrow will be better than today. Jim?
Jim Thompson: Thanks, Lisa, and good morning everyone. I echo Lisa's comments and thank our Regency team for the successes we've been able to achieve during this difficult period. When the vaccine news was first announced last November, we began to see a light at the end of the tunnel in regards to the pandemic. As we sit here today, the tunnel is shorter, and the light is getting brighter. We're not completely out of the woods yet. Governmental capacity restrictions remain in some of our markets, particularly on the West Coast. And just last week, we saw rollbacks. Rollbacks announced in Oregon and Washington in response to increasing levels of cases. But overall, we're moving in the right direction. As stay-at-home orders and restrictions have been lifting on the West Coast in recent months, we're seeing that translate into higher foot traffic and rent collection. This is similar to what we saw during 2020 in other markets across the country as they reopened. Speaking of foot traffic as evidenced in the chart on Page 4 of our slide deck, foot traffic on our portfolio as a whole has recovered to 90% of 2019 levels in April, while in some regions it's close to 100%. Rent collections on current period billings have continued to improve at 93% in the first quarter and 94% for April. The West Region still lags on foot traffic and collections, but is gradually catching up to the other regions and remains our greatest opportunity to drive future upside. As we've discussed on prior calls, we've taken a patient approach with deferral agreements, not pushing tenants into an agreement until they are open and operating. And that strategy has proved to be the right one financially, and created a lot of goodwill with our retailers. Our goal is and always has been to get our tenants back to rent paying status, and to avoid space turning into vacancy, which leads to downtime and capital leases back up. As I've stated in the past, we liked our merchandising and tenant mix pre-pandemic and working with these savvy operators is the best and quickest way to get their spaces stabilized and generating revenue again at or near pandemic level -- pre-pandemic levels. Turning to leasing, we're encouraged by the solid interest and activity that we're seeing. Active new leasing categories include grocers, medical, QSRs, health and beauty, fast food, home improvement, fitness, and personal services. We've also seen increased interest from traditional mall tenants moving to the open-air formats, including home concepts, especially athletic retailers, eyewear, and cosmetic retailers. Our new leasing volume in the first quarter was higher compared to Q1 2020, and in fact was the highest first quarter new leasing volume we've seen in the last five years, due to greater economic optimism, as well as some likely pent-up demand from 2020. Renewal leasing volumes have remained consistent throughout the pandemic. So the first quarter pace was also ahead of historical trends for both shop and acre space. Our leasing pipeline is healthy. And we're seeing this growth in retailer activity across all regions, providing confidence in the sustainability of deal volume. Our recent spreads remained muted, a function of the current environment and the mix of leases we're signing today. We've continued to have success pushing rents higher on a central tenant and QSRs, but we're also making certain shorter-term concessions for non-essential tenants and table service restaurants to help bridge them through this more difficult period, putting pressure on our initial cash spreads. We don't see this the long-term reflective of the direction of market rents. Our properties have always been able to command market leading rents over time, and we don't see this changing. Additionally, the strong embedded contractual rent growth that we've consistently achieved over the last several years generally brings our tenants rents closer to market ahead of lease expiration, compressing those initial spreads. Encouragingly, we're still having a lot of success negotiating rents depths in our leases consistent with historical averages. Lastly, on occupancy, our commensurate is down 30 basis points sequentially. We normally see the seasonal occupancy decline in the first quarter, but move out or actually lower than we anticipated. Some of the tenant fallout that we had expected may still occur in coming quarters, but more tenants also renewed their leases than we expected. In summary, while this past year has been one of the most difficult and challenging in my career, it has also been incredibly rewarding to see our team rise to the challenge and successfully navigate this unique environment. We're on a definite road to recovery, and our visibility and conviction levels have only improved as country continues to open back up. Mike?
Mike Mas: Thanks, Jim. Good morning, and Happy Friday, everyone. I'll begin by addressing first quarter results, and then walk through the changes in our full year guidance. First quarter NAREIT FFO was $0.90 per share, uncollectible lease income was positive in the quarter, as reserves on current quarter billings of approximately $18 million were more than offset by the collection of over $20 million of prior period reserved revenues from cash basis tenants. Including those contractually defer, you can see the breakout of our uncollectable lease income on our COVID disclosure Page 32 of the supplemental, which also shows that excluding prior period collections, we recognize as revenue 94% of our first quarter billings. Our cash basis tenant pool stands at 28% of ADR today. That compares to 29% a quarter ago, slightly lower due to move-out activity. We've not yet moved any tenants back to accrual basis accounting from cash basis at this stage of our recovery. Our same property commenced occupancy rates declined 30 basis points sequentially. But more importantly, as we were able to collect more from our cash basis tenants, our net effective rent paying occupancy, which we've spoken about on previous calls was actually up over 50 basis points through the first quarter. Same property NOI excluding lease termination fees declined 1.6% in the first quarter compared to prior year. As a reminder, the first quarter of 2021 is the last quarter that we will be up against the more difficult pre-COVID comparisons. Our balance sheet remains in great shape. As mentioned the quarter ago in mid-January, we used cash on hand to pay down a term loan. And in early February, we recast our $1.25 billion line of credit, extending our term by another four years. We finished the quarter with a more normal cash balance and full revolver capacity, and have no meaningful unsecured debt maturities until 2024. The secured mortgage lending markets, which were tough last year for retail in general have continued to open back up and show demand for high quality grocery anchored shopping centers, especially those owned have stronger sponsors. Subsequent to quarter end, we closed on a $200 million refinancing of a portfolio of secured mortgage loans on 10 assets held in one of our JVs. The blended rate was a very compelling 2.9%. From a leverage perspective, our net debt to EBITDA remained at a very comfortable 5.9 times, even with the impacts of the pandemic on our trailing earnings. As we -- and we see a clear path back to the low-to-mid 5 times range as our NOI continues to recover. Turning to guidance. We point you to Pages 13 through 16 of our earnings investor presentation. Recall that a quarter ago amid continued rollbacks and restrictions in certain markets, and general uncertainty in the overall environment, we provided our earnings guidance under three distinct macroeconomic scenarios: reverse course, status quo, and continued improvement. From a macro perspective, we now feel comfortable and confident that we are firmly in a continued improvement environment. And as such, we feel that we can comfortably rule out the first two scenarios from our guidance analysis, which supported the lower and midpoint levels of our previous range. We are moving to a more traditional guidance framework around that more positive outlook with a narrower range. There are three additional major drivers that bridges from our previous upper end of $3.14 per share for NAREIT FFO to a new range of $3.33 to $3.43 per share. The first two drivers directly impact same-property NOI and I’ll refer you to the visual on Slide 15 of the presentation to help articulate the change. The first is higher collections of prior period reserve revenue. When we provided guidance back in February, we had already collected almost $9 million prior period revenues. As such, this amount was included in our previous guidance range, impacting our full year same-property NOI growth forecast by about 125 basis points. Our new guidance range now reflects an impact from prior period collections of about 425 basis points at the midpoint, of which we’ve already collected about 80% as through April. The remaining 20% is forecast to be collected through the balance of the year. Secondly, we now expect a higher collection rate on current year billings from cash basis tenants. In other words, the conversion of more cash basis tenants from non-rent payment to rent paying. We saw our cash basis collection rate rise from January through April and roughly a third of our cash basis tenants are now current on rent, that's up from about 15% a quarter ago. This gives us added confidence in higher collection forecasts on current period going. The third major driver is a reduction in G&A forecast, which we have guided lower for the full-year by approximately $5 million at the midpoint. With greater certainty, and firmer timing around the start at Westbard and the second phase at Carytown, we now expect higher overhead capitalization. Additionally, we've incorporated savings from the first quarter departure of Mac Chandler, a large portion of which was one-time in nature resulting from unwind previously expensed share variance. To wrap it up, we are greatly encouraged by our first quarter results, and are pleased to be revising our outlook higher today. As we believe we've gained more visibility into the economic environment and the recovery of our cash flows. As we look ahead, our priorities continue to be first, converting non-paying cash basis tenants back to rent paying; second, backfilling space loss of vacancy; third, returning leverage to pre-pandemic levels through organic growth; and fourth, shifting back to an opportunistic mindset from a capital allocation perspective. And with that, we'd be happy to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Katy McConnell with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Katy McConnell: Great, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Can you talk a little bit more about how cash basis collection levels trended this quarter and what's driving the improvement over 4Q? And then for the outstanding balance, how much more upside are you assuming in collections as opposed to potential occupancy fallout?
Mike Mas: Hey Katy, it's Mike. I'll take that one. Appreciate the question. Maybe just -- let me color up some stats around on our cash basis pool on a collection rate. I think that'll get you where you need to go. So for the first quarter of 2021, we've collected 78% of rents from our cash basis tenants. That is up from 75% a quarter ago. Interestingly, recast the fourth quarter, we have now collected 79%, so kind of flat. What's most interesting to us and what's driving a lot of improvement our guidance range is the trajectory in the current year. So let me just throw these as sequentially month-over-month. January cash pool 67% to February 73%, to March 77%, and in April, we're at 81%. So this -- it's this reality and the numbers that's not necessarily presenting itself in the Q1 report in the numbers, but it's what's giving us the confidence to increase our cash collection rate going forward. It's really that March and April success as compared to January and February. And last time, we spoke to everyone, early February; it was -- it wasn't the time for darker than they are today. We were experiencing more rollbacks on the West Coast, all of that has changed. And it's that the March and April performance that's given us the confidence to move our numbers forward. As you think about our range on a same-property basis, it's really about uncollectible lease income more than it is about move-out activity. When you think about the fungibility of those two numbers, we can have move-outs, but it's already incorporated into our uncollectible lease income projections. So for us, we'd like to talk about net effective rent pay and occupancy. Right now we're in the mid, 86%, 87% range. And as I mentioned on the prepared remarks, that's up 50 basis points sequentially in the first quarter. So for us, we think from a net effective perspective, we've troughed in our occupancy rate, and we're starting to move forward we're converting tenants to cash basis from non-rent paying status. And that is again the tailwind behind that improvement. As you think about the ends of the ranges, basically, the midpoint is we'll call for gradual improvement through the year from the first quarter. And then more or higher rates of collection on cash basis tenants supporting the upper end and lower percentage of cash basis as paying us on the bottom end. Just a little nugget, which I find helpful and I think you will, 1% collection rate on cash basis tenants is about $3 million of total revenues to Regency. So when you think about the range of our same-property growth that's roughly $10 million up or down from the midpoint. So that that'll help you frame out that. Within our guidance range, we don't have to get to 100% collection to hit the upper end of our range. It's about a roughly a 3% tolerance on either end. So I threw a lot at you Katy. I hope that's helpful. If you have any follow-ups, I'd be happy to take them.
Katy McConnell: That's really helpful. Thanks so much for all that detail. And then just to switch topics given the outperformance in your shares year-to-date, what's your appetite to issue equity at this point? And is there anything embedded in guidance for that?
Lisa Palmer: Katy, it's Lisa. I'll take that. We do not have anything embedded in guidance for an equity raise. We view equity, it's a -- it is a capital source to fund our growth. And to the extent that we are able to issue equity and put it to work accretively on a long-term earnings basis -- long-term earnings growth basis, we will do that. And I think we have a really great track record in doing so. So it's tied to opportunities. And opportunities, compelling opportunities, acquisition, free cash flow, still funding, our development pipeline, so always an arrow in the quiver, and one that we will use when we can use it accretively.
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Craig Schmidt: Great, thank you. As the country continues to open up, are you seeing more curbside BOPIS activity the same or less?
Jim Thompson: Craig, this is Jim. I'll take that. As you'd expect, we're seeing a lot more actually. In interesting anecdote, if you talk to -- as I talked to Kroger, they indicated their click and collect program is 4x of historical. We're seeing all the major brands look at some form of BOPIS for collection arrangement. So it's clearly here to stay, I think it's an additional leg of getting product to the consumer, driving traffic at the store is still obviously getting people in the store is the best method for a grocer. But second best is being able to have it picked up or delivered to the car at curbside. So I think it's definitely a trend that's here to stay.
Lisa Palmer: And we like that Craig, right. I mean any additional traffic into our centers will benefit us. It's more eyes on our shop space. They may be different trips. But it still becomes the shopping center of choice and where the consumers that are close to their homes, look to go to when they need something right, whether it's goods, services, or food. We think that it really is a benefit to our shopping centers. And we like that we are in close proximity to people's home.
Craig Schmidt: No, I agree. I see the benefit and thanks for the early confirmation that it is here to stay. I guess my follow-up question would be, what are the retailer's appetite for opening a new developments, and particularly beyond the grocers.
Jim Thompson: Jim again. I'll -- we're seeing as evidenced by our Q1 leasing, real strong activity out there. The 266,000 feet we did a new leasing in Q1 is highest in five years as indicated in the prepared remarks. Our pipelines are strong. Mike mentioned Cary, Phase 2 -- Carytown Phase 2. That's a current development that were 85% leased on Phase 1 took a pause during the pandemic and have very good pre-leasing and appetite for space. We're obviously diving into Phase 2 to get that product online. So we are seeing good activity in new leasing as well as existing portfolio.
Lisa Palmer: And really focused on continuing to build that development pipeline so that we can get back to kind of pre-COVID levels in terms of our starts and spend on an annual basis.
Operator: Our next question is from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
Derek Johnston: Hi, everybody. Good morning. Are you seeing changes in the lease structures given the pandemic, any changes like co-tenancy clauses? Anything related to the methodology for assessing percentage rent, especially since it seems hard to capture in omni channel sales? And the dedicated parking that you discussed for clicking collect is that an opportunity to push rents a bit?
Jim Thompson: Derek, good question, and I guess the short answer on changes to lease structure is not on the margin, but really no -- no real change. I think the one thing we are seeing from a leasing standpoint is the time from negotiation to RCD. I think permitting is taking longer, decision trees are taking longer, but other than that front-end time extension, deal terms are generally holding. The percent rent is a tricky that used to be everybody's metric of how well a tenant is performing is based upon their sales and their ability to pay rent, et cetera. But that's become -- it's become very muddy with the internet sales. So each tenant does it differently. It's a place where data has become a really helpful tool for us to in addition to sales, compare trips to help us evaluate real volume and potential sales at least at a location. We don't do a whole lot of percent rent work, it's generally in our groceries, which is a little cleaner or has been cleaner. But now with some of the online, I'm not sure how that is going to get reported. But we just don't -- we don't have that much exposure to percentage rent, but it is a tricky, that's a tricky area, I think going forward. In dedicated parking, I think at this point, we're very accommodating to our tenants to help them distribute their product. So we're not looking at that as necessarily a rental stream impact as much as continuing to drive traffic and their ability to be as successful as they can as our anchor.
Derek Johnston: All right. Thank you. How about the Serramonte? Is it still expecting to deliver in the second half 2021 given the notal location and shutdowns, and it's a pretty large scale project? Can you give some color as to the buzz around leasing and excitement in the development?
Mike Mas: I'll start with a disclosure and let Jim talk about the project. But Derek it's a multi-phase project. It's going to -- the phases will expand over multiple years for us. So I think what we'll see is that there is some visibility to delivering on the first phase of that project, which will include the large scale investment we're making into the interior portion them all together with the new pads we're building out on the exterior replacing some defunct previous retail sites. So that will we have a lot of confidence we'll finish and deliver in 2021. But the rest -- the multi-phased approach to the project will expand over multiple years from this point forward.
Jim Thompson: Yes, as far as leasing activity today within the mall, we've just executed a real high-end quality restaurant tour. We'd get good activity with some name brand recognizable. I will call them junior anchors, but larger interior mall tenants that I think will really enhance our merchandising mix. We continue to work on opportunity with the J.C. Penney box, more to come on that, but we are getting some good traction on that anchor space. So overall, we love the real estate. It's fantastic. It's -- we're very happy, we're open for business, the tenants and the consumers are happy that we're back at it. And there is -- there's definitely a buzz as that marketplace continues to regain some consumer confidence in getting back out in the environment.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Rich Hill: Hey, good morning, guys. Congrats on the nice quarter and thanks for the transparency in your various different numbers. They're very helpful. So look, as we think about this, it seems like can it help itself is a lot better than maybe you and we feared in 2020, as evidenced by the leasing volume and the cash collections. Moreover I'm trying to get my arms around is what does that mean for a new normal environment going forward? And so set some another way, not direct trying to straight line out the accounting reversals of some of the things that maybe should have been in 2020 if we had perfect knowledge. So two questions. One is just a factual question about same-store NOI? What same-store -- what would have same-store NOI have been in 1Q ex the cash collection benefit? And then, number two, could you maybe just talk us through the leasing environment? I have -- I fully appreciate how strong the leasing was. But if you can maybe give us an idea about what the rents look like, relative to 2020 and relative to the past five years, and how those negotiations are going, I think that would be helpful.
Mike Mas: Sure. Really quickly on the impact of Q1 Rich and I'll hand it off to Jim. But prior period collections was a 950 basis point boost to our same-property growth rate in the quarter.
Rich Hill: Thank you. That's, that's really helpful.
Mike Mas: Sure.
Jim Thompson: Yes, Rich. As I indicated, I think leasing in general the terms and appetite, and types of uses, we're seeing really across the board. All of these is kind of coming back to the table, even the ones that have been impacted the most, which gives me comfort when you see the fitness and personal services folks coming back into the marketplace, when they have been the most impacted with new locations. It indicates to me that there is a place for them in the future. And there are obviously going to be failures, but there are people ready with new capital will step in those places. So overall, again, we're seeing for essential, we're seeing really good activity as well as rent growth. I think in those more non-essential and more difficult challenge spaces, we're being more creative and selective in helping those folks build back their business without as far as overall rent spreads go. As you know, we're heavily dependent on the mix between anchor and shops and anchor releasing is generally where we have our biggest impact to mark-to-market opportunities. But in this particular quarter, we had an outlier anchor deal that was quite frankly had -- was driving some negative spreads. But having said that, give you a little color on that deal, it was well capitalized fitness franchisee who was moving down from the northeast, I think because of COVID and backfill the space in South Florida that had been vacant four plus years. It was previously occupied by an education facility. But we structured a low rent start to helping build his business with a 60%, kick and bump rent bump in year three, zero landlord capital for tier [ph] white box. Long-term it's a great addition to this summer, because it's going to drive some traffic in that location. It's been vacant, like I said, for over four years. And the deal structure from our perspective is extremely appropriate for the long-term go to the center. So we really continue to maintain a very high conviction that our centers have always been able to combat market leading rents over time. And we'll see that changing. So that's kind of a long way around.
Lisa Palmer: And if I may just add just a little bit bigger picture, I think if we spoke a year ago at Mary, we talked about what the impact we thought might be. And gosh, we were really, we had very little information at that time, so much uncertainty. And I know that I spoke to many of you about, we would expect that we would see some decline in market rents. I can sit here today and say we're not seeing that. And that is because number one, we all performed so much better I think that we all feared that we may have. And it also speaks to the tailwinds in our sector. And the fact that we own quality shopping centers close to consumers' homes and in where tenants -- where our retailers and our service providers know that they're going to have highly productive stores. They are willing to pay as Jim just said those market leading rents to be in the best locations. And we're really well-positioned to capture that. And there still remains limited new supply and limited new competitive supply. What I mean by that is supply that is equal in terms of the quality of what we offer. And so I like looking forward and believe that we will continue to demand those market leading rents and grow NOI from this point forward.
Rich Hill: Yes. Hey Lisa, that's really helpful. And just one follow-up question, if you would have asked me three months ago, six months ago, certainly 12 months ago, I would have told you, I thought it was unlikely that tenants were going to be able to pay back rent and current rent. So I think that's a pretty bullish outlook for the future if they can pay double rent. So does that mean that you're getting rents that are above 1Q 2020 levels or similar to 1Q 2020 levels at this point? How should we think about that as I'm just thinking about modeling core growth?
Lisa Palmer: Yes. I'd be a little bit careful with the ability to pay double rent, because a lot of that is being driven by a lot of the stimulus that is being provided by our government. Without that I'm not certain that many tenants would be able to pay double rents, because if they weren't then we weren't charging rents high enough. And I believe that we push rents to where we can. So I would think that again, I think about that we are returning to a healthy kind of pre-COVID environment with even more support and conviction that we own the right retail. We are in the right sector in terms of part of the retail offering for where tenants want to be in for where consumers want to shop.
Rich Hill: Got it, helpful. Look, I'll reiterate, I said at the beginning, I think your disclosures best-in-class, so kudos to Christy, for making you guys do that.
Lisa Palmer: Kudos to the whole team, and thank you all, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Greg McGinnis with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.
Greg McGinnis: Hey, everyone. So Lisa, I'm going to visit my mother this weekend who lives by Westbard. And I'm sure she'll be glad to hear that asset is finally getting a facelift. But I also think she'd want to know about potential NOI disruption there. And that the rest of the relevant development starts. So any details you can provide there would be appreciated.
Lisa Palmer: Your mother sounds like she might want to come work for Regency, I'll let Jim and Mike talk to that on disruption and whatnot.
Mike Mas: We do have, it's beyond Westbard, we have the -- to facilitate an active redevelopment pipeline, there's going to be some disruption in NOI, Greg, as you know, and we have about $2 million of decline baked into our plan for 2021. And then we would bring that back up starting in 2022 and beyond in the accretion from those redevelopments.
Greg McGinnis: All right, thanks. And then, Jim, I had a couple questions touching on the rent spreads again. First, could you perhaps disclose what the spreads were if you exclude the non-essential tenants? We had to cut some deals or maybe excluding that fitness tension that -- fitness tenant that was mentioned? And second, when do you expect that you'll finish addressing leases from the more stressed tenants?
Jim Thompson: As far as addressing the lease is obviously that's a work -- that continues to be a work-in-progress primarily out West today, because if you look at the openings in foot traffic, most of the depressed product is still coming from the -- from the West Coast, we just now starting to really, really reopen. I'm sorry, the other question.
Greg McGinnis: Excluding the --
Jim Thompson: Oh, excluding --
Lisa Palmer: I don't think we have that number at our fingertips.
Mike Mas: It's actually, Greg, I know this if we the lease that Jim talked about in the anchor side of a new renew rent at the fitness center. If you were to use the full rent at the end of year three, that basically wipes out the negative impact on the new lease spreads and brings us to flat. But generally, I think the mix this quarter is basically a flat type of story.
Operator: Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Juan Sanabria: Hi, good morning. Just a question on the balance sheet and turning more opus which you touched on in your prepared remarks. Do you foresee that being more ramping up developments and redevelopments that we're maybe postponed as a result of COVID or are you seeing interesting external acquisitions? And if so, are those more for stabilized assets or redevelopment opportunities where maybe the yield is a bit use? You're kind of once you think about the long-term prospects for that asset?
Lisa Palmer: Yes, yes, and yes which is more seriously, we still believe that the best use of our capital is on our redevelopment opportunities and development opportunities. And we will continue to try to rebuild that pipeline, if you will, and increase that spend. And then we're also -- we are canvassing the market for acquisition opportunities and we will pursue those that align well with our strategy. And we've typically been successful, where we have been able to leverage that same redevelopment or development expertise that allows us perhaps to underwrite slightly better growth or leasing or some value creation. So we are looking at all and we do have the capacity to do that. And we will, again, pivoting to grow from here.
Juan Sanabria: And a question kind of following-up on a question, it's earlier one, and just to play devil's advocate. If traffic could be up, if people are just kind of going there opening their trunk and kind of driving out, it may not be so good for the non-anchor grocery tenants that are dominating both those activities. Do you have a sense of how much time people are spending at the center's kind of pre-COVID and any thoughts longer-term about just what opus does to the whole center or not just that one tenant?
Lisa Palmer: We do not have the data to measure dwell time. We just have the visits, what we do; we are able to measure where the people that are visiting our center, what other centers are visiting. So we are able to do comparative measures for that. But again, I have said this, even pre-COVID that every shopper can essentially do what they need to do, really from their homes. The reason to come to the center is going to be value convenience. And then also for entertainment, if you will, our place, it's a place to go. And I think that over the past 12 months. One thing again, that has really been solidified that that human beings generally are social beings, and they want interaction, and they want to get out of their homes and they want to shop they don't just want to buy. So I do believe the benefit of, if you have anchors that are very good at opus that offers the same shoppers the value and the convenience at the same time that becomes their neighborhood shopping center. And it is where they will then go when they do have other needs and other ones, if you will to shop. So that's the benefit. And I also believe the data will get better. And in time we will be measuring dwell time at our shopping centers. But we're not there yet.
Juan Sanabria: I love going to my center. So I agree with you. Want to ask if we need more solid places in the Chicago suburbs.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you.
Juan Sanabria: Thanks for the time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Ki Bin Kim: Thanks. So maybe a little bit more about open-ended question. But I thought was interesting that you guys made a pretty clear commitment to spend $175 million in development annually for the next five years. Obviously, that language wasn't in there last quarter. And it looks like you've even re-increased the scope of Serramonte. So, like I said, a little bit open-ended question. But this is pretty long-term commitment, I think carries a lot more weight. I'm not sure if I'm overreaching. But just help us walk through what you're seeing and thinking.
Mike Mas: Yes. Hi Ki Bin. Let me start with a little bit of disclosure response, maybe and then I know Lisa will jump in from just a capital allocation perspective. This -- we did make a change and a tweak to the Serramonte number really just to include the GLA of the entire center, as we do for all other re-developments. We had realized that we weren't including all the GLA on site. So that's not really a scope change. But we are -- we do remain bullish on that -- on that redevelopment project at Serramonte. From a forward-looking perspective, you did pick up on that $175 million of forward capital spend. Really kind of just a placeholder and our intent has been pretty consistent. We would like to put to work anywhere from, plus or minus a billion dollars over the next five years. And we want to put that capital to work in the form of new development ground up, as well as redevelopment of our existing shopping centers. And we are looking forward to getting back on our front foot and making progress and building those pipelines from here, starting with Carytown Phase 2 and Westbard.
Lisa Palmer: I don't know that how much to add, I think Mike said it really well. And just that we remain committed to development, it is -- it has been -- it is a core competency of Regency. I believe we have one of if not the best teams in the business, that development expertise benefits, our ability to maximize and optimize the value of our operating assets, in addition to ground up developments. And we are always looking to expand that and it enhances our future growth rate is with that $100 million of free cash flow that we're generating to the extent that we've put that to work in developments at approximately 7% returns that benefits all of us.
Ki Bin Kim: Okay. And switching topics we cover other sectors as well, obviously, and there's incredibly tight cap rates and lot of capital chasing returns and industrial and self-storage and even triple net, which is still retail, but I get to see that differently. Is there a scenario building where you're starting to see some private equity money finding renewed interest in retail?
Lisa Palmer: As we've been speaking to you over the past year, cap rates remain pretty sticky for the neighborhood grocery anchored shopping centers, and that hasn't been they may have moved very marginally up. And I would say that's been that's been wiped out and they'd come back down to where they were. We are seeing some new money coming into the sector, but they're -- it's chasing more of as you just said, chasing more yield versus the alternative investments, opportunities for them. I think that the capital flowing into the neighborhood grocery anchored shopping centers, there was already a pretty -- it was already pretty substantial. So that hasn't changed much. Where we are seeing the notable new capitals is more in the higher yield larger unconventional centers where there is distress. So that would be typically in areas where Regency really wouldn't play.
Operator: Our next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Linda Tsai: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Given the year-to-date success of cash basis tenants paying back rents can you tell us about the process that's entailed in moving cash basis back on to accrual and maybe a sense of how much earnings could still benefit from straight line rent receivables coming back that had been written off?
Mike Mas: Sure. The process we'll be very careful. We need, Linda it's much more -- the standard is much more of an assessment about the future rent paying ability than the past. And while the past is set as oftentimes reflective of that kind of ability to pay rent, it won't simply be a light switch where you've come current; therefore you're back to accrual basis. We're going to need -- we're going to need to build a track record, we're going to need to hit some thresholds on our ability to project the forward rent inability of those tenants. So that assessment likely isn't going to occur at Regency until later this year. We have included no change on straight line rent into our guidance. And you'll see that in our revised ranges is still plus or minus $30 million. So we've incorporated no change in moving tenants back to accrual.
Linda Tsai: Got it. And then on Northborough Crossing realized you've entered into a purchase agreement. Why did it make sense to part with it and then maybe where it sits in your asset quality D&A of premier plus premier and quality core?
Lisa Palmer: I'll take the beginning of that and I might turn it over to Mike for the D&A category. Northborough was came to us as part of -- it's an unwind of a JV that we inherited it with the Equity One merger. So that is part of the reason for the disposition. But also that when we look at that when we think about prioritizing assets for disposition, it's the lower growth, non-strategic assets and a strategic asset and that would fit in this category. I'm not sure I know exactly on which tier [ph].
Mike Mas: It fits into the quality core so that's third tier Linda is what I'd grade it out.
Lisa Palmer: So it is more about the future NOI growth potential of that asset.
Operator: Our next question is from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Mike Mueller: Yes, hi. Lisa, I know, you mentioned stimulus checks when you're talking about prior period collections. But are there any other, I guess category differences, regional versus local categories that we should think of in terms of where the collections have been coming from?
Mike Mas: I'll take that. Stimulus did have a lot to do with it, we think. But the categories driving our prior period rent collections is it's the same that were driving our reserves last year, right. So local buyers, small shop buyers, West Coast buyers generally and when we think about categories, it's fitness, restaurants, personal services, entertainment. Those have been the more variable type of revenue streams, and that's what we're seeing coming to door now.
Operator: Our next question is from Wes Golladay with Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Wes Golladay: Hi, everyone, can you comment on why the reserves were $17 million largely comparable to the fourth quarter in the -- I guess against the backdrop of tenants paying more on a cash basis. And I guess could this be upside, an upside reversal later in the year?
Mike Mas: Sure. So let me get a little bit technical to help and then we'll kind of bring it up bigger picture. But so the fourth quarter, it's a little bit apples and oranges a little bit, but we’re trying to make an apples-to-apples, fourth quarter had about a $500,000 positive impact from prior periods in that number. And then the first quarter of 2021 had about $1 million additives related to CAM reconciliations. So there's a bit of a seasonal component to it, right. So we build CAM recs with cash expensed [ph] so that amplifies the bad debt expense. So the apples-to-apples change is really about a $1.5 million of improvement. So you don't see that on the surface. But then I kind of go back to my earlier comments. And really, we were seeing the improvement in our cash basis tenant, collection rate, so late in the quarter of March and then extending beyond the quarter of April. That's what's giving us the confidence to increase our outlook moving forward. And Wes, even, if you think about it, big picture collection rate on the top is basically unchanged, right quarter-over-quarter 93% plus or minus the same. That I think that helps frame out that sequential question you have.
Wes Golladay: Got you. And then I might have missed it. But did you talk about the, I guess for the balance of the year 2Q to 4Q, the amount of 2020 rent that you will, I guess expect to unreserve for that going forward?
Mike Mas: Yes, no, I appreciate you asking because we didn't get to that point. So beyond just an increase in current year collection, rate, we have also included an increase in the collection with 2020 reserve rate. So we had 125 basis points in our original guidance, we now have 425 basis points positive impact in our guidance range. So that's an incremental 300 basis points, so think about that in dollars, that's roughly $30 million at the midpoint in our new range. And as you can see in the results, we've already collected $20 million of that, in fact, through April; we collected another $4 million. So we're 80% through our guidance range on 2020 reserved collections.
Wes Golladay: Got you. And then, Mike, can you just clarify, I think you said occupancy trough is that paying occupancy or the occupancy that you show on the statistics or maybe it's both?
Mike Mas: It's a net effect of rent paying occupancy. So it's not a number that we report on it's basically commenced occupancy adjusted for uncollectible lease income. So that's in the 86% to 87% range today. We could trough -- we could lose more occupancy on a percent leased or commenced occupancy -- or commenced basis in the second, third quarters even but what we think matters financially is the convert, it's the fungibility again of move-out and uncollectible and we have increased our effective rent paying occupancy in the first quarter by about 50 basis points and we're moving in the right direction. I think the leasing activity that Jim and the team did in the first quarter is again another kind of confidence builders, as we think about moving or moving occupancy forward through the balance of 2021.
Operator: Our next question comes from Floris Van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please proceed with your question.
Floris Van Dijkum: Thanks for taking my question, guys. Lisa, maybe if you could, you guys have a lot of dry powder enviable balance sheets, obviously earnings are on the upswing, things are looking good. Maybe your thoughts on as you deploy, you've talked about the redevelopment, which is an attractive capital source or capital use and some of your ground up development opportunities as well. But as you look at acquisitions, as the pandemic changed your thinking in about what you want to acquire and buy and maybe talk about the types of assets and both in terms of types of assets, and maybe in terms of region and regional exposure as well?
Lisa Palmer: I wouldn't say that the pandemic and isolation if you think about the impacts on tenants has necessarily changed, how we're thinking about where we may want to deploy capital. But some of perhaps the more permanent trends that were that may, that we're seeing from the pandemic have influenced, how we're thinking about where we may deploy capital. What I mean by that is a lot of the migration trends in terms of potentially opening or widening the fairway for us with regards to markets where we may invest. And I don't necessarily mean that we're going to go to brand new markets. But if you take a market that we're in like Atlanta, for example, we've been very focused in Hawaii if you will, right, the first ring of Atlanta now with a more permanent, more remote work, people we're seeing migrations pattern of people moving a little bit further away from the city. And so that may open up more opportunities for us in markets that we already know, we're already in, we already have scale, we already have critical mass, where we may be able to kind of expand that that reach, if you will, that's probably the largest influence in terms of where we're looking to deploy capital. But beyond that, our strategy has not changed. We still will develop, redevelop, acquire high quality, well located grocery anchored neighborhood, and community shopping centers.
Operator: Our next question comes from Paulina Rojas Schmidt with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.
Paulina Rojas Schmidt: Good morning. And how different is the interest today in the private market for smaller grocery anchored neighborhood centers versus your centers and with maybe one or two boxes in addition to a brochure. Also I think you said before that cap rates had not changed much versus [indiscernible]. And where are you referring to this two property types that I just described or just for the smaller neighborhood centers?
Lisa Palmer: Thanks for the question. Again, I would say generally speaking, when for the past -- prior to the last three months where we've really seen the transaction market open up a lot more. Prior to that, the properties that we're trading and centers that we're trading were on a much smaller size. So really grocer anchored with small shops that were easier to underwrite, because of the essential tenants that were in the shopping centers, just a smaller bite size. With the improved environment, retail environment, the improvement just overall of our economy, we have seen the transaction market open more. So now there are properties and we are -- that are trading that wouldn't have even traded before. This goes back to what I said about new capital coming in, looking for higher yields. So those wouldn't even have traded. That's the larger, more unconventional more entertainment. With regards to boxes, there's definitely a premium. So cap rates are higher for where there are additional boxes. And while in the short-term, you've seen higher collection rates because they're typically occupied by national tenants that are paying rents. There is still the risk that over the long-term as there continues to be shrinking GLA and consolidation especially with the impact from e-commerce. That is where we're going to see the greatest fallout and also what requires the greatest amount of capital to release. So there is a premium for higher cap rates for those types of centers.
Paulina Rojas Schmidt: Has that premium widened and or not?
Lisa Palmer: I don't know that it's much different than it was pre-COVID, it's going to be depending on, it's always it depends in our sector, and in real estate generally, but more boxes in centers generally will push up cap rates due to the long-term risks anywhere from 50 basis points to 100 basis points, depending on what the market is in -- what market bps, shopping centers in. And that's really not that difference from pre-COVID. The difference is they weren't traded prior to the past three months.
Paulina Rojas Schmidt: Yes. And then I think you have mentioned before that you expected to return to pre-pandemic levels by 2023. Given your guidance raised and generally the more optimism there is it seems that this to be achieved earlier. I know I'm asking a lot. But do you think, what are the odds that you are back to pre-pandemic in 2022?
Lisa Palmer: I'm going to pass that to Mike. So I don't get in trouble for providing 2022 or 2023 guidance.
Mike Mas: Hey, following that really no change in what we said previously, late 2022, certainly on a full-year 2023 is what we're talking about internally as a recovery type of period. It's important to remember, there's a lot of crossover going on between 2020 and 2021, right. And then it's producing a lot of growth, quote-unquote in 2021. But we have lost 200 basis points that come as occupancy. And that recovery period will take longer, as it always has; finding the tenant, negotiating a lease, building out the space, commencing rent is a process. That's really what's going to at the end of the day result in when we end, where we end and how that relates to 2019 and how quickly we can get there. What's happening with the uncollectible lease income between 2020 and 2021 is -- it's a shallower trough, but it's not necessarily changing the endpoint. That's where this vacancy number matters. And it all matters because it's all cash, but that vacancy number is going to influence where we end and how in relation to 2019.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Tammi Fique with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Tammi Fique: Hi. Thank you. I guess I'm curious, as you think about new developments starts are you at all concerned about the impact of a rising construction costs on yields relative to sort of historical yield?
Mike Mas: Yes, Tammi. We historically have done really a pretty good job of embedding growth in our underwriting so that we don't get caught flat flooded. And looking over our shoulder we've done a pretty nice job of that in existing pipeline deals. So obviously, underwriting it's just a fact out there. Construction is a challenge pricings staff; deliverables are very difficult right now. So all of those factors would go into the mixer in our thought process as we look at our underwriting and pipeline.
Tammi Fique: Okay, thanks. And then maybe a bigger picture question, I guess with -- as with any downturn, there are obviously lessons learned that lead companies to better position for the next downturn. Taking the Great Financial Crisis the lesson was, how important liquidity and the leverage were, but curious in a year from now when you look back on this downturn what lessons do you think Regency and other owners retail real estate will have learned?
Lisa Palmer: I think that, interestingly, the first thing that came in mind that you started to answer that is the same thing about liquidity and financial strength. And since we did learn that so well in past downturns, I would just have to say that it just -- it really, really solidifies how important it is to keep that balance sheet extremely strong and how you -- how you enter that downturn is so important. And that is what has enabled us to provide the support to our tenants that we're providing, it enabled us to maintain our dividends and it also coming out of it it's still strong enough that we're able to act on opportunities as they -- as we -- as they come to fruition. So that's the biggest lesson learned, remain true, remain disciplined, even when times are booming, and you will be in a position to take advantage of any disruption or distress when that downturn does happen.
Tammi Fique: [Indiscernible] for Mike, I'm sorry if I missed this, but what was the nature of the termination expense in the first quarter?
Mike Mas: Sure, Tammi, we bought out a lease in connection with the sale of a former shopping center called Pleasanton. And so with the last lease remaining, we had to buy that out to deliver that site to the buyer. The buyer is building basically an office building and corporate headquarters.
Operator: Our next question is from Chris Lucas with CapitalOne Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Chris Lucas: Hey, good afternoon, everybody. Just a couple of quick ones on my end. I think there's when you guys were going through the pandemic, you had a number of projects that were sort of set to deliver or nearly ready to deliver, and you made accommodations with tenants with that, by allowing them to open up I'm thinking specifically about 0.50. But are you seeing tenants that maybe had gone through that negotiated sort of delayed openings, now pushing to accelerate those openings or is the timing pretty much set and that's just how they're going to be?
Mike Mas: Chris, I think at this point, it's -- that's kind of behind us, the hesitation to open it's much like the foot traffic as people have come back and most of our assets that were in that predicament we're seeing, either the tenant that chose not to go-forward has been replaced by in a lot of cases, similar use because it's the right merchandising mix, it may have been partially built out along those line. So it was almost a natural that those same users get to backfill, but we're seeing people move forward with the opportunities today.
Chris Lucas: And maybe the flip of that question is I don't know if it's just in my neighborhood, but we're seeing more hours getting cut by shops and retailers based on lack of staff. Are you finding retailers hesitant to sign leases in low labor pool availability markets because of that, or is that not impacting the decision processes at this point?
Mike Mas: I wouldn't say it's impacting decision process right now. But it certainly is it's a reality out in the workplace. We hear it from retailers, restaurant tours to soft goods to get across the gamut. It's a real issue, trying to find labor, so more to come. Hopefully, there'll be some changes from the legislative changes that may be impactful to get folks interested in coming back to work. But there's definitely a lack of supply from last year.
Chris Lucas: Yes, just last question for me. On the development, when I look at your redevelopment/development page today, it's overwhelmingly oriented to redevelopment. If I look at that page 18 months from now, does it still look overemphasized on the redevelopment or does development have a larger play in your outlook?
Lisa Palmer: I'd say that there's always going to be, the mix of that's going to change because again, I'll just bring it back to the core competency, the best team in the business, the way that we are even structured regionally and proud versus functionally, right from the development team and an operations team, we bring that expertise to bear on our existing portfolio as well. And really maximizing the value of those properties is going to continue to be an important part of our strategy. At the same time, last quarter, we had two new starts; they're both ground up developments. So we're continuing to pursue and look for those opportunities also and I believe we'll have success in both.
Operator: Our next question is from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Linda Tsai: Hi, sorry, thanks. Just one follow-up. On the 3Q call you noted that the Pacific Coast comprised nearly half of uncollected rent due to tighter lockdowns, is the escalated receipt of prior period rents in 1Q 2021 and from fiscal year 2020 weighted towards the West Coast?
Mike Mas: Yes, it's nearly 40% West Coast on the prior period collection and about a third kind of in the Southeast.
Linda Tsai: And then is there any sense that the West Coast markets are more impaired now from a leasing activity, rents or kind of stability to pay or you just being more recovery overall?
Mike Mas: Yes, the latter, recovery overall. It's been exciting to see the level of activity in amount we spend, very, very difficult to operate in over the last year. But we're seeing that same, same leasing activity in volume in the West Coast as we're across the country.
Operator: We've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Lisa Palmer for closing comments.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you again for the Regency team. But also thank you all for being on the call with us today and as I opened in my remarks, I know it's been a long week and a long earnings season and I appreciate you being with us on a Friday afternoon. Have a great weekend.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and we thank you for your participation.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-12 12:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to Regency Centers Corporation Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Christy McElroy.
Christy McElroy: Good afternoon, and welcome to Regency Centers' fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Lisa Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Mas, Chief Financial Officer; Mac Chandler, Chief Investment Officer; Jim Thompson, Chief Operating Officer; and Chris Leavitt, SVP and Treasurer. As a reminder, today's discussion contains forward-looking statements about the company's future business and financial performance as well as future market condition. These are based on management's current belief and expectations and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. It is possible actual results may differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements we may make. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements are included in our presentation today and in our filings with the SEC. The discussion today also contains non-GAAP financial measures, the comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this quarter's earnings materials, all of which are posted on our Investor Relations website. Please note that we have again provided additional disclosures in this quarter's supplemental package related to COVID-19, and its impact on the company's business and have also posted a presentation on our website with additional information. Lisa?
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Christy. Good afternoon, everyone. And good morning for those of you out in the West Coast. First, I'd like to begin our call by again thanking the Regency team. It's hard to believe that almost a year has passed. Since this pandemic started to meaningfully impact our daily lives. Collectively, and individually, we're presented with challenges and we continue to be that I don't think any of us could have ever imagined. And in the face of that I'm so proud of how our team has navigated this very different environment, with a revised and even more demanding set of expectations. We have worked harder than ever during this time to serve our tenants, our customers, our communities, and our shareholders. And while Regency does enjoy the advantages of our size, scale and national presence, it's the people in our 22 offices across the country that have been the keys to our resiliency. Our local presence provides us close proximity to our properties, which enables us to act small and to take a personalized, relationship driven approach with our tenants. So once again, thank you all. In the fourth quarter, despite a rise in cases in most markets, and increased restrictions in some, we have been encouraged by continued improvement in our operating results. And this is driven by further meaningful progress on rent collections. The hardest hit categories however, especially in the more restricted markets are still lagging. Many entertainment, fitness, sit down restaurant, and personal service centers are still either not allowed to open or are operating with severe capacity restrictions. This has had the greatest impact on our local small shop operators. But even in these categories and end markets, we've still seen improvement in collection rates compared to where we were three months ago. We also remain encouraged by momentum in our leasing efforts, as execution volumes picked up in the fourth quarter, and our pipelines continue to grow. This is a testament not only to a greater willingness among tenants to do new deals, but also to the strength of our locations, our tenant relationships and our experienced team. So, despite the setback, we saw the health crisis in certain markets in the fourth quarter, Regency still moved forward, and we see green shoots as well. The vaccines helped to at least provide some light at the end of the tunnel, and additional federal stimulus could help to support our local tenants and consumers at the margin. The worst of the restrictions are hopefully behind us, knock on wood, as we've seen, some of the most restrictive states like California start to ease up a bit. But with that said, we still have reasons to be cautious given the meaningful uncertainty that remains. While many businesses may technically be open, the inability to operate at full capacity can be a major obstacle. The vaccines are definitely a positive, but distribution will take time and the presence of additional variants is certainly a wild card. The ultimate impact of this on the consumer and in turn, the resulting impact on tenant fallout, remains unknown. And our 2021 outlook reflects that uncertainty. In fact, we've chosen to use a scenario approach rather than a traditional guidance framework. And Mike will discuss that in more detail in just a bit. In light of the current environment, we firmly believe that being careful and transparent as we always are, is the most prudent approach to setting expectations. While we do have a greater sense of optimism, and that is inherent in our continued improvement scenario, it is still too early in the year to eliminate our reverse course scenario. As we move through the year, we will have a lot more clarity and visibility and we will refine our expectations accordingly. Today, our team in the field continues to aggressively but thoughtfully pursue recovery of cash flows. As I've discussed previously, we've taken a targeted strategic approach with our tenants throughout the pandemic, especially for our local tenants, waiting until they are able to reopen, and then working with them on a plan for the future. We believe that this approach will help to ensure the long term success of our tenants, which should in turn put Regency in the best position for recovery. The quality and locations of our assets have allowed us to choose our tenants over time to fill our portfolio with great operators. We've already vetted these merchants, and we still want most of them in our centers when this is all over. Same time, we're not afraid to get space back. We have great space, and we will release it. This is what we do, and we do it really well. But in many cases when factoring in the economics of re-tenanting, making this conscious decision to work through with a proven business operator, is often the wisest choice. We always have to keep in perspective that these are people just like us that we're working with. And importantly, I also want to re-emphasize the strength of our balance sheet. This has provided us with the financial flexibility to maintain our quarterly dividend throughout the pandemic, which we are really proud of given our long-term commitment to driving total shareholder returns. It has also enabled us to continue committing capital to new investments, as well as in operating and maintaining our existing centers. While we know that we still have a long road ahead of us, substantial progress that we made with recovery this far, really has provided renewed energy among our team members. As I reflect back on the last year, my confidence in the longer term trajectory for Regency has only solidified. We are on the right side of a structural growth trend in strong suburban markets. Our high quality, well located, geographically diverse portfolio of grocery anchored, open air centers, is well positioned to continue serving the essential needs of our communities. Jim?
Jim Thompson: Thanks, Lisa, and good afternoon, all. I would like to echo Lisa's comments and thank the Regency team. Our people who've worked tirelessly over the last year to maintain lines of communication with our tenants. We're doing everything we can to enable them to open and operate safely and successfully. I'm proud of what we've accomplished during a very tough year, and how far we've come since last spring. As of the end of January, the vast majority of our tenants are open and operating. And that hasn't changed much from a quarter ago. But a subset of our tenants are still operating under government mandated capacity restrictions. And those restrictions increased in certain categories and markets during the fourth quarter, given the rise in COVID cases. Despite this, our cash collections continued show improvement, reaching 92% in the fourth quarter, and 89% in January as of Monday. We're still receiving rent payments for January and the collection trajectory is tracking in line with prior months. In fact, as of today, it's already up to 90%. Even in our West Coast markets, despite the greater restrictions during the fourth quarter, we still improved our collection rates from a quarter ago. They still meaningfully lag or other regions, but we are encouraged that California appears to be easing some of these restrictions, which should help narrow that gap. As we've seen in markets that are more open and less restrictive, consumers have returned to engaging with our retailers. This is encouraging and is an opportunity for continued improvement. Lisa just discussed our strategic approach with our tenants and we designed deferral plans that are realistic. We expect the majority of our deferred rent to be collected in 2021. Beyond those with deferral agreements, tenants are still uncollected generally fall into three categories. There are those we believe in, but are still waiting to engage, predominantly in the West Coast markets operating under closure or capacity restrictions. There are those we are aggressively pursuing for rent. And there are those who are struggling pre-pandemic that we see as closure risk. We continued to see impact from tenant fallout in the fourth quarter, and expect 2021 will likely remain challenged from its tenant fallout perspective. The seasonal dip that we typically see in the first quarter could be more meaningful as a result. Elevated tenant failures are factored into our guidance with the uncertainty around move outs contributing to the wider range. I want to provide some added color on our leasing activity in the fourth quarter. We are encouraged by the strength in our leasing volumes, which I continue to show improvement throughout the year. The demand is real and the retailers are active. We are seeing the greatest new leasing activity in the markets that are more open with the least restriction. Our future deal pipeline is also strong, with categories including grocery, off-price, banks, medical, auto parts and service users, but also and most encouragingly, fitness and restaurants. So where our tenants can operate, leasing feels closer to normal. Total rent growth for the quarter was slightly positive, weighed down by renewal activity. For our renewal deals, volumes have remained consistent throughout the pandemic. But in the fourth quarter, we did see some pressure on our renewal leasing spreads. One-third of our renewal leases signed during the quarter averaged 18 months in duration. And these deals had negative spreads averaging more than 5%. Our longer term renewal deals had positive spreads of over 2%. Some of the short-term deals or rent relief negotiations with tenants in bankruptcy, as well as others that have been significantly impacted by the pandemic. Those deals primarily consist of shop tenants, because conversely, we saw positive spreads nearly 7% per anchored renewal deals in the quarter. Importantly, our teams are managing this space in the right way. We're being thoughtful when making leasing decisions with an eye towards longer term. We believe that rents for much of this space we right size at higher levels post pandemic. And by signing shorter term deals, we'll have another bite at the apple in the near future. To sum up, we remain impressed by the resiliency and creativity of our tenants in this environment, and the willingness of consumers to adapt to the new normal and reengage with our merchants. Most importantly, we're encouraged by the improving operating trends, as we continue to see a flight to quality and believe our portfolio is well positioned to benefit from this. Mac?
Mac Chandler: Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon. Throughout 2020, we performed an in-depth review of our in process development and redevelopment projects, as well as our extensive future pipeline of value add opportunities. This evaluation included potential impacts to scope, timing, tenancy and return on investment in order to determine the best direction for each project to align with our long-term growth objectives. Following this process, which we've largely completed, we made the decision not to pursue certain projects or components of projects, as they no longer meet our return thresholds. As a result, we wrote-off development pursuit costs above our historic average in the fourth quarter. The largest write-off was at Serramonte Center as we produced our scope. Though the broader multi-phase project is proceeding forward, and we added it back into the in-process pipeline in the fourth quarter. This roughly $55 million project will include several standalone restaurant pads, a new hotel and a ground lease to completion of the mall interior renovation, and the releasing of the former J. C. Penney box. While, we have trimmed some of our activities due to COVID, we continue to maintain a healthy pipeline of value add projects, and in fact, this process has given us renewed confidence, the $300 million of development to redevelopment in process at the end of 2020. In addition to restarting construction at Serramonte, we also commenced construction on a ground up Publix anchored development in the Jacksonville market. In the fourth quarter, we successfully completed The Village at Hunter's Lake, a Sprouts anchored development in Tampa, Florida, and opened at 100% leased in the middle of a pandemic. Hunter's generating an 8% return on a $21 million investment. We continue to invest in our other large scale high value redevelopment projects that we expect to start in the near-term. For example, entitlements are finalized at Westbard Square, Bethesda, Maryland. And we plan to commence with the first phase in 2021. We remain confident in the long-term value creation opportunities available in our pipeline. Moving to dispositions, during the fourth quarter we sold five shopping centers for a combined gross sales price of nearly $78 million, bringing our total dispositions for 2020 to $191 million and a 5.7% cap rate. Additionally, we sold over $80 million of non-income producing land and outparcels in 2020. Our disposition activity is consistent with our strategy to opportunistically sell non-strategic, low growth assets to improve portfolio quality and maintain balance sheet strength. For 2021, we anticipate dispositions of approximately $150 million at an average cap rate of 5.5 to 6. This includes the sale to assets that close subsequent to year-end. We look forward to providing updates throughout 2021 on the progress of our development projects and our disposition plans. Mike?
Mike Mas: Thank you, Mac. Happy Friday, everyone. I appreciate you joining us on what we know has been a very busy week. I'll start by addressing fourth quarter results and our balance sheet position before moving to our framework for helping everyone understand what this New Year may bring. Fourth quarter NAREIT FFO of $0.76 per share includes a few one-time charges that were communicated several weeks ago, and were detailed again in our release last night. These charges are in addition to a write-off a straight line rent receivables of nearly $8 million or $0.04 per share, and uncollectible lease income of approximately $18 million or $0.10 per share recognized in the fourth quarter. Uncollectible lease income remains the primary driver of the decline in same property NOI in the quarter. As evidenced by the additional straight line rent write-off in the fourth quarter, we did move some additional tenants to cash basis accounting. This was predominantly the result of increased levels of operating restrictions imposed late last year, and this bucket of tenants was concentrated in our West Coast markets, as well as across the more impacted tenant categories, including restaurants, personal service providers and fitness operators. However, at the same time, we continue to see improved collections in our cash basis tenant pool. This is clearly a gratifying trend. In the fourth quarter, we’ve recognized revenue equating to 94% of our pro rata billings that is up from 90% in the third quarter and 86% in the second. We ask that you refer to our updated COVID-19 disclosures in the fourth quarter supplemental, which provide a reconciliation to pro-rata billings. Just a few comments on our balance sheet, where we remain extremely well-positioned. Shortly after year-end, we repaid our $265 million term loan, which we indicated we would do if positive trends continued, which they have. With this move, we have completely redeployed the proceeds from our bond issuance last May, and you'll notice this impact in our guidance for interest expense. With ample access to low cost capital, we no longer feel the need to maintain an outsized cash balance out of an abundance of caution, which was dilutive to our earnings in 2020. We now have no significant debt maturities until 2024. In addition, earlier this week, we closed on a recast of our $1.25 billion revolving credit facility, through which we have full availability, at terms and pricing consistent with pre-COVID levels. We are very proud of this execution, reflecting the continued strong support of our lenders in this challenging environment. Turning to 2021, we’ve provided an additional NAREIT FFO range of $2.96 to $3.14 per share, a much wider range than we’ve historically offered, reflecting continued uncertainty. We encourage you to refer to our guidance disclosure in our press release and on Page 34, of the supplemental, as well as our guidance roll forward on Page 18 of our earnings slide deck. The roll forward should prove to be especially helpful. As you would expect, the widest per share variance is in our projection for net operating income. Given that much more of our NOI is potentially variable amid the uncertainty that remains in the environment, especially as it relates to uncollectible lease income and potential move out activity, we believe a wide range is prudent. We also feel that is important for us to communicate a framework for how we are thinking about the different scenarios that could play out this year. And what our earnings could look like under those scenarios. So different from past years, our initial 2021 guidance is not driven off of simple deviations from a base case scenario. Instead, the low end of today's range is representative of what we think our results could look like under a set of circumstances that is distinctly different from the assumptions supporting the high end of the range. Each of these guideposts represent a unique set of potential outcomes. We actually thought about not even calling it guidance and instead calling it scenario analysis, because for now and until we have a bit more clarity on the impacts of the evolving pandemic, this is how we are thinking about this framework internally. From a big picture perspective, the low end, what we call our reverse course scenario, is an environment in which the U.S. experiences elevated infection rates, and in turn sees more shutdowns and increased restrictions. In this scenario, with the potentially backtrack on rent collections and full year 2021could look a lot more like 2020. Under this scenario, we see same property NOI property declining another 100 basis points year-over-year in 2021. The midpoint of our range represent the status quo scenario, where 2021 reflects a continuation of our fourth quarter results. In this scenario, same property NOI growth is slightly positive year-over-year, despite the tougher comp in the first quarter. The high end represents what we've named our continued improvement scenario. This is an environment with continued progress in vaccine rollout, further listing of state and local mandated restrictions on operators and added federal stimulus that helps support local businesses and consumers. Under this scenario, we would experience a positive trajectory from Q4 results, as we continue to increase rent paying occupancy, as we had for the back half of 2020. In this scenario, same property NOI growth could increase by up to 250 basis points year-over-year in 2021. We recognize the challenge that such a wide range of outcomes presents, but at this point in time, there's simply too much uncertainty to rule out the downside. At the same time, we also appreciate how difficult it can be to develop expectation without the benefit of a company's outlook. We sincerely hope that this approach, and added transparency is helpful in allowing the market to consider its own views of where we stand in the pandemic, and then apply those assumptions to our scenario. We also expect that with another quarter under our belts, added clarity will allow us to refine our scenarios and tighten our expectations. I'll touch on a couple of the major drivers of their earnings changes in 2021, using the midpoint scenario as reference, but we've given a lot of detail on the roll forward, and much of it speaks for itself. One item to note is lease termination income. This is net of expenses, and first quarter 2021 will be impacted by a onetime lease termination expense of close to $2 million associated with a buyout of an anchor lease at Pleasanton Plaza. And secondly, we expect higher net G&A in 2021, assuming hiring activity and business travel starts to return to more normal levels this year. As I spoke about on the last call, we are no longer assuming as much of an offset from development overhead capitalization, as we had in 2019, given the delays and changes in our pipelines. In closing, we are very much encouraged by the progress that we've made and by where we stand today. But if there's anything we've learned in the last year, aside from confirming how critically important it is to maintain a fortress balance sheet, it's how quickly and materially things can change. As such, we remain careful with our expectations. With that, we'd be happy to take your questions.
Operator: At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Katy McConnell with Citi. Please state your question.
Katy McConnell: Great. Thanks and good afternoon, everyone. So, within your same-store NOI guidance, can you provide some context around what you're expecting for 1Q, in terms of the magnitude of occupancy fallout or bad debt? Just to give us a sense for how steep the recovery could be in the back half of 2021?
Operator: One moment, guys. One moment, Katy.
Mac Chandler: Katie, this is Mac in LA. They are having a little bit of technical difficulty, so just give us a moment here.
Katy McConnell: Okay. No problem.
Mac Chandler: Katy, it looks like the Jacksonville team is going to switch conference rooms. So it'll be just a moment or two.
Lisa Palmer: Hey, Katie, can you hear me?
Katy McConnell: I can. Yes.
Lisa Palmer: We apologize, everyone. Can everyone hear us now?
Katy McConnell: Yes. I can hear you.
Lisa Palmer: You missed -- I don't know if you heard Mike at all. But he actually started to answer your question while, we're having some difficulties here. Okay, so hopefully we start with relocated, we will not get cut off again.
Mike Mas: So, hey, Katie, this is Mike. I'm going to go ahead. I did get your question before we got cut off. I think you were asking about the kind of cadence of NOI going into '21 given our guidance.
Katy McConnell: Yes, exactly.
Mike Mas: Let me limit my comments to maybe our status quo scenario. And we'll talk about the other scenarios off of that. Obviously Q1 is going to be a difficult comp for us and that status quo scenario, which as you recall would be our fourth quarter in effect replicating itself through the full year of '21. So that would mean we still have a pretty tough comp, expectations in that area would be similar to the growth numbers we've been putting up in the back half of 2020. And then if you think about the what could occur in the other scenario, should they present themselves, obviously that would in a reverse course, that would amplify that to the negative and obviously the other way, within a continued improvement scenario.
Katy McConnell: All right, great. Thanks. And then the second question, can you update us on where the cash basis tenant pool stands today, as a percentage of total ADR? And what are the collection rates have been like so far?
Mac Chandler: Sure. So we did add some tenants to the cash basis pool, as I indicated. We're up to 29% of our ADR is on a cash basis. However, there are some really positive signs. There our collection rate, as I mentioned, 75%, of those tenants are paying their rent. And that's up from 64%, if you recall from the third quarter earnings call, so really good momentum in that area. And those numbers would then be reflected in both our status quo as is that that number were to remain constant through '21, and then continued improvement that's where you're going to see the continued improvement. It's going to come from our cash basis tenants, and their ability to grow that rent paying percentage.
Katy McConnell: Okay. Makes sense. Thanks, all.
Mike Mas: Thank you. Sorry for the delay.
Katy McConnell: No worries. We can hear you perfect now.
Operator: And our next question is from Derek Johnston with the Deutsche Bank.
Derek Johnston: Hi, everybody. Thank you. Just sticking on small shop here for a second. How do you envision remerchandising small shop vacancies with new relevant retailers? Are there any categories that stand out maybe more of a focus on more essential or hybrid versus entertainment health or beauty or fitness? How are you contemplating the mix going forward as you look to relate some of these faces?
Jim Thompson: Derek this is Jim, I'll take that. I think our philosophy is consistent with how we've always dealt with vacancy and merchandising. Obviously, I think there is a SKU towards healthy lifestyle. So wellness is a great category that we're seeing growth in. Certainly a lot of the existing categories, the better retailers are growing within the footprint that we have today. I'd also like to think as an emerging category, what I call emerging category are some of the typical mall type folks, we mentioned, I think on our last call that we're seeing some of those people that support us West Town [ph], Lululemon, The Gap concepts that are interested in the open air center from the standpoint of pricing, as well as access visibility and merchandising mix. So a little bit business as usual from a mix standpoint, but there are some categories that I just mentioned, I think we've got a particular eye towards.
Derek Johnston: Okay, okay. Great. Thank you. And then I guess I would ask, what have you learned about traffic and demand, specifically at centers within states that have less mandated restrictions? Are there some inspiring read-throughs or positive takeaways from those states versus ones with tighter restrictions in California, that you can pinpoint and would possibly lead to your high end continued improvement, or frankly full case guidance? Thank you.
Lisa Palmer: Thanks, Derek. I'll jump in on that one. I mean, absolutely, we continue and I know that we've talked about this, even in our prepared remarks continue to see really strong correlations, with restrictions being lifted, and foot traffic, and then foot traffic with collections. And so absolutely, we have the data that actually tracks that foot traffic. And in the markets where we've essentially fully recovered foot traffic, the collections are the highest. And so expect as we continue we did see some restrictions lift in California, in the very recent past few weeks, and absolutely believe that that should translate to more foot traffic into our centers, which would translate to upside in our collection numbers out in that market.
Derek Johnston: Excellent. Thank you.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets.
Juan Sanabria: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the time. Just following up on Derek's question. Could you give us any sense of where the rent collections are maybe comparing California to Florida, kind of the two opposites maybe?
Jim Thompson: Yes, absolutely. Actually, I'll point you to I'm looking for it, if you look at our as a business update deck we put out last night, it's on Page 11. And we did enhance this disclosure this quarter. And I think really it shows the trend exactly as Lisa described it. You'll see quarter-over-quarter trends in collection rates by region at Regency. And you'll see that the Southeast from the second quarter at 84%, as an example to the fourth that 96%. And that's indicative of the foot traffic and that translate Lisa's identifying together with the relaxed restrictions. The Pacific Coast or West Coast portfolio, although we have improved our collection rate there, the pace of that improvement from it has not been as great and there's a little bit of a sticky, small shop, restaurant, non-essential categories that continue to just have a hard time performing. And when you have these heavy restrictions and sometimes locks on your door, it's a challenge. And that's evidence in itself in our collection rates, we take a lot of comfort in what we're seeing in other markets in the country. And that replicating eventually in our great shopping centers in these great markets on the Pacific Coast. So, we look forward to that post-pandemic. But that's just the point of our guidance. It's uncertain when that will happen. And so that's why we've taken this approach, as we have with our guidance ranges.
Juan Sanabria: That's fantastic. And apologies for not catching that earlier.
Jim Thompson: No worries.
Juan Sanabria: Just one follow-up on the balance sheet. You guys clearly have that as a position of strength and you talked about maybe feeling less cautious and willing to not carry so much cash. So, how do you think leverage looks from here either from a net debt to EBITDA perspective or otherwise? Can that increase from here? Are you kind of happy keeping kind of a current run rate in place just giving your historical defensiveness with regards to the balance sheet?
Mac Chandler: Yes, we're not getting off of our key tenant and key strategy here is to protect that balance sheet and to operate in the low 5 times area. That's where we started in 2019. And, as we define recovery, that is a key portion of that definition, we'd like to return to those levels. We're at 6 times, at year-end, with that much disruption, I think that's a very enviable position, I would imagine. But we're not satisfied with that. So we will continue to look through primarily EBITDA growth organically, and just converting these spaces in these tenants back to rent paying. We'll handle much of that. If you think about our status quo scenario again, just to baseline us, and you go through Q1 towards the question that Katie asked, we could top out on a leverage ratio range in the 6.25 plus or minus range, is what we would see in that scenario, and then obviously amplify that up or down, depending on which scenario actually presents itself. Very comfortable at those levels from a security standpoint, that's why we took down the term loan, that's why we continue to pay our dividend. And we do have a lot of confidence that our recovery will get us back to that low 5 times ratio in due time.
Lisa Palmer: And I just want to add, because we're really proud of it. We obviously built the balance sheet intentionally to weather future storms. We've always talked about it. And with maintaining our dividend, we still generate a free cash flow north of $50 million in 2020. And we're really proud of that.
Juan Sanabria: Thanks very much.
Operator: And our next question is from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America.
Craig Schmidt: Great, thank you. Good afternoon, or good morning, where everyone is. It's clear through your business update that your portfolio is most impacted by the Pacific Coast asset. I was wondering, what are you hearing from state and local regarding restrictions? It seems like it's more restrictions now than actual mandate closings. And I was wondering, having these restrictions does that also impact new leasing, as retailers drag their feet to open stores in markets they may appreciate from a longer term basis?
Jim Thompson: Craig, I think you're exactly right. It's more of a -- it's not so much a closure now as it is just basically capacity we're seeing in LA, they've reopened the restaurants, and we're hitting. There's a pretty solid pent up demand for folks to get back out in the outdoor setting anyway. Certainly, categories that have been most restricted are going to be the least perceptive at this point I believe to engage in new leasing. The folks that have been open are engaging, are doing new leases. I think when you look at our pipeline of activity as well as executed deals in the last quarter, we're seeing across the country of similar demand as well as executable deal. So, I don't want to beat up on the West Coast too bad. Certainly there are categories that really were hurt badly by I think these mandated closures and capacity restrictions. But the folks that were open are continuing to do business and grow their business out there as well.
Craig Schmidt: Great. And then I know that you have an 18% exposure to restaurants, I guess 12 in kind of fast food and six in dine and casual. I know that you have said that, that's where you'd like the exposure to be, perhaps you can comment, what you're thinking? And I guess its longer term thinking about sticking close to that 18% exposure?
Jim Thompson: Yes. I feel like that ballpark numbers is the right ratio and mix for restaurants. I think restaurants are certainly as they continue to morph and react to what consumer demands are, there's always going to be a place for restaurants. The QSRs have done very well, the fast food folks have done very well. And even the full service restaurants in markets that were more open adapted very well during this pandemic to figuring out how to curbside pickup delivery and basically they added a leg to their sales program.
Lisa Palmer: Can you still hear us?
Craig Schmidt: Yes, I can hear you.
Lisa Palmer: Somebody run and say that they couldn't hear. Yes, sorry about that.
Jim Thompson: Sorry about that. So yes, I believe that the restaurants in that range are that's right number they will move, they will change as retail changes, but we're comfortable there.
Craig Schmidt: Isn't it factor of sort of competing against e-commerce? I mean, you physically need to either pick up the food or dine in the restaurant that brings traffic to the center. I'm wondering if that enters into the long-term. Why you want to keep that 18%?
Lisa Palmer: I think, I mean just generally thinking about the neighborhood centers. And for the most part, right, where grocery anchored neighborhood centers. I actually believe that restaurants are their driver, just as much as your growth with their anchors are. And that this trend to even more remote work and people spending more time at home is going to play to our favor. As people are spending more time at home and not necessarily in the downtown CBDs or urban core, they're still going to want to leave their homes. And whether it is to pick up and go or if it's to dine in. I think that we will benefit from that increased traffic at our shopping centers.
Craig Schmidt: Okay. Thank you.
Lisa Palmer: Thanks, Craig.
Operator: And our next question is from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.
Rich Hill: Hey, good morning, guys. Sorry, good afternoon, it's blurs day [ph]. So I can't even get my days right. Never mind my time. First of all, thank you for what I think is best in class guidance. Your reconciliation across your three scenarios was really, really well done. I did want to talk about those three scenarios, not necessarily about your guidance but maybe if you could just frame a little bit how the retailers are thinking about the outlook for 2021. What are they telling you about rent negotiations? Are deferrals coming back are abatements coming back? Are they looking for lower rents? Are they looking for percentage rents? I know that's a lot there. But I'm just really trying to frame the discussions you're having with retailers within those three frameworks that you provided?
Jim Thompson: I think the discussion with retailers is, for the most part, pre-pandemic kind of conversations. We're not seeing wholesale change on term negotiation or big divergence on historical rents and those kind of things. But I think the folks that have done well and are doing well, are continuing to try to grow their business as there's opportunity in the marketplace today, they're going to take advantage of that. We're seeing tenants that are more local in nature, that are finding opportunity in this environment to relocate. And fortunately, we are seeing and being the beneficiary of some of that relocation within a marketplace. Under the scenarios, I think the scenarios would be probably more on the low end reversal and would be more of the wait and see kind of attitude. Things got shutdown, you're going to have more of that. I'm not sure what the future looks like. So I'm not sure I can comment. So again you're going to be in that no man's land. Quite frankly, we're at some of our categories in California, no man's land. And our program has been once we can see light at the end of the tunnel, then we engage and we structure programs that are win-win for our retailer and for us. So I think that'd be the probably the biggest change is if we go backwards, it'll probably stymie some of those categories that have been, again, the most impacted today.
Lisa Palmer: I do think that based on the volumes that we have already executed and on our pipeline, you can see that there's some optimism and positivity amongst our retailers and all of our tenants to continue to grow. And there's a flight to quality and we're positioned really well to take advantage of that.
Rich Hill: Lisa, I wanted to just follow-up on that, because you made a really important comment about free cash flow and how you were able to be really nicely positive in 2020, despite all the uncertainty that the world threw at us. So as we think about your cash flow going forward and the FFO you created in 2020, and the free cash flow you created, it seems to me that that's a super high quality cash flow stream. And in fact, maybe it's -- I'll use my words and you can push back on it, but it's been de-risked. My view is that if you were able to generate that NOI in that free cash flow, that's a pretty high quality cash flow, if it continued to be created in a pandemic. One, am I wrong on that? And how would you respond to that?
Lisa Palmer: I think that you said it perfectly. I don't know that I have anything to add. Absolutely.
Rich Hill: Christy didn't tell me to ask that question for what it's worth.
Lisa Palmer: Absolutely, which is why I'll say it again, that we're really proud of that and really proud of the fact that we were able to generate that much cash flow in the middle of a pandemic.
Rich Hill: Okay, great guys. That's helpful, that's it for me.
Operator: And our next question is from Greg McGinnis with Scotiabank.
Greg McGinniss: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Mike, I appreciate the context around the guidance that is laid out. Just want to kind of confirm what the base case is, maybe essentially assuming that you're continuing to recognize like 94% of rent. And then what does that mean on the upside from that rent recognition standpoint?
Mike Mas: Yes, you have the assumption, right. Again, the easiest way to think about this is status quo. And I wouldn't -- I don't want to call out our base case, but our status quo scenario, which is top of our range, is a Q4 replicating scenario through 2021. And then obviously that and a continuous -- should we see continued improvement that would accelerate from there. If you kind of think about where we are at Q4, which again is I think it's important to grow more sales. And if you were to look through uncollectible lease income, and just think about it as effective rent paying occupancy, which is what we talk a lot about internally. We're at 86% plus or minus. So that is what we're carrying during the status quo scenario, through that midpoint range through 2021. And we'll go ahead and say this, what we see today and what Jim's articulated from a leasing activity perspective and a little bit to Rich's question around, what we're hearing and seeing from the retailers and the other and the service providers and interpreting what scenario they may be behaving under. Our eyes are focused today on the status quo scenario to the continued improvement scenario. However, we presented this reverse course scenario because it's February, it is early. The vaccine is just beginning to roll out. There's these variants. We just can't rule out a reverse course scenario. It's just too soon to do that. But I think it is important for you to hear that where our eyes are focused, it's on the status quo and/or the continued improvement scenario.
Greg McGinniss: All right, thanks. That's fair. And then on the leasing to CapEx costs on new leases look like they trended a bit higher in Q4, as a percent of the rent per square foot. Is this starting to cost more to bring in tenants? Or there's some maybe some one-time items in there that can explain the increase?
Jim Thompson: Yes. Greg, Jim, again. Exactly right. We had two new anchor deals outsize TIs associated with those. And if you netted those out, we were right back in the $20 square foot, which put us right in line with historical. One was a Burlington back fill of a 30 year old Office Depot space. It finally termed out, so we had some excessive work on that one. And then a national grocer back filled it vacant box in southern Cal. So both of those were little higher than normal TI cost, but excellent replacement merchandising for those two centers.
Greg McGinniss: Okay. So purely a function of, who when and where versus... 
Jim Thompson: Yes. At the end of the day, I don't expect -- I don't see a change into from where our historical averages have been.
Mike Mas: And let me just add to that, Greg, for your benefit. We did, I think, post an 8% of NOI kind of all in CapEx ratio for 2020. That's low. That was intentionally low. When the pandemic hit, we made some moves to preserve some capital, pushed some CapEx projects beyond 2020 into 2021. We do anticipate returning to more normalized levels. So as we recover and more normalized levels would be that 10% to 11% of NOI range, maybe even leaning on the upper end of that, because we will have more space to lease.
Greg McGinniss: And just to clarify, is that 10% to 11% inclusive of development? Or are you just I mean in terms of those kind of regular maintenance CapEx and leasing CapEx?
Mike Mas: Maintenance and leasing CapEx only.
Greg McGinniss: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.
Mike Mueller: Hi. You talked about three buckets for your uncollectable revenues. I think it was tenants you really believe in those that were challenged beforehand and then in the middle. What's the split that you see between those three buckets?
Jim Thompson: I would think the ones we believe in is by far the majority. And I think, if you looked at the West Coast, that's where the majority of that bucket resides. Again, as I mentioned, when there's clarity, we'll clean that up. The folks that pre-pandemic were struggling, that's a very, very small group of folks. And that'll clean itself up in the course of business.
Mike Mueller: Got it. And then one other question on the -- go ahead, sorry.
Jim Thompson: I was just saying on the other ones are pushing for rent, that too is a very, very small group of people at this point that just are playing the game.
Lisa Palmer: Trying to take advantage of the situation?
Jim Thompson: Take the advantage of the situation and that will resolve itself relatively quickly as well, I believe.
Mike Mueller: Got it. And then just a quick one, the 5.5% to 6% disposition cap rate for this year. Would those cap rates have been similar pre-pandemic?
Lisa Palmer: Go ahead, Mac.
Mac Chandler: Yes, Mike. Definitely they would have been similar. That's what we're seeing. We're seeing really solid pricing in the types of assets we're selling. And the strongest part of that market is small grocery anchored centers, particularly in the open states where there's more transactions, certainly triple net assets, there's tremendous pricing power there. And we've been very pleased at being able to transact. There's buyers out there, they have capital, and they're typically local private buyers who have a lot of experience and know the trade areas and markets.
Mike Mueller: Got it. Okay. Thank you. That was it.
Lisa Palmer: Thanks, Mike.
Operator: And our next question comes from Floris Van Dijkum with Compass Point.
Floris Van Dijkum: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. Good afternoon, and good morning. I wanted to, by the way, love the fact that you, I know it's not official guidance, but in your scenario analysis, the midpoint shows positive comp NOI. But if you can walk us through what kind of reserves have you baked into that? And maybe if you can talk about Mike, if you can compare that to 2019 levels of reserves?
Mike Mas: Oh, gosh, there is no comparison. So, if you think again, let me comment on the status quo scenario just to center ourselves in that status quo midpoint level. Again, going back to Q4, so $17 million, $18 million net charge in the quarter for reserves, that's down sequentially, certainly from Q2 and then into Q3, I think we're 40% down from Q3. And then that level, we would anticipate replicating itself through the year as I've kind of repeated today. That's a very healthy level for us, when you consider what our experience was in 2019. And before that, when bad debt charges kind of historically, are in the 50 plus or 50 basis points plus or minus was normal. And you're maxing out at 100 basis point level. So, it's just a completely different universe really.
Floris Van Dijkum: Right. So, I was trying to -- because one of the things that which is interesting to think about, and you sort of alluded to some of your comments here about your 96% cash paying occupancy. What is the potential here? And pre-pandemic, you were probably at 94% on those levels or something along those lines. So, it suggests you're going to have not just one year but a couple of years of pretty, pretty decent sized earnings growth, if I'm not mistaken?
Mike Mas: Yes, let me refine some of those numbers.
Lisa Palmer: First, correct it. Its 86%.
Mike Mas: Its 86% effective rent paying occupancy as being effect to uncollectible lease income at the end of Q4, 2020. And I think your point is this, if you compare that to February, pre-pandemic, that's about a 700 basis point decline in effective rent paying occupancy that we believe through our recovery will return.
Floris Van Dijkum: Right. That's great.
Lisa Palmer: We do expect that we will continue to have continued growth, not just as you pointed out in the status quo scenario positive in 2021, if we hit that, but also for the next several years.
Floris Van Dijkum: Yes. Thanks for that, Lisa. That's exactly what I was saying. Yes, knock on wood.
Operator: And our next question is from Michael Gorman with BTIG.
Michael Gorman: Yes, thanks. I just wanted to spend a little bit on the development pipeline and the review process you went through and just kind of reconcile what sounds like a lot of positive demand trends in your market with some of the review process. And maybe understand, which the majority of projects that were impacted. Is this mostly derisking the CapEx budget because of COVID-19? Or were these projects that had different retail trends that made them no longer work? Or kind of any common themes that impacted this pipeline kind of in the context of what sounds like an improving leasing environment?
Mac Chandler: Yes, absolutely. I guess a couple of themes there. We did take our time to go through our projects as we mentioned in our prepared remarks. Really, it only cost us to cease moving forward on a couple of projects. One was the project that we had under contract. And, unfortunately, with the pandemic, the leasing didn't evolve as we thought and we dropped the contract. So we had to write-off some pursue costs, typical any type costs you can imagine. But in the larger context of looking at our pipeline, really the biggest impact is time. Some of these projects have taken us longer to put together. I'll give an example of that, Town and Country is a project that's been in our pipeline. That project has been delayed by about a year. We've had trouble getting our EIR released by the City of Los Angeles, because they're impacted by COVID, just so happens this actual week, it was finally released. So it's taken us some time. The scope of the project, really is very similar to how we planned it, but we've had to push it out a year for that reason alone. But we are looking at other projects, they're in locations that we very much believe in. We really believe in the scope. Of course we're going to challenge ourselves to make sure that what we're proposing is still relevant in a post-COVID world. So I would say we made some minor changes to them, but not significant wholesale changes to them. Because these projects were pretty conservatively scoped to begin with. So we need to make sure we have the right amount of shops, convenience, parking, outdoor dining, the right amount of non-retail uses in those cases where we have it. And we believe that that's still the case. So it was very important for us to do that early in the pandemic. We were in a more of a capital preservation mode. Now that things look more clear we are getting ourselves prepared to start some of these projects, including our Bethesda project, which has now been entitled. And I'll give you one more. Our Costa Verde project, which we've been working on for many years, was finally entitled. They got approved in December without any appeal period. And that probably took an extra year longer than what we thought. But we've made some really good progress and gives us a lot of confidence going forward to get these projects started, when all the little ingredients come together. But the big ingredients are there.
Michael Gorman: No, that's helpful. Thank you. And then Mike, maybe just one last technical one on the guidance side of things. I know you talked a bit about it in your prepared remarks, but can you spend another minute talking about the G&A, the 20% rise that's implied in guidance. Just kind of what are the biggest drivers there?
Mike Mas: I appreciate the question, Mike. It does deserve at least another minute. The way what we need -- what I'd asked everyone to do is really kind of break down G&A by years, and then was talk about gross and then we'll just talk about gross and net. So, first, I think it's important to go back to 2019, walk through '20, and then into '21. And what you'll see is that the top line gross revenues '19 to '20 came down, in the pandemic, there were material savings to the company, those savings came in the form of T&E, reduced travel expenditures across our entire platform, conference attended, so on and so forth. We also benefited, I guess, we benefited from a financial perspective by having fewer seats filled, as it was more challenging to hire in that type of environment. And then variable compensation, other compensation all went in line with that. But what's happened in '20, is those savings have been masked or covered up by our development overhead capitalization. And I spoke about this last quarter, probably my fall price should have spent a little bit more time on it. That change in our development pipeline that Mac just articulated, did result in changes to our overhead capitalization as a result. Those changes are masking the savings in '20. So now, fast forward to '21, and in our guidance range, what you're seeing there is a return on the top line. So, those savings in '20 should the economy continue to reopen as we hope and suspect it will, in a status quo/continuing improvement scenario, you'll see those savings start to reverse. And that'll put pressure on the top line. And then overhead capitalization, however, will take longer to recover with the development pipeline that is a longer lead time. We have the same phenomenon occur with us in the GFC coming out of that downturn as well. Last point on G&A on the top line, then if you come back and just think about top line gross G&A '19 versus '21, it's essentially the same. '21 slightly higher, and that's because we are spending a little bit more money on third-party legal, as we work through our tenant negotiations. This is more activity than we've ever had to do in a year. But I think it's good to see that that top line is relatively consistent.
Michael Gorman: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from Ki Bin Kim with Truist.
Ki Bin Kim: Good afternoon. Just want to ask a couple quick questions on your lease spreads. So, this quarter, it was roughly flat. Obviously, the most important part is that you're doing leases and there was a good volume of it. But my question was the half a percent of positive cash lease spreads. Do those still have the traditional rent step-ups that you've had in the past? So, like the 1.25%, or 1.5% rent step ups?
Jim Thompson: Ki Bin, I appreciate you asking that. The short answer is yes. We're running about on our local shops, we're about averaging 2% on say 80% of our local deals still have the annual embedded rent steps. And when you blend the anchors in as well, it's about 1.5% on 80% of it. So, yes, we're kind of proud of that. We've been -- that program is in place for a long time and over time, it's a very nice extra bump, if you will to long term NOI growth.
Ki Bin Kim: Okay. And that's good to hear, because getting those bumps or not, it really changes the perception of what rent spreads are. My next question is, what are some of the things when you talk to tenants that you think might permanently change going forward in terms of like what they're looking for. It's a pretty broad question, but maybe the types of assets or the store size or how they do business or anything that you think will have kind of permanent lasting changes and where that might pull you towards in terms of your business?
Jim Thompson: I would say lessons learned from the pandemic are certainly the curbside pickup, the last mile delivery. I think all retailers are struggling with this fulfillment issue. And as that morphs, that's something we're certainly going to try to keep our finger on the pulse and make sure that we can react and create the environment that helps support our tenants as they're building, as their business morphs. But those kind of things I think are the biggest long term changes that I see in the business are lessons learned and pandemic, I think, drive throughs how critical they were, the ability for a lot of these restaurants for that outdoor space that's here to stay, the ability to have easy access for the Starbucks of the world where they can people can get in, get out because it's more pick up than it is sit and stay for a while. So that whole shift in the business, I think is something that we need to continue to morph and modify. Where we're able, our centers to accomplish and accommodate some of those new changes.
Ki Bin Kim: Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question is from Linda Tsai with Jefferies.
Linda Tsai: Hi, can you hear me?
Mike Mas: Yes.
Linda Tsai: Okay, great. Are you actively tracking the spread of retailer micro fulfillment across your properties, I guess, as a follow up to Ki Bin's question? Just wondering if it creates pricing power down the road for centers that offer this? Or is it more the case that at some point all centers will have micro fulfillment?
Lisa Palmer: If you can answer that question, Linda, I meant there are a lot of people that would pay for your services. It is certainly something that we talk about every day. And Jim just mentioned it, how do we strategically position ourselves to really capitalize on and profit from the need for this micro fulfillment and last mile. Because we do I mean, we own 400 plus shopping centers close to the consumers. And I absolutely believe that the future is the inventory, if you will, of goods needs to be close to the customer. And we are well positioned to play a part in that. And we talk with our retailers. We talk to the other experts in the field, and we continue to do the things necessary to position ourselves for the future. But again, where that goes and how quickly it goes, no one really knows. But I like where we are in the overall kind of universe, if you will, of the fulfillment of goods to customers.
Linda Tsai: Thanks. And sorry if I missed this, but just given some of the migration patterns to lower cost markets that we're starting pre-COVID, which accelerated during the pandemic. Does this change your view of which markets you'd want more or less exposure to?
Lisa Palmer: I mean, we really like the markets that we are in. We are already pretty geographically diverse and a national portfolio. And there is even micro migration patterns in some of the higher cost markets, if you will. And we believe that we're going to be able -- we will benefit from that as well, where you're seeing perhaps some migration from the urban core to the suburbs, the first ring suburbs where we are well positioned. So, we will continue. We again like the canvas and we will continue to expand whether it's looking for opportunistic acquisitions or developments in the markets that we are in.
Linda Tsai: Thanks.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I would like to turn the call back over to President and CEO, Lisa Palmer, for your closing remarks.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you all. 1:15 Eastern Time on a Friday, I know it's been a really long week. Apologize for the technical issues and have a great weekend. Go visit your local neighborhood shopping center and buy a Valentine's Day gift. Thanks all.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a great day.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-11-06 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to Regency Centers Corporation Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Christy McElroy, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Christy McElroy: Good morning everyone, and welcome to Regency Centers' third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Lisa Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Mas, Chief Financial Officer; Mac Chandler, Chief Investment Officer; Jim Thompson, Chief Operating Officer; and Chris Leavitt, SVP and Treasurer. As a reminder, today's discussion contains forward-looking statements about the company's future business and financial performance as well as future market condition. These are based on management's current belief and expectations and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. It is possible actual results may differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements we may make. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements are included in our presentation today and in our filings with the SEC. The discussion today also contains non-GAAP financial measures, the comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this quarter's earnings materials, all of which are posted on our Investor Relations website. Please note that we have again provided additional disclosures in this quarter's supplemental package related to COVID-19, and its impact on the company's business and have also posted a presentation on our website with additional information. Lisa?
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Christy, and welcome to Regency. We're really glad to have you on the team. Good morning, everyone. I want to start by again thanking our Regency team for all of the amazing work they have done for our company, our tenants and our communities over the last eight months. I could not be more proud and appreciative of the dedication and commitment that our employees continue to demonstrate. As many of you have heard us say throughout the years, we do believe that bigger can be better, but better is always best, particularly in an uncertain environment. And while Regency enjoys the advantages from our size, scale and national presence, one of the things that makes us better are the people in our 22 offices across the country. Our local presence provides us the boots on the ground and close proximity to our properties, enabling us to act small and to take a personalized relationship driven approach with our tenants. With the challenges we were all facing, our ability to provide focused attention to our tenants is really important to the improving current performance as well as the future results. We are encouraged by our meaningful progress as demonstrated by increasing cash collections and productive tenant discussions over the past few months. As of the end of October, we collected 86% of third quarter rent. Importantly, and Jim will discuss this in more detail, we have seen a direct correlation between tenant reopenings with increased rent collections and executed deferral agreements as restrictions are lifted. As tenants are able to reopen, even with capacity restrictions, they gain the visibility they need to start paying their rent or to enter into a deferral plan that both they and we can feel confident in. In many cases, tenants that we originally thought we might have to defer for collecting rent instead. And we're always remembering that our goal is to maximize the likelihood of long-term success for our tenants. Our tenants are able to open and operate safely. We are seeing customers return engaging with their local neighborhood businesses and community centers. We hear this from our tenants and we see this in recovering foot traffic and regions around the country that have continued to gradually reopen and lift restrictions such as Colorado, parts of the Northeast, Texas and most of the Southeast. The experience may be different today. In fact, we know it is different today versus pre-pandemic, but we've been impressed by the resiliency of our tenants and the value placed on local retail shopping, dining and services by the American consumer. These results give us confidence that the improvement we've experienced over the last several months will continue as more markets and businesses find a pathway to reopening safely and operating successfully in the new normal. This is especially relevant as we think about the Pacific Coast and particularly California, where the most restrictions on non-essential businesses and restaurants remain in place. This geographic and category concentration comprises a majority of our uncollected rent and we expect continued improvement in our results as California reopens. Supported by the continued improvement in our cash collections and overall financial performance and consistent with our longstanding commitment to building total shareholder value over the long-term, we have again maintained our quarterly dividend, which has remained consistent throughout the pandemic. As always on a quarterly basis, our board and management team will continue to monitor and revisit all relevant metrics and factors when making future dividend decisions. While we are pleased with the improvements in the progress, we also recognize that meaningful uncertainty about the future remains. The restrictions that remain in place in some markets are putting a strain on the health of the impact at tenants. And in that context, while our tenant fallout has been limited to date, we're mindful of both the cyclical and structural challenges, impacting many tenant categories. And we acknowledge the risks of further tenant bankruptcies and store closers in this environment. But again, there are clearly visible green shoots and we are on the road to recovery, still likely to be an extended one and the length of which could be dependent on the existence and timing of medical solutions. While we certainly can't control the hand we've all been dealt, but we can control is that Regency came into this pandemic as prepared as we possibly could have been due to our unique combination of unequaled strategic advantages, which include and have never been more critical. Our geographically diverse portfolio of high quality, grocery anchored open-air centers that serve as the backbone of our communities with a focus on necessity, service, convenience, and value. Our sector leading balance sheet and liquidity position affording us financial flexibility. Our strong but flexible value creating development pipeline that has allowed us to quickly adapt to the evolving retail landscape. And finally, our people, it's times like these, when the value of experience and relationships become most apparent and important. We acknowledge the challenges facing our industry, accepting that we are not unaffected, but the game is always changing and our playbook will continue to evolve along with it as it has throughout the years. We are not standing still. Regency is working with, partnering with and helping our tenants adapt to the new normal. And we are certainly in a relative sweet spot with a seasoned team, a high quality grocery-anchored portfolio and a strong balance sheet. Jim?
Jim Thompson: Thanks, Lisa, and good morning. I reiterate Lisa sentiments regarding our appreciation for the Regency team and all of their incredible efforts this year, particularly our operations team members in our 22 field offices across the country. We have been in constant communication with our tenants throughout the pandemic to ensure we've done all we can to enable them to open and operate safely. It's hard to believe more than seven months have passed since the shutdowns began. And I continue to be amazed and inspired by our team's capacity to deliver results while keeping their energy and spirits high. I'd like to provide some color on the investor presentation we posted yesterday. As of the end of October, 97% of our tenants are open, up modestly from quarter ago and compared to 75% open as of the end of May. At this point, the limited number of tenants that remain closed are generally comprised of entertainment, restaurant, fitness and service users in certain regions of the country where stricter government mandates are still in place. We continue to see improving base rent collections. And most importantly, our collection rate has improved sequentially with each consecutive month. Our strongest categories in terms of collections remain grocers, drugstores, banks, and home improvement, while not surprisingly, we continue to see our lowest collection rates among those tenant categories that have not been able to fully reopen or operate due to local restrictions. This is also evident in our collection rates by geography. There are many markets where our collection rate recovered to 90% or above in the third quarter. This is encouraging as we think about the opportunity for continued improvement in markets like California and the Pacific Northwest, where collection rates continue to weigh on our portfolio average. It's important to highlight that Pacific Coast comprised nearly half of our uncollected rent in the third quarter. As we communicated previously, we have been implementing a very intentional strategy with regard to our tenants during this time and pushing for rent payment and deferral agreements. Our first priority has been getting tenants open and operating and then working on them with deferral plans that maximize their potential for future success, which in turn improves our likelihood of ultimately collecting that rent. The majority of our deferral agreements have been with non-essential tenants in our most challenged categories and we continue to see the greatest success in getting deferral agreements executed once these tenants are able to open and operate. Our executed deferral agreements as of today require payback predominantly during 2021. We have also been successful at negotiating concessions from certain tenants in exchange for rent deferrals. This includes non-monetary concessions like landlord recapture rights, sales reporting requirements, and modifications to co-tenancy and use restrictions as well as some lease term extensions and early renewals. What was most encouraging this quarter was the rebound and new leasing activity, following much softer volume in the second quarter together with the renewal volumes remaining consistent with expectations. Retailers are most active in categories with little to no restrictions in place as well as those operators that have successfully adapted to the current environment and are performing well. We're signing new leases in categories such as grocery, banks, beauty, restaurants, and medical. Some of these leases were originated pre-COVID, but we're also executing new deals that were initiated well into the pandemic. While this activity is encouraging as we noted on last quarter's call, we are seeing pressure on rents in this environment, especially on tougher to lease space. Due to a lack of legacy anchor deals in the mix this quarter, which typically have strong mark to market upside, our new lease spreads were impacted. Also we remind everyone that our new lease spreads include all comparable space leases executed, including those older spaces that have been vacant for greater than 12 months. As category and geographic restrictions continue to ease, we see a runway for continued recovery. Tenants are learning to adapt and succeed in the new norm and are taking extra precautions to make sure customers feel safe. We've seen so many examples of that in the restaurant space where in many markets capacity restriction on indoor dining remain, but restaurant operators are flipping the script and we are helping them to do that by enabling greater common area access through our pickup and go zones as well as help with space and permitting for outdoor dining. In summary, we are very happy with the improvements we are seeing in rent collection and leasing activity. Customers are back shopping as evidenced by the continued improvement in foot traffic trends in nearly all our markets. While we are far from declaring victory, we are encouraged by the resiliency of our merchants and are seeing a more visible road to recovery. Mike?
Mike Mas: Thanks Jim. Good morning, everyone. While our financial results continue to reflect the impacts of the pandemic on our tenants, our collections and operations are moving in the right direction as I’ll discussed in more detail. Third quarter Nareit FFO includes a debt extinguishment charge this quarter of $19 million, or $0.11 per share associated with the previously disclosed redemption of our senior unsecured notes originally due in 2022. Nareit FFO was also impacted by an $8 million or $0.05 per share non-cash charge taken against straight-line rents receivable. These charges, which are not included in core operating earnings, are in addition to uncollectable lease income of $29 million or $0.17 per share in the third quarter. This quarter’s decline in same property NOI was driven predominantly by uncollectable lease income. Before we dive deeper into rent collections, let me touch on G&A, which in the third quarter is elevated as compared to the year ago quarter. The primary driver continues to be reduced capitalization of development related overhead, similar to our results in the second quarter. As discussed previously, we extended the timeline of approximately $150 million of investment in our pipeline at the outset of the pandemic. This flexibility and action, allowed us to preserve liquidity, as well as adjust to any changes in tenant demand. Longer term, the teams continue to work diligently to bring these value-add projects back into production when design and tenant demand thresholds are met. This shift in investment timing will continue to impact overhead capitalization from an FFO perspective, but importantly, reduce capitalization does not impact our total cash flow. Moving to NOI, as Jim discussed, we continue to see improvement in the base rent collection rate, from 72% as reported last quarter, to 87% in October. We ask that you refer to our updated COVID-19 disclosures on Page 32 of the third quarter supplement. The tables provide a good reconciliation to pro-rata billings showing what was collected and of the uncollected amounts what was accrued versus reserved. Uncollected pro-rata billings in the third quarter totaled $41 million, which is down by nearly half when compared to Q2. In accordance with our lease-by-lease collectability assessment, we reserved nearly 70% of that amount. As evidenced by the additional $8 million write-off of straight line rent receivables this quarter, we did move some additional tenants to cash basis accounting.  In accordance with GAAP, we are not recognizing any uncollected revenue on these tenants, even if rents have been contractually deferred. As Lisa and Jim both discussed, the continued tight restrictions that remain in place in certain markets have disproportionately impacted specific categories of tenants. However, despite adding tenants to the pool, we saw a 30% sequential quarter-to-quarter decline in our third quarter reserve for uncollectable lease income. Driving this with a meaningful improvement in collections on the entire cash basis of tenant pool, rising from 46% in the second quarter to 64% in the third. Importantly, the improvement we are seeing in collections is driving an increase in our revenue recognition. In the third quarter, we recognized revenue equating to 90% of pro-rata billings and other income. That's up from 86% in Q2. This sequential improvement aligns with what we are experiencing in the portfolio. Improved collection rates on both current and Q2 billings, as well as quality deferral discussions with credit worthy tenants. Moving to our balance sheet, as Lisa spoke to earlier, we are fortunate that despite the disruption of the last nearly eight months, our balance sheet remains in a position of strength. Including the full capacity on our credit line and cash on hand, we stand today with immediate liquidity of nearly $1.5 billion, easily covering if needed development, redevelopment commitments, and debt maturities over the next four years. We raised $600 million from our bond issuance in May at a time of especially heightened uncertainty to pay down the credit line and shore up our cash position. And as previously disclosed, in September, we used a portion of those proceeds to redeem $300 million of notes originally due in 2022. We will continue to monitor the evolving landscape, but given the continuing positive trend, we expect to use remaining cash on hand to repay our $265 million term loan due early 2022. This repayment would likely be in the December, January timeframe and would result in Regency having no significant debt maturities until our next bond maturity in 2024. During the third quarter and subsequent to quarter end, we also closed on $25 million of dispositions at a 4.5% average cap rate. These transactions align with our continuing objective to improve portfolio quality and divest of non-strategic, lower growth assets. We would opportunistically look to sell more assets like these on a limited basis with an eye on preserving balance sheet strength. Taken together, our low payout ratio coming into the year, our very strong balance sheet position, our flexible approach to developments and redevelopments, and our improving collections have enabled us to maintain our dividend at its pre COVID level, which is a critical component of total shareholder return.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Mike. And thank you, Jim. Before we turn it over to questions, I really did just want to reiterate my appreciation of the dedication and commitment of the Regency team during this challenging time. I know many of you are listening, so thank you. Looking back on the last eight months, our primary focus has been on NOI and balance sheet preservation, while continuing to prioritize the safety and wellbeing of fellow team members, our tenants and our communities. I believe the results of these efforts are evident and I'm really proud of that. We are navigating through this pandemic with the long-term in mind, for which I'm confident we are well positioned. That concludes our prepared remarks. So we now welcome your questions.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] One moment, please, while we poll for questions. Your first question comes from line of Katy McConnell with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Katy McConnell: Great. Thanks and good morning. I’m wondering if you could provide some color on what the new backfill leasing pipeline looks like today? And given the negative new leasing spreads this quarter, can you discuss how you are thinking about balancing rent versus occupancy as you address your lease negotiations in this environment and whether that had an impact on the shorter lease terms?
Jim Thompson: Katie it’s Jim. You got a lot packed in that question. On the lease terms I would say that that kind of goes back to the mix. In our new leasing for the quarter, which I indicated did rebound pretty nicely, 108,000 feet in 72 deals, only two of those were anchor deals. So the majority of that population are shop spaces, which generally have shorter terms. As far as the rent growth associated with that, again, due to that small population of anchors, we had two Sephora, which is a great tenet that we got at over Cameron Village, had nice rent growth baked into it, but it was a JV deal, so we didn't get – with the pro-rata growth, it was not as impactful to the pool. And then the second one, which I'd like to highlight, just because, I think, it's a great deal, is a UFC Gym backfill, a 30,000 foot, 24-hour fitness rejected lease in Southern California. And the reason I say it's a great deal, it was a mid-20s lease, we were able to sign UFC at par, so it was a flat deal. But the best thing about it was we executed that deal before the lease was actually rejected. So our guys in Southern California hats off, kudos, did an outstanding job of getting out of that BK. As to pipeline, what I see as far as color in the pipeline, really from a national, regional anchor home improvement, off-price, TJs, the Burlington, Sierra Trading, we're engaged with PGA Superstore, on the shop side, the pet sector is still pretty solid Mansfield, sports bike shops are red hot, our price Five Below, fast casual food is still very good to Fort Lee Burger King, Chick-fil-A, medical obviously is – medical support are hot categories. And then obviously in the pads, we're seeing Starbucks very aggressive when order to buy, as well as some of the auto servicing and parts groups. So as I look at the pipeline, I'm really very encouraged by the level and quality of tenants that we're seeing in the pipeline. 
Katy McConnell: Thank you, Jim.
Jim Thompson: Did I get them all?
Lisa Palmer: You did.
Katy McConnell: Yes, I think you got them all. Thank you. And then just wondering if you can update us on the de-leasing impact that you might expect to see into 2021 if you prepped some of your larger development projects? And have your thoughts around timing of any those changed?
Jim Thompson: I think you're highlighting Katy the projects that we've been speaking a lot about, which would be the Abbot and Costa Verde in particular. Nothing has really changed in that regard. Those impacts to forward-looking earnings would be the same as we've talked about in the past. I think it was about $1 million at the Abbot of lost NOI. And that has in fact occurred. We are working on that building to bring it back to the lease-able condition at some point when that demand appears to us.  And then Costa Verde, we continue to pursue the redevelopment of that project as well. So we do anticipate that same trajectory of lost NOI. That number will not occur in one year, that will be strung out over multiple years. And I believe that number was in the $2 million to $3 million range. So no changes in that regard.
Katy McConnell: Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.
Greg McGinniss: Hi, this is Greg McGinniss on with Nick. Given the improving rent collections, what's your expectation very in that trend heading into year-end and at this point, do you have a better sense for what we should maybe expect regarding permanently lost rent from leases in place?
Lisa Palmer: Hey, Greg, It’s Lisa, I'll take that. Here – it's still, I'm going to go back to what Jim said in his prepared remarks and what I said in my prepared remarks. We're really pleased and encouraged with the improvement that we've seen from – we first shutdown in March and then picking up throughout the year. There's still some uncertainty. And as we said in our remarks, there's a really high correlation between opening and lifted restrictions with rent collections. And that's why we feel really good if things are to stay and gradually improve in these markets. So we see a pathway to more openings. We would expect that we should see some improvement in our numbers. But the reality is none of us really know, that are sitting around this table or that are on the call as to what may happen with the virus and with lifted restrictions. So I'm not allowed to – I can't possibly give you guidance. I think that's the best answer I can give you. We feel really good about the quality of our real estate, about the fact that we're close to neighborhoods, that we have a lot of essential tenants. And for the retailers, even in the non-essential categories and restaurants have really learned to adapt in this new normal and have created new ways to service their customers. And our team in the field is doing a fantastic job of actually helping them do that as well, with a lot of curbside pickup and dedicated parking spaces and looking to use technology to help connect the consumers with the merchants. So I expect we should see marginal improvement from here and the significant improvement will come when there's a medical solution.
Greg McGinniss: Okay. Thanks, Lisa. And then on leasing, I did appreciate the disclosure on rent collection by geography, which I thought was very interesting, but I was wondering if you could also discuss whether you're seeing differences in leasing productivity in spreads based on geography as well.
Mike Mas: Productivity, I would say – I'd have to say yes, again it gets back to, we have found even in deferral – in the deferral program until tenants are open and some of these folks kick back and have visibility towards reopening and what the environment looks like. It's very difficult to do deferral deals let alone new leasing. So where we have opened and we're 90% plus collection, foot traffic's back. We're seeing good activity. We're seeing a closer return to normalcy in markets where we're, still operating under mandated closures. Activity is probably slightly less. However, one thing that I will mention is, in this group of local tenants in Q3, we had about 25% that were really more non-essential, mom and pop in nature. We saw several of these in some of our tougher markets. We saw them in some of our tougher spaces. And at the end of the day, the way I looked at that was I felt like it was a very positive sign that those retailers in my mind have learned how to adapt, are looking at the future and are making their way, that demand is really in those non-essential categories is stronger than I would have guessed at this point in time. So I found that to be kind of a positive in our sample size of leasing in Q3.
Greg McGinniss: So I guess given that you've had maybe more limited leasing, where there's been greater restrictions and a little bit increasing vacancy numbers. Could we potentially see productivity increasing over the next few quarters? Is there enough interest out in the market from tenants right now to support that.
Lisa Palmer: I I'm going to – I'll just interject here because I had a conversation just this week with one of our leasing agents here in Florida. And he very encouragingly told me that he was working on getting some more transactions finished by the end of the year. And if he was able to get them across the finish line, but he was really optimistic about that he would actually meet his goals for the full year. So that tells me that, yes, we are seeing some pickup where markets are, again, that was here in Florida, where we may – where we see more opening. So I do think that will be the case. And you obviously also saw a decline in percent lease, which means we do have more space to lease as well. And that obviously also will translate to higher volumes and higher productivity.
Greg McGinniss: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Rich Hill: Hey, good morning guys. Please, I just wanted to follow up on that, point about where you stand today. And I recognize that you're not in a position to give a guide nor am I asking for one, but as we think back to maybe where you were in 2Q and then where you were at the NAREIT meeting in June, if you had a bull-case scenario, a base case scenario and a bear case scenario, where do you think you're falling out on that today versus your expectations a couple of months ago?
Lisa Palmer: Well, you just gave me a great opportunity to give the shout out to the tremendous team. Because the tremendous team we have here at Regency, so thank you for that. Because the information from the field, from our finance team, from everyone that is really the inputs into how we thought about those scenarios was fantastic. And I would say that we've, it was a lot more uncertain three months ago. So we have a lot more certainty and visibility today. And I would say that we're slightly better than perhaps even what our kind of base case was in terms of cash collections. And we've taken that data. And then I would just reiterate what I just said to answering the last question. There's still a lot of uncertainty in with what we know today, we expect that as if it's status quo, then we expect kind of status quo. And if we see improvements and restrictions lifted and markets reopen, then we would expect marginal improvement.
Rich Hill: Got it. And then, Lisa, I liked what you said at the beginning with the bigger is better, but better is better. And I'm sure you've learned –better is best, excuse me. I'm sure you've learned a lot of lessons as we all have on the other side of COVID. But as you think about your portfolio right now, do you still love all your assets or are there any sort of assets that maybe you'd look to dispose of given a market that seems to be holding in there? And what are the attributes that you might be looking for to make you bullish on an asset than maybe you were this time last year?
Lisa Palmer: Let me answer that first, just broader. I think when you look at how our entire sector has performed throughout the pandemic, institutional quality shopping centers are performing well. I think beyond, as you asked the question kind of the bull versus bear, I think probably beyond what anyone would ever have imagined when I speak to friends, neighbors and family that are kind of outside of our business, and you tell them that you're recognizing 90% of your revenues, they're like, wow, that's amazing in this type of environment. I do try to remind them that we typically, we collect 99.5%. But I think that alone says that we do have really high-quality properties in good neighborhood and that's across the sector. It's institutional quality. With that said, I mean for as long as I've been in the business and for as long as Regency has been a public company, retail is always evolving and you're always going to see changes within neighborhoods, within the merchandising of tenants. And that is why we've always remained really committed to kind of portfolio calling if you will, and disposing of 1% to 2% a year and active asset management. So there's always going to be centers that we don't necessarily love as much as some of our best centers. And we ranked them appropriately. I'm comfortable owning everything that we own, long-term. But there will be some that we will target for disposition. And I don't think that the nature of those has changed. We still really like neighborhoods with above average demographics. We still like shopping centers with a merchandising mix. that's going to appeal to all to the consumers that has a high percentage of essential tenants that is not unchanged from where we were pre-COVID. And with that fresh look, there's so much competition in today's retail environment that we need to ensure that we are working with our tenants, with our merchants, with our retailers to create a thriving gathering place for consumers to give them a reason to come in.
Lisa Palmer: Great. Thank you, Lisa. And Christie, if I didn't mention it congrats on the new seat. And if you are sitting in Jacksonville today, I'm a little bit envious. So look forward to working with you.
Christy McElroy: Thank you, Rich.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Craig Schmidt: Okay. Thank you. Your second quarter and third quarter same-store NOI were somewhat lower than the average for your peers. I'm wondering, what are the factors that are resulting in that spread?
Mike Mas: Hey, Craig, this is Mike. I appreciate the question. I mean, listen, it's as hard for us to compare ourselves to our competitors as it is for you. But what I can say is what's significantly driving our results that are uncollectable lease income estimates. And if I think about those uncollectable estimates and where they're coming from is, at this point in time it's coming from the collection of tenants that is really coming from three different types of categories, whether it's geography, those regions within our portfolio that are more restricted and those tenants are unable to operate at full capacity. And within that, those regions tenant categories matter significantly. So are you in a fitness, many restaurants where those restrictions are even more damaging, and then obviously credit comes into the equation and those would focus us on more local shops, where the local credit may not have the ability to bridge those tenants from a pre-pandemic to after the fact. So I think that combination certainly has something to do with it.
Craig Schmidt: Great. And then in terms of thinking about the new leases you signed in the third quarter, how long is it going to take for them to actually be open for business?
Mike Mas: Craig, I think we're operating about like our historical averages. Let’s say we're generally from lease execution to doors open 90 days to 120 days, depending on the deliverable shape of the space. 
Craig Schmidt: So these new tenants are trying to wait – we laid out the virus.
Mike Mas: No. The folks that are engaged today are engaged. We're kind of back in business. We're delivering as fast as we can. And the tenant expects the same. 
Craig Schmidt: Okay. Thank you.
Christy McElroy: Thanks, Craig.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question. 
Vince Tibone: Hi, good morning. Could you elaborate on how tenant demand for new leases varies by region? And if any markets jump out as being particularly strong? 
Mike Mas: Again, Vince, good morning. I would say there's demand across the country, but again, the more open the geography is probably I would say correlates to the depth of demand. There's more comfort. There's more credibility, if you will that that people are comfortable there. They see the return of the consumer. They're seeing sales from their peer groups. And it just seems to make life easier as you would expect when things are open and operating closer to full capacity, you get better activity.
Vince Tibone: Makes sense. Thanks. Thanks for that. Switching gears a little, what needs to change in your mind to unfreeze the private transactions market? And could you also touch on just the current state of CMBS availability in terms for shopping centers for potential buyers of your centers? 
Lisa Palmer: Thanks. I'll direct traffic here. We'll let Mac answer the transaction part of the question, and then Mike will take the CMBS.
Mac Chandler: Sure. Thanks. Vince, we haven't seen a ton of transactions that have consummated, but you are seeing more and more of them. And those transactions are typically they're smaller sized centers because buyers just it's easier to get your head wrapped around a smaller rent roll. And they're typically transactions where tenants are open and they're essential tenants and they have vibrant grocers and generally markets that are less restrictive, the more restrictive.  So you are seeing more price discovery out there. What we've seen is, the premier high quality centers, the types of centers that we own for the most part. Evaluations really haven't moved internally. They're really pretty close to what they were before COVID. That does vary a little bit by geography, because in some areas, tenants are more open than others. But we've been pleased to see that there is demand from experience retail investors who were looking to expand their platform and they're able to underwrite transactions. And I think we're going to see an increased amount of that. We're not going to see the volume that we have last year, but the volume looks like it's going to get better month over month, and we'll see that continue into 2021.
Mike Mas: Hi, Vince. It's Mike. Let me follow up on that from a financing standpoint. We have the benefit with our portfolio and our JV relationships to be pretty active in the secured debt market. And we're going through a financing at the moment and I'll tell you we've been very pleased to see that for our quality combination of the central retailers or grocery anchor doing very good business, great location in Northern Virginia. We're seeing good demand from the lending community to finance the project. It's not – the demand is not what it once was for sure. But I think sponsorship, asset quality and location are all proving that we can find pretty well-priced debt, all things considering. I would say to specifically on the CMBS front. We are seeing CMBS lenders being very interested in this product type. And I would characterize their interest is from an economic perspective on a race spread as being tighter than that, of more of the classic secured lenders in the life company field. A lot more to go, we're still in the middle of the process, but feel good about finding a solution here.
Vince Tibone: Thanks for that. And just maybe one quick follow-up there. How about LTVs for that good – even the good combination of sponsor, quality location or LTVs where they were before COVID and how are lenders thinking about the V in that equation? Have they still using kind of January levels? Are they taking a small haircut?
Mike Mas: There's a haircut. And we understand that the V in that equation is less than it once was. I'd say it's not materially so. And they're going to rely on the appraisal community, of course, as a backstop. And we know that in that regard that those Vs tend to move pretty slowly. But everyone's sizing to debt yields. What I'm seeing is, minimum thresholds that look like they did in the past. And I'd say, we're the type of borrower that's not looking for high LTV, so we're in that 50% to 55% range.
Vince Tibone: Got it. Thank you for all the color. 
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. 
Mike Mueller: Yes, hi. I have two quick ones here. One, how confident are you in the 2021 redevelopment starts? And then do you still see Serramonte as a core long-term holding?
Mike Mas: Hi, Mike, it’s Mas, happy to take those. We've – you've seen how our disclosure on Page 17 we've listed out are our projects that we expect to start. Obviously there's ones that are sooner, we're more confident in 2021 is right around the corner. And but they are still dependent on external variables. So I'll give you 22 example, Costa Verde, we have a hearing next week to get our entitlements, for example.  Until those things are done, you can't have a 100% confidence, but what we are confident is these are terrific properties that have great long-term potential for densification redevelopment, and there's great value creation in them. So we'll start these projects when we have real clear visibility on underwriting our NOI, a clear visibility to understanding the risk adjusted returns, and we'll use the same high standards that we've used in the past to underwrite them and make appropriate business decisions. So we'll give more guidance as we get closer. But we really liked these projects and we intend to start them. But some factors are beyond our control. On Serramonte, that's a property that we have great long-term faith in. So we anticipate holding that for the very long-term. We liked the fact above everything is that it's 80 acres of free and clear land just south of San Francisco. And there's lots of various opportunities to create value in the short term and the long term. For example, we're embarking on to drive through ground leases that will start later this year that have a very nice return to them. And we also have opportunity to retain it, the former JCPenney box, which is arguably our best space. So we're engaged with several retailers about that, and we just think long-term, there's really, that's a unique asset that will continue to grow and do well for us.
Mike Mueller: Got it. Okay. That was it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. 
Linda Tsai: Hi. Can you talk about lease terms and the current leasing environment and how that plays into your negotiations with tenants?
Jim Thompson: Yes. Linda, this is Jim. What we're seeing in lease terms really isn't that much different than historical, quite frankly. I would say the only tweak to that might be in the more in the renewal environment where there's, again, in those non-essential smaller local tenants, there's probably more anxious towards the future and they're less willing to potentially pop their option as stated look for shorter term. And I think we're both on the same page there. We liked the tenant, but let's get our sea legs underneath this us and talk again in two, three years. So that would be the only thing I would say that I've seen, that's a little different than normal but new deals and in general, essential, non-essential players are taken options, stated options, no negotiation business as usual. And that'd be the same in new deals with those essential, non-essential players.
Linda Tsai: Thanks. And then in terms of tenants facing higher pressures, has it made sense to reevaluate your criteria for how you evaluate collectability, since the start of the pandemic given, various tenants performance to date, either on the upside or the downside?
Mike Mas: Yes. Hey, Linda, it's Mike. I think you've kind of nailed the change in our uncollectable lease income sequentially from second quarter to third. And we did in fact change our assessment of certain tenants because of that time that you're identifying. We moved about 4% of our ABR into cash basis tenants this quarter. And that's translated into our uncollectable charge. And that is driven, that change in mindset was driven by this, I've used this analogy internally about this weight that these – many of these tents are carrying. And with each month of these closures, that goes by the weight is heavier, and that is impacting our thoughts and our ability to collect rent that is owed. And that's where you're seeing the – as I said, in the in the front, that's where you're seeing the uncollected rents kind of clusters in certain geographies that are more closed it's within certain types of tenants. And it's specifically within a local kind of credit quality. So definitely change. On the flip side of that, if you look at our cash basis tenants and the entirety of the pool, this – we are also – we see this positive in our collection rate. We posted a 46% collection rate in the second quarter on that pool. Well, that's up to 64% this quarter. And in fact, looking into October, it's up to 66%. So while we've segregated those tenants into that cash basis pool, we are seeing green shoots and productivity, all of it – as you've heard from all of us today, tied to the restrictions and their ability to operate.
Linda Tsai: Thank you
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Floris Van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please proceed with your question.
Floris Van Dijkum: Thanks for taking my question guys. I intrigued about the regional disclosure on collectability and perhaps a little bit surprised that New York or the Northeast didn't get mentioned in lower collections as well. How much of an impact in your view is the local governments on the ability for your tenants to operate? And where do you see the greatest impediment is it in regions you've mentioned?
Lisa Palmer: I mean, we're all looking at each other, like who wants to take this one? I'll start. So I think that there's no question, geography matters. So does percentage of essential versus non-essential and you can't look at either one of them in isolation? So we have a higher percentage of essential in the Northeast than we do in California, which is why it wasn't necessarily mentioned in kind of the opening remarks or some of the answers to the questions. And the restrictions do matter, and this goes back to what we talked about on earlier calls specifically when it's for restaurants and for fitness and for those – for the indoor activities, or if you will, where people need to come into the store, because a lot of the non-essential and the restaurants that are more fast casual have been able to have been able to really adapt and recover sales from a takeout and from a curbside. But the ones that you need to come into the store for indoor dining, in the areas where the governments have imposed restrictions, where capacity is still limited at 25%, it's just really difficult for those operators to make the numbers work. So it absolutely has an impact. And as you increase, at 50%, I think you get some that are more willing to lean in and try to make it work. But then if you have the threat of a future shutdown again, that could potentially wipe them out and because it takes capital to reopen and that's – that is what we're – that's what we're seeing; and that's what we're feeling, but you can't look at geography and isolation. It absolutely has to; you have to take into account the present essential as well.
Floris Van Dijkum: Thanks Lisa. Maybe one follow-up question in terms of, I mean, you guys are in an enviable position in terms of your balance sheet clearly, and in terms of your portfolio collections on demand, as you say on the road to recovery, I think was your quote. As you look at opportunities going into 2021? Do you think that there's going to be more opportunities on one-off assets with private owners, or do you think there are going to be portfolios or other larger transactions you could be looking at?
Lisa Palmer: I think that it's – I appreciate the question. Thanks, Floris. I think that it's still too early to know for sure, but I do like how strong we are positioned. And we've been, I think saying that consistently, that I feel really confident about how we will come out on the other side of this and how we will emerge position to continue to be a leader. And we will continuously look for those opportunities and take advantage where we can. And some of our – some of our really successful development, some of our really successful acquisitions came out of other cycles and it's being prepared to be able to capitalize on them. And I believe we are taking all the steps that we need to do in order to do that.
Floris Van Dijkum: Thanks, Lisa.
Operator: Your next question is a follow-up from Katy McConnell with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Bilerman: Hey, it's Michael Billerman here with Katy and I would be remiss if I didn't offer my own congratulations to the Christy in her new role. And definitely I think Lisa; you've made a wonderful decision in hiring her. So congratulations.
Lisa Palmer: It's the best decision of 2020.
Michael Bilerman: For you. So I wanted to sort of go-back to thinking about the whole JV partner side and putting capital out. You've obviously had very long-term relationships with a lot of different capital partners. I guess within your holdings today with them. How eager are they to create some liquidity in those verses, how eager are they to go out and put capital out alongside of you in potential acquisitions?
Mike Mas: Hey, Michael; this is Mike, I'll start and Lisa can jump-in. We are very fortunate to have a very longstanding relationship with our existing JV partners. And they've been wonderful to work with in this environment. No eagerness at all from or nobody's crossed-off retail and put in sell orders, very, very patient. They've agreed with our approach to tenant negotiations, which has been, again, another testament to just the relationship we've built with them over time. And I'd actually kind of flipped it on it [indiscernible]. I think across the board, they understand that grocery anchored retail in the best neighborhoods of the country is where you want to be in this space, and they believe in that on a long-term basis. And I believe if presented with the right opportunity where you have confidence in the forward income stream, they would be there to co-invest with us on a continued basis.
Michael Bilerman: How do you think about perhaps larger scale opportunities and the discussion with Serramonte was a good one, and granted, I recognize that came from equity one, something that they had started. But there could be a fair amount of mall land and mall assets available around the country over the next little while, right? Because enclosed has not performed as well as, as outdoor. And you talked about Serramonte having 80 acres and you're right South of San Francisco. Is there a focus internally today about trying to source differentiated opportunistic value add type of deals where if you have strong partners, you're able to do those on a risk adjusted basis. But they're obviously these types of deals are not cookie cutter and maybe require a fair amount of work and time and capital.
Lisa Palmer: Michael, Serramonte is unique and it did come through with a larger acquisition, and we do feel really great about the real estate. But I'll go back to our unequaled strategic advantages. And number one is a high quality grocery anchored portfolio and to the – and that is really our focus. So to the extent that we can continue to create value with that focus, that will happen, but it's not – we're not looking for 80-acre parcels to invest capital. We still have a lot of opportunities in front of us with our owned assets and with our own redevelopment pipeline. And that is really, as we think about risk adjusted use of our capital that is where – that is our focus today.
Michael Bilerman: And then last question. If I go back to the Investor Day, which was, I think it's at the beginning of 2018. You talked a lot about sort of this whole asset quality DNA, both from a trade area DNA perspective, and then a individual asset DNA perspective. And you sort of went through and you graded all of your assets along those lines to eventually come out with that premier plus, premiere quality core, and non-core. I guess as you're seeing the markets evolve during this pandemic, is there anything as you run the portfolio, new markets that are coming up that would be stronger or markets that you're in today that are moving down the spectrum? Is there anything that you can tease out from that data at all?
Mike Mas: I appreciate your remembering that Michael, I was with Mike again. We're learning a lot about our DNA model
Michael Bilerman: Well to be fair, Katy remembered that I didn't. So let's get credit where credit's due. So...
Mike Mas: We are learning a lot about that model and we study it continuously and it's a guide, it's not a rule for sure. We think the model is proving out what we believe, which is that our suburban, near urban locations as measured by the demographics and the really supply constraints that DNA produces are holding up very well in this environment and will benefit from any changing landscape with respect to where people work. What I would also say at the same time is we didn't have a pandemic box in the math. And when you overlay – when you overlay a government imposed mandate that you cannot conduct business in a certain environment, it doesn't matter how much money the people make, or how many people are involved in that trade area, that the model will break down and we did – we have seen that. So this period of time, we'll have a lot of noise in the math but we are learning. I think what we're learning is that work from a location quality perspective, much of what we believed is confirming itself.
Michael Bilerman: Great. Appreciate the time.
Mike Mas: Sure.
Lisa Palmer: Thanks, Michael.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I would like to turn the call back to Lisa Palmer for closing remarks.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you very much all of you for your time today. Thank you to the Regency team one more time. And I look – it is Friday. So have a nice weekend and I look forward to seeing many of you, and I put seeing in air quotes in a couple of weeks. Thanks, all.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-08-04 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings. And welcome to the Regency Centers Corporation Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Laura Clark, Senior Vice President, Capital Markets for Regency Centers. Thank you. You may begin.
Laura Clark: Good morning. And welcome to Regency’s second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Lisa Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Mas, Chief Financial Officer; Mac Chandler, Chief Investment Officer; Jim Thompson, Chief Operating Officer; and Chris Leavitt, SVP and Treasurer. As a reminder, today’s discussion contains forward-looking statements about the company’s future business and financial performance. These are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements are included in our presentation today and on our filings with the SEC. The discussion today also contains non-GAAP financial measures. The comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this quarter’s earnings materials, all of which are posted on our Investor Relations website. Please note that we have provided an additional COVID-19 disclosure in this quarter’s supplemental package and have also posted a presentation on our website with additional information regarding COVID-19 Business Updates and Impacts. Lisa?
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Laura. Good morning, everyone. I hope you’re all doing as well as possible. First, I just want to open and acknowledge and thank the amazing Regency team. I’m extremely proud and grateful for the dedication and commitment our team has demonstrated during this incredibly challenging time. As we’ve continued to navigate through the last several months, the entire Regency team has prioritized the well being of their fellow team members, our tenants and the people and the communities that our property serve, while also making great progress in assisting tenants with successful re-openings, improved rent collections and rent deferral negotiations. As states and markets have lifted restrictions over these last few months, we’ve been encouraged by the success that our tenants have experienced. Our base rent collections for the second quarter including executed deferral agreements was 77% and nearly 80% in July. We’ve seen firsthand that as tenants have been able to reopen, consumers are eager to return to some sense of what was once normal and that means resuming some of their prior shopping behaviors. Despite the progress Regency and our tenants have made, we are keenly aware that there’s still a lot of uncertainty ahead. It is so difficult to predict the future and we know that this situation will continue to evolve and maybe more challenging as this disruption is even more prolonged. We don’t know for how long the virus will continue to spread without an effective treatment or vaccine. We can’t predict how resilient consumers will be or how tenants will be able to adapt and innovate or some tenants will need additional support in order to survive. But what we do know, as we look towards the future, we are certain of Regency’s combination of unequaled strategic advantages that we’ve worked to build over time. This combination affords us the opportunity to withstand this difficult time and I’m confident that we will emerge well-positioned for future success. The quality of our geographically diverse portfolio comprised of necessity based retailers has never been more important than it is today. Our development program was a pipeline of exciting value add projects is structured to provide timing and financial flexibility. Our highly engaged team achieving great results while doing business the right way, and perhaps, most importantly, in today’s environment, a balance sheet and liquidity position that was rock solid entering the pandemic, enabling us to absorb the body blows that we’ve endured the past four months. Given our strong balance sheet and belief that our rent collections will continue to improve over time, our Board again declared payment of our quarterly dividend at the same level. Our ability to continue the dividend at the current level is an output of a strong starting position of a very low payout ratio, combined with actual results that while certainly not up to our historic performance levels appear to not only have stabilized but to also be trending in a positive direction. Working closely with our Board, we will monitor our financial metrics and projections in addition to economic and industry trends, and we will make future dividend decisions based on the facts and circumstances at that time. Before handing over to Jim, I’d like to touch on Regency’s continued commitment to corporate responsibility. In addition to our strategic business advantages, Regency has always had a strong set of core values that have guided our business strategy since we were founded over 50 years ago. Among those core values is a commitment to do what is right, for the environment, our people, our communities and our company. By doing what is right in each of these areas, we’re effectively managing risks and ensuring the success and sustainability of our business. As I hope you saw in our recently published Annual Corporate Responsibility report, implementation of these initiatives occurs across all departments at Regency and is ingrained in our culture. I’m confident that this commitment to do what is right along with the combination of our unequal strategic advantages will continue to position Regency to be a leader in the shopping center sector going forward. Jim?
Jim Thompson: Thanks, Lisa. Good morning. As Lisa said, our top priority remains the well being of our team, tenants and communities. As of the end of July, 95% of our tenants are open, compared to 75% two months ago. The majority of tenants that have reopened experienced better than anticipated initial success and had been encouraged by consumer reception. Customers appreciate that retailers are taking extra precautions and measures to help them feel safe and welcomed in their stores. Regency is also working side by side with our tenants, including implementing increased safety and cleanliness procedures and installing enhanced signage and wayfinding. We will continue to make additional modifications and adjustments to help our tenants and their customers feel safe and comfortable. As highlighted in our business update posted on our website, as of the end of July, we have collected 77% of base rent for Q2, including executed deferrals. Looking beyond quarter end, we have collected 79% of July base rent on that same basis. We are encouraged that July collections have trended ahead of April, May and June as at the same point in time for those respective months. We have purposely taken a very deliberate approach to negotiating rent deferrals with our tenants. As tenants began opening or have visibility on when they would be able to open, we were in better position to understand their financial needs to open and operate successfully. Just as important, Regency has been able to obtain certain non-monetary concessions in our deferral agreements, including waiving co-tenancy clauses, lifting use restrictions, extending terms or requiring enhanced sales reporting. Even with tenants that are still limited on how they can operate due to government orders, such as full service, dining and fitness categories, we are seeing that the better operators are able to adapt to the circumstances and are creative in how they successfully operate their businesses during this time. For example, we have many nail and hair salons that have extended their normal operating hours in order to accommodate more clients. restaurants that are creatively using additional outdoor areas for seating, such as sidewalks and even parking spaces, and fitness operators that are hosting outdoor classes and adding additional class times to accommodate customer’s modified work-from-home schedules. At the same time, in certain markets that had reopened, but restrictions have since been put back in place, many tenants are unfortunately experienced a regression in the progress they have made over the last several months. Just as we did during the initial shutdowns and impose restrictions in March, we will continue to work with these tenants to provide support and flexibility as they navigate the evolving environment. While our operations teams have been primarily focused on providing support to our 8,000 in place tenants throughout the pandemic, we are also continuing to negotiate and execute new leases with retailers including grocers, off price, banks, home improvement, service users and restaurants. We signed over 120,000 square feet of new leases this quarter, including a new anchor lease with a home improvement retailer in a former Kmart space in Florida with rent over -- rent growth over 55%. Although, our net leasing volumes were down this quarter due to limited new leasing activity, it’s worthwhile to mention, that we renewed nearly 1.2 million square feet of leases with positive rent spreads. While the more -- majority of new leases signed in Q2 or begun pre-COVID, we are seeing tenant interest falling and it terms similar to pre-COVID expectations, while there’s no questions our op team is keenly focused on collecting rents due and papering lease modifications. This hint of new lease interest is energizing to me and certainly our leasing teams. Mike?
Mike Mas: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As we know, Q2 results were meaningfully impacted by rent collections that remained the low pre-pandemic level. To better understand its impact, we’ve enhanced our disclosure in our supplemental and I strongly encourage you to reference those added pages, if you haven’t already. I’m going to focus my comments on uncollected rents and specifically how those amounts are recognized in our results, both earnings and same property NOI. And I’ll finish with some comments on our balance sheet and liquidity position. Given continued uncertainty, we will not be providing forward looking guidance at this time. Uncollected pro-rata rents and recoveries billed in the second quarter totaled over $84 million. Following an extensive collectability review, based on a multitude of factors including credit rating, location and chain performance, tenant category, tenant communications and a host of other relevant inputs, we deemed nearly 50% of these rents, even if contractually deferred as likely to be uncollectible. To use a more common description, we’re accounting for these receivables on a cash basis. Meaning the income was not recognized in the quarter and will only be recognized as revenue when and if cash received. The balance of the uncollected pro-rata rents and recoveries billed in the second quarter, approximately $44 million was from tenants with financial and operational attributes, warranting being accrued as revenue and carried as a receivable at quarter end. Again, this includes rents that were contractually deferred. Importantly, when including accrued rents and recoveries, together with collected billings, Regency has recognized revenue in the second quarter, equating to 86% of total quarterly billings and other income. The uncollectible lease income charged this quarter. Again, moving tenants to a cash basis of accounting also resulted in a reversal of previously recorded straight line rent. On a non-cash basis, this negatively impacted the second quarter by approximately $19 million. Together, current quarter uncollectible lease income charges are impacting NAREIT FFO by $0.35 per share. Moving to the balance sheet, during the quarter we took additional measures to enhance our already strong liquidity position by issuing $600 million of 10-year bonds and repaying the defensive draw we made on our line of credit in Q1 bring in our line capacity back to a full $1.2 billion. As of quarter end, we are carrying approximately $600 million of cash on hand. Together, with our earnings announcement, we also noticed our intent to redeem the entirety of our $300 million of bonds maturing in 2022. The stronger than anticipated rent collection rates in the quarter, combined with the progress we are making on tenant negotiations, gives us confidence to use the material portion of our cash balances to retire this near-term debt and eliminate the added interest expense. We continue to have a $265 million term loan outstanding maturing in 2022 and we will monitor our progress and the evolving retail landscape over the next several months before deciding to retire any additional near-term obligations. With our line of credit fully available and our pro forma cash balances following the bond redemption, we remain very well-positioned with over $1.5 billion of liquidity more than covering development, redevelopment commitments and debt maturities through 2022. Before we turn to your questions, there was one person deserving of a special mention this quarter. Laura Clark will be leaving Regency for an exceptional opportunity within REIT Land and we could not be happier for her. Laura’s contributions to Regency had been significant, as everyone on this call likely knows and while she will be missed, we are excited to watch your career continue to grow. Best of luck, Laura, and from your Regency team, thank you. With that, we’d be happy to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Christy McElroy with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Christy McElroy: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. It looks like local tenants comprised 23% of your ABR but only about 16% of the deferrals that you’ve agreed on. Can you sort of discuss your approach to dealing with those local tenants and attempting to collect rent, maybe specifically restaurants. There’s been a lot of press reports about permanent restaurant closures. There’s obviously a lot of concerns that non-payment of rent potentially turns into vacancy. I’m just trying to get a sense for your strategy to both collect that rent, but also mitigate that potential occupancy loss within your own portfolio?
Mike Mas: Sure. Hey, Christy. This is Mike. Let me start with a little bit on our disclosure and then I’m going to pass it on to Jim to more directly, I think, answer your question. We did highlight our local exposure and then we also highlighted our collection rates for local tenants both for the quarter, as well as in July one, and you see a decline in rate of collection there. I’d like to note, however, that we have found that the local payers have been later than our national tenants. So measuring one month of local payment rates versus three months has been, I just want to make that distinction that, the local tenants have been paying a little bit later in this environment. In fact, if you were looking at our collection rates in July, at the same point in time as that of April, May and June by months, you’ll see that that local collection rate is actually increased sequentially for all four months and we feel like that momentum is pretty positive and consistent with the other directional changes that we’re seeing in our portfolio. With respect to the follow up, I’ll let Jim give you some color.
Jim Thompson: Yeah. Christy, what I’d say is, we’ve been very, very focused over the last eight years, 10 years, 12 years in our proactive asset management of merchandising and really enhancing the quality of our smaller shop tenants. So, as we look at that that group as a whole, that -- they’re really good entrepreneurs, the business is their livelihood, so they’re very invested. They’ve got significant skin in the game and they’re important players within the merchandising shopping center. So, by and large, they’re nimble, they’ve reacted well to the changing environment, our -- as I said in the opening remarks, I think, our teams are actively engaged in deferral plans to assist these folks get back on their feet. We’re clearly going to have some fallout at the end of the day, but by and large, these retailers were doing well pre-pandemic and we want to do the best and everything we can do to help them survive and thrive post-pandemic.
Lisa Palmer: And if I may just quickly address the restaurant closures, I don’t think that there’s any doubt that we’re going to see a lot of failures in the restaurant category. But I think that the numbers that you see and the news reports that you’re reading really are looking at America as a whole. And I like where we’re positioned, close to the neighborhoods, close to people’s homes. And also from an exposure standpoint, we have a lot less in sort of that fine dining, if you will, which I think is going to be probably the hardest tip. But as more people continue to work-from-home, and perhaps, moving forward as people continue to work-from-home even in a permanent state, I do believe that having those options for people close to their homes, the neighborhood community shopping center, we’re still going to have restaurants as an important part of our merchandising mix that are -- at our really high quality portfolio going forward.
Christy McElroy: Okay. That’s helpful. And then just thinking about the broader, including national and regional tenants, and, Jim, you mentioned in your comments in the opening remarks, being thoughtful about future performance and thinking about future performance and doing those deferral deals, have you done any rent abatements to-date? And in terms of that, looking at that unresolved bucket overall, what is your desire to keep pushing for deferral agreements, so pushing that deferral percentage higher here versus going down the road of litigation eventually?
Jim Thompson: Christy, that’s a great question. And I’d like to answer that by kind of opening up our playbook on the whole deferral process and our approach to it. As I said last quarter, we started out being patient deliberate. We didn’t engage in the original on slot rent relief request back in March and April of that rather prestart tenants, we want them to get open and we’ll address their needs when there’s visibility. And now that we moved from 59% of our retailers open at the end of April to 95% today, I think, we’re now in a more rational environment both tenant and landlord, we both have much better clarity and visibility as to needs. And we’re finding good common ground for fair trade offs between a repayment plan and non-monetary concessions to create win-win for both of us. So as we kind of rewind early on in the process, we initially prioritized our top 300 tenants, which represents about 70% of our ABR and that was the first group we actively went out to work out agreements. But as of today, as we sit here, we’re actively engaged with every one of our open retailers -- open and operating retailers, crafting modifications where needed and you can kind of see that priority strategy evidence in the 84% national and 16% local executed deferral agreements. So that mirrors exactly how we attacked the situation. Obviously, the categories that are hardest hit theaters, entertainment, fitness uses, full service restaurants, child related services. We continue to be very patient with this group, as these uses in general are still closed or operating under limited levels of occupancy. So, again, just to reiterate, we’ve been very delivered in the papering process, as evidenced by the 4% executed deferral that you might see that stat in the investor slide deck that we sent. But the majority of uncollected rent is from tenants that we have ongoing relationship and dialogue with today, but have yet to pay for the agreements. We believe we will continue to close the gap on this uncollected bucket, but each deal is individually in nature and it will continue to take time to resolve.
Christy McElroy: Thank you.
Jim Thompson: I will add the -- I will add one thing, I think, it’s important. Well, tracking these exact -- these deferral agreements is important. You really can’t lose sight that our existing leases are binding contracts and the deferrals are just modifications outlining payback programs. The collectability of the outstanding receivable is really the key to the success and really coming out the other side of this pandemic the way we want to see it.
Christy McElroy: Thanks so much for the color.
Operator: Thank you.
Lisa Palmer: Thanks, Christy.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
Derek Johnston: Hi, everybody. Thank you. When we look at the cadence of NOI going forward, it’s fair to say that you are now operating and growing for a lower -- from a lower base. Should we expect the lag and occupancy declines as you possibly move tenants out, as it seems occupancy held up better than the NOI decline indicates? How should we think about that in our models?
Lisa Palmer: Derek, I mean, you are right. We have not been, as Jim just described in terms of the negotiations with our tenants, we certainly haven’t been evicting tenants. And there are going to be many that will fail and we know that. Even Laura’s last day, she would be given me the eye that I’m not allowed to provide any future NOI guidance, so I’m going to refrain from that. But, absolutely, do expect that we are going to see occupancy declines and the NOI is reflecting, the reserves are reflecting some of that today.
Derek Johnston: Okay. Actually, thank you. That’s helpful. And something a little more positive, feeling omnichannel now post-COVID is really emerging as the gold standard for navigating sales and wallet share for your tenants or retailers. How are you positioning Regency to capture the increasing demand trends of the omnichannel efforts and how are you facilitating bringing in tenants with the strategy and focus?
Lisa Palmer: I’d ask -- we’ve been saying this for a long time now. What we like about our strategy. What we like about our portfolio is the fact that we really have -- we are close to the neighborhoods. And we have a really high quality portfolio as most publicly and even -- and prior to institutionally owned shopping centers are, there are 30,000 to 40,000 shopping centers in the U.S. and we are going to continue to see store closures. We know that. But physical presence remains such a critical component in this omnichannel world, these retailers are going to keep those stores that are most productive, that have the highest quality, that can touch the most people and we’re really well-positioned to take advantage of that. What this pandemic has done has really just accelerated that trend. To accelerate it for the retailers because they’ve been forced to really innovate and move faster. And we’re going to continue, Jim, even mentioned it in his prepared remarks, we’re going to continue to do all that we can to facilitate for that retailer, so that we can partner with them and best enable them to satisfy their customers, which are our customers as well our shoppers.
Derek Johnston: Okay. Great. And lastly, how are you thinking about the development and redevelopment projects? When do you anticipate returning back to offense and moving value enhancing projects forward at a more rapid rate?
Mac Chandler: Hi, Derek. This is Mac. We continue to evaluate these projects one at a time. Each one takes a lot of experience, a lot of discipline that we’ve always shown. And when we start a project is based on a lot of factors, some of its pre-leasing, some of it’s the format, some of it is the location, it’s really a risk adjusted return at the end of the day. And so we’re setting up projects that are ready to go and some that aren’t ready to go, but we’re continuing to advance entitlements to put ourselves in a position to start. So that when we have visibility to a green light position, we’ll be in a position to start. So it’s tough to tell you exactly when each project is going to start today, but we have lots of experience in this and we’ll know on a case by case basis when to start projects. And I think we’ll be able to also take advantage of a declining construction costs which will help our yield as well. And so we’re setting ourselves up well, having this platform of offices throughout the country where we have local sharpshooters and local teams ready to go. I think really gives us a distinct advantage. So we’re excited about that and the teams will be ready to start these projects when conditions present themselves.
Derek Johnston: Thank you.
Mike Mas: Hey, Derek. This is Mike. Just -- I am going to follow-up on Mac’s comments, because I think, it is a balance, as well as Mac and team are preparing at the property level and tenant demand, and in fact, will probably drive much of that decision making. We’re also thinking about funding, right? So we need to align both the opportunity with the development, with the opportunity on the funding side. And as you know, prior to the pandemic, with free cash flow being our primary funding source of our development pipeline, that may change, but we have access to multiple sources of capital, whether that be property sales of lower growth assets or potentially even new capital in the form of debt or equity. We’re preparing on that front as well.
Derek Johnston: Thanks, everybody.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Craig Schmidt: Thank you. Just some thoughts regarding your exposure by use, do you see as you go through the process of maybe decreasing your exposure to fine dining, fitness and possibly personal services, as some of those shakeout and maybe you’re not as quick to release to those uses again?
Mike Mas: I’ll start with a couple comments and I think, Lisa or Jim will jump in as well. Number one, first on fine dining, we’re only 1% exposed to the category. So, although, it’s included in that line item on our disclosure, it’s a very small component of our rent roll. And fitness being 4%, we actually still remain in the long run. We’re still pretty bullish on the category. We think fitness -- personal fitness and health is certainly a secular trend and I think this pandemic is probably even highlighting that even more. So we still like that idea going forward. Boutique fitness, we believe will continue to be a good use for our shopping centers. On the personal service side, again, something that we still have a long view on in a positive fashion. So we think -- and we think our shopping centers provide that necessity to our consumers really well.
Lisa Palmer: I mean, I think, Mike hit most of it, just thinking and reminding about kind of our property type. In that -- one thing that is certain is that it’s always available. For as long as we’ve -- I’ve been in the business, for as long as Jim’s been in the business, you’re continually seeing failures and then new concepts. And I imagine that we will continue -- we will see innovation and new concepts from this disruption. And I don’t know what those are yet, but I expect that our future leasing will probably include leasing to some of those new concepts and we may have older concepts, if you will, that will fade away.
Craig Schmidt: Okay. Thank you. And then just…
Jim Thompson: Rest you can model on…
Lisa Palmer: Yeah.
Craig Schmidt: … given the spike in California, Texas and Florida, I am wondering if you are seeing a reduction in terms of discretionary good spending in the last couple of weeks?
Lisa Palmer: I think it’s too early to really tell. What I will, I mean, as we probably all do, gosh, I tried to read everything I can all the research report, falling mobility data and open table reservation. And we did see -- I think, we did see a very temporary drop in those exact spots that you mentioned, Craig, but then recovered again pretty quickly. Whether there is any permanent kind of reduction in increased traffic. I think that’s too early to tell. But the consumer really has -- they’ve been resilient, which is been really encouraging to us. Any data tool that we’ve used to track foot traffic has been, honestly, positively surprising in some instances as to how much traffic has recovered.
Craig Schmidt: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.
Greg McGinnis: Hi. This is Greg McGinnis on with Nick. Lisa, you mentioned that the reserve reflects some of the expected occupancy decline. And I am wondering if you might be able to provide some more context on the expected short- versus long-term impact of uncollectable Q2 rents. So, basically, how much of that rent could we maybe strip out to create a run rate from what today, or maybe said differently, how much of the uncollectable rent is effectively a Q2 rent abatement, but the tenant is still viable and will survive to pay rent in Q3?
Lisa Palmer: Okay. I’ll let Mike address that.
Mike Mas: Great. I appreciate the question. I think you’ll appreciate the response. It’s very difficult to give you some of those directions that you’re looking for. Let me help you here. For the quarter, we -- at the end of quarter we effectively moved about 20% of our tenants to a cash basis of accounting. So that leaves 80% on accrual, right? Collection rates within that cash basis bucket were at 40%, and in fact, when you pull the same data in July, they have trended to 50% collection rates. So I think that is a good element for you to consider as you look forward in our portfolio, how to think about that reserved rent effectively representing the 60% that was uncollected within that category. From an accrual basis perspective, we collected 80% of that 80% of our exposure. But, obviously, because of how we feel about those tenants from an operational perspective, as well as a credit perspective, we’re accruing that rent. And I think, bottomline, what we felt like was most important is that for the quarter, we recognize revenue equal to about 86% of our total potential rent and that’s where our eyes are focused on. As Jim’s team continues to make progress with deferrals and bringing and modifying contracts as he articulated, we feel good about the collectability of that 86% of our rents either represented by actual cash collections or good visibility towards that.
Greg McGinnis: Okay. Thank you. Appreciate this clarity on the disclosure. And I’m just curious how much, you said, that occupancy is still kind of trending down, you said [ph]. But I’m just curious how much of the uncollectible rent piece is actually due to tenant move out and bankruptcies at this point?
Mike Mas: I will answer, very little. I mean, we’ve had a couple of questions here about abatements and there’s been effectively zero abatements to this point in time. But the reserve is there. Again, they’re on a cash basis with accounting, they’re only going to be recognized to the extent rents are received, basis point is completely true. To the extent there is any fallout it would be reflected by that reserve amount. It’s just too early to tell to give any changes in any occupancy levels not only for 2020 but certainly beyond.
Greg McGinnis: All right. Thanks, Mike.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Brian Hawthorne with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Hawthorne: Hi. So within the categories that you’re signing leases, there are a couple of that have only paid with like two-thirds or three quarters of the rent. Are you negotiating leases with tenants that are not paying rent currently? Like negotiating new leases?
Jim Thompson : No. This is Jim, Brain. No. We’re not.
Brian Hawthorne: Okay. Good answer. Okay. And then, have you guys seen demand change for certain locations within shopping center. I mean kind of looking at pads. Is there a higher demand there?
Mike Mas: I think the reality is that the pandemic brought about was certainly drive-throughs, everybody wants a drive-through today. So pad with a drive-through, I think, for the future is going to be a must, it’s going to be a very, very highly sought attribute. But other than that, I think, the banks have been very active and their pad type of user. So pads are always seemed to be very resilient and the depth of tenant that like pad is generally pretty deep. So pads are pretty easy to work with.
Brian Hawthorne: Got it. Okay. Thank you.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Richard Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Ron Kamdem: Hi. You got Ron Kamdem on for Richard Hill. Just two quick one, going back to sort of the bad debt, and obviously, we’re not asking for guidance. But I think we’re all trying to figure out if there is another bad debt charge coming. So I guess the question really is, when I think about when we get to the end of 3Q and we’re looking at I think your report your July uncollected at 21%. Are you going to have to go through sort of the same exercise to try to figure out what’s uncollected and how much to reserve against it? And is there any reason to think that there’s something about this mix that’s either better or worse and it was in 2Q. So, again, not asking for guidance, maybe just high level color, how we should think about how that bad debt going forward a little bit?
Mike Mas: Sure. Hey, Ron. First and foremost, you can’t reserve for rent that hasn’t been billed yet. So, you’re going -- to the extent you have cash basis tenants in your shopping centers that continue to occupy space, and you’re billing rent and they haven’t paid in the third quarter by way of an example, you would have reserved. So it will come down to your thoughts, our thoughts, anyone’s individual thoughts around what percentage of that exposure will either start to pay rent or move out. To the extent they move out, you won’t have that debt expense, but you’ll have no income. So the impact would be the same. So I hope that’s helpful and how we and how -- the idea that there will no longer be bad debt expense. I think it’s misleading. It really is the idea around what -- how should we think about the performance of our cash basis tenants? So I hope the 80%, 20% be on cash basis is helpful. Again, 40% of those did collect rent -- did pay rent in the second quarter that is 50% as of July, I think, that’s a helpful statistic as well. Put in context of our opening percentages being materially higher than they were three months ago. At this point in time, that’s about the best we can give from a forward looking perspective.
Ron Kamdem: Got it. That’s helpful. And if I could just ask the follow-up on that, just thinking about, is it -- if I thought about your 21% uncollected and put a 50% ratio based on what you did in 2Q for bad debt, I guess, what am I missing if I did that, right. Does that make sense?
Mike Mas: It makes sense and that -- I mean, that can be an assumption. We can’t comment on…
Ron Kamdem: Okay.
Mike Mas: …whether that’s a…
Ron Kamdem: Yeah.
Mike Mas: …fair or unfair assumption.
Ron Kamdem: Got it.
Lisa Palmer: Well, what we don’t know is how many of those cash basis tenants that did not pay that we reserved for begin today? That’s what you don’t know and that’s what we don’t know.
Mike Mas: Right.
Ron Kamdem: Okay. That make a lot of sense and I appreciate you navigating that. The other question was just on, the straight line rent charge that was reversed in 2Q. Is sort of a similar the bad debt question, well is there -- should we be expecting sort of similar reversal or is there sort of an overlap something that can mitigate that in 3Q. I guess, how should we think about straight line rents going forward without giving up?
Mike Mas: Yeah. This one is -- yeah. No. This is a good question. It is different. So that is the one-time decision to move a tenant from accrual to cash basis for the standard, that’s a one-time reversal of the balance of the straight line rent. So to the extent those tenants remain as is the 80%, 20% split remains as is, you would anticipate less by way of straight line rent noise, so to speak in future quarters. But that’ll be dependent on how we assess collect -- assess tenancy going forward. So there -- the 80%, 20% is not set in stone at this point in time. But I will say from a procedural perspective, you put a lot of time into this quarter and thinking about our tenants thinking about the pretty high level from a standard perspective, a 75% probability or better that they will meet the demand of their contract. That’s a pretty high bar. And we -- so while I don’t anticipate a material amount of change from this point forward, we’re in a very unusual environment. A lot is changing month-to-month, quarter-over-quarter, so we will make that assessment again at the end of the third.
Ron Kamdem: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you. That’s all I had.
Mike Mas: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Mike Mueller with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.
Mike Mueller: Yeah. Hi. I guess, what does the Board sees the benefit of holding on to the dividend at the current level?
Lisa Palmer: I will -- I’m going to -- I just want to remind you, one, that we intentionally strengthened the balance sheet to position ourselves to weather the next economic downturn. We never quite expected a storm quite like this one.
Mike Mueller: Yeah.
Lisa Palmer: So I think it’s really important to remember that that the strength of our balance sheet and financial position coming into this, really it was a true differentiator for us. Our FFO payout ratio was in the low 60s. Our AFFO payout ratio was in the low 70s. That provided us with $150 million of free cash flow that Mike even alluded to earlier. We pulled back capital spend early. So we deferred that, essentially almost a like amount of $150 million capital spend. And this really provided a really big cushion for us. And so with that backdrop and the fact that we continue to see what we believe to be an improvement in rent collections going forward, it allowed us to declare our full dividends. And our future projections essentially cover our dividend payments, which is really, which is the objective. And so that’s why we have paid it. That’s a fact. The dividend is an output. It’s not a decision just to hold it, just to hold it. I’ll reiterate that our future decisions are going to be really deliberate. The payment this quarter doesn’t guarantee future payments. We have to continue to weigh all the facts and circumstances as they happen. But based on where we sit today, with the starting position and with what we are seeing with actual results, it makes sense to pay our dividend. As a REIT part of total return is the income return and that’s an important part of our total return.
Mike Mueller: Got it. Okay. And then, out of curiosity, the sequential small shop occupancy decline. Was that fairly broad based or was it concentrated? Can you just give us a little bit of color on that?
Mike Mas: Mike, yeah, I think, that was basically wrapped up in BK. We add, gosh, 16 -- at this point in ‘20 we have 16 brands that have filed, of which we’ve got 150 individual store locations and out of that, we’ve got 40 that we expect either have rejected or will likely reject. So the decline is primarily BK at this point.
Mike Mueller: Got it. Okay. That was it. Thank you.
Lisa Palmer: Thanks, Mike.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Floris van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please proceed with your question.
Floris van Dijkum: Good morning, guys. Question for me is on, what you see is going on with cap rates. And also as you think about your valuation, obviously, there are two things that are involved in valuing assets. It’s the NOI and the cap rate. Do you see any movement in cap rates or -- and maybe comment on what you think is going on in the public markets and your view in terms of what -- where you think how sticky values are for your asset costs.
Mac Chandler: Hi, Floris. This is Mac. I’ll take the first half of the question and hand it back over to Mike. In terms of cap rates, you’re not seeing for starters, a whole lot of the A quality properties, the types of properties that our portfolio is representative. Owners of these properties, I think, really recognize the long-term value and they’re not willing to sell them. There is really a scarcity of that product. But for those sellers that are willing to sell them, there is high demand for grocery-anchored neighborhood centers. The ones that are holding up the best are a little bit smaller because of just the amount of capital that’s in the marketplace. But we’re seeing cap rates really hold tight. They’re really quite strong. There has been -- buyers are trying to figure out how best to underwrite forward cash flows. And they’re cautiously underwriting limited growth for the next couple years and then in year three, typically, they’re sort of back to historical norms. So we have some properties that we have put on the market and we’re seeing a lot of demand. There is also demand for debt that’s allowing people to execute, 50% to 60% permanent loans are available at tremendous rates, better than we’ve seen a long, long time. So for our type of product, values are holding up really quite well. And I’ll let Mike talk about how that relates to our NAV.
Lisa Palmer: I’ll actually jump. I’ll give Mike a break. Since I keep tossing all of the reserve questions, too, I think, Mac said it well, and this is something that we’ve been talking about quite a bit. There is still -- I think that, I said it in my prepared remarks as well, neighborhood community shopping centers and essential retail has never been more important than it is today. And I think that you’re seeing that with how cap rates are responding. So they’re have -- while there is not much change in the applied cap rate, what’s really difficult to know is what is the NOI stream and also the cash stream even to recapture more NOI as we release. Because I do -- we do expect that there is going to be a significant amount of releasing that’s going to happen in the future that’s going to require TI spend. So from a valuation perspective, I mean, I can’t -- we’ve provided all of the information that we could provide. It really does come down to where does NOI settle and we’re not -- we don’t know that yet. It’s still -- it’s -- there’s still too much uncertainty. So where does that new kind of base settle and then from there, I do expect that we’ll have -- we will obviously have growth as it was pointed out earlier. We’re starting at a lower base. We’re going to continue to release and we’ll see probably above average same property NOI growth in our portfolio for a period of time. But it will take capital to do that. So I know that I didn’t exactly answer your questions Floris, but everyone’s estimates are going to be different and we are -- we just need a little more clarity as to when this is really over and then we can start to recover from there.
Floris van Dijkum: Thanks, Lisa. That’s it for me.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Gorman with BTIG. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Gorman: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Lisa, if I could just go back to your comments earlier on omnichannel and maybe drill down a bit, especially on e-commerce grocery, can you maybe talk a little bit about conversations you’re having with tenants about their e-commerce trends on the grocery side and maybe the rollout of newer technologies like MSCs and maybe how they’re thinking about your portfolio where they have much higher productivity you have some of the top locations in each market and allocating space within those stores for MSCs or are they looking elsewhere and how they’re kind of just approaching the e-commerce -- how they’re approaching ecommerce strategy right now?
Lisa Palmer: Sure. I would say, again, those conversations really haven’t changed much. The better operators were already focused on how can they best serve their customers in the most profitable manner. And they’re -- while they’re -- Kroger is focusing on the larger robotic automated warehouses partnerships with Walgreens. Ahold, I think, in Albertsons probably the most focused on the micro fulfilment centers. All of them and then we all know what Amazon is doing with Whole Foods and then Amazon Go and the rumored and real traditional grocery stores that they’re opening. All of them are focused on how best to serve their customers in the most profitable way and there is still no argument that the most profitable way today, because that change in the future absolutely never say never. But today it’s to bring the customer in the store. So they’re still all very focused on serving their customer in an omnichannel fashion, but to the extent possible the most profitable way, which is in sending them to come into the store. With that said, again, you see that, you do see all the better operators are investing more in technology and spending more on the different means of that happening. And we continue to have the conversations. We continue to partner with them. We continue to help them where we can to facilitate that delivery of their goods. And I don’t mean literally, I mean, within our shopping centers. It’s going to continue to evolve. We’re going to continue to see consolidation in the grocery. I think that scale matters. I think that having the cash flow and the money to invest and innovate and to invest in technology and invest in serving their customers, that’s where the winners will be.
Michael Gorman: That’s helpful. I guess just clarifying. I mean, when you speak to the grocers, the high productivity of their stores in your portfolio make them more likely to kind of leave those intact and look elsewhere for technological solutions in the market or is it -- is that not playing a role?
Lisa Palmer: Well, clearly, it plays a role when they think about their most profitable stores. It’s about their profitability. And typically, the more productive stores are going to be more profitable. So that certainly plays a role as when they’re thinking about their network of stores and fulfilment centers. They are going to be very reluctant to close something that is profitable. They could use that store as the core or the center of a little of a smaller network if you will and add micro fulfilment around it to continue to service the customers even out of that particular store. So it absolutely is an input and a variable.
Michael Gorman: Excellent. Thanks so much Lisa.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist Financial. Please proceed with your question.
Ki Bin Kim: Thanks. Good morning. So going back to the 14% of revenue reserves, how much of these rents from tenants for decently healthy pre-COVID? And how is this impacting the ways you’re thinking about helping these tenants? How?
Mike Mas: Yes. I appreciate the question, Ki Bin. I think let me answer it this way. So our cash basis, the percentage of our ABR that we had on a cash basis pre-COVID was only 3%. Now, as I stated earlier, we’ve identified a collection of tenants that equates to about 20% of our rent roll is now on a cash basis. So I think by extension and that 3% was primarily basically BK watch list tenants. So by extension, I would answer your question to say, the majority of them were healthy. But as Jim kind of spend some time on earlier from a local tenant perspective, at least, it -- this is a storm for them that is pretty challenging. And that it’s the severity of the circumstances, the inability to operate at all in some cases that has changed our perspective from a classification standpoint. But again I can’t reiterate that’s not 40% of those tenants are still paying rent currently and that is actually 50% right now through July. I don’t know, Jim, if you want to answer -- add anything to that.
Jim Thompson: No. Thank you.
Mike Mas: Got it.
Ki Bin Kim: Okay. And I appreciate the fact that your deferral arrangements are only 4%. I mean, basically deferral ranges are easy to give out and in some cases, when you worth the paper is written on. I’m just putting myself into perspective of tenants here for a second? Some of these -- lot of these local tenants are not built to pay a lump sum rents, right, just deferring it and paying it back in a year. And I would think maybe it’s a little bit of a ball on shackle to some of these local tenants. How are you thinking about that and if deferrals even make sense to a lot of your tenant base?
Jim Thompson: Ki Bin, that would be -- as we talk to these tenants and really understand their situation, their outlook for the future, their credit capabilities, all that goes into play. And we just take them one at a time and we’ll make the best decision we can. It’s -- part of it is if there are 15-year operators always done exactly what they said and they’re a great operator. I’m going to bend over backwards and try to figure out how to make that tenant successful. We got a lot of tools in the toolkit. We’ll employ them as we see fit. But we want to put our dollars where they can go the best to get the best result. That’s really all I can.
Mike Mas: Yeah. I will say this for Jim, because he is told me many, many, many times, we’re not going to put a tenant into a deferral plan that puts them out of business.
Jim Thompson: Right.
Mike Mas: And I think, Ki Bin, that’s the point you’re making. So we’ll be hit those tools. However, whatever they are either stretching payments out or maybe even sprinkling in a little bit of abatement. We’re going to make the right decision for the right tenant and they’re all snowflakes. And we have the long-term in mind and setting ourselves up and our portfolio up for success after we emerge into some sort of normalcy.
Ki Bin Kim: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Linda Tsai: Hi. Of the 16 brands that have filed in the 40 spaces have been rejected or likely to be rejected, when is the earliest you might expect to get those spaces back and any sense of whether you’d see more demands in the national brands or local tenants as backfill options?
Jim Thompson: Linda. This is Jim. We will be getting, I think, some of those rejections probably in the next 30 days or so. As far as demand, pre-COVID, we obviously had a lot of interest in, for instance, Tier 1. We are in dialogue with several of those. I think there’s still interest. I think the speed to market if you will of converting that interest into an executed document is slowed dramatically and I expect the same. At the end of the day, Lisa said, we think we’ve got great real estate. The tenants within our portfolio have historically operated at very high levels. As we get space back, it’s a supply and demand business. We think we’re going to have good product in good centers, and if the market allows it, we’re going to get more than our fair share of returning opportunities.
Linda Tsai: Thanks a lot for that color. And then just one other, how are you thinking about dispositions in the post-COVID environment. How might parameters around low growth have changed pre- versus post-COVID?
Mac Chandler: Linda, I can take that to start with. When we consider properties that are being disposed, we do it like we have been historically. It’s a ground up basis. We look for properties that might be non-strategic, certainly, low growth, just non-core properties that we’re not going to miss so to speak. So in today’s world, we’ll take a second look to make sure that we accurately forecast growth going forward. Will that change? Sure, certainly, I would think at some properties. So we’ll take it on a case by case, probably, a little too soon to have a perfect assessment of forward growth compared to pre-COVID times. But we’ll continue to look at that. But these are good properties to have as well. I don’t want to dismiss them. I think the buyers of our properties have done quite well and we wish them well. So I’ll let others update as needed.
Mike Mas: Hey. Thanks, Mac. It’s Mike. I’ll go back to kind of our funding plan and one thing I’d like to make sure you hear is that we’ll be a very disciplined. To the exempt property sales are a lever in our funding plan and they most likely will be. We’re going to be a very disciplined on the valuation. And I think Mac is exactly right. We’re going to have our own view of the forward NOI stream of these properties. And if the market is not giving us the value we believe we deserve. Well, we’re prepared to hold that asset and we will choose to hold that asset and we’ll make appropriate other funding decisions from that point. We have a large portfolio, a diverse portfolio. We have a lot of optionality within that portfolio to fund what we plan to have as a vibrant -- again a vibrant redevelopment and development opportunities set going forward.
Lisa Palmer: We’ve -- and we have always had a commitment to dispositions and, well, absolutely believe that we have a really high quality portfolio. Again, as I do -- as I believe most of the publicly owned companies do, everyone still has their lower quality and lower growth, even if we are in the top 10% of what’s owned in the U.S. And so we’ve always maintained that commitment to continually improve the quality of our portfolio and to continually fortify that future NOI growth rate. It’s an important part of our strategy.
Linda Tsai: Thanks. Good luck.
Lisa Palmer: Yeah. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Chris Lucas: Hi. Good morning, everybody, or I guess afternoon now, sorry. Just a couple of quick ones, just as it relates to, I guess, rent collection particularly on the more challenged lines of business. Does geography play a role in that? And then, I guess, sort of on the same geography line of thought, when you guys were pursuing litigation, does geography drive that as well?
Jim Thompson: Chris. It’s Jim. As far as impact on collection rates, I think, certainly, there is really three things that come into play. You’ve got kind of the essential category mix, which will drive that recovery, obviously. Geography certainly comes into play. We’ve got as you’re well aware, we’ve got areas within the country that have higher mandated closure still. So that will have a big impact. And then the local national mix, as I referred to earlier, in our strategy that local group is kind of the last group that we’re engaged with right now. So that will have impact on that same collection rate. Well, part two of the question was….
Chris Lucas: It’s related to litigation and geographies?
Jim Thompson: Oh! Litigation?
Chris Lucas: Yeah.
Jim Thompson: Chris, where we are in that is, if warranted, we’re taking legal action as tenants that have, number one, either have the ability to pay and have chosen not to or non-responsive or unreasonable tenants. In many cases, this approach of late has become pretty effective in bringing payments through the door or at least getting folks to the table for further discussion.
Chris Lucas: Okay. And then, Mike, I’m just curious, have you collected rent in, I guess, third quarter that was applicable to second quarter, just kind of curious how you’re dealing with that?
Mike Mas: Yeah. I think what I call the crossover rents about $8 million. So if you -- that we collected in July that was owed on quarter two. So if you want to think about our reserve as a percent of billings that would move it from 47% to 52%, Chris.
Chris Lucas: Okay. And then, of the -- I guess, the $8, do you have a split between what was the on a cash basis accounting?
Mike Mas: I don’t have that for. I’d have to follow-up with you on that one.
Chris Lucas: Okay. Okay. Great. Thank you. That’s all I have this morning.
Lisa Palmer: Thanks, Chris.
Mike Mas: Thanks Chris.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen that…
Lisa Palmer: Okay. Thanks…
Operator: I’m sorry. I’ll turn it back to Lisa …
Lisa Palmer: I was just going to jump in. Yeah. Thanks Lisa. Thank you all for your time today. Your continued interest in Regency, your support, I do hope that you all stay safe, wear a mask. And again, thank you to the Regency team. I really do appreciate this time that we’re living in is really hard for all of us. So thank you to everyone and good Laura. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today’s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-05-08 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings. Welcome to the Regency Centers First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants will be in listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. At this time, I’ll turn the conference over to Laura Clark, Senior Vice President, Capital Markets. Ms. Clark, you may begin.
Laura Clark: Good morning and welcome to Regency’s first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Lisa Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Mas, Chief Financial Officer; Mac Chandler, Chief Investment Officer; Jim Thompson, Chief Operating Officer; and Chris Leavitt, SVP and Treasurer. As a reminder, today’s discussion contains forward-looking statements about the company’s future business and financial performance. These are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements are included in our presentation today and on our filings with the SEC. The discussion today also contains non-GAAP financial measures. The comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this quarter’s earnings materials, all of which are posted on our Investor Relations website. I will now turn the call over to Lisa, who will address Regency’s key priorities in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. A presentation providing additional information regarding COVID-19 business updates and impacts is posted on our website. Lisa?
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Laura. Good morning, everyone. The last couple of months have been an experience that none of us could have ever imagined, nor one that any of us will ever forget. I hope you’re all well. I know several of you have been personally impacted during this challenging time. And our thoughts are with you. Our thoughts and appreciation are also with those on the frontlines, healthcare workers, public safety officials, first responders, delivery drivers, and to name many more, the employees of the many retail businesses that continue to provide our country with essential goods and services. All are working so courageously to serve, protect and provide for all of us. During this pandemic, Regency has been dedicated to ensuring the wellbeing of our team members, tenants and the people in the communities that our properties serve. We are fortunate to have the resources and systems in place to allow our teams to work remotely. At the same time, our property and asset management teams have continued to respond appropriately to any on-site tenant requests. I’m extraordinarily proud of how everyone at Regency has responded. And I’m especially proud of the tireless work performed by our property management teams. I thank all of you. As with any major disruptions, how well you are positioned at the beginning of that disruption is so critical. Those companies positioned in strength will have a significant advantage to emerge successfully. At Regency, we have worked diligently and thoughtfully to build a company that can withstand challenges and adversity, through the strength of our unequaled combination of strategic advantages, which have never been more relevant than they are today, our people, our portfolio, our development program, and our balance sheet. Our portfolio, a focus on necessity, service, convenience and value. More than 80% of our national portfolio of neighborhood and community shopping centers are anchored by a grocery store, with another 10% that include a mass merchandiser like Walmart or Target, a national drugstore or a home improvement store such as Lowe’s or the Home Depot. Our local teams, 22 offices throughout the country, I have been working diligently with tenants and vendors, enabling all of our properties to remain open and operating, allowing our tenants to continue to provide the goods and services that the surrounding neighborhoods need. In fact, in April, approximately 60% of our tenants will allow us to operate in some form, including categories such as groceries, drugs, banks, restaurants, pet and office supplies. The remainder of our portfolio was occupied by many best-in-class high credit quality retailers, such as TJX or Burlington, as well as many other retail and service providers that are anxious to reopen. We also benefit from a pipeline of high-quality developments and redevelopments that our talented investment teams have structured to provide us with timing and financial flexibility, affording us the optionality to either continue to move forward during this time, or to pause, positioning these projects for future value creation over the long term. Lastly, but certainly not least, one of Regency’s greatest advantages is our extremely strong balance sheet featuring low leverage, a low payout ratio with the highest level of free cash flow in the sector, liquidity to satisfy our commitments, and thoughtfully managed maturities. This intentional positioning is a key element of our strategy and maintaining this financial strength is of critical importance. Considering the possibility that we may still be able to maintain the current dividend even beyond this quarter, given the benefit of our solid financial position, our Board approved full payment of our dividend at the rate of $0.595 per share. That said, over the coming months, management and the Board will carefully monitor the extent and success of the opening of the country and economy, consumer behavior, retailer performance, actual Regency results, and our view of future rent collection and NOI. And even though we recognize that there may still be uncertainty when we have our earnings call with you in August, we should have a much better view of the impacts from the pandemic and the recession on our company. I want to emphasize that the resulting future major decisions will be very deliberate. This concludes the decisions related to the level of the quarterly dividends, where we must, and we will weigh near-term liquidity and balance sheet metrics with future expectations for Regency’s portfolio, including preserving our financial strength to best position us for achieving our strategic objectives and sustained outperformance. None of us could have imagined the current challenges facing our country, the economy, retailers and the shopping center business. But even in this environment, I’m firmly convinced that Regency will not only successfully weather this crisis and navigate the bridge to the new normal, but also will thrive in the post-pandemic world. My belief goes back to the strategic advantages that Regency has built: high quality, necessity and convenience focused portfolio, our value-add asset management and development capabilities, the strength of our balance sheet and liquidity position, and our unparalleled team of experienced professionals. In this, my confidence is unwavering. Jim?
Jim Thompson: Thanks, Lisa. Before I get into the details around COVID-19 impacts, I think it is important to quickly touch on the solid first quarter momentum we were experiencing before the pandemic began. First Quarter leasing and base rent growth exceeded our expectations. While leasing activity has clearly been impacted by the COVID situation, we have still been able to execute a number of renewals over the last 2 months and are continuing to negotiate new leases with numerous tenants. Many anchor tenants such as Publix, Target, Wegmans and TJX, as well as drugstores, medical uses and banks continue to pursue new deals during this time. We are already seeing activity pickup in those markets where shelter-in-place guidelines are being relaxed. And we are confident that leasing activity will increase once we have further clarity on reopening across the country. As Lisa mentioned, the top priority for our asset management teams continue to be maintaining the safety and wellbeing of our team members, tenants, properties, and the customers in our communities. All of our properties have been open and operating for the entirety of the pandemic. In addition to reaching out to each of our 8,000-plus tenants, and continuing to safely make regular on-site visits to properties, our asset management group has also set up our tenant assistant website. Site includes resources that our tenants are able to leverage, as well as direction on how they can access and apply for government or other assistance programs. We recently hosted a webinar that hundreds of our tenants attended, providing further information on Regency’s plans to help tenants successfully and safely reopen their businesses. As at the end of April, approximately 40% of our tenants were closed, although we anticipate within the next 30 days to see many of those retailers begin to implement plans to reopen as mandated closures are lifted. We collected 62% of our pro rata base rent for the month of April. This includes a collection rate of over 90% from tenants deemed to be essential, which represents nearly half our pro rata ABR. April collections for restaurants, which represent approximately 19% of our total ABR was 41%. And finally, the April collection rate for other retail and service categories, which represents a little over 1/3rd of our annual ABR was 37%. Given the ongoing uncertainty in the marketplace and extent of future impacts, we remain in the early stages of working with tenants on potential rent deferral plans to help our retailers, especially those that have been totally closed for a period of time, allowing them to focus on reopening and start to rebuild their customer base. We recognize that Regency success, as it always has been, is tied to our tenants. So we aim to work with our retailers, understanding their needs while being mindful of our contractual rights and long-term strategic objectives. As mandates are lifted and we began to help our tenants and centers transition into a post-COVID environment. Our teams are prepared to make adjustments to the operation of our centers, such as facilitating more buy online and pickup areas, adding hand sanitation areas, installing social distancing signage reminders, and prohibiting the use of certain common areas until they are deemed safe for all customers. Just as Regency team and portfolio has successfully navigated through various cycles and disruptions over history, our teams are well equipped and doing everything we can to help our tenants and properties prepared to recover as successfully and quickly as possible. Mac?
Mac Chandler: Thanks, Jim. We continue to have confidence in our ability to create long-term value through disciplined development and redevelopment. That said, given the current environment, it is prudent to reassess the scope, timing and projected investment on each of our in-process projects, as well as our extensive pipeline. We realized the importance of reevaluating projects to determine if modifications may be necessary, as we think about the future needs of our retailers and their customers, including potential changes to design and formats. At the end of 2019, we had approximately $350 million of developments and redevelopments in process, but nearly $225 million remaining to be invested. Since the onset of the pandemic, we’ve diligently reevaluated future timing and scope for each of these projects. As a result of this process, we intend to finish construction on those projects that are nearly complete, as well as those where we have lease in city obligations. We will invest approximately $80 million to complete these projects. We are also fortunate that at a select number of other projects, construction was at a point where we’re able to pause without experiencing material impacts to our long-term value creation. This has allowed us to selectively defer investment of approximately $145 million of in-process commitments. For the projects continuing construction as planned, including The Village at Hunter’s Lake in Tampa, and Point 50 in Fairfax, Virginia. The scope and costs are essentially unchanged. For other projects like Carytown Exchange in Richmond, The Abbot on Harvard Square and Market Common Clarendon in Arlington. We intend to phase our investment in these projects, providing us flexibility as we determine the most appropriate future direction. A Culver Public Market in Los Angeles and Serramonte Center in the Bay Area, we have not yet started vertical construction. We have suspended activity to allow for more time to study and potentially phase these projects. Investments like these require more material reconsideration of tenancy, scope, timing and return on investment, given the impact of the ongoing response of COVID-19 pandemic. We will be certain to update you on our revised plans as soon as they become more clear. We are also thoroughly reviewing our near-term investment pipeline, and will continue to position these opportunities to start, while preserving optionality in order to best manage our near-term commitments until we have better visibility of our free cash flow. We were fortunate to be in a position to continue moving these projects forward, while we assess the timing and scope of our plans. This includes projects such as Westbard Square in Bethesda and Costa Verde, and the UTC market of San Diego. We remain excited to start these projects, when the timing is right. It’s important to note that these projects are major redevelopments of existing owned shopping centers, and a deferred timing of our incremental investment is mitigated by our ability to maintain NOI from the existing roster of tenants. We continue to have conviction in the long-term value creation opportunities afforded by these exceptional locations. But at the same time, understand that these investments require patience and discipline, 2 cornerstones of Regency’s proven investment strategy. Mike?
Mike Mas: Thanks, Mac, and good morning, everyone. I’ll start with our first quarter results where we were off to a good start for the year relative to our initial expectations. While not indicative of expected full year results, I do think it’s important to know that the operating environment was quite healthy. However, after reserving for open receivables as a result of the pandemic, same property NOI growth for the quarter came in at negative 70 basis points. As noted on our last earnings call, we did plan for a negative first quarter growth rate driven by bankruptcy related move outs, but still our underlying results were better than those expectations. However, as many of you are aware, GAAP requires that we reserve for any receivables we’re collecting the entirety of the lease obligation is less than probable. Given the current environment, we reviewed all receivables with emphasis on non-essential tenants, restaurants, local tenants, tenants that did not pay April rent, and all watch-list tenants. Any receivable that was less than probable was reserved, and we will recognize the income as those amounts are received. This resulted in a bad debt charge the same property growth in the quarter of approximately $2 million above what we originally planned. Relatedly, and as required by the standard, the changing collectability expectations for certain tenants also resulted in a reversal of the related non-cash straight line rent of approximately $3.5 million. We will continue to evaluate our collectable or uncollectible lease income reserves, as the current situation evolves. Now to the balance sheet and our liquidity position. Over the years, we have committed to a rigorous set of principles in order to maintain balance sheet strength and flexibility highlighted by low levels of leverage, maximizing free cash flow, access to liquidity to meet our needs, and a well-laddered maturity profile to reduce risk. As a result, we are very well positioned from a balance sheet and liquidity standpoint, as we pivot towards mitigating the impacts from the ongoing response to this health crisis. During the quarter, we took several steps to further solidify our position, including settling our forward equity offering and drawing down on our revolving credit facility. These actions, when aggregated with property sale proceeds that closed during the quarter, positioned Regency with a cash balance of $735 million, which when combined with undrawn capacity, provides total liquidity of approximately $1.3 billion. While protecting and enhancing our liquidity position, we’re also carefully managing all future capital requirements, including development spend, property level expenditures, as well as G&A and dividend payments, as mentioned earlier by Lisa. Importantly, and to amplify what Lisa said, we will closely monitor the ongoing impact of the pandemic response on our cash flows, and future dividends will be subject to our ongoing comfort with our liquidity position, our leverage ratios and our taxable income forecasts. Lastly, as we previously announced, we withdrew our 2020 guidance due to the extreme uncertainties of the impact of the COVID-19 situation. We look forward to providing guidance again, when we have greater clarity around reopening and the impacts to our business. We understand the need for timely information in this rapidly changing environment and are committed to being as transparent as possible. To that end, and as we did in March, we will provide material mid-quarter business updates, if warranted. That concludes our prepared remarks. And we now welcome your questions.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we’ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from line of Christy McElroy with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Christy McElroy: Thank you. Good morning. My first question is for Mac, just following up on some of your opening remarks. In thinking about just the construction pipeline and understanding you’re deferring $145 million of CapEx, assuming for now that’s just sort of pausing and pushing out that spend and extending the pipeline, to what extent will you revisit that to potentially permanently reduce the scope of those projects and reduce that plan spend and those projections? And given that you’ve removed some of the yield productions? What impact should we expect these delays and interruptions will have on those yield productions ultimately?
Mac Chandler: Thanks, Christy. Good morning. I’d say we’re going to revisit that pipeline continually. It’s still very early in the process. And as visibility becomes more clear, we’ll reassess these projects. And as you mentioned, that has to do with tenancy, and timing, and scope, ROI, so it’s a little bit too soon to say when these projects will come back online. And if some, we elect not to pause, but to stop. But I think at this point, we very much believe in these projects. We believe in the locations and the concept. And we think long term, they’re going to be terrific projects. So at this point, we just need to take a little more time to study these projects. So I can’t give you a whole lot more clarity at this point, but we’re constantly revisiting those, and we’ll know more. As the quarters come by we’ll be sure to update everybody.
Christy McElroy: Okay, second question is for Mike. You’ve started to become, obviously, more conservative already in evaluating the collectability of your leases. What percentage of your ABR did you convert to cash basis as of Q1? And maybe you can provide a little bit more color on how you’ll be further approaching this process as you think about the accounting for 2Q in this environment.
Mike Mas: Hey, Christy, good morning. Thank you for the question. I think it’s a little too early to respond to your first part of your question, how much did you convert to cash basis What we did at the end of the quarter was really about those receivables that were on our books at that point in time, and using the April reaction to the health crisis to inform our assessment of profitability. So it was simply, our probability of collections has decreased for a certain segment of our tenants as of March. As we move into the second quarter, I think that’s where the relevancy of your question will come into play. And there’s still a lot to be determined there. As we work through the progress of opening up, as we work with our tenants on lease modifications to the extent they’re necessary, and the context of all of those discussions. And those agreements will inform us as we think about how the standard applies to revenue recognition. And you hit the nail on the head, some of these modifications will continue to result in accrual accounting. Some will be converted into cash basis. And it’s on us, and we’ll do the best job we possibly can to inform you and all of our investors and stakeholders in that impact going forward.
Christy McElroy: That will be helpful. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Greg McGinnis with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.
Greg McGinnis: Hey, everyone. So I’ve seen a few somewhat dire reports on the potential fallout of retailers due to the pandemic primarily, in apparel, specialty retail, restaurants. I’m just curious what your exposure to bankruptcies have been thus far this year, how your watch-list has evolved through the pandemic, and what steps you’re taking to try and mitigate any potential fallout.
Mike Mas: Hey, Greg. Good morning. I’m sorry, maybe a little bit of a broken record on too early to tell. And in fact, it is – I think, really, from a high level, nothing’s really changed with respect to our watch-list. The sizing of our watch-list is about the same as it has been. It’s been less than 5% of our ABR, identified. Do we anticipate that there could be some acceleration and in tenant failures and bankruptcy filings? Absolutely. This is an environment that will certainly result in that. But we haven’t added any amount of significance to our watch-list in some time. And I don’t think this situation has resulted in that occurring just yet.
Lisa Palmer: And I think I would add, as I think about the part of retail real estate that we operate in, I think it’s best positioned. Whatever that post-pandemic world looks like, I like the fact that we are close to neighborhoods, and that we have grocery anchored shopping centers and the quality of our real estate. It’s something that was true pre-COVID. And it’s certainly going to be, I think, even more true post-COVID, as retailers continue to focus on having physical presence, which I think they still need. And if anything, that perhaps this has highlighted some of the difficulties in the cost of delivering and of picking up, and that physical presence really is going to be critical as part of their overall strategy and being close to the customer. And having the best locations is going to be of critical importance to them.
Greg McGinnis: Right, that’s fair. And then, Lisa, are you seeing much benefit from Paycheck Protection plan loan? I mean, have your tenants been successful in getting those funds? And do they use them to pay rents? Or is it more so just keeping folks employed and then you guys may need me to step in and help on the rent side?
Lisa Palmer: I’m going to – I’ll let Jim really dig into this. But this is – this provides me the opportunity to give another shout out to our property management team, which Jim ultimately really has responsibility for. So allow him to get into the details. But our team has done, really has worked really tirelessly since the start of this pandemic, staying in touch with all of our tenants and particularly those local tenants that don’t have access to the capital markets to bridge them through this? And so, I I’ll let Jim – I’ll let Jim talk to that.
Greg McGinnis: Okay.
Jim Thompson: Yeah, Greg, we’ve obviously spent a lot of time sharing information, educating and in some instances really helping some of the local tenants physically fill out the application forms for assistance. We hosted webinars. So I think we’ve done a pretty good job of helping local folks get access to that, those programs. And from a – I can’t tell you exactly what the ratio of folks that have had benefit of that program. But I will say that there have been several tenants that basically paid their rent in April, due to the fact they were able to access those spots. So there is indication that that has worked. As we get deeper into the conversations with the tenants, we certainly – that answer will come into play as far as how we evaluate additional needs that they may require to reopen.
Greg McGinnis: All right. Thanks, Jim.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.
Craig Schmidt: Thank you. I just wondering, as the mandates in some of your markets are lifted and non-essential retailers can open, what has been the consumer acceptance of these tenants opening in terms of more discretionary shopping?
Mike Mas: Craig, it’s obviously very, very early. Texas kind of led the charge with the May 1 opening. I can give you some limited, what we’re hearing from our folks in the field. Number one, I think all the retailers that are returning to work, if you will, very, very focused on ensuring their customers are feel safe and are trying to make sure they have a very welcoming but safe environment for customers to return to. So everybody’s top of mind, to make sure the customers feel good about coming back. I would say, from a restaurant perspective, full service folks, right now there is 25% occupancy. What we have seen in general is the full service guys are just sticking with to go right now, because I think that – our impression is that, they are waiting for 50% occupancy, where it may make more sense to bring their folks back online and make in-room dining more profitable for them. That’s not to say some of the Jersey Mike’s and those kind of kind of folks are taking great advantage. And we’ve seen it here in town that BurgerFi, where they have opened up. They’ve got people inside. They’ve got good spacing and the customer has embraced that so far. Medical, dental: again cautious, slow reopening. And the one thing I would say in Atlanta, what we noticed was, when the salons opened up, the lines, as you can imagine, were out the door, so literally out the door. That is one category that’s popped back pretty quickly. Obviously, they’re instituting some waiting room protocols, some number of chairs. But they’re bouncing back pretty quickly. The gyms in Atlanta were given the green light. Quite frankly, right now what we have seen is, they’re taking a cautious, and I think, correct approach in kind of waiting a little bit to make sure when they come out, they’ve got a real good program. They’ve got protocols in place. Again, consumer confidence is going to be key really to all of this for the consumer to come back. And that’s about all I’ve got really for what we’ve seen so far.
Craig Schmidt: That’s great. It’s interesting to see where the priorities lie. Just one other thing, I was wondering if public somewhat more liberal rent relief program informed any of your rent deferral negotiations with your tenant?
Jim Thompson: Short answer, no. As I indicated in the opening remarks, we’re in the early stages of negotiation. We’re certainly not taking a blanket approach at all. We’re being very thoughtful, strategic and targeted. Each tenant will be handled individually. Our goal is to negotiate common ground to get our retailers open and selling goods and services as soon as possible. Fortunately, we enjoy a high-quality platform, and the majority of our tenants perform well on our assets and want to be here. So I think, we’re both very anxious to get this worked out and behind us. And so, right now, I would say there’s a real nice balance in the negotiation. They want to be there. We want them there. And we’re trying to, as quickly and expeditiously as possible, get through any document negotiation. But conversations, the data I will say have been productive, positive and, quite frankly, are in line with our expectations.
Craig Schmidt: Thank you for that detail. Bye.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Craig.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Shivani Sood with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.
Shivani Sood: Hi, good morning. So the Regency team has a history of working with third-party capital. And you guys certainly have a wide pool of capital available to you guys. So just curious how these conversations have trended in recent weeks, just particularly given utilization of grocery anchored centers as distribution centers in recent weeks, if there is incremental capital and demand there from some of your partners.
Mike Mas: Hey, Shivani, good morning. I appreciate the question. We are – I’ll start with just liquidity from a capital perspective. We’re very fortunate to be partnered with some of the largest pension funds in the country, CalPERS, CalSTRS, State of Oregon. And in those long-standing relationships, we have, as you said, access to capital. Our partners as well have access to capital. And the plan that Jim and his team is operating to work with our tenants, to minimize the disruption to income and cash flow to the best of our ability. Our partners are in agreement with our approach. And that has been not surprising to see. I think that’s a product of a longstanding relationship between us. So that’s been comforting. I think what you’re asking is more forward-looking product type question. And I think our – again, our alignment of interest is there. There continues to be an interest in investing capital in the necessity-based grocery-anchored space, in the private capital markets. And our partners, those that I’ve mentioned have consistently asked about continuing investment opportunity together with Regency, given our historical performance. So I’d say, our vision of the future of the space, which is positive – and I think there’s no been no better time to prove out the concept and the relevancy of this product than now, especially with the essential retail requirement that this country needs. And our partners agree with that, and they believe in that as well. And going forward though, I don’t know necessarily that our capitalization strategy has changed. And that, I don’t know that Regency’s plans to add to our portfolio from a joint venture perspective has changed as a result of this environment. We still feel like the portfolio we currently own with our partners is about appropriately sized. And we aren’t actively looking to increase that share.
Lisa Palmer: But I do think it’s also important and many of you have heard us talk about this in prior meetings, one-on-one meetings, as well as on calls that, we’ve always – we value those relationships with our partners. And we always thought of them as long term. And while we haven’t needed their capital for quite some time now, we believe that treating people right and doing well by your partners may, at sometime, pay off in the future. And who knows what the future holds and whether we might need to access third party capital. And I think the good thing is, I believe that would be available to us if we so chose.
Shivani Sood: That’s great to hear. And then in terms of the mortgage debt on specific properties, curious, if the 62% rent received in April, if that would potentially trigger any revaluation requirements or covenants, I guess, is there anything we should be aware of there? Thank you.
Jim Thompson: No. Nothing to be aware of, though, we’ve been in communication with all of our mortgage holders. In fact, we’ve actually closed on $225 million in mortgages in the first quarter of this year, and that many of those closings extended into the shutdown and health crisis. And I have to make it a point to appreciate and congratulate our capital markets team, Andrew Mumford, who runs the mortgage business for us at Regency. He has done a remarkable job, maintaining those relationships, closing on those projects, our lenders, we appreciate them living up to their commitments when, in fact, there was an opportunity not to do that. Again, I think that action speaks to our relationships, the value we’ve created over the past. And importantly, the product type. I think these lenders understand that they’re getting into a durable asset class, highlighted by highly productive grocery stores. And at the end of the day, we’re happy and comforted to close those loans this quarter.
Lisa Palmer: Not this quarter. We close them this week.
Jim Thompson: This week.
Shivani Sood: Thanks for your time.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Richard Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Richard Hill: Hey, you got Ronald Kamdem on for Richard Hill. 2 quick ones for me. The first one is just going back to the dividend decision. Just – would like just a little bit more color on sort of the thought process there, because, I think, as you know, I think nobody really knows what’s happening, what’s going to happen over the next 3, 6, 12 months? But are we supposed to read into that having seen the April data? If things don’t get worse, you felt comfortable that the dividend could be maintained at these levels, obviously, if things do get worse, everything is off the table. But just trying to get a sense of sort of what the scenarios that were thought through about that decision? Thank you.
Lisa Palmer: Of course, I’m really just going to reiterate what I said in the prepared remarks. And again, I’ll go back to something that is clearly part of our strategic objectives in that positioning our balance sheet to really be able to withstand, and oftentimes we said the next recession that we never quite imagine that it would be like this. But we’ve intentionally strengthened that and positioned ourselves so that we really could withstand some disruptions. And it’s just – it’s early, it is – we’re really early in this situation and the circumstances that we don’t know what will happen over the next 3, 6, 12 months. But with that said, we came into this with really low payout ratios, right. Our FFO payout ratio is in the low 60%, our AFFO payout ratio in the low 70% range. And what that afforded us was a very high absolute level of free cash flow. We then – we work to defer some of our capital spend on our developments that provides us even more financial flexibility. And we do believe, because we are – there is uncertainty and so much that’s unknown, but there’s still a possibility that we’ll be able to maintain the current dividend. And so with that said, we were very confident in paying this second quarter dividend. But again, as I said in my prepared remarks, we’re going to monitor really close closely, what happens over the next 3 months. The consumer – Jim even mentioned it – consumer confidence is such a big part of this, and how the consumer behaves, you can open the stores, but if they don’t go in, that’s going to impact the success of our tenants. And we will be – we will stay really close to it, and management and the board are going to manage this closely. And it’s a critical balance, because again, I just said, positioning ourselves to achieve our strategic objectives is critically important. And we’re going to have to weigh paying the dividend with that financial strength to ensure that we can achieve our objectives in the future as well and best be positioned to do that.
Richard Hill: Helpful. My second question was just on going back to sort of expenses, and maybe can you provide some color on how much of your expenses can actually be deferred in some ways to form, right? We’re assuming things like property taxes, utility probably can’t. But just how much of those can be deferred? And the corollary to that question would be what level of rent collection is sort of breakeven to cover those expenses? Thank you.
Mike Mas: Sure. From an OpEx perspective, listen, we believe we operate a best-in-class shopping center at a best-in-class efficiency rate. So when you really think, and then as we mentioned on the call, all of our shopping centers are open in over – approaching 60% of our tenants are operating. So when you think about that, the flexibility within the line items of operating expenses, we feel like we’re running – they’re more fixed than variable, although we’re doing what we can to enhance and provide liquidity to ourselves where we can. Where you can move the needle a little more at the property levels on CapEx? But certainly to the extent the leasing environment slows down, that will result some savings from a cash perspective. To the extent, we have some onetime capital items at the property level, parking lot repair, roof repair, to the extent we can defer that capital in a safe manner, we will. And we’re doing that as we speak. But beyond that, from a liquidity standpoint, there isn’t – at the property level, I think that we’re achieving our goals. And really the needle mover was with respect to our development pipeline and the $145 million, that we were able to, in effect, option to the future, which we felt like provided – helped with that confidence, as Lisa mentioned, as we considered our dividend. Sorry. I’m sorry. Breakeven second part of your question. Really good question. So from a – it’s about 50% rent collection on the top line to breakeven before capitals. And then after capitals, it’s roughly around 55%.
Richard Hill: Got it. That’s helpful. I just want to thank you guys again for all the transparency and disclosures and everything you provide. I think you’re really leading your peers here. We appreciate it.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you.
Jim Thompson: Laura and Kathryn do an exceptional job and we appreciate you recognizing that.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Hawthorne with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Hawthorne: Hi, just one for me. How are you guys balancing – adjusting the tenant mix versus kind of trying to work with some of your current tenants or will replace them if that you feel it’s a better long-term strategy?
Lisa Palmer: No. I think – yeah, the question wasn’t clear. Sorry. Can you repeat it?
Brian Hawthorne: Sorry. Yeah, I’m just going to asking, him how are you balancing – maybe adjusting the tenant mix where you kind of see some people that either were attractive and aren’t now? Or maybe were ones that you were just kind of waiting to get the space back and replace them? How are you looking at that and thinking about that? Has that changed at all from your previous strategy, pre-pandemic?
Jim Thompson: Brian, I think, we pride ourselves in our proactive asset management. We’re constantly as you’ve heard us say we’re constantly trying to upgrade the quality of our tenancy our merchandising. So I think, it’s our standard playbook, I would say during this pandemic, we may have more opportunity to recapture some space, and potentially remerchandise in the future. More to come, but we’re always looking to do that.
Brian Hawthorne: Is there anything – any tenants or any industries in particular, where you’re kind of more interested now in remerchandising than maybe you were before?
Jim Thompson: No. I think, it’s kind of the known suspects from the watch list. That would be the – that would be where we would expect in our planning opportunities to arise. And that’s – those are the kind of spaces we’re talking to stronger, better retailers, quite frankly, pre-COVID that have their eyes on that space. So that’s really all I could tell you on that.
Lisa Palmer: Jim is being a little bit humble. We’ve – right, if you look at Regency’s track record, we’ve done – I can say, because I’m not the one that’s done it. Jim and the team has done an exceptional job of really, as he said, proactively managing our tenant mix, and our merchandising mix, and ensuring that we were positioning our centers for the long-term. And if you – retail is always evolving. This is going to accelerate some of that evolution, no doubt. So we’ve had users come and users go, and we are continually working to ensure that we have an optimal merchandising mix at our centers. It’s really important.
Brian Hawthorne: Okay. Thank you for taking my questions.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Mueller: Yeah. Hi. I guess putting aside that you have some government exposure this time. Can you talk a little bit about how your small shops compared today versus the GFC?
Lisa Palmer: I’m going to let Jim talk to the details. But generally just thinking about what’s happening today, versus what happens, I guess was 11 years ago – 10, 11, 12 years ago. It really is apples and oranges. And also, the comp – we at Regency have significantly – we made a lot of significant moves since that time in terms of the properties that we sold, really refocusing and having a much more disciplined development program in building properties that we would only want to hold rather than developing to sell. And I think that if you look at Regency today versus Regency 12 years ago, it’s just – we’re different. And the quality of our tenant base today is certainly at a much higher level than it was then. And I think that – and so with that when I do, and I think I have the rough numbers, and Jim can talk a little bit more. In fact, in the GFC, we fell to about 92% overall occupancy and 84% shop occupancy, which was one of the highest in the sector’s even then. And then layer on top of that, that I think that we’ve improved the quality of our portfolio. I feel really good about it. But this is a different animal. And there’s still so much that’s unknown. It’s too hard to predict what the end will be. Right now, we feel really good about the quality of our real estate. We feel really good about the sector that we operate in. And we feel really good about the quality of our tenant base, but there’s a lot more to come
Michael Mueller: Got it. And then what triggers do you look forward to potentially repay some of the cash you pulled off the line?
Mike Mas: Hey, Mike, we will – I think that will dovetail with our assessment of really pulling down the line was a little bit of a reaction and a playbook out of the GFC, frankly, and I think since that point in time, we’ve become very comfortable with the treasury’s response to the potential economic crisis, we feel really good about our capital partners, that are lenders to us on our revolver. So I would say that those triggers are probably more about the financial capital markets than what we see occurring in the portfolio. That being said, we’re going to give it some time right now. It is a rather inexpensive insurance policy to carry on the balance sheet. At the same time, we are always looking at our debt maturity profile. I think our history and our track record specifically recently would show that, we built a very – we live by a set of principles, one of which is to limit our annual maturities to no more than 15% of our total debt capital. And we’re always looking out 2, 3 years to see to be opportunistic and determine if we can stretch out our maturities and just maintain that safety from a capital perspective. So we’re looking at 2022. Obviously, in 2020 and 2021, very limited maturities, we’ve taken care of many of our mortgages already. And 2022 is our next target. We’ll see what – how the capital markets evolve from this point forward, they feel quite nicely over the last several weeks. But it’s – at the same time, you have to be aware, you have to be careful that every day is a new day in the capital markets, as you know. And we’re doing what we can to monitor that activity, and we’ll be opportunistic to be kind of something is presented.
Michael Mueller: Got it. Thank you. That was it.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Floris van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please proceed with your question.
Floris van Dijkum: Good morning, guys. Quick – a lot of my questions have been answered. But I have just a more – I guess, a broader question for you. Given that Regency’s got this great balance sheet, you’re sitting on this tremendous liquidity. A lot of your tenants are struggling. Some of your peers are actually looking to – either provide loans to some of their tenants or – I think, Brookfield just announced a $5 billion fund to invest in some of their tenants. Would you consider investing in some of your retailers, particularly the ones that pretty well? Or are you going to stick to your – is your view that you’re going to stick to your knitting?
Lisa Palmer: Again, it’s we’re really – we’re early in the discussion process with our retailers. We do appreciate and acknowledge that many of our tenants are an important part of the fabric of our center. And some of them specifically in – and it’s not a surprise, right, specifically in the restaurant area. There – they can be almost another anchor to centers. And depending upon how the consumer behaves and how we open up, and again, it’s so much – there’s still so much uncertainty. It’s too early to answer that definitively. I would never say, never. But right now we are discussing and working with the tenants and focusing on getting them reopened and understanding what they need in order to succeed. And the team – that’s what the team is focused on.
Floris van Dijkum: Thanks, Lisa.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Linda Tsai with Jefferies & Company. Please proceed with your question.
Linda Tsai: Hi. I think in past investor – on the past investor presentation, you cited the stat of 40,000 groceries in the industry going to 30,000. How are you thinking about the magnitude of that number now? Are there any disruptors that might shift that maybe potentially the proliferation of micro fulfillment centers?
Lisa Palmer: Not sure that we ever put that in print in an investor presentation, but I do recall half actually saying that on an investor calls probably about a year ago. And it’s really just, I mean, it was – we were hypothetically talking at the time saying, there are 40,000 grocery stores in the U.S. even if we were to lose 25% right. That’s how we think about it. And that number were to really reduce. We still – when you think about Regency as well as all of our other publicly traded peers and other institutionally owned shopping centers, really owned the best real estate. And so when you think of Regency, 416 shopping centers, 80% of which are grocery anchored. If I do the math, that gets you to somewhere in 300-plus grocery stores. So 300 plus out of – even if there are 30,000, we still believe we’re going to have some of the best of the best in terms of the operators that are – they continue to operate. And we also do believe that a physical presence is going to continue to be critically important, look at what Amazon is doing in terms of buying Whole Foods and the unverified rumors, I guess, actually though they’ve opened a store already, right. They’re continuing to open grocery stores, even throughout this pandemic. So I think that the fact that the quality of our real estate, the quality of our anchors, we haven’t necessarily changed our future outlook for grocery stores.
Linda Tsai: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Lucas with CapitalOne Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Christopher Lucas: Good morning, everyone. Jim, I’m sorry if I missed this, but did you provide a percentage of ABR that wonder what you’ve already agreed to deferral requests?
Jim Thompson: Chris, no, I didn’t. We’re – like I said, we’re early in the process. And all I can tell you there’s more to come and we’ll be able to share more down the road as we kind of get some of this negotiation behind us.
Christopher Lucas: Okay. I just want to make sure I didn’t miss that. And then Mike, I guess 2 questions for you. One is on the loans that you’ve recently closed on it. I guess, curious as to whether or not there were any lender underwriting changes that sort of incorporated sort of the impact from COVID to their process?
Mike Mas: No, Chris. As I said, they – we applaud them for living up to their commitments, and there was no COVID related modification.
Christopher Lucas: Okay, thanks. And last question, Mike. Just as it relates to some of these larger development projects that are on review at this point, how should we be thinking about some of the de-leasing numbers you have previously provided, particularly Costa Verde and Westbard?
Mike Mas: I think, it’s project specific. I’m actually going to hand that off to Mac. But I think generally – and it is project excluded to the Westbard as an example is more likely to maintain its occupancy and NOI than maybe a Serramonte, which we had already negotiated that termination. And in fact, their lease was going to expire relatively sooner with J. C. Penney. So I’ll hand that off to the Mac and he can handle NOI disruption.
Mac Chandler: Good morning, Chris. I think what’s really important is we’re continuing to position these projects to start. And in order to do that, we need to make sure that we have the ability to get to our tenant spaces. So we’ll continue to extend these tenants on a short-term basis, so that when the timing is right, we can start these projects. But we should be able to maintain income. It gets tougher. As you go along, that’s not to be unexpected. That’s what we’ve revealed in the past. So we’ll hold to income the best we can, but we think that’s a worthwhile trade to position ourselves to start these projects when the timing is right.
Christopher Lucas: Okay, great. Thank you. Appreciate it.
Operator: Next question is from the line of Tammi Fique with Wells Fargo. Please proceed you’re your questions.
Tammi Fique: Hi, good morning. Just wondering on – just going back to Chris’s question on the $225 million of mortgages, I guess, were those negotiations taking place pre-COVID? Well, I know they closed recently, but were those negotiation, I guess, taking place earlier?
Mike Mas: Yeah.
Tammi Fique: Okay, so…
Mike Mas: Yeah, Tammi, those commitments were made pre-COVID. But importantly, we closed those into April. I mean, we were deep into both institutions working from home. And no real retrades on pricing or conditions.
Tammi Fique: Okay. But, I guess, just as an indicator for changes in LTVs or underlying cap-rate assessments or anything else that the lenders are making it difficult to say at this point.
Mike Mas: At this point, yes. I think we know that credit spreads are up from what we were able to secure for ourselves. And underwriting there is likely changing as we speak. We haven’t tested yet on securing a new mortgage. These have been just closing deals that had already been struck prior to the crisis.
Tammi Fique: Okay, thanks. And I’m wondering, if you can comment on what you are seeing so far in May. I’m sorry if you touched on this already and maybe what your projections are for May rent collections relative to what you collected in April?
Mike Mas: What we’re seeing in May is our collections through, as we sit here today, through yesterday. And in fact, those rates have mirrored what we experienced in April. Beyond that, Tammi, we don’t have any expectations coming into May. We did anticipate that May had the potential to be less than April, just kind of given the timing of when the closures started to occur and how late they were in March. We thought there was a reasonable chance and a likelihood that May would be worse than April. But we’ve seen those collection rates mirror April on a day-to-day basis to this point.
Lisa Palmer: And they still very may well settle at a lower level than April. That wouldn’t surprise us. And I think, as Mike said, we’re going to remain committed to being transparent and providing updates. So when we feel good that we have good numbers to report, we’ll make sure that we provide you with that.
Tammi Fique: Okay, yeah, definitely appreciate that. And I’m just wondering the range of collections you’re seeing for April across your markets. Are you seeing any particular pockets of weakness?
Mike Mas: No, Tammi, really, there’s no real geographic difference at this point. I think as we start to open markets, there likely will be some data that we can interpolate. But right now it’s kind of across the board, same.
Tammi Fique: All right, thanks. And then just one last question, the goodwill impairment that you took in the quarter, just wondering what that was related to.
Mike Mas: Hey, Tammi. You saved the best to last there. No, I’m just joking. So you have to go back in time and understand that why goodwill is on our books. And it goes back to the merger with Equity One. And if you think about the way the purchase price is allocated from an accounting standpoint, at the end of the day, goodwill reflects the synergy value. But then you get into how the accounting literature is a bit awkward with respect to real estate companies like Regency. Once you determine the value of that goodwill, then you are forced to allocate that to all of your assets. And it’s not the assets you acquired in the merger. It’s your company’s assets, effectively spreading that synergy value across the platform. And then, not to get overly technical, but now you’re assessing that goodwill for impairment triggers from that point forward. That’s a qualitative test that was triggered with the onset of the crisis. Really, it was the rapid reduction in share value that triggers that qualitative. Then you move into your quantitative impairment analysis, which is a discounted cash flow approach. And that resulted in about a 40% write-down of our original goodwill. Importantly, it’s therefore to reflect synergy value of the merger with Equity One. That synergy value has been absorbed and it still exists. And this is where I say the literature for goodwill with respect to real estate companies is a bit awkward, in that they force you to allocate that to the individual assets.
Tammi Fique: Okay, thank you. That’s helpful.
Mike Mas: Sure.
Mac Chandler: Thank you.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Thank you. At this time, we have no additional questions. I’ll turn the call over to Lisa Palmer for closing remarks.
Lisa Palmer: I’d want to thank everyone again for their time. I want to thank all of our frontline workers. We did have the Blue Angels fly through here today, but it was a little quiet outside my window. So I want to thank them also for saluting Jacksonville hospitals. And happy Mother’s Day weekend to all the mothers. Thanks again.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-02-14 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Regency Centers Corporation Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It’s now my pleasure to introduce your host, Laura Clark, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Laura Clark: Good morning and welcome to Regency’s fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Lisa Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Mas, Chief Financial Officer; Mac Chandler, Chief Investment Officer; Jim Thompson, Chief Operating Officer; and Chris Leavitt, SVP and Treasurer. On today’s call, we may discuss forward-looking statements. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to our filings with the SEC, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. We will also reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. We have provided a reconciliation of these measures to their comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release and financial supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website. Today, we will be utilizing a slide presentation for a portion of the call. You can view the slide presentation through the webcast link or in the presentation section of our Investor Relations website at regencycenters.com. Lisa?
Lisa Palmer: Thanks, Laura. Good morning, everyone. I will start with a recap of 2019 and a few thoughts on 2020 and the future outlook before Jim, Mac and Mike walk you through in much more detail. Overall, in ‘19, we had a good year. Specifically, some of the key accomplishments from our talented team for the year were grew core operating earnings per share by 4.3%, which exceeded the top end of our initial guidance from a year ago. We ended the year at 95% leased. This represents the seventh consecutive year at 95% or better; started over $250 million in development and redevelopment projects; completed several developments that are great adds to our portfolio. We made substantial progress on our in-process projects and we have clear visibility to our future pipeline. Capitalized on unique acquisition opportunities, enhancing our portfolio quality through the additions of approximately $275 million of well-located, high growth properties most notably The Pruneyard and these acquisitions were funded in part by the sale of more than $200 million of lower growth assets. We further improved Regency’s already impressive balance sheet, solidifying our funding needs through 2020. We demonstrated our continued commitment to best-in-class environmental, social and governance practices. The list of those accomplishments is way too long to list all here, but I would like to highlight just a few. Earning the GRESB Green Star recognition for a fifth consecutive year, being recognized as one of the leading organizations in the country for top employee engagement scores, receiving the highest governance quality score from ISS, and finally, being recognized in Newsweek’s inaugural America’s Most Responsible Companies 2020 list as one of the 10 most responsible companies in the real estate and housing sector. While we are really proud of these accomplishments, we acknowledge that disappointingly we did not exceed expectations in 2019, both ours and yours, specifically for same-property NOI growth. As we have discussed, leasing velocity in the first half of last year as well as store closures and bankruptcies drove us to the lower end of our same-property NOI growth range. But it is really important to note that we finished the year strong with full year leasing volumes that met our original expectations. Looking to the future, as we indicated last quarter, we expect flat to slightly positive same-property NOI and earnings growth for 2020. However, we do believe this muted growth is temporary as despite the unique challenges of 2020, Regency is operating in a reasonably favorable environment for higher quality neighborhood and community shopping centers. Better operators in many categories remain focused on the importance of physical locations that provide our customers with a combination of convenience, service, value and experience. This is supported by sustained healthy demand for our centers with a deep leasing pipeline. We believe that the 10th demand we are experiencing from better retailers, restaurants and service providers, together with the progress on our redevelopment pipeline, will translate into future NOI growth beyond 2020, in line with our strategic objectives. The bottom line is that 2020 is below our standards on both an absolute and relative basis. But as I look to 2021 and beyond, I’m confident that we will soon be meeting our objectives of 3% plus same-property NOI growth and 4% plus earnings growth. Regency’s quality portfolio, value-add asset management and development capabilities, strong balance sheet, an exceptional team, truly position us to achieve these objectives and return to performance that will again be among the sector leaders. Jim?
Jim Thompson: Thanks, Lisa. Same-property NOI growth for the fourth quarter was in line with our expectations, allowing us to finish the full year at 2.1%. Leasing ended the year with a very strong finish that met expectations for the full year. In fact, our Q4 new leasing production was the highest single quarter activity in the past 3 years and we anticipate this positive leasing momentum to continue through 2020. Our same-property portfolio was 95% leased, with shops at over 91%. While Regency maintains one of the highest shop occupancy levels in the sector, we did experience a decline of 30 basis points in Q4 driven by the expected move out of our remaining dressbarn locations. Our teams have been diligently working on backfilling these locations and currently have active negotiations or signed leases on all the recaptured spaces. We achieved solid rent spreads of over 11% in the fourth quarter, which contribute to full year spreads of 8.5%. Importantly, this solid rent growth was on top of the average annual rent steps of over 2%. We achieved on more than 80% of leases we executed in 2019, even though we continue to experience healthy demand and deep leasing pipeline, weaker operators continue to struggle. In 2019, bankruptcies and store closures impacted same-property NOI growth by 80 basis points with Sears Kmart, accounting for roughly half of that result. We know the tenant failure has been and will always be a part of the retail business. And while it creates short-term disruptions to NOI, it allows us the opportunity to upgrade and refresh our merchandising quality and generate opportunities for us to unlock value. In regards to our Barneys location in Manhattan, the tenant is still in possession of the space, but has given notice that they will be vacating at the end of this month. As previously noted, this bankruptcy will have an impact of approximately 40 basis points on our 2020 same-property NOI growth. Our team is focused on the plan that maximizes value as quickly as possible, whether it be selling the property, re-leasing the space or redeveloping the asset. Moving to 2020, we anticipate a total same-property NOI impact up to 140 basis points from bankruptcies and store closures. This includes a typical 60 bps from Barneys, IPIC and Sears, and up to an additional 80 basis points of known and unknown bankruptcy-related move-outs. Please also note that our bad debt is expected to remain in line with the past several years. While we realized store closures continued to earn a disproportionate number of headlines, we are excited to be working with thriving grocers and retailers around the country that are expanding in open-air shopping centers, including grocers, such as Publix, Wegmans, H.E.B. and Trader Joe’s as well as an elevated number of retailers like Sephora, West Elm and Athleta. These prospering retailers recognize that our high-quality neighborhood and community centers provide what is critical for their success in today’s retail landscape. Mac?
Mac Chandler: Thanks, Jim. During the year, we started more than $250 million of value-add developments and redevelopments as we continue to make substantial progress towards meeting our strategic objective to start and complete $1.25 billion to $1.5 billion of projects over the next 5 years. During the fourth quarter, we completed four impressive ground-up developments, including Ballard Blocks in Seattle, The Village at Riverstone in Houston, Pinecrest Place in Miami and Mellody Farm in suburban Chicago. These four projects speak to our development breadth and are a reflection of our talented professionals and unequaled platform. Returns on these projects are in line with projections. The centers are over 95% leased and tenants are performing well, with many exceeding their initial sales projections. For the full year, we completed approximately $230 million of developments and redevelopments at a stabilized yield in excess of 7%. Our major redevelopments are steadily advancing per plan, including our pipeline of future opportunities. I’d like to provide an update on several of these key projects. Let’s start with our office building redevelopment at Market Common in Arlington. This transformative project is more than 30% constructed as steel framing is complete. We have an executed lease with our luxury fitness operator to take 2 floors of the building and are negotiating with several users for many of the remaining spaces. We anticipate construction completion later this year with the first tenants opening in 2021. Moving on to The Abbot located in the heart of Harvard Square in Cambridge. This project started in 2019. Construction is progressing smoothly, and we are approximately 20% complete. We have tremendous interest in our ground floor retail space and are working with a variety of users for the upper floors as well. We expect delivery late this year with the first tenants opening in 2021. Next is our Serramonte Center located just 3.5 miles south of San Francisco. We are excited to announce in the fourth quarter, we started on the first of our three-phase redevelopment. This first phase consists of the addition of a new Regal theater integrated with the insurer of the mall, a relocated fitness club, several new outparcel restaurants and a new hotel in a ground lease. The second phase of the project commenced in January and includes a long overdue modernization of the mall’s interior that should complete prior to this year’s holiday season and is already enhancing our leasing velocity. The third phase is the redevelopment of the JCPenney box, which we get back in June is arguably our best space. We are evaluating several scenarios to re-tenant and reconfigure the space, which is estimated to start in 2021. As we have discussed previously, approximately $1.5 million of NOI will be coming offline at Serramonte in 2020 as we execute this multi-Phase 3 development. Moving to some of our near-term redevelopments, first, Westbard Square, formerly known as Westwood, located in Bethesda. We anticipate starting the first phase of this compelling mixed-use project later this year. As we’ve previously disclosed, approximately $1 million of NOI will be coming offline in 2020 and an additional $2 million in subsequent years as we demo a portion of the current center in order to relocate our grocer. The project will also include 100,000 square feet of retail, 200 apartments, 100 units of assisted living and approximately 100 for sale townhomes. We will be partnering and co-investing with several leading developers for the non-retail components of this project. The new Giant supermarket in Phase 1 retail should open in 2022, and the Phase 2 multifamily ground floor retail should follow in 2023. Lastly, Costa Verde, this dense infill property is located in the vibrant UTC market of San Diego, across from Westfield UTC mall and a new trolley station opening in 2022. This mixed-use redevelopment will include new retail, office and hospitality, and we are in discussions to joint venture the endeavor with the best-in-class office REIT. We anticipate starting the project in 2021. Accordingly, as we prepare for demolition, approximately $1 million of NOI is expected to come offline this year and an additional $3 million in 2021. Initial occupancy is projected to occur approximately 3 years after construction begins. These are just a few of the exciting projects our teams intend to commence and deliver over the next several years that will support our long-term objective of 3% plus same-property NOI growth. Our 8 major redevelopment projects, both in process and near term, are expected to generate approximately 45 million of incremental NOI in the years to come, representing almost $1 billion of incremental capitalized value. I look forward to providing you with further updates as these projects advance. Mike?
Mike Mas: Thanks, Mac and good morning everyone. I’d like to focus my comments on our 2020 outlook by walking through our same-property NOI and earnings guidance. I think the visuals will help with this discussion. So let’s start on Slide 1 and I encourage those that can’t follow the live presentation, its package on our website, as I’m sure you’ll find the materials to be helpful. This first slide is a quick reminder of the components that make up our 3% plus same-property NOI, long-term growth objective. First, our embedded contractual rent increases continued to generate about 1.25% of growth annually. Next, rental rate increases were another 75 to 100 basis points of growth comes from rent spreads in the mid to high single digits, which is consistent with our recent historical averages. And lastly, we need to consider changes in rent paying occupancy as this impacts base rent as well as recovery income, together with growth from our redevelopment activity, which has averaged a positive contribution of 75 basis points over the last several years. With that backdrop, I would like to walk through 2020 to better understand the outlook of flat to slightly positive same-property NOI growth that was previewed on our last call and confirmed with our formal guidance today. Let’s move to Slide 2, which outlines how growth is impacted by certain key assumptions this year. Contractual embedded rent steps and the contribution from rent spreads are in line with our long-term objectives. This leaves changes in rent paying occupancy and expectations around redevelopment contributions as the key drivers of our flat or better guidance. As we’ve discussed on past calls, rent paying occupancy is impacted by 3 key sets of assumptions: first, fallout from tenant bankruptcies or store closures; second, timing expectations around our redevelopment activity; and lastly, our downtime estimates embedded in our forecast due to the timing and volume of leasing activity. First, from a bankruptcy perspective, we will certainly feel the impact of the unique material failures of Barneys, IPIC and Sears. In addition, as we have in the past, we have included provisions for actual and potential bankruptcy activity to include tenants such as dressbarn, Avenue and Pier 1 as well as other unknowns. In total, these could cause a decline in rent paying occupancy of approximately 75 basis points, which translates to the drag on same-property growth of up to 1.4%. Next to redevelopment, as we have discussed on previous calls, we know that contributions to NOI growth can be uneven from year-to-year, especially given the size and character of our current projects. While we have been successful in completing projects and bringing incremental NOI online, at the same time, we are taking approximately $3.5 million of NOI offline in 2020, including at projects such as Serramonte and Westbard Square to position those projects for future growth and value creation. As a result, we are essentially projecting a net 0 contribution from redevelopment activity when you consider both the ins and the outs. The final component of rent paying occupancy is related to the timing and volume of leasing activity. In 2020, outside of bankruptcy driven move-outs and redevelopments, we are planning for up to a 15 basis point decline in average rent paying occupancy caused by the timing of our leasing activity, both execution and on rent commencement, which translates into an approximate 30 basis point impact on growth. Lastly, we expect a drag about to 30 basis points for other items, which include percentage rent and other property level income and expenses. A couple of final comments on same-property growth, first, thinking about the next couple of quarters, we are projecting a negative growth rate in the first half of 2020 driven by the timing of prior year bankruptcy closures. And second and this is most important, as we look beyond 2020, we are encouraged by our strong leasing results and the progress we are making on our redevelopments. And as Lisa explained, this visibility gives us confidence in our ability to return to our strategic objective of 3% or better same-property NOI growth over the long-term, including taking a big step toward that goal in 2021. Let’s now move to Slide 3, which is a roll forward of our 2020 earnings guidance, where I will just – well, I will touch on just a few items. Our 2020 NAREIT FFO per share guidance range is $3.90 to $3.93. The contribution from the total NOI growth is expected to be minimal, with growth essentially only coming from ground-up development completions offset by performance of our non-same-property assets. And quickly, on our non-same-property pool, beginning in 2020, and as indicated on a previous call, we have moved Costa Verde into our non-same-property pool due to the scale of the project and major disruption in NOI of over $4 million that will occur over the next 2 years as we actively de-lease the asset. Transparency is an inherent value of Regency and in that spirit, we felt like this project, given its size, would materially distort the performance metrics of our remaining portfolio, both as NOI comes offline and also when NOI of about $18 million comes back online following completion. You can find property level information to appropriately model the impact of Costa Verde, together with additional disclosure around other changes in the property pools in our supplemental. Please also remember that we sold approximately $130 million of equity last September on a forward basis through our ATM. We can settle this trade at any time through the third quarter, and proceeds were targeted to fund our outsized development spend this year, while keeping our leverage in check, which is a good time to note that we are now providing guidance on development spend, together with development starts and anticipate spending the $300 million area this year. Finally, non-cash items, which primarily include straight-line rent and above below market rent, are expected to decrease by approximately $7 million. As a reminder, in 2019, we recognized significant income related to the acceleration of below market rent balances following move-outs of a few anchor leases. This has increased the rate of deceleration on this line item. And lastly, while we are only providing NAREIT FFO guidance, we will continue to measure and report the performance of our business using core operating earnings, which eliminate certain non-recurring and non-cash items. We anticipate core operating earnings growth per share to be flat to slightly positive in 2020, but we remain confident in our ability to return to 4% plus earnings growth over the long-term. As we look forward, the team is extremely focused on achieving our objectives, and we all remain confident in our ability to continue to deliver earnings growth, dividend growth and in turn, total shareholder return that is at or near the top of the sector. That concludes our prepared remarks. And we now welcome your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Christine McElroy from Citigroup. Your line is now live.
Christine McElroy: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Lisa and Mike, you both mentioned in your prepared remarks about commenting on sort of getting back to that 3% same-store NOI, 4% FFO growth in 2021 and beyond. I think a lot of us are sort of looking to 2021 now given the flattish growth expectations in 2020. And Mike you sort of laid out those components. I am wondering if you could sort of help us bridge that gap from the flat in 2020 just to a more elevated pace in same-store in 2021, you have got the what’s likely to be the 125 of contractual rent growth, the 75 basis point contribution from rent spreads, but then how does – how should we be thinking about the redevelopment contribution in 2021 given all the moving pieces and also the recovery in rent paying occupancy from the bankruptcies and move-outs that you’re experiencing this year?
Lisa Palmer: Hey, Christy, it’s Lisa. Good morning. I think you just answered the question with your question.
Christine McElroy: Well, it’s really more the breakout of those last two, right, it’s sort of occupancy versus redevelopment.
Lisa Palmer: Yes, because it really – so you start with we do have – the team has done a great job continuing to get contractual rent steps. Our leasing spreads are really healthy, right. So we are starting at 2%. And then we do have a lot of visibility as we have said in our – as we have said in our prepared remarks, as you have heard us say prior to the redevelopment contribution coming back in 2021, more like what it had been historically and that 75 basis point range perhaps even more certainly looking even better in 2022. But I am not giving formal 2021 guidance or certainly not 2022, we are going to execute on 2020 first and make sure that we meet those expectations. With regards to the rent paying occupancy, that’s always going to be an unknown. But as we have said, 2020 really is – it was a rare, I think, Hap’s words last quarter were a rare confluence of events to have two really large bankruptcies in Barneys and IPIC and add Sears on top of that. We just don’t see that replicating in the future, because of the magnitude of those spaces. So, rent paying occupancy is certainly an unknown more than 12 months from now, so is economic uncertainty, but we feel really good about contractual rent steps, lease spreads and redevelopment contribution.
Christine McElroy: Okay. And then just as I think about sources and use of capital, you are looking at the $300 million of development and redevelopment spend which we appreciate that guidance. You have got $170 million of free cash flow that you have talked about, which generally would fund most of that on a leverage-neutral basis, but you are also sort of over-equitizing with the $130 million of forward equity. So I am wondering why the sort of additional $125 million of net dispositions on top of that, which is causing a dilutive impact to your FFO and sort of where does all that capital raising leave you from a leverage perspective at year end?
Mike Mas: Hey, Christy, it’s Mike. Appreciate the question. The dispo guidance really is a carryover from ‘19. So this all in effect, goes back to our funding plan for The Pruneyard acquisition. So what I would say to balance out the sources and uses, which you nailed right there is that we are planning to reduce our overall debt level in 2020 by about $100 million to $110 million.
Christine McElroy: Okay. And that’s sort of causing the lower interest expense guidance, there is...
Mike Mas: Yes, the lower interest is being driven by that as well as some accretive refinancings, we are going to do within the joint ventures in 2020 together with the accretive refinancings we executed on in ‘19 through the bond market.
Christine McElroy: Okay, thank you.
Mike Mas: Thanks, Christy.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Your line is now live.
Greg McGinniss: Hey, good morning. This is Greg on with Nick. I just want to talk about rent spreads a little bit, I mean very strong in Q4, healthier spreads we have seen this year in both new leases and renewals. Could you talk about some of the deals that you guys were able to complete this quarter to help boost those metrics and what you anticipate seeing from spreads in 2020?
Jim Thompson: Yes, Greg. This is Jim. As you noted, we had a real strong fourth quarter and it was really pretty heavy on the anchor side. Every quarter we look at the mix and we were heavy on anchors this quarter and we have some really good and pretty strong anchor deals. Publix, LA Fitness and Roosevelt, Edge Fitness, backbone of Kmart, all very, very accretive deals and help to increase that new percent leased or the spreads on new as well as the King Kullen grocery mark-to-market on the renewal side. So that was pushing the spreads pretty strong this quarter. But overall, I think we still target that mid to high single-digit, 8.5%, that meets our objective long-term and that equates to about a 15.9% straight line rent growth and both of those metrics are where we would like to be.
Greg McGinniss: Great. Thanks. And then just hoping to grab some clarity on transactions as well, so first on that is do you count – use incremental purchases to Town & Country into acquisition guidance, so basically, not much left to do this year and then on the dispositions, only $100 million at this point left?
Mike Mas: Hey, Greg, yes, that is somewhat of a technicality in our guidance. So, we have been – the initial entry into Town & Country, we did show as an acquisition, I think that was in ‘18. We have staged some acquisition – additional shares in the property throughout ‘19 and then this is in effect kind of our final piece hopefully not. And hopefully, we will find a way to buy them even more of this asset, but we are not including that in acquisitions guidance in 2020. In effect, I am thinking about that as added development or redevelopment spend at Town & Country. So, we do have a project – we have a project under contract in Southern California actually that we are excited about, honestly, probably too early to talk about that deal, but we look forward to making progress on our due diligence and potentially closing on that in the early part of 2020.
Greg McGinniss: Okay, thanks. And just a quick follow-up on transactions, can you just give us an update in terms of obviously, there is that one that you are talking about there. But in terms of other product that you are seeing in the market right now, have increasing CapEx needs start to bring more maybe high-quality mom-and-pop owned assets to the market and then what’s the impact been on cap rates as well?
Mac Chandler: Greg, this is Mac. We are still seeing very – sort of very few of the types of properties that we typically buy on the market. So, that scarcity has really kept cap rates very low. Cap rates haven’t moved in quite a while. The types of progress we are looking for are not only ones in the submarkets and traders that we do well in and have long-term growth potential, but also where we can use our platform and our expertise to really it’s either core plus or a value add or somewhere we can really find some long-term growth beyond just a core acquisition. Not seeing a lot of those, but we are in the market all the time and just by nature of our 22 markets we see everything that comes to market.
Greg McGinniss: Great. Thank for the clarity.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Derek Johnston from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live.
Derek Johnston: Hi, good morning everyone. So the Barneys is unique, but you did lower the carry value closer to market, has there been much interest in this space? I mean, are you evaluating it as a possible disposition or are you committed to weather the downtime in CapEx and is the associated redevelopment project baked into guidance?
Mac Chandler: Derek, this is Mac. I would be happy to answer that. We are looking at really three scenarios. Definitely sale, we are considering that and we are in the marketplace to see if that is – could transact it when we are looking to redevelop it in either a multi-tenant scenario or single tenant scenario. So we are in the marketplace too as well. So, all are very viable options and we are not going to limit ourselves to one of them. And as we get more clarity, we will be sure to communicate that.
Lisa Palmer: I think the most important thing as we are evaluating the options is how can we maximize value, really and time matters as well when you are thinking about returns to us as well as returns to our shareholders. So, how can we maximize value in really the shortest amount of time? And that’s how we are thinking about it.
Derek Johnston: Okay, thank you. And just you mentioned the Market Common in Arlington, just wondering how discussions with prospective tenants for the office component are progressing? Office tenants tend to make decisions relatively early. And with yield compression being an issue that’s being discussed out there, is the 9% yield still attainable on this project?
Mac Chandler: Derek, this is Mac again. We believe so. We have – having signed now Equinox, that’s really a big boost to the product and the tenant tours that we have had have gone very well, very favorable, now that you can get actually up to the upper floors and see the tremendous views back there, which you couldn’t until we got the frame completed. We have had great interest. Now it takes time to convert interest to LOIs into leases, but we feel good about where we are on the prospects and we will continue to communicate that as we start to absorb.
Derek Johnston: Okay, great. And just one real quickly on escalators, I think they were north of 2% towards the end of last year for new and renewed leases, is this holding firm in the current environment on new leases that you guys are writing?
Jim Thompson: Yes, Derek, Jim, again. We continue to have very good success in embedding that 2% increase in over 80% of our leases. So, we feel like we can continue to follow that tack.
Derek Johnston: Okay. Thanks everyone.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jeremy Metz from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now live.
Marissa Delikoura: Good morning. This is Marissa on for Jeremy. I just wanted to go a little bit more in-depth on acquisitions. Specifically, what sort of upside dynamics are you looking for to keep paying a mid-4% cap rate in the current environment? And also that how is the IRR, you are underwriting changed if at all, in the last 12 to 18 months?
Mac Chandler: Hi, Marissa, it’s Mac again here. Really, the upside, we underwrite a 10-year term just like almost everyone else does. And in order to get that IRR in the mid-6s, sometimes upper mid-6s, sometimes 7, they are paying the product tech you need really strong compounded growth and we get that through contractual bumps. Sometimes there is mark-to-market leases they are under market today. And then often in the – sorry, the second 10-year period, there is even more upside on some of this. That could be through densification. It could be through an anchor lease that finally comes due, that doesn’t show up in our 10-year and those are the kinds of things we look for. We also look for improving demographics, neighborhoods, where demographs are trending up and in the right direction, so you might not see that in the leases that are signed today, but we think we can upgrade, not only rents, but the merchandising and in the physical plant to as well. Ours haven’t changed materially for what we are looking for. We certainly are – we scrutinize our underwriting very carefully and we think that’s obviously embedded in our underwritten IRR so not a material change to that.
Lisa Palmer: I think I just would add, if you think about – I mean Mac’s exactly right if you think about where we have been successful in the properties that we have acquired really over the last 3 to 5 years. It’s where we are able to bring our talent and our expertise, whether it be very proactive asset management, as Mac mentioned, or even our redevelopment and development capabilities. That’s when we are really able to compete with the other buyers that are out there in the market. If it’s just a straight down the fairway core shopping center, we haven’t been quite as successful. So that’s why we’re able to turn these low to mid-4 cap rates into IRRs, sometimes north of 7% as Mac said.
Marissa Delikoura: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Craig Schmidt from Bank of America. Your line is now live.
Craig Schmidt: I was wondering if you guys expect a pickup in small shop occupancy by year-end ‘20, particularly given the strong anchor leasing you’re able to do in the fourth quarter, which you can sort of leverage against some small shops?
Jim Thompson: Craig, Jim here. Yes, I think with the momentum that we are seeing, we feel like we can pick up some ground. We’ve talked about it. We’ve had a high, I think, at 93% leased at one point. So I’m not saying we could get back there, but I do think we’ve got some runway, and I think we’re going to pick up some around this year.
Mike Mas: Yes. Let me add some color there, too. I completely agree with Jim, what we are seeing in our forecast is that we will make up some ground on a spot basis and anticipate percent leased at the end of the year potentially increasing from this point. But importantly, and as presented in the materials, we are anticipating our ramp in occupancy to be down in 2020. And that’s just representing that trough in leasing that that is a result of all of our leasing activity, signing new leases, commencing new leases as well as move-out activity.
Craig Schmidt: Okay. Thank you. And then assuming there isn’t an outright sale, how long may the Barneys redevelopment to lease to different types of tenants, maybe, I mean, how long may make that – maybe that take?
Mac Chandler: Well, it certainly – if you went to a single tenant basis, it’d be relatively quick, but a multi-tenant scenario, a reasonable estimate would be probably 2.5 years.
Mike Mas: Yes, and let me just add from a disclosure standpoint, Craig. As we refine that decision and move forward between sale and redevelopment, if redevelopment is the path we take, we’ll certainly add that disclosure to our supplement and you’ll get a better picture of timing.
Craig Schmidt: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Rich Hill from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.
Rich Hill: Hey good morning guys. We discussed last quarter timing of leases and move-out. And you sort of alluded to this at the beginning in the prepared remarks, but I was wondering if you could just give a little bit more updates on how move-outs have been trending so far?
Jim Thompson: From a volume perspective in ‘19 and ‘20 and I am going to limit these comments to the – what we’re seeing in our shop space because I think that is where some of this – I think in the anchor space, it can be pretty volatile for the given reasons in those known identified tenants of Barneys and IPIC, etcetera. But on shops, we are anticipating a consistent level of move-outs year-over-year ‘19 and ‘20, and that number is in the million square foot range, plus or minus. And we don’t see that kind of volume changing. If you think about that over a 4-, 5-, 6-year period, that level of volume is up on the margin, but we’re replacing that with new leasing activity as well. We had – we signed over 7 million square feet of leases, and that’s obviously including anchors. But the pipelines, as we look at our leasing activity remain full, and we are replacing the tenants that we’re losing to move-outs. And I would say, we are upgrading the merchandising mix and the quality. And while we already have a very high-quality tenant roster, we are making improvement on the meaningful margin with every one of these new leasing transactions.
Rich Hill: Got it. That’s helpful. And Lisa, just to thank you for the bridge on the NOI, that’s very, very helpful. So that’s it for me.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you.
Mike Mas: I have to say, credit goes to Laura Clark on that. We find it to be a really helpful tool, and we appreciate that you all are finding it to be the same.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Wes Golladay from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live.
Wes Golladay: Hey good morning everyone. Just quick question on dispositions, every year, Regency has a strategy to shut the bottom tier of the portfolio, but when I look at the 5.5% cap rate this year for the planned dispositions. Is that more opportunistic sales and where are cap rates now for you – the bottom tier of your portfolio?
Mac Chandler: Wes, this is Mac here. A typical normal year is about a 6.5% cap rate. This year, 2020, we’re guiding to a little bit lower. It’s really because of 2 assets. There is two shopping centers that we are selling, one we’ve already sold, and they are basically being sold to non-retail users. One is going to convert the property to a condominium development, that’s the one in Florida. And the other one is a office user that’s going to buy the property and scrape it. So there isn’t – we’ve whittled down the income in those properties and that’s – makes the cap rate go down. But in general, a typical is sort of the 6.5% cap, that’s typically what we’re selling and those are non-strategic assets in non-strategic markets and typically have lower growth profiles.
Wes Golladay: Great, thank you and thanks for the good quarter.
Lisa Palmer: Yes. So it’s just – generally, we’re not changing the kind of the identified kind of disposition pool, if you will.
Wes Golladay: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you our next question is coming from Mike Mueller from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.
Mike Mueller: Yes, hi. A quick question on the potential – the 75 basis points of occupancy headwind for 2020, how much, if any, of that was already reflected in year-end, 93% level?
Mike Mas: In the percent commenced?
Mike Mueller: Yes. Is anything in there already or is it that 75 basis point is all incremental starting on January 1?
Mike Mas: No. Some of it was in the percent commenced at year-end, like, for example, IPIC had already moved out. So to get you a precise number, Mike, I’d have to come back to you offline. But it’s not all incremental to percent commenced at year-end. Again, just for clarity, this is average rent paying occupancy. The 75 basis points you’re citing is average rent paying occupancy year-over-year. So there could be some tag over from year end.
Mike Mueller: Okay, that’s helpful. That was it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Vince Tibone from Green Street Advisors. Your line is now live.
Vince Tibone: Hi good morning. I have a few questions on the Serramonte redevelopment. I’m just curious given the stabilized yields or on the project are pretty skinny, and malls are obviously not your core property type. Did you consider selling the asset over starting that project, I’d be curious to hear your thoughts on that?
Mac Chandler: Sure, Vince. I’ll take this one. This is Mac. The yields are a little lower than what we typically see. And that’s for a couple of reasons. The first is we elected to relocate the gym that operates there today. It’s a very well performing gym. We thought it was worth it to move them out to a pad and replace them with a new theater. That’s also going to add extra energy, the mall traffic to the interior of the mall that will help all tenants, and we think the gym will operate even better actually on a stand-alone. The yield also includes this modernization to the interior of the mall, which hasn’t been done in a long time. And the benefit we see over that actually takes a long time to realize because we are very well leased. But as tenants turn, we are already seeing better tenants offering better rent and tenants that have always loved the location, but they were a little hesitant because the interior of the mall is a little outdated, and this will really help to that. So you’ll start to see that benefit over the long term. And then the third phase is to JCPenney, which will take some time. We have got a lot of different options that we’re still evaluating. We still are very bullish on the mall property. The location is terrific, and we’re very comfortable operating it. We have some history now to it, and we really like the prospects long term.
Lisa Palmer: Yes. And I would just reiterate that. It is a really high-quality shopping center. Yes, it’s a mall we don’t own any other malls. But there’s still a lot of value to be harvested from it as well. And we can really apply – we’ve got and we’ve got an exceptional team out there. And we’re, again, applying our talents to that asset and really creating value. And in some sense, I know you’ve had the opportunity to visit it, it almost is a community shopping center for Daly City. It’s an exceptional asset.
Vince Tibone: Now it makes sense. That’s really helpful. Just one quick follow-up on that, I am just curious, do you have to pay JCPenney to recapture that box or how did you end up getting control of that mid this year?
Mac Chandler: Yes, we had to make a – there is a very small payment to JCPenney. And that’s what was driving that kind of rapid increase in our write-off of non-cash below market rents, starting last fourth quarter. JCPenney will be out, I think, end of May.
Vince Tibone: Right. Got it. So you bought the lease, but you always own the box, just to make sure I clarify that.
Mac Chandler: That’s right. That’s right. And that whole – that entire property, we own everything, there’s nothing – there is no separate pieces and we think that also gives you lots of optionality over the years.
Vince Tibone: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question today is coming from Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust. Your line is now live.
Ki Bin Kim: Thanks all. Good morning. So in the 2020 guidance, you have 140 basis points accounting for rent paying occupancy declines. And in your commentary there, you said 75 basis points from the known move-outs from Barneys, IPIC, Sears and some others. So can I take that to mean that 65 basis points is for unknown future events?
Mike Mas: I want to breakdown what you said there, Ki Bin, and just make sure we’re all talking about the right numbers here because I think we were crossing over between rent paying occupancy declines and impact to same-property growth. So we are forecasting 75 basis points of rent pay and occupancy decline related to bankruptcy activity and an additional 15 basis points of rent paying occupancy decline due to the timing of other leasing activity. That translates to an impact on same-property growth. That impact on same-property growth is 140 basis points from the bankruptcy category, right, and then another 30 basis points from the leasing activity category. So I think – and then further breaking down that 140 basis points same-property growth impact, there is two categories, that we’ve kind of segmented these three tenants that are materially driving our numbers: Barneys, IPIC and Sears is 60 basis points, and then everything else is 80 basis points. So let’s keep digging in here, Ki Bin. It’s a good question. We want to make sure we got through here. Of the 80 basis points, and that compares historically to a range of – in recent history, 10 to 80 basis points, around the upper end of that, roughly half of that is identified and that’s the Pier 1s and the other tenants, dressbarn that we identified on the prepared remarks. And the other – the 30 to 40 basis points would be more speculative assumption based that we have in our plan. And that is just supported by our – just looking at the environment that we’re in, considering what we experienced in 2019, we thought it was an appropriate level to carrying a plan.
Ki Bin Kim: And you think that the 40 basis point, do you feel comfortable with that, given what you have rolling over, what you know about your tenants?
Mike Mas: Yes, we feel comfortable with that, Ki Bin.
Ki Bin Kim: Okay. And how often are you guys doing preemptive rent restructurings with some trouble tenants before they go BK?
Jim Thompson: Ki Bin, this is Jim. We’re in dialogue, as you can imagine, in today’s environment, we get a lot of knocks on the door from tenant to asking the question. But our general position, I think I’ve said this in the past, our general position is, we like our real estate. We feel very comfortable with our real estate. Sometimes sick tenants – it’s better to take your real estate back and re-merchandise. So we play a pretty hard game when it comes to rent reductions and those kind of requests. Some instances, we will evaluate and determine that working with a tenant on a short-term basis with the landlord we capture might make the most sense, but in general, we play pretty hard on rent reduction.
Ki Bin Kim: Okay, thank you.
Lisa Palmer: On the changes – and the proactive asset management of upgrading the merchandising, we do that all the time. I mean it’s just part of the business. And we do – and if I may say so, – I’m not patting myself on the back. I’m patting them same on their back. They do a really good job of it and have for a really long time.
Jim Thompson: We are – just to tag on that. We are very proactive take the dressbarns, for instance. We have 10 locations, and we just got them back Q4. And basically, all 10 are spoken for, so we’re proactively leasing these things that we think have an opportunity to recapture. So that’s part of the reason we can be strong in the negotiation because we know the real estate, we know what our opportunity pool set looks like.
Ki Bin Kim: Alright. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Linda Tsai from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Please go ahead.
Linda Tsai: Tenant allowances on new leases were up a little in the past two quarters, 32 a foot in 3Q and 39 in 4Q versus 24 to 25 the prior quarters. What’s driving these increases and will this remain elevated in the coming quarters?
Jim Thompson: Linda, it’s Jim. As I indicated, the mix this year – this quarter was really anchor driven. So that was one of the reasons. Obviously, we continue to see increases in construction costs in general across the board, but it was really mostly the mix, and they were all LA Fitness, Talbots, Marshalls, Edge Fitness, great tenants, really good merchandising backfills. But at the end of the day, when we step back and look at our capital spend, we think that number is somewhere between 10% to 10.5% of NOI at the end of the day and taking out the quarter-over-quarter movements, we think that we’ll continue to operate in that 10% to 10.5% NOI spend.
Linda Tsai: And then Amazon is opening a low-cost grocery store format in 2020 as an alternative to Whole Foods and Amazon Go. Will your properties see any of these openings? And if so, any store details you are comfortable sharing?
Lisa Palmer: Just as we answered that question last quarter, we are unable to talk about anything at this point.
Linda Tsai: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Chris Lucas from Capital One Securities. Your line is now live.
Chris Lucas: Yes good morning everyone. Just a follow-up on Serramonte, Macy’s had disclosed a store realignment programs, shrinking the footprint again. Have you guys had any conversations with them about your store there at Serramonte?
Mac Chandler: Chris, this is Mac. We talk to them all the time, and especially recently as part of this redevelopment. But they have given us no indication that they’re unhappy with the store or they haven’t requested rent relief or anything like that, so, no, new news in that front.
Chris Lucas: Any thoughts about being more proactive in terms of trying to buy them out?
Mac Chandler: We are always looking for opportunities just like that, just like we accomplished with JCPenney on that same property. So that’s always an option that we explore.
Chris Lucas: Okay. And then we’ve seen a couple of regional grocers file or – and/or close stores first part of this year, Fairway, Earth Fare, Lucky’s, you’ve got a little bit of exposure to Earth Fare and Lucky’s. Just curious as to how you’re thinking about the sort of regional grocery player at this point in the cycle and how you are thinking about sort of your tenancy in that vein going forward?
Lisa Palmer: Chris, we really haven’t changed our point of view. Generally speaking, as you’ve heard us speak quarter-after-quarter, we really want to make sure that we’re aligning ourselves with the better operators, with strong balance sheets, and with the ability to reinvest back in their business. So certainly, smaller operators and especially those with higher leverage, are facing more of an uphill battle. No question. And we continually are looking at that. It doesn’t mean that all regional, smaller grocers are not going to be able to survive and thrive in this environment, but they have to have the ability to reinvest back in the business in the in-store experience as well as technology, delivery, everything that’s happening in the world of grocery. It’s an ultra competitive retail segment and has been for a really long time. And those better operators that have the ability to be flexible, nimble and actually innovate are the ones that are going to continue to succeed in the future. It’s always disappointing to see any retailer sell, it impacts people’s lives, but it is part of the business, and it’s something that we’ve dealt with for as long as we’ve been a retail shopping center company.
Chris Lucas: Great, thank you. And that’s all I have this morning.
Operator: Thank you. We reached end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to Lisa for any further or closing comments.
Lisa Palmer: Just want to thank you all for your time. We’ll see some of you, I think, in the next month or so and a very quick happy birthday to Madison, Greg and Amy. Thank you all.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-10-31 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to Regency Centers Corporation Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to your host, Laura Clark, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets.  Thank you. You may begin.
Laura Clark : Good morning, and welcome to Regency's third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Hap Stein, our Chairman and CEO; Lisa Palmer, President; Mike Mas, Chief Financial Officer; Mac Chandler, Chief Investment Officer; Jim Thompson, Chief Operating Officer; and Chris Leavitt, SVP and Treasurer. On today's call, we may discuss forward-looking statements. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to our filings with the SEC, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. We will also reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. We provided a reconciliation of these measures to their comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release and financial supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website. Before turning the call over to Hap, I would like to highlight updates for development and redevelopment pages within our supplemental disclosure. We have included additional information in an effort to provide enhanced guidance around timing for initial rent commencement and stabilization, as well as expectations for NOI coming offline, as we position pipeline projects for start.  We hope you will find this useful. Hap?
Hap Stein : Thanks, Laura. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our leasing activity and pipeline and are experiencing healthy tenant demand across multiple categories. The retail environment continues to evolve, as grocers and retailers remain focused on the importance of high-quality physical locations that provide shoppers with the best combination of convenience, of service and of experience.  Regency will make the right decisions that will enable our shopping centers to remain relevant in driving places for outstanding retailers to connect with the surrounding neighborhoods and communities in the top markets across the country. As you'll hear from Lisa, the team is intensely focused on addressing short-term headwinds, driven by what we believe is a rare confluence of atypical bankruptcies together with the timing of larger redevelopments.  You should know that I share her confidence that we will soon return to core earnings and dividend growth and total returns that will be among the sector leaders to Regency's combination of strategic advantages, which include, our high-quality portfolio of community and neighborhood shopping centers anchored by high performing grocers located in the fluid and dense trade areas; our experienced development and redevelopment capabilities and deep pipeline; free cash flow after capitals and dividends that funds our developments and redevelopments on an extremely favorable and cost-effective basis, supported by our strong balance sheet; and Regency's exceptional team located in top markets across the country with a commitment to industry-leading, environmental, social and governance practices. Before turning the call over to Lisa, I am happy to report that the Executive Succession Plan that we announced last quarter is progressing well. Mike has seamlessly moved into the role of CFO and as you know, Lisa is fully prepared to be Regency's CEO, when I become Executive Chairman on January 1st.  I am extremely confident that Regency will continue to progress on our journey from good to great under Lisa and our talented team. Lisa?
Lisa Palmer : Thank you, Hap, and good morning, everyone. I want to reiterate how honored I am that you and Regency's Board of Directors have entrusted me to lead Regency. I am excited about the opportunity and I am looking forward to continuing to work alongside with you and with the rest of our exceptional team. First on the call today, I will provide some comments around our 2019 guidance. 2019 same-property NOI guidance has been updated to 2%, which is taking the high-end off the table. You may recall, last quarter, we stated that we did expect to finish the year at the low-end of our previous range of 2% to 2.5%.  And I will remind you that a few factors have contributed to this to our same-property NOI growth being below our strategic objective including the bankruptcy impacts specifically related to Sears Kmart, a muted contribution from redevelopment, and timing around leasing and move-outs in the first half of the year.  In spite of these headwinds, it is notable that we expect 2019 core operating earnings growth to come in at the high-end of our 3% to 4% range. Looking ahead to 2020, we will provide full year guidance with our fourth quarter earnings release. However, we want to share an initial preview of our 2020 expectations. Due to what we consider to be a unique set of circumstances, same-property NOI and core operating earnings growth in 2020 is currently expected to be flat to slightly positive.  This temporary dip in growth is primarily being driven by a couple of factors. First, an elevated impact from bankruptcies including a 50 basis impact just from Barney's, plus additional known and potential move outs for tenants such as IPIC, Dress Barn and Pier 1.  And second, an estimated $4 million of NOI that we are proactively taking offline next year for in-process and planned redevelopments will be offsetting the positive contribution from projects that were completing, as well as just the general timing of starts and deliveries. Beyond 2020, we do have conviction that we will return to 3% NOI growth and 4% plus earnings growth driven by a number of key components. We believe that the elevated impact from bankruptcies largely a result of our unique Barney's will return to a more normalized range in 2021.  While we are cognizant of the evolving retail environment and its challenges, the quality of our portfolio, our well-located properties and top notch team give me confidence, but going forward, and consistent with our experience in the past, Regency will have relatively lower exposure to store rationalization.  In addition, we continue to see healthy tenant demand as evidenced by our active and full leasing pipelines is giving me further confidence in the potential for upside in rent paying occupancy for both anchors and shops. We continue to achieve annual embedded rent steps, translating to a build in approximate a 130 basis points of growth across the portfolio. Growing rents in the 7% to 8% range also translates to an additional 100 basis points of growth. We are making great progress on our in-process redevelopment projects and we have good visibility to contributions that will support our 3% same-property growth objective in the future.  In fact, over the next five years, our pipeline is positioned to generate approximately $45 million of incremental NOIs from eight specifically identified projects including the Abbot, Market Common, Westwood and Serramonte to name a few that Mac will talk about and just a bit. And while the contributions from redevelopments will be uneven at times, as we prepare for and start these more complex projects. Over time, these value-creating redevelopments will translate into a positive contribution that should average approximately 75 basis points of growth, even with these two years of muted contribution.  Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, our team remains keenly focused on blocking and tackling and executing our strategy to enable Regency to return to sector-leading total returns. Jim?
Jim Thompson : Thanks, Lisa. Same-property NOI growth for the third quarter met our expectations at 2.1%. I am happy to report that Q3, the team executed most new shop leasing in nearly eleven quarters. We continue to have success embedding contractual rent steps into our leases, as evidenced by nearly 90% of our new shop leasing, include average annual steps of 2.4%.  This translates into strong straight-line rent spreads of 14%. Due to robust pipeline, we expect the positive leasing momentum to continue. At the same time, as we discussed in the first half of the year, the timing of leasing and move-outs earlier this year caused the decline in rent paying occupancy and in turn, lower same-property NOI growth for 2019. In regards to tenant fallout, we are diligently monitoring watch list retailers and focused on working with potential backfills for existing and future vacancies including our IPIC Theater and Dressbarn locations, as well as tenants like Pier 1, where we have 11 locations representing 20 basis points of annual base rent.  Foreclosures are a part of the business and our teams are discerningly back-filling these spaces, upgrading the merchandising mix and more often than not at higher rents. More importantly, as Lisa indicated, we have every reason to believe given the uniqueness of Barney's in our portfolio and the confluence of events that the elevated impact in 2020 is an anomaly. In regards to the status of Barney's location in Manhattan, the situation remains fluid, while our store in Chelsea is one of the location that remains open for now, it's likely that when we get the space back at year-end and is a significant driver to our flat 2020 growth expectations.  We are evaluating and pursuing alternative redevelopment plans and we feel good about the prospects for replacing the rent at this high-quality location, although this would certainly come with downtime and capital requirement.  It's important to keep in mind that we continue to execute on proactive asset management and center repositioning across the portfolio. We remain highly focused on making astute long-term merchandising decisions, which sets up our centers for future success. Mac?
Mac Chandler : Thanks, Jim. Our development and redevelopment opportunities remain significant and we are well-positioned to meet the strategic objective of starting $1.25 billion in value-add developments and redevelopments over the next five years.  As retail real estate evolves, the nature of development and redevelopment is changing as well, our focus on owning and operating premier shopping centers in dense infill and affluent trade areas positions us well to capitalize on increasing opportunities for horizontal and vertical mixed-use projects. As Lisa discussed, redevelopments are a key component for Regency to achieve 3% same-property growth over the long-term. But it's important to keep in mind that many of our current and near-term pipeline projects are larger in scale more, complex, and often include a mix of uses.  These projects typically take longer to complete and often require NOI to come offline. But once these projects stabilized, they will add substantial incremental NOI and value to our portfolio. With that, I'd like to provide updates on some of our larger in-process and near-term redevelopment projects. Redevelopment of our former office building at Market Common in Arlington, Virginia started in the fourth quarter of 2018. As a reminder, this outdated building was vacant when we purchased it in the adjacent retail.  The redevelopment entails configuring the three-story building essentially into a new four-story mixed-use office and retail building. Construction is progressing smoothly. The building is topped out and will be weather typed by year-end.  The exceptional views of the National Cathedral and execute at least with a leading luxury Fitness operator in the second quarter are very appealing features for our prospective office tenants. We anticipate tenants to begin coming online in 2021 with an estimated incremental yield of nearly 9%.  The Abbot redevelopment located in Harvard Square started this year with the entire $1.1 million of property NOI coming offline in the first quarter. Construction is progressing nicely, particularly now the demo is complete and footings are being prepared for a ground-up building.  Leasing activity is positive and we are in negotiations with several best-in-class retailers, fitness concepts and restaurants. We estimate initial occupancy to begin in 2021 at an estimated 9% incremental yield. Moving now to some of our near-term pipeline projects, at Serramonte Center located south of San Francisco, we expect to commence on the next phases of our redevelopment by year-end. This consists of three components that will be staggered over the next several years. The first project is the development of a new state-of-the-art 16-screen theater, as well as a 145-room hotel ground lease, several new outparcel restaurants and relocation of our successful Crunch Fitness. The second part of the project is a renovation of the interior of the mall, as well as several new exterior entrances. Both projects will increase foot traffic, supporting our productive in-line tenants, which now average $620 per square foot and paving the way for new retail concepts, which we look forward to announcing next year. Both projects are due to start in the next quarter. The third component is the redevelopment of the former JCPenney box, which benefits from tremendous visibility from Interstate 280. This 75,000 square foot space sets up well for a variety of junior anchors, including a specialty grocer. Groundbreaking is anticipated in 2021. Westwood Shopping Center in Bethesda Maryland is another large-scale redevelopment that we plan to start in early 2020. It will be converting a poorly configured giant anchored center into a vibrant mixed vertical center to include retail anchored by a new giant 200 multi-family apartments, 100 units of assisted living and approximately 84 sale town homes.  Consistent with our strategy, we are partnering with best-in-class co-developers for the non-retail components. The Phase 1 retail should open in 2022, and the Phase 2 apartments at ground floor retail shall open a few years thereafter. These are just some of our exciting projects in our near-term pipeline and we will provide regular updates on these and other significant projects on future earnings calls and in our supplemental disclosure. Mike?
Mike Mas : Thank you, Mac. Let me begin with some additional color around our third quarter earnings results and updated 2019 NAREIT FFO guidance. Third quarter NAREIT FFO includes a net positive $0.02 per share impact from a combination of one-time items.  First, a $0.01 per share negative impact from a swap breakage charge associated with the repayment of our term loan following our August bond offering. And second, an offset in $0.03 per share positive non-cash benefit from the accelerated amortization of below market rent triggered by our agreement to proactively terminate a lease with JCPenney at Serramonte. Under the termination agreement, JC Penney will move out at the end of May 2020, which requires us to ratably amortize their below market rent through this new termination date. Therefore, we will recognize another $5 million of below market rent in Q4 of this year, in addition to the $5 million recognized in Q3, and yet another $8 million in 2020.  Our 2019 NAREIT FFO guidance has been updated to reflect these impacts. Items like these provide a good reminder of why we use core operating earnings as a metric to better measure performance as it eliminates certain non-recurring and non-cash items more closely reflecting cash earnings and our ability to grow the dividend.  As Lisa mentioned, we are confirming our core operating earnings growth range of 3% to 4% for 2019, and expect to finish near the top of that range. Before wrapping up the call, let me first highlight one of the most important differentiating aspects of our business plan, our capital allocation and funding capabilities. We are fortunate to have access to many attractive funding options and now hold a positive outlook rating by both S&P and Moody's. And we are generating approximately $170 million of free cash flow annually, which funds our developments and redevelopments on a leverage-neutral basis. In addition, given the quality of our portfolio, we can be opportunistic and fortifying our 3% same-property NOI growth objective through the sale of non-strategic lower growth assets and deploying that capital into the acquisition of shopping centers with superior growth prospects. To that end, we acquired two compelling assets this quarter and we are able to take advantage of several attractive sources of capital. In August, we issued $425 million of 10-year unsecured notes at a Regency record low interest rate of 2.95%. We used a portion of these proceeds to repay our $300 million term loan with the balance partially funding, the $212 million Pruneyard acquisition. Our disposition guidance incorporates funding the remainder of this acquisition through the sale of lower growth assets on a tax-efficient earnings and leverage-neutral basis. In September, we funded the Circle Marina acquisition located in Long Beach, California, through a combination of secured debt and operating partnership units, which is yet another funding source in our playbook. And lastly, we executed on our ATM program in September, selling approximately $130 million in gross proceeds on a forward basis. As Mac discussed our development and redevelopment pipeline continues to grow and we are excited about the near-term value-add opportunities. We expect development and redevelopment spend to exceed our leveraged free cash flow in 2020 and proceeds from the forward ATM will be used to fund a portion of that spend.  This is a compelling funding source when priced correctly as it maintains our balance sheet strength and when compared to diluted property sales. Our flexible funding strategy is one of the many factors that contributes to Regency being well-positioned to meet our strategic objectives over the long-term, including starting $1.25 billion in value-add developments and redevelopments over the next five years, averaging same-property NOI growth of 3%, core earnings growth of 4% plus, and with dividend growth, total returns exceeding 8%. I'll turn the call back to Hap for closing remarks.
Hap Stein : Thank you, Mike. I'd like to take this opportunity on my last earnings call to thank not only all of the amazing Regency team members, team members that I've worked with over the last 40 years, but also to thank all the talented people in the investment community that I have interacted with throughout my career. This includes many of you who are on the phone with us today and with whom I will be able to meet with at the upcoming NAREIT.  Our constructive dialogs have truly made a contribution to Regency's success. It has been my pleasure to work with all – you all and an awesome honor to lead this special company to where it is today. I am looking forward to stepping into my new role as Executive Chairman, supporting Lisa and our exceptional team, as they successfully achieve Regency's goals. That concludes our prepared remarks and we now welcome your questions.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.
Greg McGinniss : Hey, good morning. This is Greg on with Nick. Just one question from me today. You seem committed to achieving this 3% same-store NOI growth over the long-term. But I am wondering what the expected timing is on that goal?  Or if I am just misunderstanding the growth number, because if we assume 2% same-store growth in 2018 and 2019, and then I guess, the zero to low-single in 2020. Does that mean we should be assuming nearly 5% growth from there out?
Lisa Palmer : Hey, Greg, it's Lisa. Just to answer your question, we will be getting full guidance for 2020, all the components of it on our fourth quarter earnings call. And so, at this time we are not giving 2020 guidance. We are certainly not going to – we are certainly not going to dip our toes into 2021 or 2022 or 2023.  But what I can tell you is just reiterate what I said on the call that, we do have confidence that we will return to achieving our strategic objectives and do that over the long-term. We have a lot of visibility to great value-creating projects in our redevelopment pipeline, some that are already in progress and those will – that value will be harvested, the timelines, they take a little bit of time.  And interestingly, we were talking about this earlier today, even just first retenanting some of our anchor boxes, the value creation is also is highly correlated to the amount of time that it's taking to complete these projects. So, we love our portfolio. We love our development platform. We love our balance sheet. And I love our team.  They may not all love me, but – and we are really excited about the future. We think we are really well positioned to continue to be a sector-leading owner, operator, developer of shopping centers.
Greg McGinniss : Okay, thanks. But just to clarify, so the 3% growth is kind of an average expected per year, that's not necessarily like over a five year period, you'll be achieving that 3% growth?
Lisa Palmer : It's over a long-term. It is an average of 3% over the long-term. I don't know that I have the exact number with me. Laura may write it down for me. But I believe that our five year average right now is 3.4% and we had several years that we were north of 4%. So, I do believe it's achievable.
Greg McGinniss : Okay, great. Thank you.
Hap Stein : Thanks, Greg.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Christy McElroy : Hey, good morning guys. Just following up on that flat growth expectation for 2020, is redevelopment expected to be a neutral or negative contribution? And appreciate the detail on each of kind of the larger projects.  But wondering, if you could update us on for FFO modeling purposes, sort of those downtime impact expectations for Westwood, Serramonte, Costa Verde as that space – any space comes offline over the next two years?
Mike Mas : Hey, Christy, it's Mike. With respect to the specific question on 2020 and the impact for redevelopments much more to come next quarter when we put our details. We are still refining our plans. But we did alluded to $4 million of NOI coming offline at two specific projects next year and Mac spent some time talking through those.  I would also point to you to our new disclosure, I think it's Page 19 or so in our supplement. The team has done a great job of trying to provide a little bit more visibility into the impacts of downtime. And more importantly, timing around a little bit to Greg's question, when NOI will start to return for these projects that we are working through, and then Mac took some time to step through.  Going forward, we will continue to be very descriptive on these projects, on these quarterly calls and in between – with meetings and we will be very, very sure to help everyone understand that the – it's about the ins and the outs. I would say this, we've averaged anywhere from 20 basis points to 130 basis points of positive contributions.  Obviously 2019 has been muted. And I would say that 2020 at this point in time we anticipate to look a lot like 2019.
Christy McElroy : Okay. Thanks, Mike. And then, just in terms of the forward equity raise, you mentioned that a portion of that will go to redevelopment spend. Is the balance going to acquisitions? And how do you sort of think about kind of the source of capital in terms of dispositions versus ATM issuance? Are you kind of a seller of additional equity here or has it all been kind of prefunded for 2020?
Mike Mas : Sure. It's a good question, and fair. It all starts with free cash flow. And as we've talked about a $170 million we are generating free cash flow given our low payout ratio. Importantly that's after CapEx, that's after dividend payments. And then, we look into our capital plan for next year and again this pipeline that we are building of active developments and redevelopments is leading us to a need to raise a little bit more capital than that leverage neutral free cash flow will provide. So we look at our portfolio and we assess whether we need to activate any pruning beyond our typical 1% per year or so.  And when we looked at the price, NAV is an art, not a science. We like this price with respect to our capital plan. I think, if you – if you think about consensus NAV and maybe what that implied cap rate may be and you think about our use of proceeds into developments and redevelopments averaging about 7% returns.  We like that trade and that's how we think about managing our capital plan. Importantly, we are committed to maintaining our balance sheet. We closed the quarter at 5.5 times. We like our ratings. We like the positive outlooks that we are on with both Moody's and S&P. And we will work to preserve the strength of that balance sheet as well.
Christy McElroy : Thank you.
Hap Stein : Thanks, Christy.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Richard Hill : Hey, good morning, guys. Lisa, maybe first for you, just strategically, would you changed anything with your redevelopments given what you know now about this confluence of the bankruptcies?
Lisa Palmer : Absolutely not. These are really great projects. And now that we have some enhanced disclosure hopefully that you can see that as well and you can see why we are excited about some of these. And I think, Mac actually talking about them on the call and some of you have even had an opportunity. And we even touched on some others.  Some of you have had an opportunity to visit some of these even or others like Town and Country. We are going to have an opportunity in Atlanta. So there is a lot of really exciting projects. And this is a – it's a marathon, it's not a sprint and we are focused on long-term value creation for our shareholders.
Richard Hill : Got it. That's helpful and very reassuring. I do have a follow-up question. I know you're not looking to give guidance right now. And I think we had a lot of us are trying to get out on the call is the mix between, maybe how much the redevelopment versus the confluence of bankruptcies is weighing on the flat growth?  Do you have any sense of, is it 75% of bankruptcies and 25% the redevelopment? How should we think about that mix?
Mike Mas : You're going to hear this a lot potentially today, but Rich, more to come obviously. but let's – we can’t talk about some of the facts that are out there and you should all be aware of. From a bankruptcy perspective, since 2015, we've averaged between 10 and 60 basis points of impact. If you just think about Barney's and IPIC, just as the unique bankruptcies that were up against next year, that's 80 basis points alone in two tenants.  So, that's far exceeding what we would call regular way business. So I think keep that in mind as you think through the impacts for 2020. I think the redevelopment contribution is what it is. It's another year of given the ins and outs of NOI, another year of muted contribution, which will look a lot like 2019.
Richard Hill : Got it. That's it for me. Thank you for the disclosure on the assets one-by-one. That's really helpful from our perspective.
Hap Stein : Thanks, Rich.
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Craig Schmidt : Yes. Just, thinking about the small shops, roughly on average, how many months does it take you to go from a closed store to one that is open and paying rent?
Mike Mas : Craig, I think we will probably in the – I must say eight month range. But I would say from lease execution to RCD is probably closer to four. 
Craig Schmidt : Okay. That's helpful. And then, will you be doing any lease modifications in 2020?
Lisa Palmer : In what sense, Greg?
Craig Schmidt : Where you – fearing to store closing, you may negotiate lower rents to keep them in place.
Lisa Palmer : I would – rent reduction, I think about the rent releases.
Mike Mas : We obviously take every situation on its own. Every deal stands on its own. We are appropriate and I'd suggest one of the reasons you saw a slight tick downturn on the renewal rates was effectively we had in this particular quarter, we had a couple of deals that I would call, standing still retailers. Keeping them placed until we can get them backfilled.  And you may take a little bit of a hit on a short-term basis to keep the space filled while you market the space. So, in general, I think, we've been pretty tough on rent reduction. Generally, we want our space back, if the tenant doesn't want to play by the rules, if you will. And we have found good success in reletting our space, when we get it back.
Hap Stein : And that's the exception rather than the rule.
Mike Mas : That is exception. 
Hap Stein : It may happen, but…
Mike Mas : If it happens, it's generally very short-term in nature.
Craig Schmidt : Okay, thank you. That is helpful.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shivani Sood with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
Shivani Sood : Hi, good morning. Switching to the private market side, we've heard from your peers that, that the investment markets, especially for the high-quality assets you are looking for is exceptionally tight right now.  So, if you could just comment on what you think is differentiating Regency from the peer set in the bidding process just given the higher volumes in the more accretive cap rates we are seeing year-to-date versus the initial guidance?
Mac Chandler : Hi, this is Mac. Thanks for your question. I do agree with that observation that, in fact the market is very tight there. There are very few qualities of the type of quality that we are looking for. We have a very high bar. And you are right, we have been successful buying properties off market, not just this year, but over the last several years.  We've got a track record for that. And I'll just use the Pruneyard as an example. That was off-market. The seller came directly to us based on our reputation and our ability to close quickly and to get our arms wrapped around it. I think an advantage is our 22 markets. We are in the market and we know these properties very well. Circle Marina is another example where we own three centers within half a mile and we've driven past this center for many, many years. It's been on our watch list and we simply approach the owner for many years and we finally came to terms with them. So it really gives us an advantage being out in the markets and having a reputation for being able to close quickly into settle at a price that was agreed upon.
Shivani Sood : Thanks for that color. And then, understanding the residential isn’t a huge part of their redevelopment at Town and Country Center. But have the recent changes due to the rent laws in California changed how you are underwriting that or thinking about that project?
Mac Chandler : That particular one is, is interesting in a sense that we have a 99-year ground lease with an apartment developer, who is going to develop that. And so they'll construct it. They'll own it. We have increases in that rent. So, they have no hesitation on moving forward with the project. We've been working with them for about a year now. We are into the city and we see no reason why that transaction would not close and they would commence rent as agreed upon. So, we keep an eye on it. But certainly our partner and partner in this case being the ground lessee, is – doesn't have any concerns.
Shivani Sood : Okay. Thanks for that color.
Hap Stein : Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Jeremy Metz : Hey, good morning. Just going back to the commentary on the investment activity. Obviously recognizing somewhat of a tight market, but you've also been pretty successful year. Here you mentioned the market strategy and that's driving some additional deal flow. So, beyond what you've closed already and what you outlined on the disposition front, you have the $200 million close your guidance is $300 million.  Do you have additional stuff either on the market for sale beyond that $300 million that we should be thinking about and on the buy, is there anything that's really kind of active in the pipeline that you are excited about that could maybe come to fruition here or early next year?
Mac Chandler : Sure, Jeremy. This is Mac. One of the advantages of buying a center like, The Pruneyard is it gives us an opportunity to exchange a property that we sell that has an embedded tax gain. And so, we do have a couple properties that we are looking to sell, where we would exchange that gain and park it into the Pruneyard.  However, we don't feel that we are under any pressure to close that sale. But we do have a couple transactions that are out there. And you are right that makes up about the remaining 100 million. And if it works, it's great. But, like I said, we are under no pressure to consummate that. So, we don't usually get into the exact transaction, just details to it. On the buy side we are always in the market. We are always looking for properties. That's how we've been successful in the past and if opportunities that are compelling and meet our high or high bar for quality and income growth come our way, we'll address those as they come.
Jeremy Metz : All right. So doesn't sound like necessarily an M&A here? And then Lisa, thanks for the initial color on 2020. On the same-store NOI expectations as we take that into account, the details you outlined, the impact from Barney's. Just thinking about managing expectations here, should we be thinking about earnings growth around a similar level to that or Is there anything positive or negative that could swing higher or lower from there?
Lisa Palmer : Again, we'll give a lot more detailed guidance in the quarter. But as I said in the prepared remarks that we expect those to be in a similar range.
Jeremy Metz : Got it, Mac and Lisa, thanks.
Mac Chandler : Thanks, Jeremy.
Operator: Our next question comes from Samir Khanal with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.
Samir Khanal : Good morning, Mike, or Lisa. I guess on Barney's. I'm just trying to get a little bit more color, if you have that. I mean, if you were to get the space back, I mean, how long do you think you get sort of property entitlements on that and then – and get a tenant back in? And also, how should we think about the rent on that box? I know it's about 80 bucks a foot there, I mean, how should we think about the economics?
Mike Mas : Let me start, and I'll kick it to Jim, as he maybe provide a little bit more color on how he is thinking about the space. But Samir, as we said, we are effectively planning for Barney's to be down next year. So much more to come as we roll out our guidance for 2020 and then we'll continue to report on this project as we have and enhanced our disclosure on the other projects.  We'll treat Barney's very similarly and get as much visibility as we can to the extent of the downtime, the extent of the capital and when we anticipate that rent coming back on board. But I'll let Jim speak to what we have been doing to this point. What our thoughts might be.
Jim Thompson : Thanks, Mike. We really like the real estate and we will be able to replace that revenue. Our team is actively engaged as we speak in evaluating the alternative scenarios. And obviously, the different uses that may be available to us. But as Mike said, much more to come, but we are diligently pursuing all the avenues at this point.
Samir Khanal : Okay. And I guess, a follow-up maybe a big picture question, Lisa. It sounds like you're a little – you are being a little bit more active on projects sort of late in the cycle, whether it's the redevelopments, or even in the development side, maybe taking space offline even at Westwood. I guess, how are you balancing that decision to do more projects with the potential server of a – the overhang of a risk coming from an economic slowdown, given that there is a lot of economic uncertainty out there?
Lisa Palmer : Gosh, If I knew when the next downturn was going to be, I might not be sitting at this table. I might be somewhere else. These projects are really generational projects and it's especially the redevelopments, right, real estate that we already own. And really high barrier markets, infill neighborhoods and even in what was obviously, right, the second worst recession in our country, in back in 2009, these types – this quality real estate that we own still performed really well.  And so, we don't have our heads in the sand. We know, we realize that there is a lot of clouds out there in terms of economic uncertainty, but these projects I believe will even perform well and withstand what that the economic cycles that we know are coming.
Samir Khanal : And they'll go through the cycles.
Lisa Palmer : And they will go through the cycles.
Samir Khanal : Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Wes Golladay : Hey, good morning to everyone. Can you give us an update on your tenant watch list? I mean, from last quarter, it sounds like it was a few percent, but now it sounds like you are cycling through a few of those tenants. So did that come down? And what is your remaining department store exposure?
Mike Mas : Hey, Wes, this is Mike. From a watch list perspective, three is really no change quarter-over-quarter from what we've talked about in the past. Tenants, as you'd mentioned have come off the list. So, there is no longer impacts of Sears, et cetera and Barney's is now moving to a different class. But as we look forward, obviously we are – our eyes around tenants like Pier 1 and others.  We are taking care of JCPenney as we mentioned with the termination agreement. But I would say, it's essentially pretty neutral. I'll go back to the bankruptcy history that we've absorbed into our NOI that figure, since 2015. It's been in that 10 basis point to 60 basis point range for tenants that are outside of this Barney's/IPIC situation that we are currently looking at.
Wes Golladay : Let me just clarify, were they on the list of the Barney's, the JCPenneys, the Pier 1s and the...
Mike Mas : Absolutely.
Wes Golladay : Okay. So – but is that, I mean, some backfilling now?
Mike Mas : No. I mean, we are just generally in that same range. I would think historically it's been our watch list maybe we'll walk through that. We think about it in three categories. We obviously are financial from a bankruptcy risk perspective. And then, when we look at store closure risk and that's where you can have – we want our teams to be aware of the change that are looking to rationalize their fleets. Generally speaking Regency does well in that regard. We typically own the centers that perform in the upper half, upper quartile of those change and in the rationalization scenario, we don't generally lose as much space as you otherwise would think. And then lastly, we'd like to include operators to retailers who are – may not be in financial distress, or actively shrinking their fleet sizes, but maybe came through some operational changes that we just want to be aware of. You put all that together, it is probably a tick down because of the fact that we moved Sears through the list and we are going to move Barneys through the list, but it's about the same, Wes.
Wes Golladay : Okay. And then what about the remaining department store exposure?
Mike Mas : What is that? 
Jim Thompson: It's mainly Macy's, in a very, very low rent 
Wes Golladay : At Serramonte?
Jim Thompson: Yes, at Serramonte
Wes Golladay : Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vince Tibone with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.
Vince Tibone : Hi, good morning. What was the rationale for doing a forward equity offering versus just issuing equity through the ATM today?
Mike Mas : Hey, Vince, this is Mike. We've used forward sales before. So we have a track record of that tool. We like that opportunity for us to best match fund our needs. So as we look to our capital plan for 2020 and we pointed this towards building redevelopment pipeline. That's in effect why we use the forward?
Vince Tibone : And is there, is there more fees than just doing a normal offering just from my perspective I am trying to get a sense of – I get the match funding or it helps a little bit with I guess earnings dilution in the near term, but are there more fees that accompanying it forward?
Mike Mas : On the extreme margin it is a - just a touch more fees, but it is negligible.
Jim Thompson: Yes. I mean, economically, the forward is better or else we wouldn't choose to do it.
Vince Tibone : Got it. And then just for – and you can do this in multiple phases over the next 12 months? Or is that a one, one-period you will get the full equity raise or one day, rather?
Mike Mas : It's at our discretion, Vince. And we will be very clear, either in the guidance that we'd roll out next quarter or on subsequent calls on our timing, as we have in the past when we've had outstanding forward issuances?
Vince Tibone : Got it. That's really helpful. And one more, just shifting gears a little bit. Could you talk a little bit about the trends you are seeing in the small shop segment of your portfolio? Specifically, kind of, I am curious which retailers or merchandise categories are kind of moving in and out of those, of the shop space in general?
Jim Thompson : Yes, Vince, this is Jim. As evidenced I think by the leasing progress we've made this year, I think you can see, we feel the market is still strong. Our pipeline is robust. The categories, it's really the same folks that we've been doing business with the off-price, the fitness, beauty, medical, restaurants, obviously. But it's really - we are seeing good activity across all our regions and activity remains strong. I think our fundamentals, we feel real good about our fundamentals.
Vince Tibone : Just on the fall outside then just because I know leased occupancy has been flat throughout the year and within shops, but where has fallouts been kind of just as a result of bankruptcies? Are you seeing any weakness with mom-and-pop tenants?  Just curious, if you elaborate a little bit more on where you've seen the kind of drop out of shop tenants, because does it sound – does it seem like the demand side is still there? But you and others across the sector have had flat to the negative shop occupancy changes of this year?
Lisa Palmer : I am going to lead Jim to the water. I want to remind everyone that our shop percent leased is, it's at a pretty healthy level. And I think, 91.5%. 
Mike Mas : 91.6%.
Lisa Palmer : 91.6%. So, can we increase that and add occupancy, I think we can. But I also believe that of those that have reported, I think we might be the high watermark. So, that's just part of the business. And we've recently did a market showcase in Raleigh and I reminded people that were there that when we are buying a property and we do underwriting and we underwrite renewal rate we essentially say one out of every four tenants are going to fail.  So, that's our business. And the way that we manage that is, very proactively as Jim even alluded to earlier in terms of when people are coming up for renewals, the ones that are kind of standing still, we are really evaluating. Is this a tenant that we think is going to be able to survive and not just survive, but thrive and really drive traffic and energy to our centers.  So, I think that 91.5% and while I do believe that we could increase occupancy, if we kept it flat, I think that that would help meet our expectations.
Vince Tibone : No, that's really helpful color. Thank you. That's all I have.
Mike Mas : Thanks, Vince.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Michael Mueller with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Mueller : Yes, hi. In terms of the flat same-store NOI outlook for next year, can you give us a sense as to how the timing of some of the bankruptcies is expect, excuse me, expected to play out, because obviously the later that it hits in the year, the more it's going to bleed over into 2021, as well?
Mike Mas : Hey, Mike, more to come on timing of all of our expectation supporting, what I will clarify to be flat to slightly positive, 2020 expectation. However, we all know Barney's is in bankruptcy. We all know IPIC is in bankruptcy. So, it would be safe to assume that we are taking the full brunt of that in 2020.
Michael Mueller : Got it. That was it. Thank you.
Mike Mas : Thanks, Mike.
Operator: Our next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Linda Tsai : Hi, good morning. Taking into account your low payout ratio, especially compared to your peers, but acknowledging that you are using free cash or developments and redevelopments. Does this reduce the probability that you'd raise your dividend more aggressively, maybe during this period where same-store is below your longer term growth target?
Lisa Palmer : Before Mike answers, let me remind you that to that free cash flow is after dividends.
Mike Mas : Correct. And Linda, we are committed to – we are committed to increase in our dividend annually. We made that statement very clear. I think, we reinstituted the annual growth of around 2014 when we made the pivot from portfolio enhancement. And then what we've also said is, we are be given that low payout ratio that our dividend growth rate would approximate our earnings growth rate.  I would say that flat to slightly positive should translate to a similar amount of dividend growth, although, we do have the flexibility and the capacity to be flexible there. So more to come. But we do anticipate that maintaining that commitment to annual dividend increases.
Linda Tsai : Thanks for that. And then just broadly speaking, I know you're not giving guidance, but what's the general view in terms of the balance between acquisitions and dispositions for next year?
Mike Mas : Like I said, and I’ll repeat, we like our portfolio. We are – at the same time, we are committed to continued recycling of a small amount. We think that, that pays dividends going forward in our exposure to at risk tenants and in our ability to meet our long-term strategic objectives of growing NOI at 3% or better. So, more to come. But I wouldn't be surprised to see guidance that is in the approximation of what we've done historically which has been in that 1% range.
Linda Tsai : Thanks.
Mike Mas : Thank you, Linda.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] There are no further questions at this time. At this point, I'd like to turn the call back to Hap Stein for closing comments.
Hap Stein : Yes. Once again, I want to thank all my friends in the investment community. It has been a real treat working with you. And I look forward to seeing a number of you at the upcoming NAREIT. Everybody have a great day. Enjoy Halloween with your family and a weekend beyond that.  Thank you very much.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And we thank you for your participation.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-08-02 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings. Welcome to Regency Centers Corporation Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference over to Laura Clark. Ms. Clark, you may now begin.
Laura Clark: Good morning and welcome to Regency's second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Hap Stein, our Chairman and CEO; Lisa Palmer, our President and CFO; Mac Chandler, EVP of Investments; Jim Thompson, EVP of Operations; Mike Mas, Managing Director of Finance; and Chris Leavitt, SVP and Treasurer. On today's call, we may discuss forward-looking statements. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Please refer to our filings with the SEC, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. We will also reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. We provided a reconciliation of these measures to their comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release and financial supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website. Before turning the call over to Hap, I want to mention our upcoming Raleigh market showcase event in early October. This event will feature our high quality properties including recent developments, redevelopment and acquisitions as well as our local market team. We hope that many of you will be able to join us, and I'm happy to provide more details to those of you who would like to attend. Hap?
Hap Stein: Thanks Laura. Good morning everyone. Before discussing our results and outlook for the remainder of the year and for the future, I'd like to highlight that executive changes we announced yesterday. I'm extremely excited that Lisa Palmer will become President and Chief Executive Officer effective January 1st, 2020, and at that time, I will transition to Executive Chairman. On August 12th, Mike Mas will become Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, Jim Thompson and Mac Chandler will be appointed Chief Operating Officer and Chief Investment Officer to better recognize their roles within the company. This succession is the result of a well-considered plan that Regency has been crafting for the last several years and we have no hesitation that this transition will be seamless. I'm deeply gratified to work with the best professionals in the business. Regency's people are the cornerstone of the company and our values and may have worked together to build a truly wonderful company. Lisa is the embodiment of Regency's culture and success. Over the last several years, Lisa and I have been partners in the direction of Regency, making decisions together every step of the way through Regency's vision, strategy, and consistent execution. And it's through this partnership I know that our understanding of the business, our ability to execute on our strategy, our experience in the capital markets as well as our devotion to our special culture position her to continue to build on Regency's past success. And with the support of the executive team and of our people, we'll continue our focus on being the preeminent national owner, operator, and developer of shopping centers. Now to the quarter, Lisa, Jim, Mac, and Mike will discuss in more detail how we're operating in and in our view is a recently favorable environment which is reflected in the underlying fundamentals. This includes a portfolio that is over 95% leased, net growth in high single-digits and bad debt at prior year's healthy levels. That said, the delayed timing of new leasing in the first half of the year as well as not exceeding our assumptions for move-outs resulted in a decline in rent paying occupancy. This has impacted the second quarter as well as the back half of the year. As a result, we now expect to finish towards the lower end of our same-property NOI growth range, which doesn't meet our high expectations. However, in spite of moderately lower NOI growth in 2019, this year, we continue to generate substantial free cash flow translating into meaningful growth in core earnings and AFFO. Most important of all, I'm confident in our unequaled combination of strategic advantages including the quality of our portfolio, our development capabilities, the strength of our balance sheet and our high -- highly engaged team has and will continue to position Regency to be a leader in the shopping center sector and generate total returns of 8% to 10%. Now, I'll turn the call over to Regency's future Chief Executive Officer, Lisa Palmer.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Hap, and good morning, everyone. I want to thank Hap and the Board for this tremendous opportunity. We are truly fortunate to have had such an impactful leader of our company and for our employees. Hap and our senior leadership team with the guidance of an exceptional Board -- in the company for a seamless transition. As Hap said, we've worked so closely together along with Mike, Jim and Mac, and our entire team is ready and excited to continue to build on Regency's past success and move the company forward as we realize our vision and achieve our key objectives. Moving to the quarter, I'd like to highlight a few things as our team continued to execute on our strategy. Our high quality portfolio remains at a healthy 95% leased and our leasing pipeline is deep. We started exciting new development and redevelopment projects including Culver City market in the, which Mac will talk about in just felt a bit. We further enhanced the quality of our portfolio through the acquisition of a premier shopping centers in Silicon Valley, and with our balance sheet strength, we are able to fund the acquisition on an essentially non-dilutive leverage neutral basis. Our conservative balance sheet at approximately $170 million of free cash flow, which is after capitals and dividends, continue to provide substantial financial flexibility and access to capital through future cycles. We recently published our annual Corporate Responsibility Report which highlights our commitment to our people, our communities, our best-in-class ethics and corporate governance and environmental stewardship. And importantly, we now expect core operating earnings to grow 3% to 4% for the year and AFFO by over 6%. Our portfolio continues to benefit from the successful retailers that are expanding their physical presence. Our high volume grocers are driving substantial foot traffic as brick-and-mortar locations remain a critical component to their strategy and at the center of their success. These best-in-class grocers are attracting desirable shop retailers and restaurants as they continue to commit resources to customer service, the store experience, value, and technology initiatives. And in spite of the well-publicized headwinds from the retail sector, we remain confident that our high quality portfolio will outperform over the long term and meet our strategic objective to average same-property NOI growth of 3%, which is supported by organic growth as well as positive contributions from our attractive pipeline of redevelopment opportunities. The continued execution of our proven strategy has positioned Regency extremely well to achieve these objectives. Mac? Sorry. I'm going hand it over to Jim.
Jim Thompson: Thanks Lisa. Same-property NOI growth in the first half of the year of 2.1% was supported by base rent growth, of 2.5%. The quality, appearance and location of our properties as well as our Fresh Look merchandising continued to elicit good demand. This is evidenced by new and renewal leasing volume in the first half of this year which exceeded the first half in 2018. Move-outs and bad debt that remained near prior year levels are both indicative of a healthy tenant base. We are astutely managing our leasing capitals and achieving high single-digit leasing spreads and executing on embedded rent increases, both of which are contributing to straight line rent growth of 16% for the trailing four quarters. That said, relevant retailers as well as Regency continue to be diligent and deliberate in lease negotiations as well as site and merchandising selection, which contributed to delays and lease timing in the first half of the year. In addition, timing associated with permitting and the construction process in markets where the retail environment is striving continue to cause delays. We're also executing on our proactive asset management to fortify our merchandising mix as well as our same-property NOI growth over the long-term. I'd like to share a few notable examples that occurred this quarter. At our Riverside Square Center in Chicago, we proactively captured a space from a regional gym operator and upgraded that merchandising with Blink Fitness, a premium quality, value-based fitness concept that is a subsidiary of Equinox. Blink took a total of 15,000 square feet at a rent that was over 20% accretive to the former operator. Also in Sheridan Plaza in South Florida, we declined Bed, Bath & Beyond's request to renew and reduce rent. We captured that space and are executing on a new lease with Burlington at 130% rent spread. These examples as well as many others demonstrate that we are being thoughtful and making the right long-term decisions even when resulting in downtime. In regards to potential future bankruptcy filings and store rationalization, we are diligently monitoring launch list retailers. Our local teams have been actively marketing many of these spaces, and given the desirability of our real estate, there are a number of backfill prospects we're working with. Should we get these spaces back, we expect to upgrade the merchandising often at higher rents. The recent news around the potential for Barney's to file bankruptcy was new information and there's much uncertainty around the eventual outcome. Importantly, despite their corporate struggles, we feel good about the long-term prospects of this unique location in Chelsea. All that said, while the bankruptcies and store closures continue to dominate the headlines, expanding categories like off-price, fitness, restaurants, entertainment, and grocery users are making up for these closures and presenting merchandising upgrades and redevelopment opportunities, leaving us feeling good about the state of our business. Mac? 
Mac Chandler: Thanks Jim. Our capital allocation strategy, which clearly differentiates Regency's business model starts with $170 million of annual free cash flow after capitals and dividends. This enables us to fully self-fund our development and redevelopment objective, start and deliver $1.25 billion over five years on an extremely favorable and cost-effective basis. In the second quarter, we started our terrific ground-up development in Culver City, arguably the most sought-after market in Southern California. This dense and build project will be anchored by Urbanspace, one of the leading market hall operators as well as several local restaurants and retailers. The area of Culver marketplace is extremely compelling, with more than 275,000 people with average household incomes of over $125,000. We also started four redevelopments this quarter, the largest being our mixed use project in Cambridge, known as The Abbott. We're extremely excited about this exceptional opportunity and its value creation. The Abbott is the most prominent location in Harvard Square, benefits from tremendous foot traffic and world-class demographics. Our in-process developments and redevelopments are performing well. The projects are nearly 90% leased and committed with the expected yields that remain comfortably well above cap rates for comparable Class A properties. Our in-process redevelopments as well as select future redevelopment opportunities are on track to contribute over $40 million of incremental NOI. One such example is our Westwood Shopping Center in Bethesda. Now, that we have secured our entitlements, we continue to advance our plans and look forward to discussing more details later this year. As we've previously communicated, a key component of our investment strategy is portfolio quality enhancement through the acquisition of premier assets. On July 1st, we did just this with our acquisition of The Pruneyard, a 258,000 square foot center in the heart of Silicon Valley. This iconic center anchored by Trader Joe's and Marshalls sits in close proximity to the West Valley's most affluent neighborhoods and technology employers and is merchandize to superb local retailers and restaurants. Adjacent to The Pruneyard are three office towers and a hotel, which were not part of transaction, but do contribute to our significant foot traffic. The Pruneyard is expected to generate a 3.5% NOI CAGR and an IRR in excess of 6.5%. This is yet another example of a strategic acquisition that serves to fortify our NOI growth. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we plan to fund the transaction will lower growth dispositions combined with debt in an unsecured market, both of which are reflected in our guidance upgrades. Mike? 
Mike Mas: Thank you, Mac. I'd like to provide some color on our reaffirmed same-property NOI growth and updated earnings guidance. First, we are maintaining our initial 2019 same-property NOI growth guidance range of 2% to 2.5%, which is centered around varying degrees of new renewal and move-out activity. As we've discussed this morning, net leasing activity that occurred over the first half of the year and, more importantly, the timing of that activity has led to our current expectation for same-property NOI growth to end the year closer to the lower end of this range. And for added clarity, please also note that our reaffirmed range does not incorporate any potential loss from Barney's as that situation remains very fluid. And as Jim mentioned, there is much uncertainty around the eventual outcome. Our annual rent exposure to Barney's is approximately $4.9 million, same-property NOI growth could be impacted by up to a maximum of 25 basis points this year. As we have previously communicated, coming into this year, our 2019 same-property NOI growth range falls below our 3% strategic objective, primarily due to the long-awaited Sears bankruptcy, together with the muted contribution from redevelopment deliveries. However, as we consider the high quality of our portfolio and look forward to the visible redevelopment opportunities in our pipeline, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our objective to average same-property growth of 3% over the next five years. Turning to FFO, the Barney's credit situation resulted in an unexpected non-cash expense of approximately $0.02 per share from the reserve of the tenant's straight line receivable. This non-cash charge will be offset by a number of other positive impacts for the full year including more favorable G&A and a slight push in timing of our planned disposition, which in total allowed us to tighten our efforts while keeping the midpoint constant at $3.83 per share. As a reminder, we like to use core operating earnings as a better metric to measure performance for Regency as it eliminates certain non-recurring and non-cash items and more closely reflects cash earnings and our ability to grow the dividend. In the second quarter, we grew core operating earnings by 4.6% after adjusting for the lease accounting change. And given the positive impacts of lower G&A and new disposition timing, we now expect to grow core operating earnings per share for the full year by 3% to 4%. You may recall that this range was wider with the floor of 2% when we initially offered guidance. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we now welcome your questions.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Christine McElroy with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Christine Tulloch: Hey, good morning everyone. Just first Michael and Katie, and I just wanted to offer our congratulations to Lisa and the rest of the team. Obviously, part of the longer term plan, but well deserved. And Hap, we'll definitely miss you in the fray, but we know you'll still be around. Just to follow-up, Mike, on some of the Barney's stuff. I know it's not in the same-store range yet for 2019, but does this potentially derail -- I know it's only 30 basis points, but you have a plan to sort of get back to that 3% same-store NOI growth rate by 2020. Does that -- does this and sort of the timing issues in 2019 potentially impact that? And with regard to that specific store, it's not a normal holding for you. I know the focus for them has been more on their Midtown store rent, but how would you feel about having to re-lease that space versus where that market is today?
Mike Mas: Thank you, Christine. I appreciate the question. I'll leave the re-tenanting to Jim, but let me first address your question around our NOI growth, and I think what you're asking the future profile. I'm not going to give 2020 guidance at this point in time. We're just not prepared for that. But I would say that, listen, Barney's, Sears, Toys before that, this is part of the business. Always have been. We're going to have retailers who fail and we'll continue to have retailers who fail. This is a large rent for us and a 0.25 point impact for this year and under a lot of assumptions, maybe 0.25 point next year as well. That being said, it's just two to -- it's a 2.25, 2.5 business organically, again assuming that we're going to have tenant fallout. Again the real reason we're at these levels this year is the lack of and the muted contribution from redevelopment deliveries, and we've been very vocal and have communicated with them in the past. The exciting part is we see redevelopment pipeline continue to make progress, and Mac and I have color on that. You saw us start The Abbot. You saw us -- we're making great progress on Westwood. Market common is underway. All of these are why we believe our future NOI very clear that our five year average from this point forward will be back in that 3% range, which is consistent with our objective. With respect to Barney's, I'll let Jim comment on the re-leasing.
Jim Thompson: Chris, you're right. It is a bit of a -- property for our portfolio. But ever since the merger, we felt that, that underlying real estate and Chelsea address had really long-term potential for future opportunity. Let's back up a little bit, but in fact, we had unsolicited offers to buy that asset in the past. Trader continues to improve. And at the end of the day, yes, we think there is value at play should we get the real estate back. Obviously, there's tremendous amount of uncertainty as to what will happen during this discussion of bankruptcy, but our team is evaluating options as we speak. So, more to come as we learn more.
Christine Tulloch: Okay. Thanks. And then understanding you've raised your disposition expectation to help fund -- but do you have anything under contract for sale today? Sorry if I missed that, Mac, in your comments. And was the downward revision to the distribution cap rate a function of the mix and what you're selling or sort of better execution for what you expected?
Mac Chandler: Thanks Christy. Nothing under contract, although we're negotiating three different purchase contracts to identify the buyer. And then we have three other properties that we've taken out to the market, so they're virtually on The Street. So, initial interest on those -- we feel good about it. And then the reason we've lowered our cap rate on the disposition is we've gotten a little bit better pricing than we expected. And if you look at what we sold today, keep in mind, too, we've had -- about a third of those assets are Louisiana properties that sold for roughly 10 caps. So, if we average that in there, gives you a good indication of the quality of our properties and the pricing that we've been able to realize.
Christine Tulloch: Thanks so much.
Hap Stein: Thank you, Christy and appreciate your nice comments, greatly appreciate.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.
Jeremy Metz: Hey, good morning and congrats on all the appointees. I'll echo Christy's comment there. You mentioned.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you before Hap had the chance to jump me. So, thanks, Jeremy, thank you.
Jeremy Metz: So, in the opening remarks you mentioned the lowering of the same-store NOI range is the delay in timing for some rent payments. I'm just wondering any more color you can give on that in terms of what you're driving some of that relative to the expectation. And you did mention the permitting and the construction delays, but I don't really think that's necessarily new. We heard about this process strategy last year, so I would assume some of that was built on the expectations. But any more color on that?
Hap Stein: Let me start, and again, we'll clean up on here in a little bit. Again, I appreciate you bringing it up. So, we are focused and our team's eyes are pointing towards the lower end of the range right now. And it's really due primarily to the timing of our net leasing activity that we experienced over the first six months. So, the way I'd like to describe it in other words is we're expecting our average rent paying occupancy to be a little bit lower for a little bit longer this year, and that is lower than what we had hoped for. However, it is more consistent with the assumption that we had in place supporting the lower end of our range. So, now the question is we look at the year. Importantly, we remain very comfortable with the assumptions on both ends at this point in time, although our eyes are pointing toward the bottom. At this point in time of the year, it's more about move-outs assumptions obviously. And with respect to that, more positive results on that front as well as net increase in timing of our expenses what you give us to outperform. So we'll focus on that. But again, it's really timing, tenant demand is healthy, and Jim will speak to that. Volumes have been very good. They're roughly in line with our expectations and they're roughly in line with prior years.
Jim Thompson: Yes, Jeremy, I'll just piggyback a little bit on that. The volumes have been strong. Pipeline is solid. When you look at our shops, we're at 91.5% on the small shops space today. We consistently been in the 91% to 93% range, which has been quite frankly at or near at the top of our sector. So, we're still optimistic and bullish on the tenant demand. We think the continued execution of our redevelopment, remerchandising opportunities and efforts will continue to keep this in that 91% to 93% range. And personally, I'm bullish that we can move towards the higher end of that range as we execute on these redevelopments and remerchandising.
Jeremy Metz: Helpful. Thanks. And then second for me just in terms of The Pruneyard acquisition, should we think about this just more as a stabilized type of acquisition, or is there any value-add or notable upside potential there that you can be sitting on? And just sticking with aiding further in the pipeline on the acquisition, you can maybe can get to the goal line here.
Mac Chandler: Sure Jeremy this is Mac. I think in the short-term, you can expect this to be, as we've discussed, various property with great CAGR at 3.5%. 10-year CAGR is going to pick up kind of quickly because there's about five tenants are in buildout that haven't commenced rent that should happen over the next nine months. Further out, maybe 10 -- more than 10 years out, there's a couple of other boxes that will roll the market and there could be some really interesting opportunities here, the sports basement box, sets itself up. You can do a lot of different things with that. Don't want to get ahead of ourselves, but it is one of the reasons we'd like the property long-term, there's tremendous demand for office, multifamily, just the kind of demand that we look for. As to other acquisitions, we already guided and we're getting really close on. There are couple of properties that were looking at, that are acquisitions that would have a redevelopment focus and we really prefer those properties that use our team, our platform, and our capital, and those two midsized projects that hopefully we can give you a little bit more color on next quarter.
Jeremy Metz: Thanks. Appreciate.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Richard Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Richard Hill: Hey good morning guys. Lisa or Mike, I want to come back to The Pruneyard and think about how much of the benefited was to FFO. Recognize you kept the FFO guide consistent at a tighter range despite the $0.02 onetime non-cash in straight-line rent charge. So, that mean we should think about The Pruneyard as maybe a $0.02 benefit that offset that? 
Lisa Palmer: Now, Rich, in my prepared remarks I think I commented that we're doing this essentially on a non-dilutive -- although I didn't say pretty good but essentially earnings neutral. It was the fact that going in cap rates in the mid-4s and we're going to be funding that partially with disposition and we're seeing our disposition guidance we're able to offset the cost of that this position as well as the cost debt. So, it's essentially earnings neutral. If you just remind everyone just strategically why these acquisitions make sense, it's an important part of our capital allocation strategy to continue to fortify that NOI growth to acquire premier assets. And we've talked about it in the past. It's no accident that we've been able to maintain and lead our sector with above same-property NOI growth. And we think the continued enhancement of the quality of the portfolio -- we don't need to, but we're very opportunistic in doing so, I think that's an important part of our strategy.
Richard Hill: That makes perfect sense. Thanks guys.
Mike Mas: Real quick on FFO. The offset to a non-cash charge was, as we indicated in the call, better G&A expectations as well as a slight timing enhancement to our dispositions.
Richard Hill: Got it. Okay, that's all from me. And congrats to everyone on the call as well.
Hap Stein: Thanks Rich.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Craig Schmidt: Yes. Also I'd like to jump on and give congratulations to all those promoted in the executive leadership change, and it's great to see talent developed within the company. So, again, congratulations. I wondered if we could discuss just a little bit the allocation of capital of redevelopments versus acquisitions and maybe talk about what was more compelling reason to buy The Pruneyard, was it the asset quality or its upside opportunity.
Hap Stein: I think that the number one use of our capital, $170 million of free cash flow, is to fund our development and redevelopment program. And the majority of those investments today are redevelopments. And then I would say in the second priority becomes value-add acquisitions like Mac implied that we're looking at right know when there's a meaningful upside. And in the third category will be core acquisitions -- high quality acquisitions with superior growth prospects like The Pruneyard and 3.5% project NOI growth plus a potential upside beyond that. And we're funding those through the sale of assets. And as Lisa mentioned, given our right now and we think we can do it on essentially on earnings and balance sheet neutral basis with superior NOI growth going forward and/or value add opportunities going forward.
Craig Schmidt: Great. Thank you.
Hap Stein: Thank you, Craig.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Samir Khanal with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.
Samir Khanal: Good morning everyone. So, just switching gears a little bit on grocers. I know just curious to get your views on Albertsons. It sounds like they're starting to move in the right direction. They're addressing leverage. Curious as to see what you're seeing on the ground again the exposure they have.
Lisa Palmer: I'll take that one, Samir. Just for the past couple of years really, three years potentially, even we've seen continual improvement in the actual store operations of Albertsons, better sales sometimes anecdotally they're reporting, but generally better operations. And as they went through some management changes, and we know their management pretty well, especially their last CEO, and under that very short period of time, right after that kind of failed RiteAid merger, they really pivoted on improving the balance sheet as well and they made tremendous improvements in their balance sheet and further improvements in their operations and even their margins. If you were to go read some research reports, you'll see that Albertsons actually has some of the healthiest EBITDA margins in the sector. So, that's Albertsons and that's how -- so we're comfortable with the direction in which they are headed. But even more importantly, the quality, we really like our real estate and the quality of the grocers, the individual stores of Albertsons that we have in our centers are above average, and the real estate itself is well above average. So, we like our position with Albertsons, but we do recognize the potential risks of that.
Samir Khanal: Great. Thanks for the color.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Brian Hawthorne with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Hawthorne: Hi. I equity wanted to mention the big uplift from anchor expirations. How much of that is left to go?
Hap Stein: We appreciate the question, Brian, and if you recall from our last Investor Day, we started what we call the legacy leases, and those are a combination of both legacy portfolios of anchor leases that are coming due. A lot of that remains and that all will be supported by this five-year plan that we feel good about and our ability to generate organic NOI growth in that 2.25% and 2.5% range and we're supplementing that with redevelopment opportunities. Some of those legacy leases are what triggered these redevelopment opportunities.
Brian Hawthorne: Okay. And then on -- it seems like 90% leased. When do those tenants start paying the rent? And I guess when do you get to that kind of stabilized yield? Or when do you expect to get there?
Mac Chandler: Sure, Brian. This is Mac. Roughly 93% lease was committed and with last quarter, we leased more than 35,000 square feet including the -- was really one of our last sort of pivotal stations. Most of the tenants are open, operating, doing well, reporting sales in excess of the projections. So, I think by year-end, we should be stabilized lease spaces. If you get a chance, we encourage you to get out there and take a look at it. It's doing well and we're very pleased with that.
Hap Stein: The center looks fabulous. And not only the place you mentioned there, but also the merchandising is exceptional.
Brian Hawthorne: When you say by year-end reached a stabilized yield, that means like by December? Or do you mean by fourth quarter, you'll be at the 6.8 yield? I think that's what it was.
Mac Chandler: Well, difference between December and the fourth quarter is pretty finite. I would just assume by year end at this point.
Brian Hawthorne: Okay. All right. Thanks.
Operator: The next questions from the line of Vince Tibone with Greenstreet. Please proceed with your question.
Vince Tibone: First off, congratulations from me as well. My first question is how do you think about your cost of capital today? Based on guidance changes, it appears you prefer dispositions over assumed equity to fund acquisitions. I'm curious is there like a certain stock price for you to assume equity to fund external growth?
Hap Stein: Well, number one, as we've said before, we start with $170 million of free cash flow after dividends, after CapEx and the number one priority of that is to fund developments and redevelopments. And then beyond that, you look at how we can make a trade, whether it's -- we're selling property to buy back stock that we've done in the past or selling property to fund acquisitions as we are doing with The Pruneyard, sometimes using debt. And at times in the past when we thought when the trade made sense, we issued equity.
Vince Tibone: Got it. That makes sense. My next is kind of your acquisition strategy going forward. Do you think Regency could buy more large ticket items? There seemed to be significantly fewer potential buyers, let's say $100-plus million centers versus small dollar centers? And then I was just curious, are there any markets or regions that you think are particularly attractive today and you're actively looking to increase our exposure?
Lisa Palmer: I'll -- color on the markets. But I'll just reiterate what Hap said in terms of the use of our capital and the fact that we are -- we're opportunistic. And then to the extent that we're able to identify and have the ability to acquire shopping centers with a value-add component or with above-average growth and we're able to fund it on an essentially leverage-neutral basis and then earnings-efficient basis, we'll continue to do that. We think it's an important part of our strategy. But I'd also reiterate we don't need to. When we talk about our organic business model, it's same-property NOI growth, it's our development and redevelopment that are funded by the $170 million of free cash flow and it's the strength of our balance sheet and our talented team. Acquisitions are generally additive to that.
Hap Stein: Yes, I don't -- we are always in the market looking for the most compelling opportunities. You can see what we bought in the past and we've been buying in the coast. We bought a great center in Florida a number of years ago. We bought a great center in Raleigh. So, it's dependent on also the dynamics of the market, the intersection, the demographics and the health of the tenants. We look at carefully the rent load as compared to centers. So, could we buy another large acquisition again? I would say it just depends, but it would have to be compelling. We look for those factors that we discussed.
Vince Tibone: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question's from the line of Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Mueller: Thanks. And obviously congratulations from our whole team here as well. So I guess first for The Pruneyard higher same-store NOI growth CAGR. Can you tell a little bit about what the mark to market is? Or is it coming from outsized comps, the combination of it? And are the bumps comparable to your portfolio or even above those levels?
Hap Stein: Sure Michael. Much of the growth in there is due to embedded rent steps, and the tenants -- at least that we're inheriting the strong bumps have been better than what we have been able to get typical of our overall portfolio. But it's not surprising given the strength of the center of the strength of the market and the demographics. So tenants signed up for higher bumps because they expect to fully realize higher profits over time given tremendous trade areas. So, there's a little bit of -- a little bit of mark to market there is in every center. But there isn't, for example, one big box that's coming back in year six that's driving the model. It's not one of those situations, it's very much lease-to-lease.
Michael Mueller: Got it, okay. And I know the watch list was brought up earlier. What portion of your ABR does the current watch list make up in aggregate?
Hap Stein: It's a good question. I'll give you a longish answer. We use a pretty extensive watch list internally and we like to beef it up. We like the teams to be aware of where we see issues, which can be financial. So that's more than the traditional bankruptcy risk that you see. That list frankly, has absent Barney's, we've put them aside, has actually shrunk over time really from Sears and actual real-life bankruptcies occurring. The second part of it was we use just store closures, store rationalization list, and this is where we'll include concepts that we feel may be oversaturated. Importantly, in that environment, Regency historically performs better. We find when fleets are rationalized, it is very often that their locations within our centers are higher performers, upper tier, upper half of their portfolios, and we just do better in that regard. And then lastly, we'd like to include -- otherwise healthy financial risk -- financial tenants that for whatever reason are maybe stub their toe and a good example of that will be Chipotle in the past with the food quality issue that they came across. So, we do include them on our internal list. The percent of our overall rent has been -- it's well under 2%. We're probably in that 1.5% range, and that's really across those three categories, Mike. So, it's pretty broad.
Michael Mueller: Okay, that was it. Thank you.
Michael Mueller: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Linda Tsai with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Linda Tsai: Hi, let me add my congratulations to everyone. Lisa and Mike, you guys make a great team. I know Sears had a 40 basis point impact on the same-property in the quarter. What kind of impact do you expect on 3Q and 4Q and maybe just shed some update on the re-leasing of those boxes?
Hap Stein: Sure. Let me take the impact question and Jim will handle the re-leasing. We're expecting all bankruptcies included in the second half of the year, it's in that 30 basis point range as an impact on the same-property NOI growth primarily to base rent.
Jim Thompson: I'm going to start our [Indiscernible] center which are our largest use is. That's a very good center that we own there. And it's in part -- it's in Austin, terrific market, just north of the city. It's also anchored by H-E-B that's over $100 million in sales. So, it's got great tenant performance and great foot traffic. The existing box has great bones, great structural integrity, great ceiling heights, great column layouts, and it really sets it up well for an adaptive reuse. So, we've been studying these plans. We haven't picked a definitive angle that we're doing. But obviously, the likely approach is we're going to convert into accretive offers, a strong demand for tenants looking for space just like that. It can take a little bit of time, but because we've been using the existing box, it doesn’t take discretionary entitlements. So, more to come on that one. But I would say we'll be able to start that construction next year and deliver to tenants about 12 months following the commencement of construction.
Hap Stein: The last Kmart we have is in Gainesville, Florida and we are at LRI, with the market-leading grocer for that particular box, and I would suspect that we will have a little more clarity in the next six months on the direction of that and probably an 18 to 24 months of deliverable.
Linda Tsai: Thanks. And then maybe just addressing the comment that retailers that are closing stores, but it tends to happens less at Regency given your higher quality centers. In terms of Dress Barn and GNC, how much exposure do you have there? And how do you feel about those rent versus market?
Hap Stein: Our exposure for Dress Barn, we only have eight locations and it's about 10 basis points, Linda. And then GNC it was in the 20 basis point range. Jim can comment further. This is kind of regular way business for us, but we feel really good about the retaining opportunities.
Jim Thompson: Yes, there's nothing new there. We're happy to have spreads back. We've been watching obviously both of them for a while. And we really -- like I said, we think we've got an opportunity to upgrade our merchandising at the end of the day.
Linda Tsai: Thanks.
Hap Stein: Thank you, Linda.
Operator: Thank you. At this time I will turn the floor back to Hap Stein for closing remarks.
Hap Stein: Once again, we thank every one of you for your interest in Regency and give me one more call and I look forward to that, and we really enjoyed the relationships with our investment communities. It's been special. We've had -- feel good work with a good team. It's been extremely successful. More often than not, the story is easy to tell. So, I thank you all very much, and everybody have a great weekend. Bye, bye.
Operator: Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-05-03 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Regency Centers' First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Laura Clark, Senior Vice President, Capital Markets. Thank you. You may begin.
Laura Clark: Good morning, and welcome to Regency's first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Hap Stein, our Chairman and CEO; Lisa Palmer, our President and CFO; Mac Chandler, EVP of Investments; Jim Thompson, EVP of Operations; Mike Mas, Managing Director of Finance and Chris Leavitt, SVP and Treasurer. On today's call, we may discuss forward-looking statements. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to our filings with the SEC, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. We will also reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. We provided a reconciliation of these measures to their comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release and financial supplements, which can be found on our Investor Relations website. Before turning the call over to Hap, I want to touch on the earnings and accounting disclosure changes effective this quarter. These include updates to NAREIT FFO and the treatment of gains on sale and impairments of land, as well as accounting changes from the adoption of the new leasing standard, and are summarized in our earnings release and quarterly supplemental. We hope that these details will facilitate this accounting and reporting transition. Hap?
Hap Stein: Thanks, Laura. Good morning, everyone. As you'll hear from Jim, Mac and Lisa, we feel good about this quarter's performance, operating fundamentals and the outlook for the business. We remain confident that Regency is extremely well positioned to successfully navigate threats and prosper from opportunities, by intentionally managing and leasing our high-quality portfolio and executing on our value-add development and redevelopment program, and self-funding capital allocation strategy, all while maintaining our strong and conservative balance sheet. Before turning it over to Jim, I'd like to touch on why we really like having grocers at 80% of our centers. This begins with the fact that the grocers in our portfolio include the top operators in the country and are producing sales that average $650 per square foot and benefit from low occupancy cost. At the same time, the grocery business has always been highly competitive and is evolving at an even more accelerated pace. Still having a physical store located close to the customer in the best centers, has and remains the centerpiece of their business model. Importantly, it is the store that provides the best opportunity for the grocer to win the customer through a compelling combination of service, experience and value. Several examples include Publix's impressive top and bottom line growth, results from the focus on paramount importance of their employees who are critical to creating a pleasant shopping experience. Opening new stores and renovating existing ones remains a critical component of this strategy. It is also worth noting that Publix continues to be one of the top buyers of shopping centers. Kroger has a heightened focus on integrating technology and strategic partnerships to better service their existing customers and create new ones. Their ClickList, Restock Kroger and alliances with Ocado and Walgreens are among the more notable initiatives. Grocers like Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, Sprout's, HEB and Wegmans achieve extremely high levels of in-store sales, as a result of the compelling and often unique shopping experiences. And each is expanding their store base with no change to the size of the store footprints. Albertsons/Safeway is investing well over $1 billion annually in the core business. They're likewise focused on the customer experience, including re-merchandising with more organic and gourmet offerings, as well as using technology to support multi-channel customer satisfaction. Importantly, Albertsons again, experienced improved financial performance in 2018, with consecutive sales and EBITDA growth, better margins and a $1.5 billion reduction in debt. Furthermore, Regency's Albertsons locations are in highly desirable trade areas, where the center benefits from its competitive position. The majority are in West Coast markets where the Albertsons/Safeway banner is the market leader. The bottom line is that our grocery anchors are proven operators that are evolving for their customers and generating significant daily traffic to our centers, including the added convenience of buy online, pickup in store. Jim?
Jim Thompson: Thanks Hap. Performance in operating fundamentals were solid in the first quarter with nearly 3% NOI growth in the same property portfolio, driven entirely by base rent. Our tenants are healthy, demonstrated by historically high collection rates, which translates into very low bad debt. Rent growth is stabilized in the high single-digits, and we continue to have a lot of success incorporating mid-term rent steps into our leases, which is a key component of our strategic objective to average 3% same property NOI growth. Our same property portfolio still sits at a strong 95% leased. The sequential decline this quarter was primarily due by the closure of two Sears locations, but we are very excited about the redevelopment opportunities to upgrade the merchandising mix and overall appeal of the centers. Our shop space is 91.5% leased, which I want to note is among the highest in the sector. This quarter, shop occupancy was impacted by a couple of things. First, an expected seasonal trend of slightly higher move-outs as is typical in the first quarter. Second, lease execution timing is taking longer as tenants remain discerning and deliberate in their leasing decisions. And lastly, we continue to execute on our proactive asset management and center repositioning, which includes recapture shop space in conjunction with our redevelopment assets, which is causing a negative impact of 50 basis points to our shop space percent leased this quarter. And we continue to take an aggressive approach to upgrade the quality of the merchandising, especially at those properties acquired in the merger. All that said, many successful local, regional and national retailers continue to look for new locations in high-quality centers and the depth and velocity of our leasing pipeline remains healthy. We feel good about the level of tenant interest, where we are seeing demand across all regions within expanding REIT categories like off-price, fitness, restaurants, entertainment and grocery users for both anchor and side shop spaces. We believe tenants are making thoughtful business decisions as they commit to opening new stores. Looking forward, we believe as the year progresses, occupancy will increase as our team executes on our redevelopments and re-anchoring opportunities, supported by this robust pipeline of tenant interest. Mac?
Mac Chandler: Thanks Jim. We had another successful quarter executing on our capital allocation strategy. This starts with the $170 million of annual free cash flow after capital and dividends, enabling us to fully fund our development and redevelopments on extremely favorable cost-effective basis. This clearly differentiates Regency's business model. The inherent quality of our portfolio and the free cash flow, allows us to be selective with capital recycling as we identify compelling investment opportunities that can be executed on a basis that are tax efficient and mitigates adverse impacts to earnings. In the first quarter, we sold seven shopping centers for a total of $137 million. As we previously communicated, this sales activity funded prior-year share repurchases, as well as investments in the high-growth premier acquisitions. A prime example is Melrose Market, an exceptional center near downtown Seattle acquired in the first quarter with excellent growth prospects. Also during the quarter, we acquired an additional interest in Town and Country Los Angeles. Our total interest is now approximately 20% and we have the opportunity to increase this to 35% and possibly even more. We cannot be more excited about the value creation opportunities for this shopping center, anchored by Whole Foods and CVS, and located across from one of the top-performing malls in the country, The Grove. Redevelopment of this asset, which is expected to start in late 2020 or early '21, will include 80,000 square feet of new retail in place of the former K-Mart box, plus 325 mid-rise apartments to be developed by Holland Partners on a 99-year ground lease. The vibrancy, tenancy and density of this site is an incredibly attractive addition to our portfolio. This quarter, to provide more visibility into these types of future opportunities, we've added new supplemental disclosure regarding select operating properties with near-term redevelopment opportunities. This includes the Abbot in Cambridge, which started subsequent to quarter-end; Westwood in Bethesda; and Costa Verde in San Diego. We hope this new disclosure provides more transparency into the depth of our pipeline and the incremental value that will be generated as we execute our plan. Our developments and redevelopments are performing well at nearly 90% leased with strong leasing momentum and yielding a blended 7.5% return and margins that remain well above cap rates for comparable high-quality shopping centers. On top of our in-process projects, we have a pipeline of future development and redevelopment opportunities that should enable us to meet our objective at $1.25 billion in starts and deliveries over the next five years and create significant value. Lisa?
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Mac and good morning, everyone. 2019 is off to another good start with first quarter results in line with our expectations. I'd like to begin with additional color around our same property NOI and earnings guidance. We are maintaining same property NOI guidance in the range of 2% to 2.5%, and while we do not provide quarterly guidance, I think it's important to note that we expect next quarter to come in below 2%, primarily due to the two Sears closures and timing of reconciliations. As we have previously communicated, our 2019 same property guidance range does fall below our 3% strategic objective due to the closure of these Sears locations, as well as a muted contribution from redevelopment. However, we feel confident in our ability to achieve our 3% objective over the long term. Turning to earnings, we had two non-recurring items in the first quarter resulting in a negative $0.03 per share impact to NAREIT FFO. The first item was an early redemption charge of $0.06 per share related to the prepayment of our 2021 bonds, following a successful 30-year bond offering executed during the quarter. This offering further enhanced our financial flexibility and increased the duration of our average maturities to over 10 years, while maintaining our weighted average interest rate. In addition, we incurred a positive non-cash impact of $0.03 per share related to the recognition of below-market rent intangibles for two anchor boxes that we got back during the quarter, where we are upgrading both spaces at a much higher rate. With these two impacts, we have updated our FFO and non-cash guidance accordingly. Excluding these impacts, the midpoint of our FFO guidance is unchanged. Importantly, in the first quarter, we grew core operating earnings by 3.4%, when adjusted for the lease accounting change and we continue to expect growth for 2019 to be in the 2% to 4% range. As a reminder, core operating earnings eliminate certain non-recurring and non-cash items. We believe this is a better measure of the performance of our business as it more closely reflects cash earnings and our ability to grow the dividend. Before turning the call over for questions, I would like to reiterate the team's continued execution on our proven strategy through the combination of our strategic advantages. First, our high-quality portfolio and intense asset management combine to position Regency to average same-property NOI growth of 3% over the long term. Second, our experienced development and redevelopment capabilities will enable us to deliver over $1.25 billion in value-add developments and redevelopments over the next five years. And finally, our blue chip capital structure, which benefits from twin pillars, a conservative and strong balance sheet and the $170 million of free cash flow, supporting a self-funding model and low payout ratio. This unequal combination of strategic advantages will support our core earnings and dividend growth objectives to average 4% to 6% over the long term, generating total shareholder returns in the 8% to 10% range. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we now welcome your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Christy McElroy of Citi. Please go ahead.
Christy McElroy: Just with regard to same store NOI, so - it seemed like base rent growth was driving much of that overall same store growth in Q1. Just with occupancy down year-over-year outside of the usual contractual rent growth, could you maybe just sort of walk us through the main drivers of that base rent growth and how you see that trending through the balance of the year?
Lisa Palmer: This is Lisa. We still - the model that we always share really, and - that was also as part of our initial earnings guidance maybe during the year, is still an accurate reflection of that. So 1.3% growth will come from contractual rent steps. And that is obviously in that base rent line item. Then you have another piece of that coming from rent spreads. And so that's been in the high single-digits. So that will add another, call it, 100 basis points. So that gets you to the 2.3%. And then the Sears impact, we did get two months of Sears income in the first quarter, so that's actually also in that line item. And then going through the rest of the year, that's going to become more of a drag.
Christy McElroy: Right, okay.
Lisa Palmer: So while we had 2.8% for quarter one, that is actually going to decline through the rest of the year.
Christy McElroy: And then, Jim, I just wanted to follow up on your comment about lease execution timing taking longer. Is this sort of more of the theme of what we've been seeing in recent years, or is this sort of a more recent change that you've observed and if it is more recent, why do you think - what do you think is driving that?
Jim Thompson: Christy, I think it's a continuation of the theme we've talked about. I think as retailers mature, it's actually side-shop retailers, the survivors are various state business people, they're very cautious and deliberate about what they do. And as they make those kind of commitments, they're being very deliberate. So we are seeing more of that time to execution than - it's becoming more apparent I think than maybe we used to see it, but it's been out there.
Christy McElroy: Okay. Just wanted to make sure this wasn't something new. Thank you.
Jim Thompson: It's - yeah, it's not a sea change, but it's kind of - incremental.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Rich Hill of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Rich Hill: Lisa, maybe this is a follow-up question for you on modeling. It looked like two line items that we were focused on, other rental income was maybe a little bit lower than we were expecting on annualized basis and then ground rent expense was maybe a little bit higher than we were expecting. I know these things can be lumpy, but I'm curious that there is - this is just timing related, or there's anything that we should be thinking about going forward.
Lisa Palmer: No, when you - if we think about the full year - for the remainder of - the projections for the remainder of the year, the primary line item that's going to drive same property NOI growth is base rent. And there is going to be timing impacts and reconciliations from other income from all of those other line items. But at the end of the year, when you look at the individual line items, the driver will be base rent. And as I said to Christy, while its 2.9% on my number, so yes 2.8%. While it's 2.9% growth in the first quarter, we're going to see Sears continue to drag. So Sears was only a 10 basis point impact in the first quarter. That's going to be growing to 40 bips for the full year. And then just as we talked about in the beginning of the year, as we talk about in the beginning of every year, the most uncertain part of our business are unplanned move-outs and they are also immediately impactful. And you saw from our numbers that we had move-outs in the first quarter, which is very typical, as Jim mentioned from a seasonal perspective. We did not have those burn-ups in the past two years, and so we were able to raise that kind of a low rent after the first quarter, which we're not able to do this year, because we did actually experience those move-outs.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Craig Schmidt of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Craig Schmidt: Just given the higher and earlier pace of dispositions, I'm wondering if the intention is to slow the disposition process for the rest of the year or may you raise the target going forward?
Lisa Palmer: Mac and I are looking at each other. So our argument is who's going to answer it. So I'll take it from a guidance perspective and Mac can add color in terms of the market in general. So just a reminder that the dispositions - these early dispositions are really funding last year's share buyback. So with regards to - I'll let Mac take it from there. But again, just a reminder that the early dispositions are funding the share buyback and when you look at our guidance, you can see what we're expecting for the remainder of the year. However, we're always potentially going to be opportunistic. And with that, I'll hand it over to Mac.
Mac Chandler: Yes, I don't have a whole lot to add at that point, but I would say that we have executed in accordance with our expectations. We are meeting our prices, cap rates are stable for these assets and I'd say that the buyer pool is a little bit deeper than maybe we've seen in the last quarter or two. So we feel confident about our ability to meet our plan for the rest of the year.
Craig Schmidt: And then just a follow-up on - I wondered how, the push on contractual rents. I know your rent was around 1.3% and you're targeting 1.5%, but how are the retailers reacting to slightly higher contractual bumps?
Hap Stein: We continue, Craig, to have really, really good success in implementing those embedded steps. I think 90% of our shop space around about 2.5% average. Annual rent step and it's - you combine that with our rent growth of 8.8% and that's kind of - as lease outline, that's kind of key to the bedrock of our sustainable NOI growth.
Craig Schmidt: And I mean, is it the quality of the portfolio that's allowing you to push this or it's just something else?
Hap Stein: I think certainly the quality. And it's just a - I mentioned we fight, we fight hard for in the field and we have continued to have good success in doing that.
Craig Schmidt: Okay.
Jim Thompson: And a big part of the time, issue is that we are selective in leasing to and even though you may be getting pushback from the tenants, we're negotiating hard to achieve the kind of the tenants that we want and the terms that we want.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Samir Khanal of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question.
Samir Khanal: So I guess, Lisa, can you remind us how much cushion you have left to account for unexpected vacancies at this time as part of guidance? I think - correct me if I'm wrong, please, but I think initially it was about 100 basis points of credit loss reserve?
Lisa Palmer: So, fact - I'll give you some of the facts first.
Samir Khanal: Yes.
Lisa Palmer: We have known - the significant known bankruptcies impacting 2019 are Sears and Toys "R" Us. And the impact in the first quarter was 30 basis points and the full-year impact is going to be 60 basis points. I don't like to think of cushion, if you will, with regards to bankruptcies. And again, I'll just bring it back to the most uncertain part of the business going forward or the move-outs. We have a great leasing pipeline that we have a lot of visibility to. We certainly have full visibility to all of the redevelopments that are in process and in managing that really well. What we don't know are the unplanned move-outs. So with that, our guidance of 2% to 2.5% is incorporating, what we believe to be a prudent level of move-outs that's really consistent with prior years.
Samir Khanal: And I guess one for Hap. You've done a great job on the leasing front on the shop space over the last few years, but that's a segment that did have an impact for you and your peers as well, sort of in the last downturn. I guess, how do we think about that segment? If we do go into slow down, let's say in the future, whether it's 24 months or 18 months that sort of time frame, what steps are you taking to minimize the impact as you continue to lease space in that segment?
Hap Stein: Well, I would say a couple of things. Number one, and this has continued to happen, as there's been kind of a self-policing or self rationalization in that. The tenants today that survive the downturn in '08 and '09 are better operators and that's been the continued - continued to be the step of this - the case. In addition to that, we are much more selective through a fresh-look initiative, through credit analysis and who --trying to get the best local, regional and national operators in there. And we feel very good about our lineup of side shop retailers. So does that mean we're going to be totally immune to the next downturn when it occurs? No, but I think we're much better positioned going into whatever the economic conditions may - that we may face in the future.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Derek Johnston of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.
Derek Johnston: Given your free cash flow, it does enable a healthy pipeline of redevelopment opportunities. And I believe around $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion has been discussed over the next five years. So the question is, how do you think about your development pipeline versus your redevelopment pipeline in terms of priority with capital spend? And is it more of a win where the municipal entitlement shake out or something else?
Mac Chandler: Derek, this is Mac. We look at both opportunities really equally in many ways. They're different in the sense that a development is a ground-up - a development opportunity comes out of the ground, and it's new income for the very first time. We continue to look for those and with our unique platform, we've been successful at finding these opportunities. For redevelopment, what we like about them is, they're in locations where we already know the trade area, we know it extremely well and we can time those redevelopments to start when market conditions give us the green light. So, the returns are pretty similar, these days, but we like both sets of opportunities. I would say one is a priority over the other or agnostic. And our teams are very much engaged to find both types of opportunities, but to us they are investments and they have strong returns whether they're incremental returns in a redevelopment or just straight up returns from the ground-up.
Hap Stein: And like as you mentioned, I think the key thing is as you go through the math, $170 million of free cash flow on a - essentially leverage neutral basis is going to fund $250 million, $300 million of annual development starts and deliveries. And so we're very well positioned to fund those developments and redevelopments, which are very compelling on an extremely favorable basis.
Derek Johnston: Just secondly, are you seeing increased traction and true proof-of-concept at this point from digitally native and multi-channel focused retailers? I mean, are we at the point where we can firmly say this isn't a fad or a beta test and the demand uptake should ramp over the next several years?
Jim Thompson: I'm happy to take that one. I don't think it's a fad. I think you're clearly seeing those tenants who have begun to engage more bricks-and-mortar, who came out of the digital native background and you're seeing it more and more. I guess, the question would be, over time is, what's the depth of their store count, how broad, will they go nationally and how many stores will they do per market. So that strategy is playing itself out and we'll continue to monitor that. But one advantage of these digital native platforms is, they really know their trade areas well through their data and through their - through their research. And so they actually have told us in many ways, they have greater reliability on a new store than a traditional bricks-and-mortar store and as a result, often they can pay more rent because of the probability of success. So anyway, we see that happening and the depth of that is, is what's to be determined.
Hap Stein: And I have something else to - just to remind ourselves, everybody on the call, if Amazon paid $40 million plus a door for Whole Foods, we will be part of very successful native digital retailer who is expanding very aggressively from a bricks-and-mortar standpoint. So I think that is happening. And I think that these native digital retailers are finding the importance of physical locations.
Lisa Palmer: And because this is something we talk about so often, I just - I think it's important to remember and note that, one, there is no debate among any of the retailers whether they're digitally native or whether they're bricks-and-mortar native. That'd be - the most profitable way to get their goods to their customers, is to have the customers walk in the store; and two, the new customer acquisition costs are much lower also with bricks-and-mortar than they are just digitally. And they've all acknowledged that and recognized that. And I think their strategies are reflecting that as well.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Jeff Donnelly: Maybe this branches up an earlier question, but concerning grocery and your underwriting process there, I'm just curious how you guys are informing yourself on how that landscape is going to evolve in the coming years and what do you feel are going to be the key points of differentiation? I mean, is it a decision that runs more to the site, is it like real estate than the retailer or is a little more nuance than that?
Hap Stein: The answer to you is, the retailer - the answer is yes. The retailer matters and the site matters. And going back to the site is what you want to have is a location where - if bad news happens and we hope it doesn't, it becomes good news from a merchandising and from replacement standpoint and from a rent standpoint. Like today, I think the good retailers want to be in the better sites and good retailers, including the better grocers, want to be in the better sites where they're going to generate significant traffic. And I think it's kind of a self-rationalization process. But I think that we want to do - as I indicated, we have and been part of our history and our track record of working and partnering with the best-in-class operators that get, that have strong balance sheets and ability to invest in the business, and in effect, pay the rent that we'd like to get in the better locations. And you look at, whether it's Whole Foods or Publix or HEB or Kroger, Sprout's, these are all strong retailers that are continuing to evolve. They know how to provide customer experience, they know how to differentiate themselves. And I - all those factors are critically important to us because what we want to do is, if they do it, we got the right - if we have the right retailer and you have the right grocery anchor, then we're going to be able to track the better side shop retailers, which is also critical to our business model.
Jeff Donnelly: And maybe just as a follow-up on that, I mean, do you think it's become clear that a lot of the changes or a lot of the concepts that people are exploring, like bigger format, smaller formats, online order and pickup in store, is that you've seen a better model emerge or is that sort of yet to be determined, do you think?
Hap Stein: So here is what's so interesting, is that Kroger's ideal format is 100,000 square feet, HEB is 110,000 square feet to 120,000 square feet, Publix is in the 50,000 square foot range, Whole Foods range is from 40,000 square feet to 60,000 square feet, Trader Joe's is in the 15,000 foot range. So it varies and I think they've all been able to, in effect, continue to perfect their model. I think it's an evolutionary process, but what's - one of the more interesting things that we've noted is, their formats have not really shrunk, I mean other than to fit into infill locations. So, I think they've all adopted, they've all got strategies from the formatting standpoint Jeff, that they think makes sense and the proof has been in the pudding with their performance.
Jeff Donnelly: If I could, maybe just a question for you, Lisa. It may be a more conceptual question, I guess on leverage. There's some property sectors out there, not retail, but - that have seen their acceptable levels of leverage shift lower in the last 10 years to 20 years as these companies who are public, the fixed income and equity investors become less tolerant to volatility or severity. Regency clearly has a great balance sheet, but retail has had its challenges and we've seen leverage shift lower. But it's also happened during a time when the economy has been relatively resilient, we haven't really faced recession. Do you - I guess, how do you think about where leverage could go in the future to the extent we have a recession that adds more pressure. Do you foresee a time where the leverage in retail could actually continue to shift lower than it is today?
Lisa Palmer: First off, we're really comfortable with our balance sheet today. We're not just comfortable, we're really proud of it. We've made significant progress on improving and strengthening the balance sheet, whether it be just with the level of debt that we have and also with the tenure of the debt that we have. With that said, we've been pretty transparent that our target level of net debt to EBITDA today is 5 times, then we're slightly above that. So we're going to continue to try to drive that down through organic growth and opportunistic actions when they're available to us. We are always monitoring our capacity levels, our commitments to developments, to acquisitions and we ensure that if we ever were to go into the crisis that we had in 2009 when there was zero access to the capital markets for a period of time, that we can actually survive not just - that was for about four months, we could actually for an excess of a year. So we're going to continue to maintain that and really focus on that. At the same time, I don't like to think of it as pressure in a recession, I'd like to think that we've positioned ourselves to take advantage of opportunities, because that is the one thing that in hindsight, right hindsight is 2020, had we been in a position then that we are today, there are opportunities that were presented to us that we were not able to capitalize on. And today, we will be able to capitalize on those. And oftentimes, and I've heard Hap say this right, it's - when the blood is in the water is when we won't be able to count.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.
Wes Golladay: Can you just comment on the tenant interest from the retail side to be part of these mixed-use projects, the live, work, play. Is it growing, any particular category stand out, and do they have a preference for being extra residential or office?
Mac Chandler: I'm happy to answer that - that one. This is Mac here. We are definitely seeing tenants who are interested in these mixed-use locations and in part because of the quality of the locations. These tend to be of higher densities, better incomes, better access to transit. The office component is a very powerful one and our restaurant tenants really react positively to office. Because I understand they have to be in our project, but if it's across the street or within a quarter of a mile where people can walk, that really is a big boost to restaurant lunch traffic and also evening traffic, and just having people on site apartments help too as well. It certainly helps with just active food court in the evenings. But one apartment is not enough to make a big difference. You need a sizable amount of density within a walking distance. But it's also the place making that you often find more in a mixed-use environment than you do in a very traditional environment. And that is something else that the retailers would resonate to. They want environment where the customers choose this location over other ones, because it's a opportunity to shop, and to dine, to linger, to patronize, and we all know that the longer a customer spends on site, the more they are likely to spend. So there's definitely interest there. We are seeing that more and more.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Mike Mueller of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Mike Mueller: Looking at the past four quarters, it looks like your renewal spreads have increased each quarter. At the same time, the new leasing spreads have gone down each quarter. And I know the new spreads will bounce around more, but is there anything we should be looking into as a trend as it relates to the renewal spreads increasing?
Lisa Palmer: It's - like it's primarily just related to mix. We feel that we've really settled in actually with - in terms of a stabilized level of rent spreads on both renewals and you're absolutely right on new. We could have one transaction that can really drive that. And if you have a 40-year lease essentially that rolls and expires, that can have a significant impact on the percentage.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Ki Bin Kim of Suntrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.
Ki Bin Kim: So I wanted to ask you about how you guys balance and how you think about merchandising mix versus rent. And obviously, you are underwriting businesses all the time, but are you - is there a change in that where it's not just underwriting the business to see if it's a good business and it was Internet-resistant, but trying to even gauge just the management teams at those retailers are forward-thinking enough, dynamic and they're thinking enough where they can be relevant and viable for 10 years down the road. So how do you think about all those things?
Hap Stein: Ki Bin, that kind of goes to the core of our fresh-look philosophy. We are really looking for retailers who get it, who do make a difference, do create that special vibe that can drive traffic and help their neighbor tenants. It's a key ingredient to the way we look at our business and the future of the leasing. We think we do a pretty good job of that and it is kind of an interesting struggle that you always have on rent versus SKUs versus credit and that whole mix has to come together, and you make a decision on who you think is going to add the most value to your shopping center and that's kind of how we go about it.
Ki Bin Kim: So you made a comment earlier that retailers are maybe taking a little bit longer to decide where to go. Do you - on the flip side, do you think landlords like yourselves are also thinking about - a little bit more about who you bring into your centers and is that a bigger consideration?
Hap Stein: I'm not sure I understood that.
Lisa Palmer: I mean, in terms of the - us being more selective, is that really the question?
Ki Bin Kim: Basically.
Lisa Palmer: Jim mentioned it when he first opened the last answer with fresh-look. It's actually nothing new for us. I mean, we've been really focused on it for several - more than several years now, because the - as the retail environment has been changing and with that pace of change really accelerating, we are really - we try to get in front of it and we understand that people have so many choices today and they can - they don't have to come to our shopping centers. So we need to ensure that we're making our shopping centers a place where they want to come and want to shop, it's convenient and not only is it convenient, but Jim used the word vibe, it's place making. It has to be a good experience. Our retailers mentioned that our grocers are focusing on the same thing. Once they are inside of the four walls, it has to be a good experience. Because if it's not, they're not going to come. And we really have begun - I mean, we began focusing on that several years ago and being much more selective with the merchandising mix and the retailers and tenants that we're leasing to.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Chris Lucas of CapitalOne Securities. Please go ahead.
Chris Lucas: Just a quick one. On tenant follow-up for the quarter, was that in line with expectations better or worse?
Lisa Palmer: I'll repeat the earlier answer. Every year we come into the year and we do expect to have a seasonal decline in occupancy for - I've been in the business for 23 years. And I think for maybe three of those, we haven't had it. So it was in line with our assumptions. We were kind of hoping that maybe we'd outperform that and we did. So we're still really comfortable with our guidance of 2% to 2.5%. And we have - we essentially still have the same assumptions moving forward for the rest of the year in terms of having a consistent level of move-outs that we - similar to what we've experienced in the past two years to three years.
Chris Lucas: And Lisa, on that move-out rate, any themes this year versus prior year's that maybe differentiated this year's outcome?
Lisa Palmer: I'm sorry, Chris, you're a little muffled.
Hap Stein: Themes on move-outs.
Chris Lucas: I'm sorry.
Lisa Palmer: Yes. No, it is obviously something that we looked at really closely and not only just this year, but we also even - we looked at kind of what's the mix of our tenants that are in our centers and also that are moving out of our centers and what we are leasing to. And amazingly, it is consistent. We still have the same percentage of restaurants, soft goods, service and certainly it is actually a little bit surprising to me when we looked at it.
Operator: At this time, I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Stein for closing comments.
Hap Stein: We appreciate your time and interest in Regency, and hope that you guys have a wonderful weekend. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation, this concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-02-14 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Regency Centers Corporation Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Laura Clark, Vice President, Capital Markets. Thank you. You may begin.
Laura Clark: Good morning. And welcome to Regency's fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call.  Joining me today are Hap Stein, our Chairman and CEO; Lisa Palmer, our President and CFO; Mac Chandler, EVP of Investments; Jim Thompson, EVP of Operations; Mike Mas, Managing Director of Finance; and Chris Leavitt, SVP and Treasurer. On today's call, we may discuss forward-looking statements. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to our filings with the SEC, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. We will also reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. We've provided a reconciliation of these measures to their comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release and financial supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website.  Now, before turning the call over to Hap, I would like to give you a quick overview of today's call as it will be a little different. First, Hap will take you through our 2018 highlights and strategic objectives. Jim will then discuss portfolio fundamentals, followed by a walkthrough of the components of same-property NOI growth and 2019 same-property NOI guidance. Finally, Lisa will present our 2019 earnings guidance and go forward. We'll be utilizing a slide presentation for a portion of today's call. You can view the presentation through the webcast link or in the Presentations section of our Investor Relations website at regencycenters.com. Hap?
Hap Stein: Thanks, Laura. Good morning, everyone. Regency's exceptional team produced another year of sector-leading performance. Through the team's talent and efforts, we executed our proven strategy by proactively and creatively managing our portfolio, building value through development and redevelopment, fortifying our balance sheet, and cost effectively funding new investments. Highlights from a successful 2018 include – same-property portfolio was at 96% leased and NOI growth at or above 3.4% for the seventh consecutive year; we expertly executed on our capital allocation strategy that starts with reinvesting our $170 million of free cash flow and modest level of sales of lower-growth assets and nearly $200 million of developments and redevelopments; acquisitions with superior growth prospects; and nearly $250 million of share repurchases at an average price of less than $58 per share, all supported by Regency's blue chip balance sheet. This year also marked an important milestone with the release of our inaugural corporate responsibility report, which showcases our environmental, social and governance initiatives. And notably, growth in core operating earnings, which eliminates certain one-time and non-cash impacts have compounded by 7% over the last three years. This translated into roughly comparable growth in cash available for distribution and, in turn, increases to the dividend by over 5%, both in 2018 and for 2018 at a low payout ratio. Retailers continue to clearly demonstrate that physical stores located in top trade areas and thriving centers remain a critical component of a multi-channel strategy. Even though retailers are being deliberate and cautious with expansion, there's really good demand for the limited amount of vacant space in our centers and renewal is robust.  We are committed to ensuring that our shopping centers remain relevant and convenient distribution channels for successful retailers that will prosper in the evolving marketplace. Our ongoing accomplishments demonstrate the effectiveness of Regency's time-proven strategy to distinguish the company by effectively employing our combination of unequaled strategic advantages to successfully achieve our objectives. Our high quality portfolio, intense asset management and fresh-look philosophy will position Regency to average same-property NOI growth of 3%. Our experienced development and redevelopment capabilities will enable us to deliver over $1.25 billion in developments and redevelopments at attractive returns over the next five years. Our pristine balance sheet and growing free cash flow will cost effectively fund new investments, while providing financial flexibility and access to capital through future cycles as we target debt-to-EBITDA of 5 times. I am extremely confident that, collectively, these capabilities will be expertly employed by our amazing team to sustain earnings, cash flow and dividend growth and, in turn, total shareholder returns that are consistently at or near the top of the shopping center sector. Jim?
Jim Thompson: Thanks, Hap. I'm extremely pleased to finish another year with solid same-property NOI growth supported by our high quality portfolio and executed by our best-in-class team.  2018 same-property NOI growth of 3.4% was driven by a strong 3.7% contribution from base rent. As we discussed on previous calls, offsetting base rent growth was the anticipated one-time impact from tax reassessments that were triggered by the Equity One merger, where we're absorbing almost two years of supplemental real estate tax expense. This one-time event impacted our 2018 operating margins. Going forward, we expect to operate at more normalized margins. As Hap indicated, Regency's portfolio continues to experience healthy demand from top retailers. That said, while retailers continue to be discerning with new store openings, we feel they are making rational decisions that will contribute to healthy supply and demand.  As it relates to Regency Centers, we continue to experience positive and stable trends in move-outs, bad debt and AR that we attribute to the enhanced quality of our tenants. Rent spreads have settled in the high-single digits. At the same time, we're benefit from successfully incorporating contractual rent increases into leases. Overall, our constructive view of the retail landscape, combined with the underlying fundamentals of our portfolio and the prospects from our redevelopment pipeline, support our expectation to average 3%-plus same-property NOI growth over the long-term. With that said, I would like to turn your attention to page three in our presentation and begin with a remainder of the components to get us to our 3%-plus same-property NOI growth objective. Please follow with me on the left side of the slide. First, embedded in the portfolio is 1.3% of growth coming from contractual rent increases. Then another 1% to 1.2% come from new and renewal leasing rent spreads. Combined, these provide approximately 2.25% to 2.5% of growth. Next, given the portfolio is well leased at 96% and 94.5% rent paying, incremental gains from occupancy at these levels should not be expected. Finally, the contribution from redevelopments has typically averaged 75 bps of annual growth. This growth can be uneven due to the size and timing of redevelopment deliveries. Together, these components equate to our strategic objective of 3% plus average annual same-property NOI growth. Now, I'd like to shift your attention to the right side of the slide. As we indicated in our third-quarter call, we expect this year's same-property NOI growth to be in the range of 2% to 2.5%, resulting from a couple of short-term impacts. Looking at rent-paying occupancy, we have one Sears and two Kmart boxes. Two of these leases were on the initial closure list, have closed and are likely to be rejected. We understand the third box is included in the approved bid for 425 locations and could continue operations. Even so, we still plan to get this box back. Based on the current strong interest from much better operators, we're really looking forward to gaining control of the boxes. In addition to Sears, we've incorporated a prudent level of move-out assumptions and this combined impact is estimated to be slightly more than 50 basis points to same-property NOI growth. Additionally, as I mentioned before, the redevelopment contribution to NOI growth has been, and will continue to be, uneven at times. This could especially be the case given our larger, more transformational projects. The uneven impact from taking NOI offline as well as the timing of completions is simply a part of making the right decision to sustain NOI growth and maximize long-term value. In that vein, this year, the contribution is expected to be minimal. More importantly, we're extremely excited about the quality of our expanding pipeline and look forward to enjoying the contributions to growth that will come from these projects in 2020 and beyond. The inherent quality of the portfolio, the visibility of the pipeline and the focus of the team combined to make me feel really good about the prospects going forward to average 3% NOI growth. I'll now turn it over to Lisa to continue our 2019 guidance discussion.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Jim. And good morning, everyone. First, I'd like to echo Hap and Jim's sentiments around the successes achieved in 2018. It was another extremely gratifying year and the team should feel exceptionally proud of their achievements. We'll continue in the slide deck and I'll take you to page four where you'll find our initial 2019 guidance. For 2019, our FFO per share guidance range is $3.83 to $3.89. This includes a $0.05 per share impact related to the new lease accounting standard where certain leasing costs that were previously capitalized will now be expensed in G&A. As I've said before, while this accounting change does impact reported earnings, it does not impact AFFO or cash flow, does not have a true economic impact on the business, and will not influence our structure or compensation strategies. Beginning this year, we're only providing NAREIT FFO guidance as we believe this is the best metric available for comparability across the sector. At the same time, we will continue to measure and report the performance of our business using core operating earnings, which eliminates certain non-recurring and non-cash items. We previously referred to this metric as operating FFO, but, going forward, we'll refer to this simply as core operating earnings. Next, as Jim just said, same-property NOI growth is expected to be in the range of 2% to 2.5%, which incorporates near-term headwinds related to Sears, Kmart as well as a muted contribution from redevelopments in 2019. From an investment perspective, we expect to start $150 million to $250 million of developments and redevelopments this year. And we have good visibility into executing our plan to start $1.25 billion to $1.5 billion over the next five years. Our acquisition guidance reflects the recent closing of Melrose Market, an exceptional center in a near-urban neighborhood of Seattle. The disposition guidance of plus or minus $200 million includes $75 million of property sales that carried over year-end, all of which I'd like to note have already closed, as well as additional sales to fund our fourth-quarter share repurchases. Moving to net interest expense, 2019 is expected to be lower, primarily driven by the accretive re-financings executed last year when we proactively took advantage of low interest rates. To G&A, as I mentioned earlier, G&A for this year incorporates a $0.05 impact, or approximately $8 million, related to lease accounting. On an apples-to-apples basis, net G&A is essentially flat year-over-year. Finally, non-cash items are expected to decrease from $55 million in 2018 to a range of $41.5 million to $43.5 million in 2019. As a reminder, in 2018, we recognized a $6 million one-time non-cash item in income related to the acceleration of a below-market rent balance for the one Toys"R"Us box that we acquired at auction. Moving to page five, which is our guidance rollforward, I'll highlight a few things. First, as always, NOI will be the primary contributor to earnings growth, contributing $0.16 to $0.20 per share. This includes organic growth plus $0.07 to $0.08 per share from NOI coming from development completions. Second, we're providing you with the incremental impacts of transaction and funding activity, including our opportunistic repurchase of nearly $250 million of our stock in 2018. Lastly, I think it's important to note that, after adjusting for certain non-recurring and non-cash items, even after the impact of the Sears bankruptcy and the muted contribution from redevelopments, core operating earnings per share are expected to grow by 2% to 4% in 2019. Turning to page six, I'd like to quickly review our funding model. Today, we are generating approximately $170 million of free cash flow after capitals and after dividends. Also, our strategy of selling a modest amount of lower growth assets has, and will continue, to fortify NOI and NAV growth. Together, free cash flow and dispositions fund our developments and redevelopments, acquisitions with superior growth prospects and – at times – repurchases of our own stock, again, when the pricing and the trade are compelling, as they were in 2018. It's worth emphasizing that the amount of free cash flow that we generate enables us to finance our development and redevelopment spend on essentially a leverage-neutral basis. We've also summarized our two-year capital allocation on the right side of this page. Over the long-term, we expect net investment activity to contribute 100 basis points to 200 basis points to our earnings growth. This, along with growing same-property NOI by 3-plus-percent, will translate into core operating earnings growth of 5-plus-percent. As we look forward to 2019 and beyond, we remain confident in our ability to continue to deliver earnings and dividend growth and total shareholder return at or near the top of the sector. That concludes our prepared remarks and we now welcome your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.
Nick Yulico: Thanks. Based on your free cash flow, expected dispositions and limited acquisitions, it seems like you have plenty of funding for redevelopment and development. So, I guess, can you just tell us what's the expected spend there and how you're thinking about it as well? If you have leftover cash, what you'd be using it for?
Hap Stein: So, as you indicated, $170 million of free cash flow funds our development spend, which – $200 million plus and, hopefully, it's closer to $300 million. And that will contribute 200 basis points to our earnings growth, as Lisa indicated. And then, in addition to that, we can decide, does it make sense to recycle and affect sale dispositions, sell lower growth assets? And to the extent that we sell lower growth assets, we make the decisions, does it make sense to invest in covered land plays, acquisitions with meaningful redevelopment opportunities, or acquisitions just with superior growth prospects, and/or buying back our stock if the trade, we think, is favorable as it was – when, in fact, our implied cap rate was north of 6%. Obviously, the tax impact of selling assets is going to play something in that. I think it's also important to note that we front-end loaded $125 million of stock buyback when we bought the stock back in December. So, in effect, we've got dispositions planned that are in – remainder of the year that are going to basically fund the stock buyback. And then, once that's completed, we'll make a decision, does it make sense to selling additional properties or does it make sense just to stay intact because one other interesting thing for our – I think it's important to note is, from a Regency standpoint, even though we'd like to recycle properties and like to enhance the growth rate and sell lower growth assets, that's something that's nice to have. It's not a must from that standpoint.
Nick Yulico: Okay, that's helpful. And then, just looking at the TIs, they were up meaningfully last year, over 30%. What drove that increase? And how should we think about the level of spend in 2019? I guess, specifically related to like a recurring CapEx expectation for this year.
Lisa Palmer: I'll let Jim answer the opening question with regards to what happened in 2018 and then I'll take the latter part.
Jim Thompson: Yeah. On 2018, Nick, really, we performed about as we expected. I think the only thing I'd note would be a little bit of tick up in Q4, which was driven by a couple of anchor deals that were really relocations, which is a little unusual, but relocations within the existing centers, which were a little expensive. But when you look at the full 12 months of 2018, we were actually, I think, 15%, 16% lower than 2017. So, our spend, we feel real good about the spend and I think we are prudent with our dollars from the capital side on leasing.
Lisa Palmer: And so, going forward, so 2018 had some unusual activity, which pushed our percent – our total capital spend as a percent of NOI above kind of normal run rates. So, we've been in the 10% to 11% of NOI range but, going forward, that will drop to 9% to 10% as a result of the lease accounting standard change. So, those leasing commissions that were previously capitalized are now expensed. It will be in G&A. And that has the result of reducing that down by 5%.
Nick Yulico: Okay, thanks. And just wanted a clarification on guidance. At least you went through some of the non-cash items. You had the benefit last year from Toys"R"Us. And even if you remove that, you have your non-cash revenue going down $5 million to $7 million. Is that just all related to burn off of leases as a – as you get through them from the Equity One merger, how should we think about that kind of ongoing impact to your reported NAREIT FFO this year and in future years?
Lisa Palmer: So, to be clear, the decline, about half of it, was related to the one-time, $6 million charge that you mentioned. So, after that, the remaining 50% – of that remaining 50%, half of that, so a quarter in total, is a reduction in the benefit from debt mark-to-market amortization. So, then, the remainder is a reduction in straight-line rent income, primarily with a little bit of the below-market rent. So, going forward, we would expect – and we did mention this to you all when we did complete our merger with Equity One and we booked the large below-market rent balance, if you will, that it would create headwinds for a period of time. And so, going forward, and for a significant period of time because of the remaining lease term on some of these is actually 20 years, we expect that the decline will be closer to $1 million to $2 million annually for the foreseeable future.
Nick Yulico: Appreciate it. Thank you.
Hap Stein: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Jeremy Metz: Hey, good morning. In terms of the same-store guide, you're not looking for much redevelopment contribution. You mentioned the offset being NOI coming offline from some of the larger redevelopments. Jim, you had mentioned this can be lumpy. So, thinking this through, how much of this have you already pulled offline versus what's still to come? And maybe some color around what that means for your same-store NOI cadence here as we go through 2019.
Lisa Palmer: Just reiterating again – and thank you, Jeremy. You sort of put it out there for me in terms of how uneven it is. And when you do look at it, we've been proactively managing our properties and redeveloping them through active asset management to increase the NOI for a really long time. And if you look at the annual impact it has, it's been a wide range, but it has averaged about 75 basis points. And what is unusual about this year – we'd still have some good stuff coming online that we have worked on in the past few years – there is a larger percentage coming offline. So, in the past, the offset wasn't equal. We've had more coming online, so more of a benefit than what was coming offline. And this year, it's just that we've got a couple of large projects, the most significant being in Boston, which is the Abbot and happy to have Mac or Jim give more detail on that one. But after this year, we also have another one that's in the pipeline that's really significant, which is Costa Verde and we do expect that, in the very near future, we're going to be pulling almost $5 million of NOI offline for that one. So, we will continue to have these happen, but we believe that we will average 3% same-property NOI growth over the long term and we will realize the benefits of those that are coming offline, so that, in those years, we will go above the 3%.
Jeremy Metz: Yeah, appreciate that. And then, on the occupancy front, your shop occupancy was down year-over-year, box occupancy was actually up. Your guidance overall is calling for some further pressure here. I think you have about 60 basis points of headwind baked in. So, how much of that is lower box for shop occupancy in that? And maybe how much of this is known vacates today with the Kmarts and the Mattress Firms versus an expectation for further tenant fallout?
Jim Thompson: Jeremy, I'll give you some color on the sharp fall-off, if you will. Quarter-over-quarter, the 30 bps was effectively – the decay of Mattress Firm was about 10 basis points; and Aaron Brothers, we proactively recaptured that space with offsetting termination fees, so that's 20 bps. And the remainder is quite frankly, in 2018, we took a very, very aggressive Regency proactive merchandising asset management philosophy and really attacked primarily the side shop business and cleaned up the portfolio, recapturing space to create upgraded merchandising opportunity in the future. And basically just get that portfolio working as the rest of the portfolio has been in the past. As far as going forward, the major metrics that we're looking at from a historical standpoint, we continue to be 96% leased. The pipelines are continuing to be very solid. Our major metrics of AR, bad debt, rent relief requests are on par with historical measures. So, we feel the market is really solid. It continues to perform well. And we think the 92% from a shop standpoint today is a very, very solid 92% leased.
Lisa Palmer: Just to clarify what Jim said, absolutely – he left out just one thing, and that is that, when cleaning up the side shop space, it was mostly in the -- it was in the properties that we acquired from Equity One. So, the integration, kudos to the team, was extremely smooth. And, yes, we closed in March of 2017, but when you're merging with a company, it takes time. And it took us time to really understand and get comfortable with the portfolio. And 2018 was when we really did attack, as Jim said, sort of the quality of the tenant base and proactively kind of weeded out weaker tenants, if you will, to bring to the quality standard that Regency likes to operate.
Jeremy Metz: All right. Thanks.
Hap Stein: Thank you, Jeremy.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.
Craig Schmidt: Great, thank you. I guess I'm taking a kind of broader look. It was about two-and-a-half years ago, we saw Sports Authority closed. And since then, we've sort of had headwinds. And it sounds like 2019 is going to have headwinds as well. Are you seeing an end of this process, particularly given how strong the consumer was in 2018? Or are we kind of looking at a new norm here?
Jim Thompson: Craig, I would say that, anecdotally, I think there has been a meaningful weeding out. But you've got to – some of this is just part of the business. As you know, having followed the business for as long as you have, there has been and always will continue to be tenant failures. And the key is to try to align yourself with the better, best-in-class operators that get it, they have the dollars to – and the financial wherewithal to invest not only in technology, but in the store experience and value, et cetera. And that makes up the lion's share of our portfolio. But at the same time, there are going to continue to be tenant failures, but I don't see anything on the horizon that says it's going to – I think we've had a little bit of an anomaly. As I said, that's part of the business. We've averaged over between 95% and 96% leased over the last five to six – even throughout this whole process of Sports Authority, Sears and we expect – and we have strong interest on the Sears box. So, we feel good about our ability and – good about tenant demand and our ability to maintain occupancy in the 95% to 96% range and average 3% plus growth over the long term. And also, the other thing is having locations where, when bad news does happen, and it does happen, or when it's going to be good news or we can upgrade the merchandising as we roll with Sears, and more often than not, also replace at a higher rent.
Craig Schmidt: So, when you're talking to your leasing team, do they feel that, generally, beyond the sort of outliers that they're feeling like they want to open more stores, feeling a little bit more aggressive?
Hap Stein: Yeah, Craig. I would say that we continue to see growth in really all the sectors. The better retailers continue to grow their platforms. We see that growth migrating towards better real estate. And again, I think that's the sector that plays to our strength. But we're seeing, across the board, good activity and good growth among the retailers.
Craig Schmidt: Okay, thank you.
Hap Stein: Thanks, Craig.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Christine McElroy: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just on Sears, regarding that third box that you still hope to get back, it seems like from what's coming out that they are willing to sell or close some of those growing-concern stores. What's sort of your early read of the process there, what's happening? It sounds like you feel pretty good about being able to recapture that box?
Jim Thompson: Christy, I'm not sure I feel real good about it. We're [ph] recapturing it. I guess I'm taking the stance that we have a 50-50 shop that is going to be in play. The whole process has been a little bit of a funny bankruptcy, to say the least. But we strongly believe the two that are closed and had been on the list since the beginning will be rejected, we suspect, in the near future. And that keeps us ticked off on those two redevelopment opportunities.  The third one, we've had a lot of good activity with retailers as well. And quite frankly, yes, if they end up trying to spin that and sell it, we may be in a bidding war to try to capture that real estate ourselves. So, we'll just have to wait and see, but we like all three locations. And we know two of them – or feel confident two of them are going to come back our way and let us get on with life.
Christine McElroy: Okay. Thanks for that. I get that it's a fluid process. And then, just given your willingness to do M&A in the past, what would compel you to do another deal? It seems like you have enough in the pipeline here for the next five years or so with $1 billion to $1.5 billion of opportunities, but what factors would make M&A a road that you would go down again?
Hap Stein: Well said. Being able to sustain 3% NOI growth, deliver $250 million to $300 million of developments/redevelopments a year should translate to 5-plus-percent earnings growth. That's there. And I would say that, as we said even before Equity One, bigger is better and better is best. We did feel that Equity One made us a better company. It set a very high bar when you think about it. It got us into markets where we are already expanding our presence in key markets – Boston, New York and Miami – expanding our presence in markets where we had a meaningful presence, Atlanta and LA and San Francisco. The demographics were consistent and accretive. It was accretive to our NOI growth rate. It provided a robust redevelopment pipeline. And we are able to do that on a leverage-neutral basis which, I think – given where we are in the cycle, I think that's critically important to make sure that our balance sheet remains very, very strong. And we were able to generate significant synergies and we've realized those and integrated – not that it was easy, but integrated with not too much of a distraction. So that's a high bar that that for any future – that we would apply to any future opportunities out there.
Christine McElroy: And just for clarification, on that 3% same-store growth, as you embark on some of these larger mixed-use densification projects, will projects like Town and Country and Costa Verde, will they be included or excluded from the same-store pool?
Lisa Palmer: Well, Town and Country was just recently acquired. So, that will not be part of the same-property pool. Costa Verde, we've been discussing this pretty in-depth internally because of the magnitude of it. It really is different than even some of our other larger ones. Like, so for example, I mentioned the Abbot. I think we have $1 million coming offline this year – $1 million plus. But Costa Verde is $5 million. And because of the magnitude of that, at this point in time, we're planning on removing it from the same-property pool. But we'll be very clear with that and be very transparent. Doing it because we believe that it really dilutes sort of the quality of the metric, if you will, for what you all…
Hap Stein: When you're taking it offline and when you're adding…
Lisa Palmer: Yes. So, we won't get the benefit when it comes back on either. So, that is the reverse side of the coin. So, we won't get -- we won't take it down, but we also won't be adding it back when we bring it back online. Beyond Costa Verde, at this point in time, we're planning on including – keeping everything else in the same property pool.
Christine McElroy: Okay, makes sense. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Richard Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Mr. Hill, your line is live.
Richard Hill: Sorry about that guys. I was on mute. I want to follow-up on Christy's comment about M&A, but maybe taking a little bit of a different direction. Hap, you had mentioned maybe covered land plays, development opportunities. You're obviously generating a fair amount of NOI off of development and redevelopment. Is there any areas of the country that maybe you're not in right now where you might want to get in? And you could do that and maybe that would lead to more full-scale M&A. How are you thinking about that? So, I guess, the question I'm asking is, are there any areas of the country that you're not currently in or only have small footprints in that, if you could, you would make a bigger splash?
Hap Stein: Well, when you look at the canvas under which we're able to own, operate and develop, it includes – we really, really like it and we already have a meaningful presence in those markets. It includes gateway markets – San Francisco, LA, New York, Miami, Chicago. It includes 18-hour cities like Atlanta and Houston. It includes stem markets like Seattle, Austin and Raleigh. It includes growth markets like key markets in Florida. I could have included San Diego and Denver in the stem markets or in the growth markets. So, we already have – and we have market offices in a lion's share of those two dozen markets that we're in. So, we could average, so to speak, enhance our presence in some of those markets where we don't have as big a presence today, but I'm not sure there's going to be an opportunity that's going to totally drive a major merger. And I want to say that you don't take your eye off the balls – rule number one, we want to kind of keep the eye on the ball as far as our basic business. You don't ignore what's maybe out there, but our bar is very, very high. And we feel really good about the markets we're in. We feel really good about our future prospects. And it would take something pretty meaningful to cause us to do something. And I don't see an opportunity out there that we'd say, "okay, we've got 3% of our asset footings in Boston today, that would take it to 6%." I think we're going to grow that from the redevelopment and development of projects like the Abbott.
Richard Hill: Great. Thank you very much, Hap. And, guys, I really appreciate the transparency. I think you do a great job with it. So, thank you.
Hap Stein: Thank you.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you.
Jim Thompson: Greatly appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
Derek Johnston: Good morning. And thank you. I was just going to follow-up on the Sears question briefly. And you might have mentioned this, but can you remind us of the mark-to-market potential on the Sears boxes? And you said there was some interest. Would this be a single tenant? Or would you be breaking them up. What are you thinking there?
Hap Stein: Derek, we're, obviously, investigating several different redevelopment opportunities. And as we always do, we would expect those redevelopment opportunities to fall in the 7% to 9% return range. As to some of the interest, TJX, HomeGoods, REI, Burlington, we've got two of the centers that have very highly productive grocers that has expressed interest in expansion or total relocation within the redevelopment. So, we're pursuing a lot of different avenues at this point. But suffice it to say, the level of interest and activity is very, very strong. And so, we're plowing through that to really figure out the best long-term direction to create the most long-term value and the ability to remerchandise these centers to bring them up to par.
Richard Hill: Okay. And then, I guess, my second one is, how do you see recycling as far as the bottom tier non-core 1% to 2% of assets annually and utilizing those proceeds for development and redevelopment spending? You guys already have a best-in-class demographic metrics. Now, at some point, do you think there is a level of diminishing returns here? And particularly, in terms of the resulting same-store NOI and FFO growth? So, at what point, does it become a less attractive funding mechanism? And is this the reason for share repurchases?
Jim Thompson: Well, I think the key thing, it starts with $170 million of free cash flow, which basically funds $200 million free and clear. And it could fund $250 million to $300 million of development and redevelopment spend on essentially a leverage-neutral basis. And then, we take a look at capital recycling, starts with assets that are lower growth assets. And as I said earlier, this is not something that we have to do given the inherent – as you indicated, and thank you for indicating it, the inherent quality of the portfolio. But we have made that decision and we'll continue to evaluate it, and it has been a key part of our strategy, but it's an optional part of our strategy and we will continue to evaluate other assets that we want to sell, where there's meaningfully low growth. Is there a better opportunity to reinvest that capital either in a shopping center with much higher growth profile with some type of future redevelopment opportunity or maybe a covered land play? And then, the opportunity, as we did at the end of last year, where, in effect, we front-end loaded it, but where we sold stock on the basis of the visibility that we think that we can as far as selling back properties, like meaningfully almost eliminating our position in Louisiana and buying stock on that basis, on a favorable trade basis. So, I think we have all of those arrows in our quiver, but it starts with, gosh, we got this great amount of free cash flow that can fund our full development and redevelopment capital, which is the highest and best use of our capital.
Richard Hill: Thanks. That's it from me. Have a great day.
Hap Stein: Thanks, Derek.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with RBC. Please proceed with your question.
Wes Golladay: Hey, good morning, everyone. I just want to go back to the major redevelopments. I think you mentioned the Abbot, $1 million dilution this year; Costa Verde, $5 million. But in the background, we see Town and Country occupancy is real low there. Peachtree is also well below the Regency average. So, I'm just wondering how much of the dilution from the pipeline for the redevelopments is it going to be in 2019 and will be less of an issue in 2020?
Lisa Palmer: Again, so are you talking, Wes, about general occupancy because Town and Country is not same-property NOI. And then Peachtree, that's not going to hit even 2020. We haven't even started the project yet. And we did provide additional disclosure in the supplemental on some of the stabilization of our redevelopments. And you can – even redevelopments will take time. So, I think it's just most important to remember that while, 2019, we do expect to return to 3% plus in the very near term, which in terms of – in 2020, and that will be because we will be getting some contribution from redevelopments that will be coming online. So, I'm not sure if you asked about NOI or occupancy.
Wes Golladay: Total NOI. So, looking at the occupancy falling at some of these properties that are teed up for maybe one, two-plus years down the road, looks like some of the dilution has already happening this year. This year, we have some of these big projects that will have up to $5 million of NOI being taken offline. So, to me, it seems like we have a little bit of a front-end load on this redevelopment pipeline, disproportionately impacting 2019 from a total NOI perspective. And that's what I was trying to get at to see if, when we get to next year…
Lisa Palmer: Absolutely. You just said it better than we said it in our prepared remarks. Thank you. That's exactly what's happening in 2019. Very well said.
Wes Golladay: Okay. Well, thanks. That's all for me.
Lisa Palmer: Thanks, Wes.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.
Vincent Tibone: Hey, good morning. Can you discuss trends in cap rates in the transaction market? Have you noticed any changes over the last few months?
Jim Thompson: Vince, I'm happy to answer this one. Let's start with the selling side of it. What we're selling out there is being widely accepted by the market. We're transacting and buyers are cooperating at the contract prices. We haven't seen a lot of re-trading going on. We have seen some more money being raised out there to buy commodity-type assets, which is typically the stuff that we're selling. So, not a material or a meaningful change in cap rates. It sort of depends on the market, but really pretty steady that's out there. On the buy side, as you've probably heard from others, not a lot of the market. The high-quality properties with high growth profiles that we look for, there's not a lot that's being traded. So, cap rates have remained quite low on those. Example would be Melrose market that we recently acquired up in Seattle. Got a low going-in cap rate, but a very impressive growth profile in excess of 3.5%. So, a good IRR on that one in a terrific location, but no real change in cap rates over the last quarter or two quarters. Pretty steady out there.
Vincent Tibone: That's helpful color. Thank you. One more from me. You mentioned there were some relocations in the fourth quarter. Do you expect retailer relocation activity to pick up going forward as retailers may have more options in the market following recent bankruptcies?
Jim Thompson: It's a little bit of business as usual. I think you're always going to be faced with tenants taking an opportunity to right-size, et cetera. But, again, I think the bigger overriding factor is the flight to quality. So, again, it's kind of business as usual. It's what we've seen forever. And we just try to be ahead of the curve and, when we see things coming, be prepared to hopefully react positively and take the best of what the market would give us.
Vincent Tibone: Okay, thank you. That's all I have.
Hap Stein: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Omotayo Okusanya: Yes. Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered. It's more of a broad one I have just around e-tailers and this need for them to kind of have physical stores on a going forward basis. Very popular topic on the mall side. I don't hear quite as much about it on the shopping center side. But just curious how you guys kind of think about that, if there are any concepts out there that makes sense for you to be aggressively quoting?
Jim Thompson: Sure thing. Well, it's no surprise you've read all the different reports out there on how many digitally native retailers are expanding into bricks and mortar and the connection between their digital sales by having a physical footprint. It's a difference maker. And we would expect that trend to continue. But, sure, it's not talked about as much in our sector. We're seeing little signs of it, but these digital native companies are in the early stages of growth. If you look at their store count, it's still pretty low in a per market basis. Amazon is another digitally-native company that is expanding. You've seen announcement, how they are expanding on a national basis. We're keenly attuned to that. So, I think that's probably the best example of how it could and will impact our space in a positive way.
Omotayo Okusanya: Got you. All right. Thank you.
Hap Stein: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Linda Tsai: Hi. Four of the seven acquisitions you made in 2018 were anchored by Whole Foods. I'm guessing this is not a coincidence. And then, you also have two new Whole Foods under redevelopment. Do you have a view of how much NAV accretion or cap rate benefit a Whole Foods adds to a center?
Jim Thompson: Well, I would definitely say we're big fans of Whole Foods. It's not just us. It's the side shop retailers that really embrace their presence in a shopping center. And they still command the highest rents, rent growth and quality of side shop retailers. So, that's one of the reasons we like them. Those centers and redevelopments are also in terrific demographics, which Whole Foods gravitates towards. So, it's no surprise that we do a lot of business with them. It matches up with the high quality of our portfolio and we approach things similarly. On the difference of the cap rate, it depends. A lot of cap – certainly, lower cap rates are attributed to Whole Foods Centers, but a lot of it has to do with the underlying growth of the income stream. And for those reasons I mentioned, those centers typically have better growth profiles because the terms of their lease and the terms of these side shop leases. So, is it 25 basis points? is it 50 basis points? It really depends. It's not fair to give a broad brushed answer in that one. But we're big fans and we're doing lots of business with them.
Linda Tsai: Thanks. And then, the two new Whole Foods under redevelopment, are these boxes any different in configuration or layout versus existing boxes? I guess I'm asking if Amazon ownership has altered the format or size of the store?
Jim Thompson: We have not seen – not only Whole Foods, but almost all the grocers we're working with have not really changed their format size. It's been pretty consistent. I guess what is different is, you're seeing continued amount of innovation, experimentation, often an increase in R&D, and you're seeing all grocers, not just Whole Foods, really focus on service and value in the in-store experience, but that hasn't translated to a change in format or square footage. And there's still an expansion in bricks and mortar stores to support their store base. So, we haven't seen a change. Point 50 is a slightly smaller store than some of the mainline Whole Foods. Whole Foods operates in different formats depending whether it's a flagship or a typical store. So, that one might look a little bit smaller, but it's not a meaningful change in strategy or anything like that. That's a terrific location in Fairfax on a site that we've owned for more than 10 years and we're excited to be kicking off that development.
Linda Tsai: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. It appears we have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.
Hap Stein: We appreciate your time on the call, interest in the company and hope you have a very nice Valentine's Day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Regency Centers Corporation, Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Laura Clark, Vice President, Capital Markets. Thank you. You may begin.
Laura Clark: Good morning, and welcome to Regency’s third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Hap Stein, our Chairman and CEO; Lisa Palmer, our President and CFO; Mac Chandler, EVP of Investments; Jim Thompson, EVP of Operations; Mike Mas, Managing Director of Finance; and Chris Leavitt, SVP and Treasurer. I would like to begin by stating that we may discuss forward-looking statements on this call. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to our filings with the SEC which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in forward-looking statements. On today’s call we will also reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. We provided a reconciliation of these measures to their comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release and financial supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website. Before turning the call over to Hap, I would like to thank those of you who participated in our Investor Perception Study. We are grateful for your candor and appreciate the feedback. Hap?
Hap Stein: Thanks Laura. Good morning everyone. In our evolving business we continue to see the rise of retailers that have identified what it takes to remain relevant and evolved in the fall of those that have not.  As we all know, Sears was once a successful brand, but in the ebb and flow of the retail industry their declining performance over the last decade, further hindered by excessive debt illustrates how critical it is for retailers to keep the pulse of consumer preferences and expectations.  Sears failure, along with the success of numerous winning retailers also demonstrates the importance of having the capital to invest in the betterment of store, customer service and experience, as well as a technology platform that supports multi-channel retailing.  The best in class retailers including Amazon, Whole Foods, Kroger, Target, Publix and TJX just to name a few continue to make sizeable investments in the bricks and mortar footprints. Based upon our many conversations that we’ve had with key retailers, it is clear the physical stores remain a very critical component of a multi-channel strategy. This is really apparent in how retailers are investing in the physical footprints and providing a seamless and differentiated shopping experience to meet the evolving needs of their customers.  Kroger is not only enhancing their technology and delivery platform, but investing in their store with a restocked Kroger initiative, which focuses on customer experience, value and talent development.  Safeway Albertsons while partnering with Instacart and rolling out Drive-up is also remerchandising 400 of their stores. Publix continues to heavily invest in both new and existing locations with plans to redevelop over 130 stores this year as part of their $1.5 billion capital plan.  Publix has also demonstrated a real point of differentiation with their commitment to exceptional customer service. Going above and beyond offering aid in communities that were impacted by recent catastrophic storms is yet another example of the many ways that grocers are able to effectively connect to their shoppers and communities.  Target has expressed their commitment to bricks and mortar and indicated that the store is the central part of their strategy. They plan to remodel all stores by 2020; continue to open their very successful small format store and are investing in their team, as well as pickup and delivery service.  In addition, Amazon has announced an aggressive rollout of bricks and mortar locations and this is in addition to the large investment in Whole Foods. These and other best-in-class retailers are benefiting from the proactive investments and producing solid results.  Publix reported strong comparable sales and generated an impressive nearly $1 billion in free cash flow in the first half of the year. TJX’s comparable store sales rose 6% last quarter and Target reported their large quarterly sales growth in 13 years.  Our well-conceived and well-merchandised shopping centers located in trade areas with substantial purchasing power appeal to these and other outstanding retailers and restaurants. Regency’s proven strategy which our team has successfully executed with astute capital allocation and intense asset management has been distinguished by sector leading NOI growth over the last six years.  We do spend a significant amount of time ensuring that Regency is staying relevant and employing our unequal strategic advantages to achieve our objectives. First, earning a high quality portfolio that sustains sector leading same property in our growth; second, creating substantial value to our national development and redevelopment platform; third, maintaining a very conservative balance sheet; and fourth, engaging a team that is best in the shopping center business is guided by Regency’s special culture and operators efficiently with industry leading systems.  And finally, earnings and dividend growth and in turn total shareholder return that is consistently at or near the top of the shopping center sector. JT?
Jim Thompson : Thanks Hap. Core fundamentals within Regency’s premier portfolio remain extremely healthy. As Hap said, retailers continue to see value in locating a higher quality shopping centers and staying close to their customers. This is evident as occupancy climbed to nearly 96% this quarter.  Move-outs were the lowest they've been in two years and bad debt remains very healthy. The strong fundamentals across our portfolio translated into another solid quarter of same property NOI growth, driven by base rent growth of 3.8%.  As I noted on our prior call, rent spreads in any given quarter can vary based on the mix of leasing. This quarter we executed on several opportunities to bring valuable anchor spaces to market resulting in new rent spreads at 35% and total rent spreads of 10%.  I'd like to take a moment and highlight our shop space performance that clearly demonstrates the quality and resilience of our portfolio. Our shop space percent leased has been 92% plus for the last six quarters. We're seeing demand for space across all categories from many thriving tenants.  We've been successful, executing increases in starting rents, and in addition our achieving contractual rent steps for shop space that average 2.5% while judiciously managing capital commitments. All leading to strong, net effective rent growth for the last five years.  I'd like to touch on recent retailer bankruptcies before turning it over to Mac and I’ll start with a Toys "R" Us update. Of the five locations originally in the portfolio, one of the locations was released and the centers been sold. One location was assumed by another retailer at auction where we experienced zero downtime. One has been released as already commenced and the remaining two locations that we most recently acquired at auction, we're in active negotiations with a specialty grocer and a fitness user. Next, we have 25 mattress firm locations in our portfolio. Only five of these leases have been formally rejected at this time. Most importantly, we are confident that with the quality of our real-estate we will have the opportunity to upgrade merchandising as we back fill any closures. And finally Sears, where we have two Kmart’s and one Sears location. Two of these locations were included on the initial closure list, both of which are redevelopment opportunities that we are excited to finally unlock. All three are located in grocery anchored shopping centers where grocery sales average over $950 per square foot, demonstrating the draw of our real-estate, as well as the opportunity and our ability to substantially upgrade the anchor. Average rents on these locations are less than $8 per square foot.  While these bankruptcies will certainly impact near term results, more importantly the remerchandising and redevelopment opportunities triggered by recapturing this real-estate will positively impact our shopping centers over the long term. Mac. 
Mac Chandler : Thank you, Jim. The healthy fundamentals we are experiencing in our operating portfolio are also evident in our investment activity. We continue to find compelling ways to astutely investor capital and go book our new development and redevelopment pipeline. Our in process development and redevelopment projects are performing very well with strong leasing interest and economics in line with underwriting. For example, this quarter our Mellody Farm development in Greater Chicago celebrated its grand opening with all five acres, including Whole Foods, RAI and Nordstrom Max open for business. All have reported impressive sales exceeding expectations.  In regards to our pipeline, we continue to make progress on our development and redevelopment opportunities and are positioned to achieve our five year goal of $1.25 billion to $1.5 billion in starts and deliveries. Our local teams are pursuing new opportunities in our target markets, including L.A., D.C. and Houston.  We are also making meaningful progress on our pipeline at infill redevelopment. We are especially excited to start the redevelopment of the office building at Market Common Clarendon and The Abbot in Cambridge which should start in Q4 and Q1 respectively.  Further, our entitlements are progressing positively in Bethesda, which should allow our Westwood Shopping Center redevelopment to commence next year. And while we are in the early stages from a timing standpoint, we are making great strides to unlock the value creation opportunities at several premiere properties such as Costa Verde in San Diego, Town and Country in Los Angeles and Piedmont Peachtree in Atlanta's preeminent Buckhead market.  These larger scale pipeline opportunities and others, especially those that are mixed use but non-retail components take tremendous discipline, expertise and persistence. Proudly, our platform possesses these qualities and as we’ve said in the past, if we side to co-invest in a compelling non-retail component that will complement our retail, we will only partner with best-in-class world capitalized developers.  Moreover we continue to unlock value through redevelopments that are more technical in nature. This is a focus where we have enjoyed great success over the years and is an integral part of a pro-active asset management and fresh look merchandising and place making philosophy. Current examples include Bloomingdale Square, a $19 million redevelopment started this quarter where we are relocating and expanding the Publix into a former Walmart space and adding Home Centric and LA Fitness to the shopping center.  At Gateway at Aventura, we proactively acquired the former Toys “R” Us box at auction and are now in anchor negotiations to greatly enhance the value and drawing power of this excellent property. Lastly, at Point 50 in Fairfax Virginia, we are completely repositioning the center by building a new Whole Foods 365, as well as several new shop buildings.  Now turning to transactions. Similar to last quarter, there is a limited availability of institutional grade shopping centers on the market. Demand and pricing for these high quality centers continues to be strong.  On the selling side, the momentum we reported last quarter is coming to fruition. The buyers for these centers that we are selling are still discerning. The market has improved as that market debt solidified and deals are getting done. We have more visibility into expected sales volume for late 2018 and early 2019 and have accordingly increased our disposition guidance. The upward revision to our disposition cap rate is a reflection of the pool of properties we expect to close and not a change in pricing expectations.  As a reminder, our strategy is to sell approximately 1% to 2% of our asset base annually. We invest these proceeds along with free cash flow into value add developments and redevelopments, high growth acquisitions or our own stock when pricing is compelling.  This quarter we co-invested in Ridgewood Shopping Center located inside Raleigh’s belt line and anchored by the highly productive Whole Foods. This center had been owned by the same family for nearly 70 years and our local presence and deed market knowledge give us an inside track to acquire our 14th shopping center in the Raleigh market. Lisa? 
Lisa Palmer: Thank you Mac and good morning everyone. As Jim stated, we had another solid quarter as our high quality portfolio continues to perform. Year-to-date same property NOI of 3.8% has been driven entirely by very strong growth. But as we mentioned on our prior call and as our full year guidance indicates, while we are still projecting strong baseline growth in the fourth quarter, we do expect a deceleration in overall same property NOI grow, as this strong base line growth will be offset by three main drivers.  First as expected, our real-estate tax reassessments in California triggered by our merger with Equity One has started to come in and are retroactive to the date of acquisition. So essentially this equates, it actually is two years of real-estate tax expense. While the vast majority of real-estate taxes are recoverable from our tenants, we will experience a drag from the non-recoverable portion of these reassessments.  Next, we're are also up against a tough comp in base rent from redevelopments that came online in the fourth quarter of last year, specifically from too much larger projects, Fairmount and Aventura. And lastly as Jim discussed, the recent retailer bankruptcies will create opportunity to remerchandise and reposition our real-estate in the future; these will have near term impacts.  So although the timing related to the Sears bankruptcy could moderately swing us one way or the other, we have incorporated reasonable assumptions on their move out dates into our of revised 2018, same priority NOI growth guidance of plus or minus 3.25%.  Turning to earnings, both NAREIT FFO and operating FFO for the full year were revised upward by a penny at the low end, incorporating slightly better performance in same property NOI.  Before we turn the call over for questions and reminding you that we won't provide formal guidance for 2019 until early next year, I still would like to give you some insight into our same property NOI growth expectations as we do look to next year.  Let me start with a reminder of our road map to our same property NOI growth objective. First, embedded in the portfolio is 1.3% growth coming from contractual rent increases. Then another 1% to 1.2% comes from new and renewal leasing rent spreads. Combined these provide about 2.5% growth.  Finally the contribution from redevelopments is expected to add another 50 to 100 basis points of annual growth. Together, absent any changes in rent paying occupancy, these components equate to our strategic objective of 3% plus, average annual, same property NOI growth.  However our initial look into 2019 includes a couple of short term impacts to this roadmap. First, while timing is still very uncertain, the downtime associated with our three Sears boxes could impact same property NOI growth by up to 50 basis points.  Next, the redevelopment contribution has been and will continue to be uneven at times. Over the past 5 years, including year-to-date 2018, the annual contribution has ranged from 40 basis points to 170 basis points, averaging at 75 basis points positive contributions, thus the 50 to 100 basis points range in our roadmap.  In 2019 the contribution is expected to be minimal as NOI is taken offline at some of our larger, more transformational redevelopment projects. So while the contribution from redevelopments to our NOI growth can be uneven and I want to reiterate that we still remain extremely excited about our expanding pipeline and the contribution to growth that will come in 2020 and beyond.  For the difficult to predict Sears bankruptcy and the atypical contribution for redevelopment is likely to result in a more muted 2019 same property NOI growth in the low to mid 2% range. That said, there is much more to come as we close out the year before issuing formal guidance. But most importantly given our very high quality portfolio and our active REIT development pipeline, we continue to expect our same property NOI growth to return to 3% or greater over the long term.  We're extremely pleased with our results this quarter, and the position of our high quality portfolio and fortress balance sheet, all of which support our ability to grow earnings and dividends, which in turn expect total shareholder return to be consistently at or near the top of the shopping center sector.  That concludes our prepared remarks. We now welcome your questions. 
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Our first question comes from a line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question. 
Greg McGinniss: Hey, good morning. This is Greg McGinniss with Nick. I was just hoping you could provide some details on those new anchor lease signings. I was just trying to understand if this is a repeatable situation. Of those 88 new leases how much were actually above that 35% mark. 
Jim Thompson: Greg, I'm not sure I can bifurcates that 40, but bottom line in that we had strong anchor growth of 85%, really driven by Publix and LA Fitness in our Bloomingdale redevelopment; those where the real leaders. As I said in my opening statement, the mix on a quarter-to-quarter basis is hard to predict and hard to try to analyze or bifurcate, but overall we're really excited. 12.7% of that new growth rent was in shop space, so the combination of 35% is really kind of across the board.  On the renewal side I will say that we were somewhat muted on a very large target at Serramonte renewal which was flat. So overall we are happy with the rent growth and [inaudible].  [Cross Talk] 
Hap Stein: You know the trial package we’ve indicated in the past, we’re going to have – Greg we’re going to have a number of legacy leases that will repeat the benefit we received from the publics in LA Fitness leases and other leases that JT just mentioned. It won’t be all of the time, but over time we’re going to see more of that than less of that. 
Greg McGinniss: Okay great, I appreciate the insight there and then you know I appreciate the details on the same store NOI growth guidance as well, but I’m just trying to understand a bit more here. So 3Q came in stronger than originally expected, so I’m just curious what changed their. You know this was the full reason that guidance was raised and if any of that impact that you were expecting is part of what got pushed into 2019. 
Lisa Palmer: Primarily it is the reason why one, that we raised the low end of our earnings guidance and additionally took off the low end of our same property NOI guidance. It's just a matter of – as you know and as we all know, the most difficult thing to predict are move outs and we always incorporate a reason of what we believe it to be, a reasonable assumption and that came in better than expected for the quarter, so we had fewer move outs than we anticipated. 
Greg McGinniss: Okay, great. Thank you very much. 
Hap Stein: Thanks Greg.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy with Citi. Please proceed with your question. 
Christy McElroy : Hi, good morning everyone. Lisa just following up on the – again the topic of the same store NOI into 2019, just with regards to the California reassessment, the portion of that that's one time, are we looking at another three more quarters of drag there to the recovery rates? And then in terms of the redevelopment just to clarify, are you talking about to inherit in the low to mid 2% range, is that zero contribution or is that a drag from redevelopment? 
Lisa Palmer: First, the real estate tax reassessments, we would expect that just the fourth quarter should be the last of the one-time impact and next year as in any typical year, as in other states where properties are reassessed at you know certain intervals, we are expecting potentially up like a 5% increase in real estate taxes next year. But remember that we do recover about 90% of that. So it would be a minimal bleed for that. So the recovery rate going forward for all recoveries we would expect is right about where we are year-to-date assuming no change in occupancy, so in the 82% to 83% range.  And then with regards to redevelopment contribution for next year, again it's pretty early as you know and we need to have a little bit more visibility as to when leases come online and as we finish projects, so I don't know that we can give you any specifics and we will do that in early next year, but would expect it to be you know somewhere in the zero to 50% range of the positive contributions. 
Christy McElroy : Okay, and then just with regards to the accounting change, the $0.06 to $0.07 moving into G&A in 2019, I understand that that also includes the leasing costs that previously would have been capitalized into the basis of your in-process development projects. How much of the estimated $0.06 to $0.07 would have been attributed to sort of normal recurring CapEx versus sort of that development, redevelopment bucket. Just geographically thinking from a modeling perspective you know just where that would have found through. 
Lisa Palmer: Christy I’m not sure I understood. So you are asking how much of our internal leasing costs are – because the $0.06 to $0.07 is [Cross Talk]
Christy McElroy : No, no, no. Just with regard to the $0.06 to $0.07. Yeah, just splitting out the $0.06 to $0.07, what has this gone through, recurring CapEx versus what would have been through development, redevelopment spend, the leasing costs, because it would have been, it would have shown up in your development schedule right, in the total cost attributed to each development project. So I'm wondering if that gets adjusted? 
Lisa Palmer: It's still – in our disclosure when we give leasing capitalization costs, it’s still our – we’ll have to get offline on that, we’ll come back to you.
Christy McElroy : Okay, thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from a line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. 
Craig Schmidt : Oh! Thank you. On the three boxes from Sears holding, does Regency have control over these boxes? 
A - Hap Stein: Craig, at this point we do not. All we know is we have two boxes that were on the initial 142 store closure list. We've not heard any more than that.  We obviously have been awaiting this day for a long time. Our teams have been focused on redevelopment plans. We feel like we're in great shape and eager to recover our real states, so that we can move forward and enhance our centers by back filling these tired old Sears and Kmart boxes with dynamic retailers today. So we’re – and more to come obviously, but no news other than its showing up on the closure list and we are prepared when it comes back to take those two. 
Mac Chandler: In addition as Jim indicated earlier in the prepared remarks, the inbound comments and interest in the space has been very, very encouraging. 
Craig Schmidt : And is there a broader acreage of land that comes with the stores? 
Hap Stein: In the Sears specific we have a tire, battery, auto and probably some excess parking area that we believe we can probably do some patch / out billings on. So beyond the box we think there's some external redevelopment opportunity as well. 
Craig Schmidt : Okay, and was October rent paid on these boxes? 
Hap Stein: Yes. 
Craig Schmidt : Great! Okay, thank you. 
Hap Stein: Thanks Craig.
Operator: Our next question comes from a line of Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. 
Derek Johnston: Hi, good morning. We've discussed a real estate tax assessments and how it relates to the EQI portfolio, but in relation to the prop 13 bill in California, can you give us an update on the weighted average age of the Legacy Regency assets there? Have you begun to assess that potential impact? 
Lisa Palmer: Yes, and it is just the Legacy Regency obviously as essentially those that are being reassessed at ages zero if you will. So of the remaining which is about 20% of our asset base, its 13 years. 
Derek Johnston: Thanks, and just switching over to the omni-channel repositioning that you discussed at the beginning, what effort and the roles of the local strip banker grocers are you seeing? Which are best positioned to address online delivery, online pick up growth segments and you know what actual investments are you seeing on the ground and what can you guys do to expedite the adoption? 
Hap Stein: We’re facilitating the adoption of the pick-up and delivery and we're seeing a keen focus on the part of pretty much all of the grocers. I think the key thing, and that's all important; technology is important in the store and we’re all investing heavily in that, but it's also the shopping experience and the service that’s really the point of differentiation and I think that's critically important to remember and keep that in mind, and that's the reason why you know we think that our grocer sales are as high as they are, both on an aggregate basis of $32.5 million and $650 per square foot. 
Derek Johnston: Great, thanks. 
Hap Stein: Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from a line of Jeremy Metz with BMO. Please proceed with your question. 
Jeremy Metz: Hey, good morning. Going back to the Sears and Kmart topic, assuming you can get control of those boxes, do any of those represent an opportunity to kick off bigger densifications of those sites just given how big this year's in Kmart boxes presumably were and then it sounds like you more or less have been ready for this as most have been. So any rough capital investment that this could potentially represent? 
Jim Thompson: Jeremy, to answer the first question. We studied the densification and believe our best avenue today is to replace with like retail. So the justification, I think we’ll be just higher better use, better quality retail. And I'm sorry, what was the second?
Jeremy Metz: About capital. You certainly [cross talk] …
Jim Thompson: Capital, it's really too early. We’ve got a lot of – as Hap indicated we got a lot of answers from a lot of different players and until we can spend some more time and really understand when we are going to get back and those kind of things, we're really not positioned today to talk about it. Well, obviously we continue to target the 7% to 9% when we get our hands back on our redevelopment, that's kind of our goal.
Lisa Palmer: Yeah, I think just to add a little bit of color Jim, in two of the three that are Kmart boxes. They're not Sears boxes, so they're just typical legacy Kmart’s and there's a reason they’re still, because it's really strong real estate and we do believe that will be an opportunity to upgrade the merchandising and then potentially also grow NOIs. 
Hap Stein: The K are extremely excited about the opportunity. 
Jeremy Metz: Yeah, I know that's fair. A question for Mac, in terms of acquisitions, the Ridgewood Center that you did enter by Whole Foods, was this sourced by your partner or why not put that one on balance sheet. Just given that it seems like down the fairway for Regency and I guess sticking with acquisitions, one of your peers mentioned the move-in rates causing some sellers to pull back. I know you guys have been active, but maybe you can talk about what you're seeing and hearing out there from an acquisition standpoint. 
Jim Thompson: Sure thing, Jeremy. You're right that Ridgewood is right down the alley for us. It’s a terrific center and we look forward to working with Whole Foods as their lease doesn’t expire sometime in the next 10 years. Our partner was that we acquired the property with actually had some internal recycling, so they were selling a center that we owned with them and this was part of their internal capital recycling. So they were up and the rotation worked within that and that's the reason for that. In terms of just overall perception, buyers are closing and we mentioned it this last quarter. There's just a firmer fitting underground for sellers; debt markets were cooperating and it seems like the market has come up and we noticed that in the transactions we closed today and we have another $60 million under contract with scheduled closings by year-end and another $65 million where we’re negotiating purchase agreements, but in those cases buyers have already begun their due diligence.  So they may not all close, but we’ll have some to grow to next year and some could drop out, but we are seeing you know buyers feeling you know measurably better about things than they were six months ago and we're seeing that in the transaction market. 
Jeremy Metz: Yeah, so I guess I was also trying to wonder just from an acquisition standpoint, as you’re out there your seeing, not you guys, but other sellers in the market pull back a little bit here or has there been any change in the cadence of deals that are out there that you are seeing? 
Hap Stein: I think what makes it hard to measure is there is very little property of the caliber that we're looking for that's on the market and we’ve seen very, very few transactions out there. So you know there are definitely institutional buyers and advisors who are out there looking for a Class A product that we are a product that has a strong tenure CAGR, but unfortunately there's a pretty select few properties out there that are transacting because buyers – owners are reluctant to put their properties in the market because it's hard to find a replacement property; there's so little Class A in the market.
Jeremy Metz: Okay, fair enough. Last one from me. Hap you mentioned the importance of investing in the store and the customer experience. You know as you think about your increasing role in that, the landlord needing to play a bigger part in creating that overall environment, are you committing more capital are looking to commit more capital along this front which may not necessarily be able to immediately – it should be returned to the longer term, you know it's going to benefit the center and therefore your ability to both retain and source new tenants as you need. 
Hap Stein: Well, number one, as part of our – obviously our large scale redevelopments and even our tactical redevelopments, there our fresh look philosophy where there's a tremendous emphasis on merchandising and on place making, they're going to distinguish the look of listing the state appeal of those shopping centers to the communities and neighborhoods that they serve, so I think that’s important. But we’ve got an ongoing maintenance program and in that ongoing maintenance program we're very focused on you know place making and ongoing leasing and merchant and merchandising is critical to that.  So that’s a part of the way we do our business each and every day and we feel really good about the way our shopping centers are distinguishing and they are continuing to focus on how to keep them relevant and we are also – I think our view is we spent between 10% and 11% of NOI from a tenant improvement White Box ongoing business, you know building improvement standpoint and think that that number is still good and together with the redevelopments that are tactical in nature will keep our shopping centers looking fresh and relevant to our communities. 
Jeremy Metz: Thanks for the time. 
Hap Stein: Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question. 
Ki Bin Kim: Thanks. So you have an interesting dynamic that's going on in your department pipeline. You might have about $280 million of pipeline, but if I look at the percent leased and think about the dollars at risk, there’s really not much because a lot of it has been leased pretty well.  It kind of clears up your pipeline or your development capability for next year. You also mentioned a lot of these other bigger projects in your opening remarks. So I'm just trying to get a sense of how much do you think you will start next year?
Mac Chandler : Sure, I’m happy to take that. This is Mac. While we haven’t given formal guidance yet on our developments starts for next year, and we will be doing that in the near future, but you are right. The developments that we have that are underway are performing very well. At 80% leased where we are very happy with those and it allows us to use our expertise to work on some of these longer term redevelopments and I touched upon several of those in our opening remarks, I’ll just give an example.  Westwood Shopping Center which is a center they came over with Equity One, in about a year's time we should be ready to start that project and that is very promising. It's a mixed use project, with retail. It's got approximately 200 apartments and some tenants to it and these are complicated projects and not every company is capable of doing this, but we think we have the team and the expertise and the market knowledge to take this on.  So we are bullish about that. We’ll eventually give guidance on where we think we’ll be, but over a long term, which is really the right way to measure our contribution, it’s not a year-to-year business, it’s always going to be lumpy, but we think we are on track to hit our five year target at $1.25 billion to $1.5 billion in starts and then deliveries would come with that two as well. So hopefully that answers your question. 
Ki Bin Kim: Yeah, I mean it does. I mean I think about Bethesda project. That by itself is probably very sizeable. You guys started about $200 million this year. I mean I guess just directionally it does feel like it could be a lot more in the next year. So is that – am I thinking about it correctly?
Mac Chandler : Well, I think directionally you will see us doing more of redevelopments as a percentage of our total investment than we have in the years past. In some years it was more ground up as compared to redevelopments and I thinks switching and more agnostic to the two. In fact we like the flexibility optionality that redevelopments give us and so I wouldn’t associate more, but I would say the mix between ground-up and redevelopment is shifting more towards redevelopment and we are very pleased with that.  These are properties that we one and then Town & Country is for the one, new one to that and we are coming into a partnership on that property which is a terrific property located across the street from The Grove and we mentioned that before. But that allows us to bring our expertise to enter into a family partnership and to add some density to that and ultimately that will be one of our more key properties across the country. We are very pleased with that. 
Ki Bin Kim: Okay and just last question. For the last question, on the Sears, Kmart I realize you don't have much direct exposure, but how do you think about that tangential exposure just from the model shop supply that might hit the market and how that impacts your portfolio?
Hap Stein: In general, space is space and it has an impact. But we think and we feel real good about our locations, about our anchor tenants, about the team’s focus and you know we have released virtually all the space that’s coming back to us, the anchor space that has and I think that’s indicative to say it doesn't have any impact. But we believe that as Lisa said that we can generate in fact 2.5% from an underlying NOI growth standpoint before redevelopments and we think over time that redevelopments are going to contribute an additional 50 to 100 basis points.  We've got the team in place, the commitment, only to say in regard to the redevelopments, you know it's kind of become the topic de jure and this has been an integral part of our business historically and we got to the team placed and the markets to markets these projects happen.  As Mac said, they can be complicated, they can be difficult, and we’ve not even viewed the tactical ones. I think as I indicated earlier, it’s just an opportunity to refill a box, etc. It’s an opportunity to further distinguish of our shopping centers for the long term. And just to reiterate what Mac said I think we're very well positioned to achieve the $1.25 billion to $1.5 billion of development starts and to average as Lisa said, 3% same property NOI growth, even in a market where there is going to be additional store closings. 
Ki Bin Kim: Okay, thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from a line of Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Rich Hill: Hey, good morning everyone. I want to maybe just go back to the properties that you're buying and selling. Maybe we can talk about the properties you're selling first. Could you provide any more color as to what’s maybe making those less attractive and trade at lighter cap rates. Is it location, is it you know the type of grocery store there, is there alternative mix. What is making that less attractive to you or maybe you want to work into something that's so called higher quality. 
Mac Chandler : Yeah, sure thing Rich. This is Mac. You know if you just look at page 15 of our supplemental, you can start to pick up some teams here from the set of properties. It’s a [inaudible] anchor. It’s a deals anchored center; it’s a theater anchored center.  There’s two larger projects that are really big box centers. There is one in India, its unanchored, its shadow anchored by Home Depot, so it’s not the typical Class A infill grocery anchored tenants that we own and we feel that these properties were ready to be sold. These were prioritized disposition for us, and ready to solid and were widely marketed and they cleared.  It’s a type of center that I mentioned, sort of the tenants who are there, but it’s also the location. These are smaller markets, and if you plug into the demographics, they are lighter than our typical property. They are on the low end and they are typically lower growth and people are paying for growth. So all those characteristics contribute to the pricing and we feel that the pricing was correct. These are really out buyers in many ways. 
Rich Hill: Got it, and so it looks your rising sales have been fairly similar this year, at least in terms of number. But you also mentioned it’s hard to find the high quality properties that you want to own. Do you think there is more role quality properties to go for you to sell or as you just mentioned, is it really just an outlier. I guess what I'm asking, do you think there's more opportunities to see more portfolio location at this point in time or is it becoming harder just they may as well be higher quality properties. 
Hap Stein: Yeah, being able to find good use of the capital is an issue. Being able to do transactions on a tax efficient basis is also important, but the other key thing is we don't have to sell properties. We are in a position where those properties that kind of have the characteristics that Mac just described are the remaining less than 5% of our portfolio, so we are in a position to sell when it makes sense to sell and when we have the appropriate use of funds and we can do it on a tax efficient basis. 
Rich Hill: Got it, and just one more follow-up question if I will. Are there any examples where you can take out so called 79 property and put money into it and make it a 49 property? I mean does that exist or is that just not a use of your funds in your opinion.
Hap Stein: That’s – where we can we have an opportunity to do that, we do that each and every day. That's a key part of our business and we've been doing that for years and these redevelopments represent a lot of those when we are transforming the properties that we have. 
Rich Hill: Got it, thank you guys. That was really helpful. 
Operator: Our next question comes from a line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. 
Mike Mueller : Hey, good morning, I through I got out of the queue. My question was the prior question on about how much of the 7.5 to 8 cap properties are less in the portfolio. So I think that – I heard you said it was about. 
Lisa Palmer: I don’t know that we actually answered the question. So I would point you to our Investor Presentation where we have about 2% that we consider kind of non-core and think about again remind you of our funding strategy. So free cash flow is going to fund our development spend to the extent that we are short, we are going to – and do not have access to the equity market because it's not a compelling price at the time. We will use dispositions for that and it will come from that 2% bucket.  And if you do, to give a little bit more color on page 15 in the supplemental, if you look at those, there is not a single one on here that we went out and bought individually. It either came as in the package of the of the portfolio acquisition and a couple of them were legacy developments when we are building much larger power centers back in the late marching developments, which we do not do today.
Mike Mueller : So basically if that 2% of the portfolio was gone and we're looking in the supplemental, the disposition cap rates wouldn't be 7.5% or higher. 
Lisa Palmer: I think that's a fair assumption. 
Mike Mueller : Got it. Okay, that was it, thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from a line of Chris Lucas with Capital One. Please proceed with tour questions. 
Chris Lucas: Good morning everybody. Hey, just a couple of quick ones. Lisa on the implied guidance for the fourth quarter, you know $0.03 spread between 91 to 94, is there any one item that sort of causes that spread or is it just a myriad of factors that you're unsure about going in. 
Lisa Palmer : It’s you know, same priority NOI is a big driver obviously and although our guidance is 3.25 plus or minus, it can be plus or it can be minus, and Sears is a big driver of that as well depending upon when – if we get November and December we are in it and that is one of the largest drivers. 
Chris Lucas: Okay and then just kind of following up on that topic. The Mattress Firms you had rejected, given the likely scenario, the plants they're going to come out. I think they want to get out of bankruptcy this year. You'll get paid what for those rejected leases? 
Lisa Palmer: Its still, I’m a little hesitant to say that I'm certain what's going to happen. So our understanding at this point is we are going to get paid for them for up to a year, but again I think its…
Hap Stein: A year from when they file.
Lisa Palmer: A year from when they file. But I think that its more to come. But right now that is the assumption. 
Hap Stein: Bankruptcy is an uncertain process and we’ve incorporated that into our projections.
Lisa Palmer: So just, Hap just so that I’m clear. You are saying that you could get up to a year, but it would be a year from now that you would get paid or when they come out. 
Lisa Palmer: I don't know that we really know when it's, and that's part of the uncertainty as well, but the early indication is that we will get up to a year's worth of rent. 
Hap Stein: Whether that’s from when they filed or it’s from when they come out, we still don’t know.
Chris Lucas: Okay, and as it relates to Sears in terms of the guidance you provided earlier and the drag to same store NOI from near year, does that matter as to whether that’s a seven or a 11 liquidation or we just a rework and what are you guys assuming?
Hap Stein: I mean that won’t matter. What matters is whether or not we actually – whether someone assumes and buys the lease or if we get it back. 
Chris Lucas: Okay, great. Thank you, I appreciate it. 
Hap Stein: Thank you, Chris. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Samir Khanal with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. 
Samir Khanal: Yeah, good morning. I just had a question on the leasing spreads for new deals. I mean it was up 35%, but it didn't look like you put in a lot of CapEx. Certainly if you look at the CapEx per term in the quarter versus maybe the trailing 12, it actually fell. So I just want to know what was kind of going on there. 
Hap Stein: Samir, yeah it was interesting that it fell with the volumes and what that represents is really the driver there was Publix at our Bloomingdale Redevelopment. That particular deal is a tear down and rebuild. So what you had was less, what we call IT and White Box and it's really rebuilding a building. So that artificially dampened that number. If you took Publix out of that, we would normalize it $30, which is right in line. 
Samir Khanal: Okay, got it. And I guess my second question is just regarding your NOI guide post, you know that low to mid 2% range for ‘19. I mean how are you guys thinking about sort of credit loss reserves for ‘19 versus this year.  You know how much cushion do you have sort of built in for maybe other distress retailers besides sort of the Sears and Mattress Firm of about certainly 90 basis points, excuse me a 50 basis points down time. 
Lisa Palmer: Again, that's not formal guidance’s, so we will come back to you in early part of next year with more formal guidance. But Sears is obviously incorporated in there as I indicated in my remarks, up to 50 basis points. 
Samir Khanal: So at this point beyond Sears you are not incorporating any other? 
Lisa Palmer: Samir yes, of course we always do and even through a bad debt expense, it doesn’t exactly translate to how much we are incorporating into kind of the credit collection loss if you own typical underwriting. We've been kind of around the 45 in the – 40 to 50 basis points range in bad debt expense. I think that that’s a good indication that we’ve had a pretty normal and steady rate of move outs if you will and bankruptcies and store closures and we would expect something similar next year on top of Sears. 
Hap Stein: We're incorporating – our thinking is incorporating our normal amount of issues, but at the same time we're also incorporating that the underlying business is good, leasing spreads will remain healthy, we're seeing strong demand for space. So we feel good about the underlying fundamentals of the business and our ability to continue. The Sears bankruptcy aside, the 2.5% underlying same property NOI growth that Lisa described earlier.
Lisa Palmer: And I think my prepared remarks directly hit that and also there is even some – it’s also implied, if you go back to the road map again of 1.3% contractual rent steps and then another 1.2% from rent lease spreads, that gets you to 2.5 and I just told you that we’re expecting and incorporating up to 50 basis points at Sears and we're still saying we're going to be in the 2% to 2.5% range.
Samir Khanal: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from a line of Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.
Vince Tibone: Good morning. I have a clarification question on the Sears closures. Are you have to bid for the leases, the bankruptcy option?
Lisa Palmer: Jim, [inaudible].
Jim Thompson: It’s just that we don’t know. We are on a closure list, but there is no telling how Sears will – whether they'll try to sell the leases before they reject, we just don't know at this point. We are – obviously in our planning we're preparing to defend our real estate.
Vince Tibone: Got it, okay. [Cross Talk] They are still paying rent and the lease is still in place until further notice. Can you just talk maybe a little more broadly about the pros and cons of buying a lease in bankruptcy option versus letting a new tenant you know purchase a below market lease?
Jim Thompson: Well obviously we evaluate every aspect, and I would say during the Toys we evaluated a deal in Chicago where it was at auction. We were prepared to be it if needed. We did our homework. Understood who was interested in the space and felt comfortable with that user and felt the economics of no-downtime projecting rent was a good alternative to us jumping in and protecting the real estate. So it's a one off thing we evaluate on every space that’s in play.
Hap Stein: And Mac in my just review to kind of what we did with Hagan, because it was a combination of working with replacements to Hagan, buying leases and letting some of them go and coming back to us on that date.
Jim Thompson: Before Mac does individual examples, I mean the biggest thing is, is the pro is it gives us control of the real estate. It allows us to control the merchandising and in often cases which Mac is going to talk about allow us to unlock a lot of value.
Vince Tibone: Those are lease closures?
Mac Chandler: Well, you may change the use Vince, right, upgrade the use, but you also by wiping out that former lease you may get rid of some restrictions that have to do with competing uses, exclusives, co-tenancy parking requirements. Sometimes these older leases are just outdated with how the market works. So you get a fresh start and there's generally at a reasonable price. The pros heavily outweigh the cons and you take some leasing risk, you're not going to have it preleased, but we're in that business anyway and we have a good feel for that and we factor that into our pricing. So net-net its usually advantageous for us to buy a least back.
Vince Tibone: That's very helpful color. Thank you, that’s all I have.
Hap Stein: Thank you, Vince.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Linda Tsai: Hi, yes. Does having a Kmart box versus having a Sears…
Hap Stein: Linda, we can’t hear you.
Linda Tsai: Sorry about that. Does having a Kmart Box versus have a Sears give you more flexibility given the size and you know maybe in terms of back filling more easily with the tenant versus having to redevelop?
Lisa Palmer: The reason I commented specifically that they were Kmart's versus Sears is to see exactly the size of the box and they're in your typical neighborhood community shopping center, so there's not a whole lot of densification opportunities at those.
Linda Tsai: Okay, and then in terms of the 35% increase in new leases, can you give us a sense of what percentage of your anchor leases are considered legacy?
Mike Mas: Hey Linda, we can’t give you that percentage. This is Mike, but we do have as we indicated at our Investor Day, there are 40 leases that we call “Legacy Leases” that are available to us in the upcoming say five plus years and those will be the leases that are going to really drive the top line rent growth metric.
Lisa Palmer: And even – it’s pretty interesting, even in a portfolio of our size, it doesn't take much for it to really move the needed, because they are such large increases at these legacy anchor leases.
Mac Chandler: And they control the space for a significant amount of time. The key thing as far as the health of the portfolio and the relative strength and sustainability of the portfolio I think is the same store rent spreads that we are experiencing, 12% on the shop space.
Linda Tsai: Thanks, and then while your peers are using technology and data to better understand shopping habits and help tenants make location decision, to what extent are you engaging in these initiatives to?
Mac Chandler: Linda, I’ll answer that. Lisa, do you want to take it?
Lisa Palmer: Go ahead Mac.
Mac Chandler: This is not a new thing for us. We’ve actually been at the forefront of using technology to help us with merchandising, to target actual customers by using mobile data to track where our customers are coming from and we've actually been piloting probably over a dozen different technologies over the years and actually have helped companies create that technology by working with them closely.  So we're using it for better merchandising, where we've been able to convince tenants that our sites makes sense by showing them what our customers are coming from and using technology that they don't have in house and it's been eye opening for them and that’s really helped us. And then the future really is using this technology to actually target customers coming on to our property through advertisements, through mobile phones and that’s in the early stages of it, but we are spending a fair bit of time on this and the industry still has years to grow up, but it's not a new thing to us. We’ve been following this for many, many years.
Linda Tsai: Thanks.
Mac Chandler: Thanks Linda.
Operator: Our next question is from Christy McElroy with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Christy McElroy: Hi, thanks for taking the follow-up. Just on mattress firm, I know that there’s the initial closure list. It’s all very fluid. There's more that’s potentially coming. Just that you know you've got five closing, 20 remaining. On the 20, are they – as they sort of work through the process and potentially emerge here, are they trying to negotiate rent release on those 20 remaining or is it still sort of up in the air?
Hap Stein: Christy, as any good bankrupter will do, they will absolutely ask on every location which they did here. We’ve been firm in our responses. I think the average AVR is $33 on ours. I think they are located in centers in 96% leased. They generally took very good real estate, high visibility high access. So that’s when we felt over good about being strong and recapture our real estate. When asked we said no, and the five may turn into seven or eight, but at the end of the day we will proactively release those boxes in smaller phase.
Mac Chandler: Just say no.
Christy McElroy: Okay, and then just – following up on some of Ki Bin’s questions, you guys were talking about Westwood a bit. Any sort of early estimates you can give us in terms of the potential for a capital commitment on this project? Is there something that you would be maybe working with partners on any non-retail components and would this project stay in the same store pool?
Mac Chandler: I can touch on the first part of that. Plus or minus $75 million is what we circle for investment in that and we would have all of the retail. We are negotiating with a partner where we would take half of the apartment, 50% interest and that’s included in the $75 million. There is also approximately 75 town homes which are up for sale product and we're going to provide some of the capital for that, although that’s not a long term hold as I mentioned. So Lisa can talk to you about sort of the big picture, what’s in and out of that. But we are excited about that project. It should have a return of in the high sixes. This is what a stabilized return is and it’s going to be down in the project for us.
Hap Stein: And just in both cases, on the town home and multi-family developer they were negotiating with and both are best in class and both will have a meaningful amount of capital invested on this share of – of those portions of the development.
Lisa Palmer: At this point of time with the early head nod of the 2% to 2.5%, we are assuming that Westwood stays in our same property pool. But it’s a great question as we really do have larger projects that we are beginning to work on, beyond – a scale beyond what we have had in the past. We got another one that’s in our pipeline in San Diego in Costa Verde. It’s over $5 million of NOI and we may essentially take that to zero as we redevelop it. So it’s something that we are evaluating and we’ll have more clarity on how we will handle those large projects in the future, but for now Westwood is assumed to be just staying in the same property pool.
Christy McElroy: Okay, and then is Giant staying at the project, has that been resolved.
Hap Stein: Giant is staying. They are going to relocate. Sorry to interrupt. Giant is planning to stay. We are going to relocate them and put them into a brand new store in a podium format with parking below them.
Christy McElroy: Okay, thank you.
Hap Stein: Thank you, Christy.
Operator: Thank you. It appears we have no future questions at the time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.
A - Hap Stein: We really appreciate your time, interest in Regency and wish that you all have a wonderful weekend. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day!

Executives: Laura Clark – Vice President, Capital Markets Hap Stein – Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jim Thompson – Executive Vice President of Operations Mac Chandler – Executive Vice President of Investments Lisa Palmer – President and Chief Financial Officer
Analysts: Jeremy Metz – BMO Capital Markets Katy McConnell – Citigroup Craig Schmidt – Bank of America Rich Hill – Morgan Stanley Mike Mueller – JPMorgan Chris Lucas – Capital One Securities
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to Regency Centers’ Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Laura Clark, Vice President, Capital Markets. Thank you. You may begin.
Laura Clark: Good morning, and welcome to Regency’s second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Hap Stein, our Chairman and CEO; Lisa Palmer, our President and CFO; Mac Chandler, EVP of Investments; Jim Thompson, EVP of Operations; Mike Mas, Managing Director of Finance; and Chris Leavitt, SVP and Treasurer. I would like to begin by stating that we may discuss forward-looking statements on this call. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to our filings with the SEC, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in forward-looking statements. On today’s call, we will also reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. We provided a reconciliation of these measures to their comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release and financial supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website. Hap?
Hap Stein: Thanks, Laura. Good morning, everyone. Fundamentals in shopping center business continue to be healthy, demonstrated by another quarter of solid results from our preeminent national portfolio. That said, we remain keenly aware of the changes occurring across today’s retail landscape. Retailers have always faced constant need to remain relevant, through experience, through merchandise, through service, and through value. The current environment is no different, and the best grocers and retailers are not standing still. They are focused on meeting the evolving needs of today’s consumer by allowing customers to choose how, where, and when they will shop. A physical store presence remains a critically important channel, where retailers connect and service to customers. Best-in-class operators are looking for stores in high-quality shopping centers that are located close to their customers. Regency’s top grocers and retailers, including Publix, Kroger, Whole Foods, T.J.Maxx, Ulta, Panera and Orangetheory Fitness, to name a few, are addressing the evolving landscape through significant investments in technology, in experience, in price and in many cases, significant store expansions. Regency’s strategic advantages position the company to not only meet the changes occurring in today’s retail environment that will enable us to consistently grow shareholder value in the future. These unequaled advantages include: a national portfolio that is distinguished in terms of its size, it’s breadth and its quality; well merchandised and well-conceived shopping centers located in dense infiltrated areas, in neighborhoods with substantial purchasing power, that are must have shopping centers for successful and expanding retailers; a best-in-class national platform of teams located in our target markets throughout the country, bringing market knowledge and expertise for value creation, from asset management, development and redevelopment; a fortress balance sheet and disciplined capital allocation strategy; and most important of all, a deep and talented team that is guided by Regency’s special culture. This proven formula will allow us to sustain same property NOI growth by 3%, and earnings and dividend growth by an average of 5% to 7%. And these should generate sector leading shareholder returns over the long term. Jim?
Jim Thompson: Thanks, Hap. Core fundamentals were gratifying, with second quarter same property NOI growth of 4.2%, and occupancy at 95.5%. It is important to note that base rent was the lion’s share of this, contributing 3.5% growth for the quarter. Retailers continue to behave rationally and deliberately, and are focused on leasing space in well-located centers. We think this constructive behavior is a positive for our business, and while recognizing today’s changing landscape, our teams continue to have success as we focus on merchandising with best-in-class tenants, maximizing net effect of rent over the term, and minimizing downtime. Our superior portfolio of quality is evidenced in the recent outcomes of the Toys "R" Us bankruptcy. As you may recall, we had minimal exposure to toys, with only five leased spaces. To date, one of the centers has been sold, one box was assumed by another retailer at auction, where we experienced zero downtime, one has already been released, and we are actively engaged in discussion with multiple tenants, including HomeGoods, Trader Joe’s and Publix, for the two boxes we acquired at auction. Overall, retail bankruptcies have been lower than anticipated today, leading to solid performance and our raise in same property NOI growth expectations for the year, which Lisa will discuss in more detail. Turning to operating performance. Year-to-date rent spreads, while still healthy, are moderating a bit due to a couple of factors. First, we have a robust redevelopment pipeline, which Mac will talk more about next, where we are proactively creating flexibility to execute on accretive investments to drive future NOI growth and value creation. This means that sometimes, we will execute flat or negative growth renewal deals in return for shorter-lease terms or termination and relocation rights, which gives us the ability to control our real estate for development in the future. Second, renewing or replacing below-market anchor leases after expiration can often have significant impact on lease spreads. In the first half of the year we had a lack of legacy anchor leases come back to us, but as we look to the second half we have several opportunities to bring these valuable spaces to market rents. More importantly, we’ve had great success including embedded annual rent increases in our leases, and over the last four years, have averaged 2.5% contractual increases on nearly 90% of our shop deals we’ve executed. This effort is certainly reflected in our strong same property NOI and cash flow growth over the last several years. Mac?
Mac Chandler: Thank you, Jim. The investment environment for institutional-grade shopping centers is stable and there continues to be solid demand, particularly for the highest quality properties where a diverse array of buyers continues to drive pricing. On the selling side, we’ve seen an adequate buyer pool for our commodity centers. These buyers are seeking solid growth and have access to debt financing. To date, we have closed on $143 million of dispositions at an average cap rate of 7.9%. Pricing in these transactions has met expectations, and we have a visible pipeline to achieve our disposition plan of $275 million for 2018. Consistent with past years, we typically sell 1% to 2% of our asset base annually. The proceeds, combined with free cash flow, are reinvested into value-add developments and redevelopments, premier acquisitions with superior growth prospects, or our own stock, when pricing is compelling and tax gains are manageable. We believe this perpetual enhancement to our portfolio uniquely fortifies our NOI growth rate. Turning to development and redevelopment. We are making impressive progress with our in-process pipeline. Leasing velocity is strong, and rents our meeting or exceeding the expectations. Case in point, we recently completed our chimney lock development located in affluent Somerset County, New Jersey. This $71 million investment is anchored by Whole Foods, Nordstrom Rack and Zacks Outfit. We are pleased to report that the center is 97% leased, with retail sales exceeding tenant expectations. As we’ve discussed previously, new groundup development opportunities that meet our high standards and disciplined strategy, remain challenging to source. Fortunately, Regency’s preeminent portfolio is full of redevelopment opportunities that are being mined by our talented development team. The following is an update on just a few of our near-term prospects. The Abbot, a true iconic property located in the heart of Harvard Square, should start by year-end. All approvals have been obtained to allow the transformation of our three historic buildings into one integrated retail office flagship. Next is that the redevelopment of our midrise building, at Market Common Clarendon in Arlington. We intend to modernize and expand this 1960s era building into a new state-of-the-art four-level structure, with dynamic ground floor retail fronting Whole Foods. Preleasing interest has been strong, including the execution of a full four lease with a luxury fitness club, which will serve as another exciting draw for the entire project. Located in Bethesda, Westwood Shopping Center is another exciting infill redevelopment opportunity. The first phase will consist of approximately 150,000 square feet of neighborhood retail, anchored by a top-performing giant, 200 units of apartments and 75 for-sale townhomes. We have strong interest in the residential components, where Regency plans to partner with best-in-class codevelopers, to create an integrated project that will draw from this affluent trade area. These three redevelopments are all projected to start within the next 12 months, with an aggregate cost of approximately $170 million, and will generate an average incremental return of 8%. These are just a few examples of the kinds of compelling value add opportunities which our portfolio and platform reports. Our experienced team is excited by the many opportunities in the pipeline, and we have visibility to exceed $1 billion of development and redevelopment starts and deliveries over the next five years. Lisa?
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Mac, and good morning, everyone. We had another impressive quarter of same property NOI growth that was primarily driven by base rents. As Jim said, base rent growth contributed 3.5% for the quarter, and 3.7% year-to-date, a reflection of the strength of the portfolio, with healthy embedded rent steps as well as the result of accretive asset management in redevelopments. This strong performance during the first half of the year, combined with less tenant fallout than we originally projected, allowed us to raise our expectations around same property NOI growth. We have removed the potential for finishing in the bottom half of our previous range, and now expect to finish the year at 2.75% to 3.25%. As we’ve communicated previously, we will experience a deceleration in the back half of the year, with some property growth in the low 2% range for both the third and fourth quarters. Timing and the lumpiness of certain NOI line items are the primary factors, as our guidance range does include very healthy base rent growth of 3%-plus through the remainder of the year. I think it would be helpful to take a minute and walk you through the primary drivers of this deceleration. First, we expect recovery rates to normalize through the back half of the year, and end the year in line with 2017 levels. Second, as Jim mentioned, while we are making great progress on the toys boxes that we acquired out of bankruptcy, we will experience downtime in the third and fourth quarters. Third, we’re going up against tough comps as we completed the major redevelopment of Serramonte, in the fourth quarter of last year. And finally, the timing of other income was front end loaded this year versus last. As we look through these timing impacts, the growth in the second half of 2018, I’d like to reiterate that base rent growth is on track to remain above 3%, in both the third and fourth quarters. Turning to earnings, we have modestly increased our Nareit FFO and operating FFO guidance ranges, incorporating the better performance through the second quarter, driven by same property NOI growth. And as a reminder, operating FFO eliminates non-comparable onetime items as well as certain non-cash accounting items, like straight line rent and above-below market rent amortization. And I also think it’s important to remind you, that these non-cash items are expected to total $54 million this year, which at the midpoint – it’s $54 million at the midpoint, which is $0.32 per share. Before turning the call over for questions, I would like to quickly touch on the new lease accounting rule that will go into effect in 2019. Many of you are aware that this accounting change will impact that way REITs will recognize certain internal leasing costs. Some of these costs have been capitalized with leasing activity, but after adopting the new standard next year, these internal costs will need to be expensed. We anticipate the impact to be in the range of $0.06 to $0.07 per share, on 2019 earnings. And while this will impact reported earnings, it does not impact AFFO, or cash flow, and we do not have any intention of allowing this accounting change, which doesn’t have a true economic impact on the business, to influence our structure or compensation strategies. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we now welcome your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Jeremy Metz: Hey good morning. A question for Mac here, just in terms of what you’ve been selling and you’ve sold post quarter. Are you seeing any shifts in pricing or bidding pools? Maybe a little color on the market. And then including the stuff you’ve sold out through the quarter, you’re at around $150 million of sale, this leaves you another $125 million, $130 million to go, to reach your guidance. You still assume a mid-7.5% cap rate, you’ve sold at about an 8% here. So that implies this next level would be closer to 7% cap, is that fair? And maybe, you can just give some color on those assets and what’s driving that better pricing; maybe it’s just simply better assets.
Mac Chandler: Sure. Thanks, Jeremy. On the first half, I think the one change we have noticed is it does appear, within our personal assets we’re selling and in the marketplace that once buyers and sellers are agreeing a price, that transactions are closing. There’s certainly a higher degree and a higher level of certainty that, that is improved, really in the last 60, 90 days. So it seems like assets are clearing, and we’ve found that to be the case. Your question on what’s remained to be sold, we feel confident that we’ll meet our objectives for the year, $275 million. We’ve got about $60 million in contracts that we’re negotiating. And for the remainder of that, some properties are on the market and some we’re preparing to take to market. But we feel, overall, on that blended number is still in line with that plus-or-minus 7.5%. So what’s to be sold, it’s a mix some smaller properties and some bigger properties. But in general, it meets that same strategy of typically non-strategic assets, often those have lower growth profiles, but they’re good assets, and we found a lot of activity there. And probably, more buyers who are putting forth credible offers than we’ve seen recently. So we’re confident in seeing that.
Jeremy Metz: Great. Thanks. And have – following on your remarks, at the start of the call about the best grocers not standing still. Can you talk a little bit about what you’re seeing here in terms of grocers thinking more creatively about future space needs and formats, and your discussion? And then, you’ve obviously, done a number of deals at Whole Foods. Are you seeing any sort of increased activity or interest from them to expand further or try a new formats post-merger?
Hap Stein: I’ll start, and then Mac will probably add. Whole Foods has been much more active since the closing with Amazon on – their store formats are very similar to what they’ve been in the past. From a size standpoint, I mean, we’re still seeing typical public store in the 50,000-square-foot range, Kroger in the 100,000 square-foot range. The Wegmans that we’re opening up in Raleigh and in Washington, D.C. are 100,000-plus. We are seeing a number of the grocers that are trying to fit into more dense infill locations, they’ll show more flexibility. But as far as any major changes to their formats, we’re not seeing that. Obviously, we’ve read a lot about some of the moves that we all have – that Kroger has made as far as their partnership with Ocado et cetera. So there’s a lot of investment in technology, investment in click and collect. And I think they are attacking the business on all fronts, and once again, in many case, that also involves adding some new bricks and mortar stores. Mac, do you want to add anything?
Mac Chandler: No. I think there’s a premium placed on location as opposed to prototype. And it appears that grocers are being slightly more flexible than before, in terms of size, sort of plus-or-minus 5,000 to 10,000 feet. But they really value that location that leads to customers. And there are many opportunities that they’re looking at, and we like what we see.
Hap Stein: And we want to make sure that we have adequate space to provide experience, which I think is a – they feel is a key differentiating factor.
Jeremy Metz: Okay. And last one for me, just to spread it around here. Jim, you talked about some shorter term deals are giving more rights here. As I look at your renewals in the quarter, activity-wise, it was pretty consistent. But if I look at the leasing spreads, it was out a little lower. And then, if you look at the TIs, those are almost double your more or less, normal spend. So is this simply a reflection of what you’re alluding to? Or maybe there’s a few larger driving these metrics? Any color there?
Jim Thompson: Jeremy, I think as far as the capital spend goes, I think it’s mostly timing issue. And I think if you look at the year-end annualized basis, we’re going to be in the 10% to 11% of total NOI on total CapEx spend, which is where we’ve been. I think as to growth, we did have a – we had a smaller pool of anchor opportunity. We think, in the second half, we will have more opportunity to recapture some of those legacy anchor deals and bring them to market. One example of that is we just executed a lease with Publix, down in Tampa, to backfill a Wal-Mart store. And that we took that rent from $4 to $16 per square foot deal. So again, I think, at the end of the day we think we will be on the spread side in the high single-digit, which is consistent with our strategic plan.
Hap Stein: And our net effective rents are mid-double digits like 15-plus percent. And I’d also say, and I don’t want to come across as being defensive here, but it is interesting to note, that over the last five years, Regency’s rent growth appears to be middle of sector. However, last five years, our NOI growth is at the top of the sector. And things like embedded rent growth that is getting us there, and less exposure to some of the bankruptcies and tenant failures, so you got to add it, altogether. And it is hard comparing comparability both internally, year-to-year, on what space may come up, what we consider for rent growth and what others in the sector may. So we feel really good, as Jim said it, about our increase in net effective rents. As Lisa indicated, the base rent should increase by over 3% in the second half of the year, we’re on track to do that, and continuing to achieve 3% NOI growth, for this foreseeable future.
Jim Thompson: Hap said that so well. I hate adding something – a little bit more on detail and granular. But I don’t – but, Jeremy, if you’re referring to Page 19 disclosure, in our sup, where we have our TIs, I just want to remind you, we have the new disclosure last quarter. And we did disclose it, we told you it was an abnormally low level. So I believe, for new leases, our total spend is in the $16 foot range. And I just wanted to even remind you then that, that would not be – that was abnormal. And that wouldn’t be the case going forward, and it we’d be more in the $30 to $40 per square foot range, which is where we were this quarter.
Jeremy Metz: I appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
Katy McConnell: Good morning. This is Katy McConnell on for Christy. Since one of your recent dispositions had a former toys box, can you talk about how buyers are underwriting box vacancies? Or even just at-risk tenant exposure when evaluating specific centers today?
Mac Chandler: Sure. I’d be happy to. For the particular asset, this was pretty unusual. So what we did is we actually gave this buyer some time to actually find a replacement tenant and they did. And it allowed us to maximize our price, allowed them to pay more for it, and they were actually able to get a tenant, get a real estate committee approval and get a lease in hand. And we thought that was a win-win in both sides. So they backfilled it with the Burlington. And in every case, it is different – different, case-by-case, as to how acquirers are backfilling boxes, but we thought that was a smart strategy, so it worked out well for us. But that that’s how that happened there.
Hap Stein: And it is indicative though, that the buyers today are more discerning, they are more risk-averse, but I think this is also indicative that even though we’re selling based upon non-strategic, lower growth profile, these are still pretty decent assets that we’re targeting for sale. And they’re not out of the middle or the top part of our portfolio.
Katy McConnell: Okay. Great, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Craig Schmidt: Hi, good morning. Is the higher construction costs impacting the future redevelopment yields – some of the things that you addressed happening going forward?
Mac Chandler: I would say that the current projects that we have and the imminent projects, we have priced in the construction increases that we are all seeing out there. And this isn’t a new phenomena, this has been going on for last couple of years. As you get further out, two, three years, it is harder to project construction costs. But most industry think that the last two years are abnormally high and construction costs are going to start to moderate at some point, and go back to traditional levels of inflation. But I wouldn’t say that is a reason for our yields, it’s a summation of incoming costs, it’s everything. And I think we’ve done a good job of managing that. You can tell by our in-process projects outlay, that are coming in as underwritten. And I think we do a lot of work and accurately forecast what our costs are.
Hap Stein: The – but the deals are still penciling out in – on the basis that make compelling sense.
Craig Schmidt: Great. And then, I believe, in your presentation, it says that nearly 20% of your tenant base is restaurants. Is that where you’d like to be? Or would you like to take it higher, or possibly, even lower?
Mac Chandler: 20%, we’ve been kind of in the high 15% to 20% for a long time. And that feels like – that feels like that right space to be. I think it is a bit self-governing between anchor requirements and parking – reality and the ability to park to the customer. So we think that’s kind of the sweet spot, and we like the place we are right there.
Craig Schmidt: Perfect. Okay, thank you.
Mac Chandler: Thanks, Craig.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Rich Hill: Hi, good morning guys. I want to come back to, maybe, some of your prepared remarks. Maybe talk about the slowdown that is being implied by your same-store NOI guide. You guys have generally done a pretty good job of being cautious. So if you could just give me, maybe, a little bit more color around how you’re thinking about that. Is there anything specifically driving that? Or is it just you wanting to be a little bit more cautious, and make sure that you’re really seeing signs of infection before moving things even higher?
Lisa Palmer: Sure. And I will go right back to my prepared remarks and reference those. But first, I want to start with, because this is also in my prepared remarks, that we are seeing really solid base rent growth, which is the primary driver of our same property NOI growth. And that, for the year, is at 3.7%, year-to-date. We will see that come down slightly as a result of, again, in my prepared remarks, I mentioned the tougher comps on the completed redevelopments in the latter half of last year, but still north of 3% for the second – for both – in both the third quarter and the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter we’re going to see more of a slow down because we have the major redevelopment at Serramonte coming online with rent commenced by then. So we feel really good about the fact that we’re going to have a full year with base rent growth north of 3%. The other items there are some timing issues involved with those, and a big one is recovery income. So the timing for cam recovery is really related more to last year. So this year was much more typical. Last year we had a major merger that we were integrating, and the reconciliation timing was a little bit unusual for the year. So we’re seeing a little bit of a drag in the third quarter for that reason. And then in the fourth quarter of this year, we will see a drag from real estate tax recoveries, if you will, and assessments and the recovery for the income for that. As we expected, when we merged with Equity One, we knew that our properties, and specifically, in certain states, like California, would be reassessed. And those are coming in. And they also go back to the date of the merger, so it’s a little bit of a double hit. So in the fourth quarter, we’re going to have a significant impact on same property NOI as a result of that. We recover a lot of it, but we can’t recover all of it. And then, we have other income – was more front end loaded in 2018 versus 2017, and they’re really the main drivers.
Mac Chandler: And that – from a narrative standpoint and from an anecdotal what’s really happening with the underlying fundamentals, this does not reflect that we’re seeing a moderation fundamentals between the first half of the year and the second half of the year. It’s just the items that Lisa articulated.
Rich Hill: Got it. That’s very, very helpful. And maybe one question, follow-up question, maybe expanding up on their risk return on invested capital. Have you guys thought about – I’m sure you have – have you done an analysis on densification opportunities across the portfolio? Obviously, there’s a lot of talk about this, particularly, with autonomous over the next five to 10 years. But I’m curious if you think there is specific, or even, general densification opportunity that could help you drive growth even further.
Hap Stein: I think that Mac articulated three major redevelopments that are underway. And you can kind of summary review those again, we’re – very, very exciting redevelopments. And I think three of them involve some sort densification, or they’re in infill – dense infill locations. Plus, a couple of more that were backed behind those.
Mac Chandler: Yes, that’s exactly right. We, as part of our day-to-day business, we’re constantly evaluating our portfolio for densification opportunities. And in many cases, we’ve seen actually, really just prescribe to us, additional entitlements, even [indiscernible] and they’re doing that to encourage housing, and as part of their general planned update. You can’t access them all right away. Oftentimes, it takes the expiration of an anchor lease. And so we note that when that happens, and we start to plan ahead of that. So we’ve done that with quite a few people, but they’ll – there will be a sort of our methodological approach to it which will happen over time. But we definitely think there are some opportunities. And our teams are keenly focused on that.
Hap Stein: And as we stated in the past, we have hired a Senior Vice President of Mixed-use that works directly with Mac, who has extensive experience in the multifamily sector. And I will say that we’ve got great properties, some with great potential. But these , especially, vertical mixed-use projects are complicated, they’re challenging, they’re easier to talk about that to make happen, they take years to create and bring fruition. We try to rightsize and have a very practical approach. We’re making very good progress on a number of these, but to underestimate what’s involved, and making them successful – anybody doing that, it would be mistake, because there’s not a [indiscernible]
Rich Hill: Thank you, guys. I appreciate all the different color.
Hap Stein: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Mike Mueller: A couple of questions here. First of all, on the extra lease accounting items for the expense. Where – what’s the geography of where that’s going to shop in the income statement, going forward, in 2018?
Lisa Palmer: That will be in G&A.
Mike Mueller: Okay. And then it was touched on before with the rent spreads, and I know there was a high single-digit number that was thrown out there. If you go through and you strip out the impact of the repositionings that you were talking about, and just look at the spreads minus that, would they be in the upper single-digit, close to the double-digit level?
Lisa Palmer: I’m not sure we fully understand what you’re asking.
Mike Mueller: So your rent spreads are mid-single digits.
Lisa Palmer: Right.
Mike Mueller: And you went through – there was a bunch of caveats as to they moderated. If you would take the repositioning aspect of that out that was weighing on it, would that, all of a sudden, if you had no redev in there, would your spreads be closer to that double-digit level?
Michael Mas: Mike, This is Mike. I’ll jump in here. There’s really, in this particular quarter it really is a mix issue. We are seeing some active leases that we’re signing in anticipation of potential repositioning. Oftentimes, these are happening two to three maybe, four years in advance of when we start a redevelopment. That’s how long it takes to position some properties for redevelopment. So to answer your direct question, in the math this particular quarter, not seeing a lot of material change in how you slice and dice that particular population. But we are seeing an impact of lease spreads metric when we make some of these decisions. And on trailing a 12-month basis, what’s important is we are posting a lease metric number that is in excess of what we did this quarter. And as Hap mentioned earlier, our net effective rent spreads are in the 15% range, which we feel really good about.
Mike Mueller: Got it, okay. That was it. Thank you.
Hap Stein: Thanks, Mike.
Mac Chandler: Thanks, Mike.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Chris Lucas: Good morning everybody. Just a quick question on the – follow-up on the same-store NOI guidance for the back half of the year question. You mentioned a number of items that are contributing to the expected deceleration. But I guess, more – the question I have is really more about rent commencement and timing. You have a pretty good handle of that. There’s been a number of your peers that talked about permitting issues that they’ve experienced and the timing issues that are going into the uncertainty they have with the back half of the year. What are you guys seeing?
Lisa Palmer: We do have a pretty good handle. And trust me, Chris, I ask that question pretty frequently. On what – really, the main drivers are the anchor rent commencements that are expected to happen in the back half of the year. And we feel really confident and good in our projections to when those will happen.
Chris Leavitt: Not that…
Chris Lucas: Okay. And then just a quick follow-up…
Lisa Palmer: Not that there’s some risks that it could flip, but we…
Hap Stein: Or it’s not taking a while to happen, but we feel pretty good of the timing that we’re projecting.
Chris Lucas: Okay, thanks. And just a quick one, I missed the earliest – or the beginning of the call. So, I don’t know if you touched on this, but the number of the projects either delivered with a slightly higher – well, a couple of projects, either delivered with slightly higher than previously sort of projected yields, or are trending towards higher yields. Anything particular that’s driving that, other than just better rents?
Mac Chandler: In one case, it was actually a reduction in costs. We were able to get back some contingency that was then spent. And the other piece, slightly better rents, so. It isn’t as parts in there, those were specific, and we were glad to see those results.
Hap Stein: That is an example, where we were able to take money from contingencies, where we are planning for these significant increases that are occurring in the construction costs.
Jim Thompson: I mean, if I may, no pressure on Mac or the rest of the team, but we report to our board, quarterly, on the performance of our developments, and have been for the entire time that I’ve been here. And we’ve developed, probably, $2 billion-plus worth of properties. And our actual returns on that $2 billion are pretty darn close to our underwritten return, which is pretty exceptional. So we have – a lot of the assessment to the team and how we underwrite and manage, and actually, execute on the build of those projects.
Chris Lucas: Great, thank you. That’s all I have.
Mac Chandler: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I’d like to turn the call back to Hap Stein for closing comments.
Hap Stein: We appreciate your time. Have a good weekend. And if you get to spend some time with your families over the rest of the summer, good luck and enjoy. Thank you so much for your time and interest in Regency.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to Regency Centers' First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to your host Laura Clark. Thank you. You may begin.
Laura Clark: Good morning and welcome to Regency’s first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Hap Stein, our Chairman and CEO; Lisa Palmer, our President and CFO; Mac Chandler, EVP of Investments; Jim Thompson, EVP of Operations; Mike Mas, Managing Director of Finance; and Chris Leavitt, SVP and Treasurer. I would like to begin by stating that we may discuss forward-looking statements on this call. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to our filings with the SEC, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in forward-looking statements. On today’s call, we will also reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. We provided a reconciliation of these measures to their comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release and financial supplements, which can be found on our Investor Relations website. Before turning the call over to Hap, I would like to highlight to additions to our supplemental. First the enhance disclosure leasing capital on Page 19 and second and additive that outlines the components of NAV on page 30. In addition, we have added a section to our investor relations website for fix income investors. That features a mix income quarterly supplemental. We hope that you find these enhancements valuable. Hap?
Hap Stein: Thanks, Laura. The constant change in the retail business is nothing now the imbalanced and diversions between thriving surviving and losing retailers continues to accelerate. While the high store closures retailers that suffered from a combination of weak merchandising, poor service and overleveraged balance sheets are getting a lot of well-deserved publicity which not getting the appropriate amount of attention is the success of many retailers. All the evidence clearly demonstrates that physical stores will remain a critical component for successful operators. This includes digital retailers that are investing heavily in bricks and mortar and expanding that platform as evidenced by Amazon’s purchase of Whole Foods last year and is recently announced partnership with Best Buy.  Wining retailers are continuing to report strong results offers customers compelling value, service and experience investing in technology and yes expanding into new brick-and-mortar locations. It’s really reported that last year there were roughly 4000 more store openings and closings across almost every category except for department stores. Publix opened over 40 new stores and redevelop another 132-last year. This year TJX plans to open more than 170 locations, Ultra 100 and Starbucks over 900 and these are just a few examples. Although disruption and change have forever characterized the word retail, the importance of having stores conveniently located to neighborhoods and communities with substantial purchasing power will remain relevant. This is why through this accelerating retail evolution Regency is well-positioned because we provide one of the critical ingredients of what retailers need to be successful.  This is evident in the ongoing performance of our portfolio in the company. Year-to-date same property NOI growth was 4%, occupancy is nearly 96%, Regency's in-process development and redevelopment continue to perform well, four premier centers were required, we executed on our share repurchase program and successfully completed a 10-year bond offering an expanded our line of credit. Ongoing cumulative impact of the capital recycling program enhances the quality of portfolio through sales, value add development, redevelopment and acquisitions, ensuring we owned the must have locations. Most importantly and specially in this environment our talented team executes our plan while we preserve our conservative balance sheet. We are confident that Regency's unequal combination of strategic advantages will enable us to meet the challenges of the ever-changing retail environment and grow earnings and dividends by an average of 5% to 7% which will approximate a 10% total shareholder return over the long-term. Jim?
Jim Thompson: Thanks Hap. Regency's preeminent portfolio continues to demonstrate impressive results despite challenges in the retail landscape, even with decisions and rent commencement taking longer as retailers more aggressively negotiate terms and carefully evaluate impacts on existing locations our high-quality portfolio is more than holding its own at nearly 96% leased. In addition, new rent growth was 15% for the quarter. We continue to have success executing annual rent bumps setting the table for future same property NOI growth. Our annual rent increases on all leasing activities are at nearly 2%. This quarter we did experience a sequential decline in percent leased in the same property portfolio. This decline was expected as a result of seasonal move out as well as strategic anchor releasing enabling us to remerchandise our centers with top brands, including Whole Foods, HomeGoods and Ultra. Moveouts still remain at very low levels. The impact from bankruptcy in retailer closures continues to be minimal. We had no south eastern grocery locations on the closer list and our five locations, which are significantly below market are expected to remain operating. Turning to toys, as a reminder, we had five locations, which represent 30 bps on pro data annual base rent. We have recaptured four of our five locations one of which we were the winning bidder at auction and the fifth is awaiting final auction in early June. We had a very solid backfill prospects that include HomeGoods, [indiscernible] and Burlington, as well as Publix and Whole Foods. I'm very pleased with our ability to regain control of this real estate and the enhancements these remerchandising opportunities will offer our shopping centers going forward. Lisa?
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Jim. Good morning everyone. I’ll start by providing an overview of this quarter's balance sheet and capital allocation update, and then turn to same property NOI and earnings guidance. This quarter we further enhanced our already strong balance sheet. We achieved very attractive pricing on our $300 million unsecured bond offering and also completed a credit facility recap with an upsize to 1.25 billion. This further expands our financial flexibility. It is this ongoing fortification that has and continues to position Regency to weather future challenges and profit from future investment opportunities. In regards to these future investment opportunities our development pipeline remains solid. However, we did revise development start guidance to reflect the push and timing of two projects that we now expect to start in 2019. Our updated acquisition guidance reflects the four premier acquisitions closed year-to-date with the excellent cap rates on those closed transactions. Disposition guidance was increased as a result of our 125 million share repurchase activity. As we mentioned on our previous call, repurchases are a component of our funding strategy and any repurchases will be leverage neutral. As a reminder that strategy is to sell 1 or 2% of low growth assets annually then together with free cash flow which approximates $160 million this year, investing the capital in outstanding value-added developments and redevelopments, high-growth acquisitions for our own stock at compelling pricing.  Turning to same property NOI I'm extremely gratified by another strong quarter of same property NOI growth of 4%, driven primarily by base rent growth. Performance in the first quarter was slightly better than expected and we have therefore revised our same property NOI guidance range to 2.4% to 3.25%. Consistent with what we previously communicated we feel it is prudent to maintain a conservative approach for potential additional retailer fallout. Therefore, as a result we are maintaining our projection for higher move out levels than experienced last year.  In addition, a deceleration and the positive impact coming from redevelopments in the second half is contributing to a moderation in same property NOI growth throughout the rest of the year. And now turning to earnings guidance, operating FFO guidance was increased to recognize the slightly better performance in the quarter and NAREIT FFO guidance was revised to reflect some noncomparable items that will occur in the second quarter. These include the one-time payment for the early debt redemption associated with our bond offering and a $1.7 million termination expense to recapture the Toys “R” Us lease at auction. These charges will be offset by more favorable interest rate on the new bond offering and the requirement to recognize income from the non-cash below market rent associated with the Toys “R” Us leases that were terminated.  That concludes our prepared remarks and we now welcome your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Samir Khanal with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. 
Samir Khanal: Good morning, good morning Lisa, can you provide more color on the developments [indiscernible] I know that went down by 50 million.
Mac Chandler: Hi Samir, this is Mac, I'd be happy to take that question. As we mentioned we had two projects that we've been pursuing. The entitlements for both of those are not going to come to fruition this year so we've pushed those out to next year and that's the simple explanation for the reduction in guidance for '18 versus '19.
Samir Khanal: But generally, I just want to make sure that there remain, you haven’t seen any sort of pullback on retailers committing to new projects sort of given the headwinds we face on the retail side right, I mean it's not like these guys are suddenly getting cold feet and are not committing to projects, that's not the case.
Mac Chandler: No, that's not the case, we're very pleased with the amount of activity that's out there, there are many anchors including grocers which most of our projects have, are anchored by a grocer. If you look at Publix, Wegmans, HEV, Sprouts, Lucky, there's a healthy list of anchors that are out there expanding within their existing markets and often pushing into new market as well so. So, we haven’t seen that change, we also feel confident in our ability to continue with our development program, and that will primarily come from three sources. One, within our own existing portfolio so projects such as [market common Claritin], which is Arlington in that case, for example later this year we will start the redevelopment of the office building. Costa Verde is another example of a project that we own [La Jolla] where we’re playing a long-term development that will start in a few years. But plus, also the Equity One properties provide some very unique redevelopments and we are executing on those as well. And then lastly as we pursue new opportunities such as [County Country] that we talked about in the investor call. We think our platforms very uniquely positioned to allow us to capture development and we think there are lots of very compelling opportunities out there. 
Hap Stein: And then one of the other benefits that Mac mentioned is that it appears and all indications are that Whole Foods is expanding at a pace relatively to somewhere where they were several years ago. 
Samir Khanal: Okay, thank you. And I guess my second question is on the cap rates for the disposition pool, I know they went up to 25 basis points, what’s really the function of that is it sort of interest rates or moving up or is it sort of your digging into sort of the non-core or lower quality [ph] assets in your portfolio.
Mac Chandler: What we do sell are non-strategic, non-core assets. So that’s certainly part of it and as the pool of properties change we’re constantly revaluating which ones should make most sense to sell at which time, we looked at this pool and we increased that. And this isn’t new news but we've said over the last plus or minus nine months that cap rates on non-core, especially secondary and tertiary markets have expanded roughly 50 basis points, but we still see adequate market demand and multiple bidders to allow us to execute our disposition plan. 
Operator: Our next question is from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. 
Craig Schmidt: Lately there is been a spread between, market anchor occupancy between you and some of your peers. You have held up better. I just wonder do you think you can maintain this going forward. It sounds like your still little bit cautious on store closings but do you think you can maintain this positive spread that you've demonstrated in the last two years. 
Lisa Palmer: Hey Craig its Lisa. No promises, no guarantees but we feel really good about the quality of our portfolio and the fact that we've been very disciplined and since for as long, really for as long as I been at the company. So, for 20 years really disciplined about capital recycling and portfolio enhancement. So, you heard us say that we don't -- we believe that kind gap if you will is clearly by design and by the actions that we've taken really for again for as long as I have been at Regency and really focusing on continued capital recycling year in and year out and it positions our portfolio at the high-end of the quality spectrum, which allows us to slightly outperform when it comes to its anchor closures. I think, as you heard of say, our strategy -- our point of view is that there are going to be continued store closures, we expect that its incorporated into our guidance this year. But we also expect that with the quality of our portfolio our strategy is to own the [most cap] locations and when stores are closed and retailers are shrinking their actual store base they are still going to keep some stores open. And our strategy is to ensure that we own those locations that they are going to keep open and not only keep open but will be highly productive.
Hap Stein: Or in the case of Toys“R”Us where they are fully liquidating we will be able to replace those locations, more times than not with better retailers.
Mac Chandler: That is good news.
Craig Schmidt: I’m just wondering are -- you seem to have less exposure to the sports authorities and the toys of the world, is that you preparing your portfolio just to remain strong and avoid over dependence on [tenants] who look concerned with?
Lisa Palmer: I mean again, I think it comes back to the very consistent capital recycling so yes. When we are looking at our portfolio and we are identifying properties for disposition that certainly is something that we discuss, we are looking at. And we have been wrong in some cases. We are not going to be perfect. But we would like to try to get ahead of what we believe maybe potential fallout in the future. And we are not perfect but we do like to say the fact that we had limited exposure is by design it's not by accident.
Hap Stein: And there are cases for instance and Jim you can comment on this. We have a Toys Box and that we bought in [indiscernible] and I think that’s going to be the bad news there is going to be good news. So, either we are going to minimize the exposure to those retailers that are struggling but also in certain cases we got a box with a struggling retailer or a potential loosing retailer where we think that there is a meaningful opportunity to upgrade the merchandising that often from a risk standpoint.
Lisa Palmer: And that is also the case, it's not as if we didn’t -- obviously we had sport authorities we had Toys“R”Us. We were able to release those pretty quickly as a result of quality of the real estate.
Mac Chandler: I think the bigger issue is the quality of the real estate, we are not driven by tenancy from a long-term perspective. And as Hap mentioned the average [term] lease we bought out of -- at the auction out of bankruptcy, outstanding locations south the Aventura Mall in Miami with [indiscernible] we actually love this area, as you recall we have a recently completed redevelopment of a Publix just north of the mall. We have extremely deep tenant interest in this site and we are very, very excited about the opportunity to redevelop this shopping center with this adjacent -- the adjacent shopping center with Toys Box on the end. Again, it's turning bad news into good news at very accretive returns.
Craig Schmidt: It seems like we are on the cusp of kind of accelerating mixed use and densification redevelopment opportunities. Have you heard anyone new to help you in that area? Do you feel like you had the team in place?
Mac Chandler: This is Mac again, a couple of years ago, we saw this -- I’m not sure I call it trend but we saw this shift occurring and we hired two really important people as part of our team. One is a gentleman named Rafael Muñiz who's our Senior Vice President of Mixed-Use, he comes from multi family background and also we've hired an in house architect to help us really push our designs to make sure that they are more flexible and they incorporate the ability to add [indiscernible] later, so those were two big hires and then just as we have natural turnover, we're looking for more well-rounded people who can understand all product types and understand really the future where retail's going, so these are incremental changes, but this is not a new thing to us we've been through mixed-use project for really for 15+ years. 
Hap Stein: And our focus will continue to be, to have the capability and mixed- used to in effect be able to harvest the retail opportunity within those developments or within our existing portfolio, obviously it may make sense to partner with an office or an apartment developer with expertise and capital, but our core capability is retail and we got the expertise to take advantages of those opportunities that are there.
Craig Schmidt: Great, thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets, please proceed with your question. 
Jeremy Metz: Hey good morning, in terms of the same-store NOI guide you started the year feeling confident in the upper half of that range, we've obviously seen an acceleration of closings, or at least potential closings here, granted the time maybe an offset, but wondering if you still feel just as confident today in that upper end. 
Lisa Palmer: I'll reiterate what I said on the call, add a little bit more color first the first quarter came in slightly better than expectations which is reflected in the raise on the lower end. And we still believe that it's very prudent in this environment to maintain a conservative level of move outs in our projections. So, we're projecting move outs to be more similar to 2016 than '17. Again, that's what's incorporated into our guidance range, with that said I'll repeat that the first quarter was slightly better than what we'd expected, so reading through to that then you would expect that we still feel really good about achieving our strategic objective of 3% plus and it's what we're really focused on.
Jeremy Metz: Sticking with Lisa and one for Jim, I just wondered if you're seeing any shift in tenant minds in terms of how they're thinking about spaces or willingness to make some long-term decisions here and maybe even comment separately on the tone from your lease discussions have evolved to shop end boxes.
Hap Stein: Jeremy we're really not seeing a major shift in tenant desires for term changes and things like that. We'd see our pipeline continue to be very robust, we continue to upgrade the merchandising mix as we recapture space, when I look out at the landscape as to the basic health metrics that we look at, receivables back debt, rent relief request those are all will within historical norms, so as I look at the landscape I feel very comfortable and confident that we're in good shape today.
Jeremy Metz: Okay, I just one last quick one on the development starts, the shift here you talked earlier about no change to the tenant side of that but has there been any changes in the mindset or demand for municipal on adding more retail, that's driving any of the entitlement delays here. 
Mac Chandler: It's not a significant shift, generally in the affluent communities where we operate, cities are very engaged and so on one hand, cities in most cases promote retail because they need the sales tax, at the same time they are also pushing for quality and design and things are important on the local level. So not a significant shift there, where we generally have great success getting our projects approved but there is no shift in momentum either way. Takes time and we feel we do it right way and ultimately create projects that are very well received in the community. 
Jeremy Metz: Our next question is from Christy McElroy with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question 
Christy McElroy: Just as follow up on some of the comments you made on capital allocation and the context of the buyback activity in Q1, how aggressively are you going after acquisitions today if it all, it looks like there has been a little movement on cap rates on what you’re buying but it’s the strategy right now to hold off on any additional acquisition, focus on buying back stock and sort of waiting for potentially more cap rate moment and more opportunity or are you still looking at [deals].
Hap Stein: Number one I would say, we’re always in the market looking, but having said that, at this point in time indicated by our guidance where we are in relationship to our full year guidance we kind of basically hit the pause button and with the pause button started it made more sense to sell more properties and buy back stock. However, given where we are, we still got a lot of dispositions to do as Lisa indicated, our overall capital recycling basis is to be leverage neutral, so until we make more progress on dispositions then we will figure out do we want to buy back more stock or just kind of hold that point in time because one benefit that we had from our sales today and what we’re projecting is we’re able to sell those properties on tax efficient basis, whether will be able to continue to do that you will be an important component, what’s the impact on be on earnings will also be and we will be looking at. But right now, I think we’re consistent with free cash flow, sales on the upper end, at 2% purchasing about a $150 million of high quality acquisitions and bought back $125 million of stock. And once we’re further along, getting closer to $275 million in more ability then we make on that and we make the decision to make further potential investments to that point in time. 
Lisa Palmer: And obviously that’s currently how we’re thinking about it and maybe it might be good as just to remind everyone because we live and breathe every day. So I don’t want to take it for granted that everybody understands kind of how we approach the business and our business model, have said our goals is to recycle 1% or 2% a year it goes back to my answer to Craig, it gives us the ability to continually enhance the quality of our portfolio part of our business model will continue to be part of our business model and the fact that we, as Mac mentioned have unequaled development capabilities the way we think about it as we have taken that 1% to 2% property sales proceeds with our free cash flow and that’s our source of funds, that’s assuming we can't copy equity market. That’s our source of funds and we are investing all of those dollars combined into developments and then into acquisitions or in this case our stock repurchases. So, net, net we are a net investor and that investment activity actually is accretive to earnings. And that is how we think about it, it is in whole, it is not in individual parts.
Hap Stein: One other comment about in the market as there may be some modest amount of activity, very modest amount of activity within some of our joint ventures. 
Jeremy Metz: Just on CapEx thanks for the additional supplemental disclosures on the executed leases. Just looking at some of the inflow you were at about 55 million for leasing CapEx in 2017, you seem to be running at a similar pace in Q1. But you also had that pick up in TAs and landmark work on the leases that were executed in Q4. Should we expect any anomalies in terms of the pace of dollars spent as those leases commence in the next couple of quarters? Are you expecting similar piece in 2018 versus 2017?
Lisa Palmer: We have been running -- first let me -- just for clarification because it is new disclosure to what we were reporting in the supplemental and the actual committed because there are swings there. It's going to -- it will vary depending on the mix of leases that -- of lease activity that quarter but going forward for new leases you could expect that number to be in the $30 to $40 range and then overall when you blend in with all leasing activity it will be in the $4.50 to $5.50 range. So obviously there has already been some movement from those numbers. And then in 2018, we've been running at about 10% of NOI spend and in '18, we are projecting that we are going to be a little bit north of that, so about 11%.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Richard Hill: I want to maybe go back to the portfolio term for lack of better term and maybe circling a little bit, focusing a little bit more on your ability to source attractive acquisitions this late in the cycle. Is it really more repositioning assets in current markets that you are in or do you think it's -- or do you see opportunities maybe in the markets that you're not operating in and finding the right property in that given market? How are you thinking about that? And how are you able to continually drive your growth through acquisitions?
Mac Chandler: As we stated before we are not actively out there looking to make many more acquisitions through the rest of the year but historically we have sourced acquisitions through really our local offices, our local teams as part of our strategies where with our 19 offices we are in the market. And we know properties even before they come to market. So, it's really a vast network of our professionals and our acquisition teams, so we have got great relationships with brokers with property owners and those people who typically sell properties. And generally, we are in the markets that we already want to be in, there is a couple of markets that we have considered going into, but we haven’t made any commitments on those. We are studying those. But, we have great coverage in the markets that we want to be in and that’s generally been our strategy.
Richard Hill: And then just maybe just one follow-up question, are you seeing any pickup in sales velocity that would allow you to increase your acquisition activity or is it still relatively stable at this point in time. 
Mac Chandler: I would call it sort of -- there is adequate demand to meet our plan. So, hasn't picked up, has been falling off, there are buyers out there and buyers who want to transact, so there certainly isn't -- we're not seeing anything that is suddenly increasing the amount of demand that would cause dispositions to increase. It's steady and it's adequate and we feel good about our plan for the year.
Richard Hill: Got it and so just to summarize all this it's really an up and improving the quality of your portfolio, selling lower quality assets maybe at slightly LIBOR cap rates, but redeploying that capital in more stable growth generating assets. 
Mac Chandler: Yes, the increase in NOI projected growth is a key part of it and it’s the quality of the center and the quality of attendance behind it and often that typically means a better-quality location as well.
Richard Hill: Okay, got it, thank you very much guys I appreciate it.
Lisa Palmer: Lock churn enhancement and we do think that I just want to reiterate, Mac just mentioned it in terms of the NOI growth and those assets that were acquired and being better it really is -- it's a critical part of fortifying future NOI growth for the company. 
Richard Hill: Understood, thanks guys.
Operator: Our next question is from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
Vincent Chao: Hey good morning everyone, just a follow-up question on the discussion side. So, increase that to match the share repurchases in the quarter. So I think it's nice to see the execution on the share repurchase side, but just curious, I would have thought it would have been a little bit more accretive just because the share repurchases are done already and the additional dispositions will take time to close on, I guess, can you give some visibility on that pipeline, [indiscernible] and other demand, it sound like it's pretty similar to what you're seeing in the past, but I guess how much visibility do you have on the 275. 
Mac Chandler: Sure Vince, this is Mac. I'll just give an example, we have $50 million of properties that are under contract, another hundred that are on the market and the balance for getting prepared to take to markets, so we're underwriting in selecting brokers and what not, so we have work to do, we recognize that, but we feel good about the guidance that we've given and we feel we can execute that plan, basically throughout the rest of the year.
Hap Stein: Comment should be kind of pro rata in the second half of the year there's minimal closures in the second quarter.
Lisa Palmer: And we did, there is a little bit of uplift from that activity but you have to keep in mind there's so many other smart little combination of things that come in and out and we did raise our guidance essentially about penny the low end and don't forget we did have $1.7 million termination expenses that was certainly not expected.
Hap Stein: And buying out the Toys“R”Us lease.
Lisa Palmer: And buying out the Toys“R”Us lease, so that is offsetting some of that accretion from the share buyback.
Vincent Chao: Got it, that's helpful, and I'm just curious I mean a number of your peers who are also selling assets have been taking impairments as they bring assets to market, just curious if we should expect that from this pool of assets. 
Mac Chandler: We did have one impairment on an asset recently and it's one that we are intending to sell, it’s a property that we developed in the last cycle to larger property happens to be in the desert here Southern California. I don’t think we will typically see impairments on Regency owned assets, you might see them on Equity One asset only because those were valued at fair market value a year ago as part of the transaction and the basis for each of those properties also includes a portion of goodwill attributed to those and there has always been a year of depreciation. So, it is possibly you might see that on the Equity One properties that we felt were agnostic as to which ones we sell and we said before that our disposition plan is to sell those that are non-strategic, that generally have low growth profile and they are marketable, that the timing is right for selling them. So that’s certainly how we look at it like so much on whether the property has impairment or not. 
Operator: Our next question is from Nick Yulico with UBS. Please proceed with your question. 
Nick Yulico: I actually just want to follow-up on that impairment question, can you just explain, you said it was the one asset mostly related to but was that the asset you said you sold after the quarter for 10 million, is it the 8 million of assets held for sale in the balance sheet, just trying to figure out the impairment relative to the value, because it seems sort of large relative to some of those numbers.
Lisa Palmer: It is primarily related to one asset, it is an asset that I actually have not sold yet, we obviously targeted for disposition and I will try to not to go into any of the details on how impairment policies work but we had a triggering event at that asset with the Toys“R”Us liquidation and that essentially didn’t pass the test. So, we got the impairment, we took an impairment. It is a legacy Regency development, that we started in probably 2006. 
Hap Stein: In a non-target market. 
Lisa Palmer: It just had never, there had not been triggering event, it been passing impairment at this point in time and at this point it does not. 
Hap Stein: And we decided that we’re going to sell it with or without impairments that was not as Mac indicated an overall part of our decision. 
Nick Yulico: But this was not the asset that you mentioned in the supplemental that you sold. 
Lisa Palmer: We have not sold it yet. 
Nick Yulico: And it's not in your assets held for sale. 
Lisa Palmer: It is not. 
Operator: Our next question is from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. 
Michael Mueller: Couple of questions. First, what portion of the portfolio do you still have that you would say falls into that 7.5% cap rate disposition bucket.
Hap Stein: I think when we went through the analysis in investor day we broke down the portfolio and it was non-core assets that were 5% or less. 
Michael Mueller: Got it okay and second question, the Sara Monty redevelopment was completed. So, are there any plans for how your thinking about that asset, is it a long-term hold at a 100% maybe a JV a portion of it to fund development just curious how you are thinking about that today?
Hap Stein: We believe there is additional -- Mac can give the specifics but we believe there is additional upside demand through our [beneficiary] redevelopment as you're aware Mike, it's in an incredibly good location. And there are other opportunities there on the upside on that [shopping center]. 
Mac Chandler: The only thing I would add we are 97% leased now. We've had pretty impressive amount of unsolicited offers from junior tenants who come to us and asked if we can find some way to get them into the lineup because tenants are doing well there. So, we are evaluating those opportunities and I won't be [indiscernible] if we execute on some of those to continue to fortify the property and continue its growth.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Wes Golladay: When looking at the higher move outs this year, is that more a function of anticipated bankruptcies? Are you seeing any lower renewal retention?
Lisa Palmer: Wes there is a projection of estimated move outs, so that we actually have -- we are still experiencing a pretty low level move out, so the actual experience is still at low levels. So, the projection is really across the board its incorporating some potential anchor closure, as well as potential follow up in the shop side.
Wes Golladay: And then when you look to competitively bid on assets and bankruptcy what type of returns do you target? And did you competitively bid on all the toys boxes or any additional one?
Hap Stein: Yes, we were prepared to bid on one other asset at auction and didn’t need to, there was I think a limited amount of term remaining under the Toys Box, so fortunately companies stepped into to start the bidding.
Lisa Palmer: From an approved purchase there was more going into the bankruptcy proceedings, I mean we put a lot of work into, what we think about it in totals from whether our redevelopment opportunities for that space and we underwrite essentially a redevelopment opportunity. And those returns will be in line with the rest of our redevelopments.
Operator: Our next question is from George Hoglund with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
George Hoglund: I was wondering what's your exposure to Sprint and T-Mobile stores?
Lisa Palmer: I don’t know that we have that …
Hap Stein: We will get back to you on that.
Lisa Palmer: It can't be very high, because it's certainly not anything that we have any focus on. But we will get back to you offline.
George Hoglund: And then just in terms of more potential store closings or bankruptcies that come down the line, do you think we get to a point where your decision-making process changes for the long-term of how you think about kind of you know lease amendments to tenants?
Hap Stein: I mean just for instance and Jim can add color to that, I mean, we were approached by Toys to do some renegotiations on the leases and we said thanks but no thanks. So, you're going to always evaluate every opportunity and every conversation with the tenant on some merit but we don't see any trend in that at all especially given the quality of the portfolio that's not to say that there aren't going to be exceptions to that for various reasons but that is certainly not an overwhelming trend, a meaningful trend.
George Hoglund: Thanks for the color.
Operator: Our next question is from Collin Mings with Raymond James, please proceed with your question.
Collin Mings: Hi, good morning everybody. Just two quick follow ups from me, I think just in response to Christy's question earlier on acquisition activity and capital allocation priorities I think I heard a reference to maybe doing more activity in joint ventures, just to clarify did you mean more acquisition opportunities potentially with JV partners, could you maybe clarify that comment and then more broadly remind us how you're thinking about your JV platforms in the current environment.
Hap Stein: We got you know several what I'd call core JV partnerships and we don't see adding to those JV partnerships. However, there's a certain amount of activity that occurs within each of those JVs. I would just reiterate there may be a modest amount of activity some recycling that's going to occur within those co-investment partnerships. Secondly, we do do a decent amount of development in joint ventures and joint ventures meaning we're in the case of town and country where we were brought in by the family that owned the land and owned the property and in the case of Ballard a [bine] institution that wanted our development expertise we came in on a 50-50 basis so they can have a partner you know with real capital and real expertise to help them mine the retail potential there.
Collin Mings: Okay, so really just kind of a continuation of the same strategy that you guys have outlined no change on the margin there, just kind of giving us a heads up that there could still be some acquisitions through a JV platform as opposed to maybe wholly owned, is that fair.
Hap Stein: Yes, but it would be-- from Regency's capital it'll be very modest in and out. 
Collin Mings: Okay and then just last one just going back to the disposition discussion obviously you touched on this in a lot of questions already but as you think about bringing in or starting to bring more properties to market, have you seen any interest from potential buyers any portfolio of your properties or do you think you'll see most of the sales execute more on a one-off basis.
Mac Chandler: Collin I'd say, given what we intend to sell, definitely one up on a one-off basis, given the property geography and the size and the differences between them we will likely execute all these on a one-off basis, maybe I could see a situation where there is two bundled together but nothing like a large portfolio sale.
Collin Mings: Okay, thanks for the time.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we've reached the end of the question and answer session and I'd like to turn the call back to Hap Stein for closing comments.
Hap Stein: We appreciate your time and interest in Regency and hope you have a good rest of the week, thank you very much.
Operator: This concludes today's conference, you may disconnect your lines at this time and we thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Regency Centers' Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd like to turn the conference over to your host Laura Clark. Thank you. You may begin.
Laura Clark: Good morning and welcome to Regency’s fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call. I would like to begin by stating that we may discuss forward-looking statements on this call. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to our filings with the SEC, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in forward-looking statements. On today’s call, we will also reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. We provided a reconciliation of these measures to their comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release and financial supplements, which can be found on our Investor Relations website. Joining me today are Hap Stein, our Chairman and CEO; Lisa Palmer, our President and CFO; Mac Chandler, EVP of Investments; Jim Thompson, EVP of Operations; Mike Mas, Managing Director of Finance; and Chris Leavitt, SVP and Treasurer. It was great seeing many of you in New York at our 2018 Investor Day and we sincerely appreciate the time you spent with us. Since not much has changed since then, we'll be brief today. For those of you that were not able to attend or listen to the live webcast, please reference the replay and presentation on our website. I will now turn the call over to Hap.
Hap Stein: Thanks, Laura. 2017 was truly a remarkable year for Regency, as our people continue to demonstrate that they are the best professionals in the business. I'm extremely proud of Regency's 2017 accomplishments and how well-positioned we are to continue to achieve our strategic objectives. To begin, in spite of the challenges in retail real estate, the team was able to push the same property portfolio to an impressive 96.3% leased and achieved same property NOI growth of 3.6%, which was the sixth consecutive year of about 3.5%. This places Regency at the top of the shopping center sector for both of these metrics. Even though store closures accelerated and expansions of some retailers were more deliberate, we are continuing to experience healthy demand from successful operators. During the year, our team continued to identify and start outstanding developments and redevelopments at compelling yields, bringing our in-process projects to over $0.5 billion. We also further fortified Regency's financial position and in times of market volatility like today, this is a very poignant reminder of why your strong balance sheet remains a critical component of our strategy. In addition, we successfully completed the merger with Equity One, which has met or exceeded our expectations. The merger not only made us a larger company, but a better company and that's the most important thing. To further enhance the quality and NOI growth of our portfolio, we sold a number of lower growth assets and purchased premier centers with superior NOI growth prospects some of which were highlighted at Investor Day. It is worth noting that given the existing quality of our portfolio, Regency's capital recycling strategy is flexible and very modest at an average of 1% to 2% of asset footings. Yesterday we announced the implementation of a share repurchase program. This provides further flexibility to execute our capital recycling plan when pricing is compelling. The impact on leverage should be essentially neutral due to the modest size of the program and similar to acquisitions we will be finding the share repurchases with the sale of lower growth assets. Regency's combination of accomplishments was truly unequaled as evidenced by our superior shareholder returns over the last one, three and five-year periods. As you can imagine, our successes in 2017 in over the last five years had been extremely gratifying. That said, given the ever-changing and challenging environment in which we operate, we fully realize that we can't afford to rest on our laurels. Our commitment to staying relevant and to being best in class will enable our deep and talented team to continue to capitalize on our unequaled combination of strategic advantages to execute our strategy and to grow shareholder value. Lisa?
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Hap and good morning, everyone. I want to start by echoing Laura's comments on Investor Day. Thank you, all for taking the time to join us whether in person or through the webcast. We are thankful for your support of Regency and hope you found the time spend valuable. 2017 demonstrated another strong year of performance as Hap said. Full year results were driven by strong base rent growth of 3.5%, a testament to our premier portfolio. And looking at 2018, there have been no changes to the previously provided NAREIT FFO and operating FFO guidance ranges. As a reminder from Investor Day, operating FFO eliminates nonrecurring items as well as certain non-cash accounting adjustments. In our view, this metric better reflects the operating performance of our business and demonstrates our ability to grow cash earnings. While we will continue to discuss operating FFO with you, we do feel it is important to emphasize that NAREIT FFO is currently the better metric for comparability across the REIT sector, given the standard definition. Therefore, we are asking the analysts community to report NAREIT FFO for consensus purposes going forward. As we've discussed, we believe our unequaled combination of strategic advantages will enable us to consistently deliver same property NOI growth of 3% and operating FFO growth of 5% to 7% over the long-term. With 2017 operating FFO growth of 9% and our projecting growth this year, our two-year compounded earnings growth will meet this objective. Our 2018 same property NOI growth guidance also remains unchanged. At Investor Day, I mentioned that this guidance incorporates some kind of fallout from move outs, store closures and bankruptcies. Since that time, there have been several store closure announcements including Toys are Us and our exposure continues to be minimal. Announcements to-date were incorporated in our guidance. I would like to reiterate that given what we know today, we still expect to finish in the upper half of our 2.25% to 3.25% range, which would represent maintaining occupancy in the 96% area. With Regency’s prospects to grow operating FFO and free cash flow and given our low payout ratio, we increased our dividend, which would represent nearly 6% growth for the full year. As Hap said, 2017 was a remarkable year for Regency with the successful merger and integration of Equity One and another year of impressive results. I can't say it enough; how proud I am of our team over this past year. That concludes our prepared remarks and we now welcome your questions.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instruction] Our first question is from Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.
Ki Bin Kim: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Could you -- in your press release, you guys mentioned some of the heavier anchor leasing driving some volatility in TIs and perhaps rent spreads. Could you provide little more color on that? And if there's anything -- anymore similar items like that in the horizon?
Jim Thompson: Ki, this is Jim. I'll answer that. As you mentioned, Q4 was relatively small sample size to begin with, but we did have high anchor activity, 6% of that activity was in the anchor side, which is about double what we normally expect to see. That equates really to nine transactions on the anchor side. And just to kind of give you a flavor for the quality of those transactions we had to HomeGoods, [Addicts], Ultra and a Michael's. We did have one outlier in Louisiana, which was a negative 59% rent growth. Backfilling a very difficult space and the best news in all of that is that, that asset is now ready for disposition. On spreads, when I step back and look at full year -- in the full year context, we were 8% overall. If you breakdown new deals from shop space, it was a 10% growth and new deal anchor was 12%. When you net out the Hobby Lobby deal from early in the year, we talked about in the Backfill Sports Authority. So, in general, I think rent spreads look pretty good overall. Looking at moderating TI, again driven primarily due to that high anchor leasing activity. Anchors typically require a little higher TI. But in this particular subset, we had some interesting white box work that needed to be performed as well. But overall, I would tell you that the quality of the re-tenanting is first and foremost in our minds and we will continue to deploy capital astutely to ensure we get the best-in-class retailers to re-merchandise our centers.
Lisa Palmer: Just to add a little bit of color, our outlook hasn’t changed. You've heard us say this when we announced the merger at Investor Day that one of the compelling factors in the Equity One merger was a lot of the inherent mark-to-market of near term expiring anchor leases. And we still -- we still see that over the next two to three years.
Hap Stein: And if you combine those with the contractual rent increases that we’re being able to generate as Lisa said, I think that we’re well positioned to achieve our strategic objective of 3% plus same property NOI growth over the long term.
Ki Bin Kim: Okay. And the second question, I appreciate the share repurchase announcement. But if the environment -- the cost of capital environment kind of stays this way, does that change your thinking about underwriting at all or buying anything at all? Even though it’s along your $50 million, does that change at all at a sub 5 cap?
Hap Stein: I would say, like the start of capital allocation and recycling plan is as follows; and we've been real consistent about this. We start with free cash flow. We sell 1% to 2% of lower growth centers and we reinvest that capital into compelling and outstanding development opportunities and acquisitions with superior NOI growth prospects. And we've added what we think is the flexibility to invest with the stock buyback announcement, another compelling investment opportunity and that is to potentially buyback our stock and when it makes sense to invest in stock and repurchase shares in the stock, we'll do that. It could be a very compelling investment opportunity and we're going to do all this in a way that's going to essentially be leverage neutral because I think more than anything else, in a volatile environment, maintaining a strong balance sheet is critically important.
Lisa Palmer: And I'd just emphasize and Hap started with this in terms of being very consistent about our capital recycling strategy. It is an important part of our strategy and we do believe that our outperformance and our operating metrics and our NOI isn’t by accident. And it is important for us to fortify that NOI growth to continually enhance our portfolio. It's something we've done for the past 21 years and we will continue to do that.
Jim Thompson: And we've done it on an incremental basis to where we don't have to do it on a significant basis. And on that incremental basis, it's paid dividends from NOI growth standpoint and from a portfolio quality standpoint.
Ki Bin Kim: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Christy McElroy from Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Katy McConnell: Good morning. This is Katy McConnell on for Christy. Given many of your peers are pulling back on acquisitions in this environment, can you talk a little bit about your willingness to continue to be a buyer today? And can you also talk about any changes you're seeing in market pricing and the buyer pools that are coming to the table today?
Hap Stein: I will start with the cap allocation. As I said, I think we've been pretty clear about this, is when it makes sense to sell our assets and reinvest those proceeds into acquisitions, we'll do that. But we now have the flexibility of rather than doing that it may be more compelling investment to buy our shopping centers. If you look at our implied cap rate today, somewhere north of 6% of the quality of our portfolio, that seems very, very interesting to us. And that's part of the reason that we decided to put in place a stock buyback program and I'll turn it over to Mac to respond to what may be happening in the market for shopping centers.
Mac Chandler: Sure thing. Really what we're seeing is, starting with the A quality centers, the types of centers that we're looking to acquire are still tremendous amount of demand for centers in -- with productive dominant grocers in the best markets. And in part there is really very little supply coming to the market in that we saw that in '17 and probably we'll see that again in '18. So that scarcity is also driving the demand there for the highest quality centers. In the B category, sort of the B shopping centers, transactions are still clearing, but buyers are little more skeptical and little bit of softening there in pricing. Buyers are pricing in some risk, whether that's real or perceived more so than a year ago. And then further down the scale, when you get down to power centers, some further softening there and I'd say fewer buyers in that product type out there.
Katy McConnell: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Jeremy Metz from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jeremy Metz: Good morning, Mac. Just following up on your comments on the shifting pricing environment, especially for the non-core low growth stuff. Any chance you can better quantify how much it's really moved in the past call it 60 to 90 days?
Mac Chandler: Jeremy, it's always a tough question to answer because it's so dependent on the grocer, the market even down to the intersection. And I think, what I would say is as you get -- as you get closer to the larger centers $50 million and above, probably the gap is more so than the smaller less than $50 million centers. So, I don't have a very specific answer but 50 to 75 basis points over not 60 to 90 days, but over say six months, but it's one of those questions that tough to be very specific, we see different shades of demand and transactions in different markets.
Jeremy Metz: No, that's helpful. And then you guys mentioned getting a couple of those toys leases back. Once you get those back, would you look to release those as there is possibly great time, and then just once the mark-to-market on those today in your current configuration?
Hap Stein: Jeremy, we expect to get all our five toys. We expect to get two of them back. Quite frankly toys reached out for a reduction, which we declined and we rather control our real estate and upgrade our merchandising. On one of those locations, we are engaged with a attendant for reletting. The other asset is in Boston, well merchandised center, so we'll look at breaking boxes up. I think the Boston space is a pretty good size box. So, we'll look at all opportunities. What we're looking for is again best-in-class merchants and we'll do we think an astute job of trying to select that backfill opportunity at the right market rate.
Jeremy Metz: Thanks. Probably it's pretty significant mark-to-market out there?
Hap Stein: As you can expect the three-week -- the three we didn't get back, we think there's a significant opportunity the ones that they rejected were the higher rent deals. I think we're 1450 up like 1438 in rent. So, I suspect there may be a little moderation, but it depends on how we end up breaking up boxes or going full refill.
Jeremy Metz: Okay. And last question for me Hap. I know we're only about a month removed from your Investor Day, so not a lot of time has obviously passed. I was wondering if you feel any different today with regards to the retail environment close tax reform? Are you feeling more encouraged today or it is generally same as you did a few weeks ago.
Hap Stein: I think it's too early to tell. Obviously, what we've seen is the way the tax reform is I think it feels like there's more growth in the economy, but we're also saying more volatility in the capital markets, now it's going to play out, remains to be seen, but we continue to see robust demand from the better operators, which I think is good. We didn't say the demand has picked up. It certainly has slackened off. We're 96.3% leased, almost 92.5% in shop space. So, we're starting from a pretty strong position and so underlying fundamentals of the business appear to be extremely healthy.
Jeremy Metz: Thanks for the time.
Hap Stein: Thank you, Jeremy.
Operator: Our next question is from Craig Schmidt from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Jeff: Hi this is Jeff [Benton] for Craig this morning. Just wanted to go back to market transactions for a second. If you look at the Cap rate that you have in your guidance assumptions of 7.25% can you give us an indication of how wide that range could be?
Hap Stein: Mac, you want to answer that question?
Mac Chandler: Sure thing. Jeff, some of it really depends on an asset-by-asset selection. I'll give you an example, when you look at what we sold in 2017, what affected our aggregate cap rate greatly was Westwood Towers and that was really an apartment building tower within our Westwood project in which the lessee had a fixed option to buy the property at a fixed price and so that cap rate actually skewed quite a bit the aggregate just cap rate there. So, when it comes to 2018 it will depend so much -- somewhat on the product mix. So probably too soon to say exactly what the range is going to be but we're seeing good activity on these -- on the properties that we want to sell. It did shift a little bit. As the year goes on, we constantly are adjusting to what we take to market and what clears. So, can't get much more clear at this point. It really is an asset-by-asset selection and they eventual all roll up and that's why we give that plus or minus guidance there.
Jeff: No, that's fair. And can you remind us which geographical regions you want to remain in and growing versus shrink?
Mac Chandler: Sure, and Mac can follow back up on this, but we went through over this at Investor Day in detail and you might -- it might be worthwhile to go back, but we did a -- we worked with Costar to do an extensive market study to look at underlying demographics in the various markets to look at supply constraints and to look at opportunities to have a meaningful platform. And the good news is that 95% of our capital is now deployed in the markets where we want to be long-term and that includes gateway markets, that includes stem markets, that includes growth markets and its a in our mind, it's an 18-hour setting like Atlanta and Dallas. So we've got a wonderful canvas on which to invest in. We did identify, we have identified two markets where it may make sense for us to add a presence too. We're going to be evaluating that in the months to come, but we've got -- the target markets we're in right now where we have a presence where had enough to say grace over if we can find opportunities and ability to build a platform in those other two markets, great. If not, we're going to be fine.
Lisa Palmer: And the other 5% isn't necessarily concentrated in any one market that we're going to be exiting the market per se. When we talk about our capital recycling strategy and our property sale as Hap mentioned, we're targeting our lower growth assets. So, it's an asset by asset selection rather than a market selection.
Hap Stein: Correct, and again it's important to note because a number of those 5% that are in outside of what you might call are core markets, many of those are still really good shopping centers. I think offhand a public center in Tallahassee Florida where public performance is extraordinary and the center is close to 100% leased and we have a number of assets like that, that we can still effectively manage and are still good long-term assets, but they're not in the markets that we identify from a target standpoint. Is there anything you want to that Mac?
Mac Chandler: No, I think that covers it. We haven't made any public announcement of us exiting one specific market, nothing like that. It's really an asset by asset selection as mentioned.
Jeff: All right. Thank you. And congrats on a great year.
Hap Stein: Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question is from Brian [Kaufman] from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Brian: Hi. So just kind of building on the geographical analysis, can you talk about where you're seeing the most demand by region? And then also can you talk about the hardest space to lease whether it's by geography, size or location in the center?
Hap Stein: Jim?
Jim Thompson: We're seeing good solid demand really across the country. I couldn’t really rifle shot any particular weakness or outstanding performance, but across the Board I would say, our demand is there. Within the shopping center there's always -- there's always boxes that are unusual in size and that's when we get creative and create the right box whether we tear down the back portion to create a box that is relevant in today's perspective. But generally, I think we can get pretty creative to make sure that we create the right size boxes for what the market demands today. The other part of our which we went over at Investor Day which we call our DNA analysis and where we had a market study that identified the markets we want to be in. We also did a study of what are the -- where are the corners that we want to be in the trade areas that have the right demographics, right purchasing power average household income, plus population density, the right education level, those factors and supply constraints. And so, our capital is deployed in premier shopping centers that are in great locations throughout the country.
Brian: That's it for me. Thanks for taking my questions.
Hap Stein: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Nick Yulico from UBS. Please go ahead.
Gary Jameson: Good afternoon. This is Gary Jameson with Nick. Just looking at the Hewlett Crossing purchased a bit smaller than usual, but in very dense areas. Should we expect redevelopment opportunity there also with expensive pricing for A quality assets, are acquisitions generally going to centered around redevelopment opportunities?
Hap Stein: Mac?
Mac Chandler: Yeah happy to take that one. In that particular Hewlett project, we're expecting a modest redevelopment that it's not a large scale one that the property and performance work very today. It's needs a little bit of a refresh but not a full blown, one by any stretch. It is a smaller asset, but we like it. It's got great growth. It's in the neighborhood. We think it's got great competitive advantages over the long term. It's very little product in that market. It's got parking, which other street retail doesn’t have. So, we like that a lot. I'd also say that, we love acquisitions where there is a major redevelopment component on it because we compete really well. Some of the institutions don't have the platform that we have and even our peers don’t have the platform that we do. So, we love opportunities like that. Town and country that we discussed at Investor Day is a great example of that and that's where the family that owns it really recognized our platform and our ability to transform the property and that was a significant factor for them when they brought us into their partnership. So, we relish those opportunities to use our platform to our advantage.
Hap Stein: And reiterating on that is from an investment in capital allocation standpoint, priority one, our value add redevelopments and developments and then outstanding acquisitions with superior NOI growth prospects. But value add redevelopments and developments are priority one from where we're going to prioritize the investment of capital.
Gary Jameson: You mentioned Town and Country, is that still looking like it's probably going to be a year out from now?
Hap Stein: Yes, still hoping with that schedule.
Gary Jameson: Okay. And during the Investor Day you highlighted Toys and Sears as the potential occupancy risks and were the two toys rejected in line with your expectations and what are your thoughts on potential closures from the five Sears and Kmart leases?
Lisa Palmer: I'll just take that from just -- higher level and how it's incorporated into our guidance. And Jim is welcome to add some specific color if he’d like. But just reiterating again, the 100-basis point range in our same property NOI guidance of 2.25 to 3.25 does incorporate store closures, move outs, bankruptcies. And the fact that we say that we're comfortable with, we're still comfortable with the high end -- the upper end of that range, which equates to about 96% leased and the fact that we’ve already, we know we've gotten two toys boxes, we’d tell you that yes that was incorporated into our guidance. And the lower end of the range we think is reasonably conservative, but not necessarily what we're expecting in terms of how many of those we might get back. And again, so it's incorporated. In 2017 bankruptcies impacted our same property NOI growth by 20 basis points and our guidance for 2018 incorporates more than that.
Gary Jameson: Thank you, Lisa, appreciate that. Just final question for me, regarding the potential buyback, is this more likely that if you dispose $150 million in assets and there's not an equivalent level of acquisitions that might be funded or is if there's the potential for more disposition sales than that money might be spent on the buyback?
Hap Stein: I don't want to keep giving you the same answer but I will, is that our plan is free cash flow of about $160 million. Dispositions to enhance the quality of the portfolio and our NOI growth rate of 1%, 2% of lower quality asset a year and then we'll reinvest that capital in development first and secondly acquisitions. And now we have the flexibility to substitute in investments in a great portfolio of great NOI growth prospects at compelling pricing and that's Regency’s start and having that flexibility does remind me of a book that one of our Directors, Dave O'Connor mentioned recently that he wants to write at some point in his life which is optionality, is the key to life. And I think that applies -- that flexibility and optionality applies and we have that optionality now. And I think that's important given the volatility in the market and it could be a compelling use of our capital.
Gary Jameson: Great. Thank you and I agree with the optionality comment as well.
Operator: Our next question is from Vince Tibone from Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
Vince Tibone: Hey guys. I was hoping to drill down a little bit more on the occupancy guidance, are you able to provide a little bit more color between anchor and small shop in terms of where you think some of the bankruptcy and store closure risk reside, is it all in the anchor space or is there -- do you see occupancy maybe falling a little bit on the shop side as well?
Lisa Palmer: Move outs and store closure happen across all the spectrum -- the full spectrum of store sizes. And don't expect it to be much different than what we've experienced in the past. So, it really is -- it is almost kind of pro-rata and how you think about what makes up our portfolio. So, we are projecting that lower end of that occupancy guidance is a combination of shop loss as well as some anchor loss.
Hap Stein: But it's important to note as Lisa said earlier in answer to a question, that in the prepared remarks that we hope and we think there's a reasonably good chance we could end the year in the 96% leased standpoint, which would mean we maintain occupancy across the spectrum of anchors and shop space.
Vince Tibone: Okay. Great thanks. And then one more just on, I know it's early, but any specific change in tenant behavior you've noticed since the passage of the Tax Reform Bill?
Jim Thompson: This is Jim. I would say no. You read different articles about some excitement from small business owners, but really, I've not seen any indication of that at this point.
Vince Tibone: Okay. Thanks. That’s all I have.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instruction] And our next question comes from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Steve Sakwa: Thanks. Good morning. Obviously with bond yields up and stock prices down, cost of capital has changed. And I'm just curious, if you guys have changed your unlevered IRR hurdles for kind of both acquisitions and developments?
Hap Stein: In a sense yes, but number one from a development standpoint, our returns on invested capital and our IRR returns are well in excess of whatever kind of cost of capital that you might attribute to that. So that's number one. And secondly, I think it does start with you got a $160 million of free cash flow. We're going to sell 1% to 2% of assets to enhance on a long-term basis the quality of the portfolio and NOI growth and its where do you reinvest that capital? You can reinvest that capital in acquisitions with superior NOI growth prospects or now do you reinvest that capital into buying in our stock? And I think what we're saying is, is we see some visibility to where it may make compelling sense rather than buying acquisitions to buy -- to repurchase our shares.
Steve Sakwa: I guess it makes sense that the unlevered IRR on the stock is better than an unlevered IRR on a Class A asset I guess, you can find in the market today.
Hap Stein: I think there's a good chance that, that might be the case.
Lisa Palmer: But do want to remind you also that, it doesn't appear that we're contradicting what we're saying. We do have an asset under contract and we will on -- we're excited about that opportunity.
Hap Stein: And the other thing that I think we need to keep in mind is that you cannot continue to be in the market. We may be in a situation where we don't buy because we reinvesting the available capital. And as I’ve said, key thing is we're going to essentially do this on a leverage neutral basis. We may be in the market and we’ll stay in the market because it is a volatile market and that may change also. So, we're going to take the capital from the sales and invest that as astutely as it makes sense.
Lisa Palmer: And the acquisition that we have on the contract is the northeast opportunity that we've talked about that we also sell our forward equity offering in December to fund that.
Hap Stein: And that was $70 plus per share.
Steve Sakwa: Okay. And then I guess Lisa I mean you sort of touched on this a bit, so as it relates to just kind of your tenant watch list and things that have fallen out, I realize there's still a little bit of time until maybe the bankruptcy at least early window in the year maybe closes or we get a little bit more finality on that. But just how are you feeling about the things that were on your shadow pipeline or shadow close list or kind of watch list today versus say a month or six weeks ago?
Lisa Palmer: Our outlook really hasn't changed since then. Toys did happen and it was within our expectations, which is why we still feel really comfortable at the upper end of our range for both same property NOI as well as occupancy. And obviously there’s others that will come this year and we're expecting that some will come this year. And our outlook has not changed from a month ago. But as you said Steve, it's still early. Sports Authority did surprise a lot of people with the fact that they gave all of them back. And their best surprise could happen which is why we have incorporated more conservatism into the lower end of our range.
Hap Stein: And I would say Steve, it's a timing issue because long term we're going to be able to refill the boxes even the ones that we haven't closed, whatever the flag may be and more often than not, it will be to a better retailer at better rents not all the time. But more often that will be those things and long-term because of the quality of the portfolio, because of the embedded mark-to-market opportunities and the contractual rent growth that we're getting, we expect to be able to generate 3% plus NOI growth and that is part of our strategic plan. That mean it's guarantee, that mean there may not be little bit of short term pain if some of the stuff accelerates from a timing standpoint, but those tenants that are on the watch list have been on the watch list and if it happens, it's more spread out, we'll be at the upper end of the range this year, but long term that growth rate will be in the 3% percent range.
Lisa Palmer: And if I may reiterate one more time because I enjoy saying it, our exposure is low and that is not an accident. And we really do believe that is a result of our strategy and the consistent discipline that we have exercised in executing that strategy with a very modest amount of sales annually that enables us to keep that NOI growth a very quality NOI stream.
Hap Stein: A cumulative impact is meaningful and if I can follow on, it's also worth noting that we have released well over 95% of the recent bankruptcy spaces that we've gotten back in store closures that we've gone back, which speaks to the quality of the portfolio.
Lisa Palmer: And if can say it....
Steve Sakwa: Okay. Thanks. That's it for me.
Hap Stein: I wish we could say that was it for us. Thank you, Steve.
Operator: And our next question Collin Mings from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Collin Mings: Thanks. Good morning. Just one question for me, just as far as development and redevelopment activities and the platform you touched on, just as you continue to bring additional projects into the mix, can you maybe just update us on what you’re seeing on the cost side? Again, we’re obviously seeing some labor pressure in terms of wages things like that. And just how that's impacting maybe which projects are moving forward with us at this point.
Hap Stein: Sure, Collin. I would be happy to answer that. We're seeing the same cost increases that you mentioned, pretty much everyone is. I think we budgeted for them accordingly. So, we haven't been -- haven't had any tremendous surprises. And if you look at our pipeline that's in process, we've really been able to manage your costs and our returns very well. As you look further down the pipeline, you may see some returns drop a little bit, but when we evaluate whether we want to go forward with those, we look at long term growth, we look at quality and we look at the very encouraging spreads to our development returns versus acquisitions. So, every project stands on its own. Are we going to get let a small reduction in return? Teller project that we believe in long term, probably not, but we're going to let --- we look very hard at every one of those. So, you'll see as we have more starts throughout the year, our returns in aggregate are pretty consistent with past years. What you will see is probably a bigger shift in the mix between redevelopments versus developments. It's probably closer to 50/50 this year. And in past years, it's been more maybe 70/30 development to redevelopment. So that's one of the compelling reasons why we like the Equity One merger this embedded pipeline of redevelopment opportunities and we're very encouraged over the next five years plus as we start some of these projects.
Collin Mings: Okay. Appreciate the color. Thanks.
Hap Stein: Thanks.
Operator: [Operator Instruction] And our next question comes from Chris Lucas from Capital One Securities. Please go ahead.
Chris Lucas: Good morning, everybody. Just two quick ones for me I think. On the Toys, on the three remaining toys that you have, were there any changes to the lease terms as it relates to either lease duration, rents or expense reimbursements?
Hap Stein: No, we did not enter into any dialogue on modification leases. And as I indicated, we would cherish to get our real estate back on the other three.
Chris Lucas: Okay. Thank you. And then I guess maybe more -- a bigger picture context question, I think maybe three years ago on one of your calls, the tenant fallout was essentially historically low. And I guess I'm trying to understand, in the current environment how would you rate the level of tenant fall out compared to a longer timeframe? Or is this a normalized level? Is this an elevated level? Or is this below average over a 20-year period?
Lisa Palmer: If I look really long term, it's still below the long-term average. But over the --with this increased closures and bankruptcies over the past year, it did tick up a little bit. And we are again forecasting it to be slightly higher than last year's levels in terms of as a percentage of your GLA. But long term, at least for Regency that trend was declining and it stayed low and has stayed low and I think that that is a result of the quality of our portfolio. And the fact that we really have, I mean if you go back to mid-2000s and compare that portfolio what we own then to what we own today, we've significantly enhanced the quality of our portfolio and the quality of our tenant and merchandising mix.
Hap Stein: Just further little bit color on that. We are not immune to the disruptions in the store closures that are out there and we don't want to -- anything we say is, so we're not going to be immune to that. We do think that the quality of portfolio and the focus of our accounts and operations team and is reinforced by the recycling, further insulates us from some of that that's occurring out there -- that will continue to occur. And that's what our expectation is, is the normal part of the business
Chris Lucas: Great. Thank you. Appreciate your time this morning.
Hap Stein: Thank you very much, Chris.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing comments.
Hap Stein: We appreciate your time this morning and your interest in Regency and wish that you have a wonderful weekend. Thank you very much.
Operator: This concludes today’s teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2017 Q3  (2017-11-04 09:00:00) =====
Executives: Laura Clark - VP, Capital Markets Hap Stein - Chairman and CEO Lisa Palmer - President and CFO Mac Chandler - EVP, Investments Jim Thompson - EVP, Operations Chris Leavitt - SVP and Treasurer
Analysts: Katy McConnell - Citigroup Craig Schmidt - Bank of America Mike Mueller - JP Morgan Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets Vince Tibone - Green Street Advisors
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Regency Centers Corporation Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Laura Clark, Vice President of Capital Markets. Thank you, you may begin.
Laura Clark: Good morning and welcome to Regency’s third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Hap Stein, our Chairman and CEO; Lisa Palmer, our President and CFO; Mac Chandler, EVP of Investments; and Jim Thompson, EVP of Operations; Mike Mas, Managing Director of Finance; and Chris Leavitt, SVP and Treasurer. I would like to begin by stating that we may discuss forward-looking statements on this call. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to our filings with the SEC, which identify important books factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in forward-looking statements. On today’s call, we will also reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. We provided a reconciliation of these measures to their comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release and financial supplements, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at regencycenters.com. Lastly, we will be hosting an Investor Day on January 11 in New York. Invitations with additional details are forthcoming and we look forward to seeing you there. I will now turn the call over to Hap.
Hap Stein: Thanks, Laura. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are gratified to see that even with the more challenging retail environment, Regency’s portfolio continues to perform well with leasing levels over 96% and year-to-date same property NOI growth of 4%, evidence that Regency’s well-merchandised shopping centers, located in trade areas with substantial buying power, are positioned to attract better retailers, which are actively and selectively expanding their bricks-and-mortar footprint. In the ever-changing world of retail, it remains apparent that a well-located physical presence will continue to be critical to efficiently service customers. Following the close of Amazon’s acquisitions of Whole Foods, Whole Foods is reengaged and actively expanding, again. We believe this is a validation by the world’s preeminent online platform that bricks-and-mortar is a critical component to a retailer success. And winning grocers, retailers, restaurants and service providers want to be located with other better operators in centers conveniently located in neighborhood and communities with strong purchasing power. While certainly not immune to accelerated store closures, in a more deliberate manner, tenants are expanding. We remain extremely confident in Regency’s ability to sustain growth in same property NOI, earnings, NAV and shareholder value at or near the top of our peer group as we benefit from the following. First, owning a high-quality portfolio distinguished by trade areas with superior demographics and barriers to entry, highly productive grocers with average sales of $650 per square foot, relevant merchandising and place making, and a necessity service convenience and value focus. Second, a conservative balance sheet that will be critically important -- will be a critically important advantage in either allowing us to profit from compelling investment opportunities or endure challenging economic and financial conditions. And most important of all, Regency’s exceptional and deep team, guided by our special culture, coupled with our value add asset management development and redevelopment capabilities. Before I turn the call over to Jim, I want to let you know how fortunate we are that our properties and especially our people fared relatively well in Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, and how much we appreciate their extraordinary efforts that enabled us to keep operating and to recover so quickly. Jim?
Jim Thompson: Thank you, Hap, and good morning. As Hap indicated, in spite of store closures that are garnering headlines and a more deliberate pace new store openings, our portfolio continues to perform well as retailer demand for top-quality space remains healthy. In the third quarter, same property percent leased increased 20 basis points sequentially to 96.1%. The majority of this growth came from shop tenants where we experienced a 40 basis point increase in occupancy and at 92.5% leased. New rent spreads during the quarter were over 17% and we continue to have great success negotiating embedded rent steps in our new leasing transactions. Almost all new shop leases include annual rent steps averaging 2.5%. Tenant improvements and landlord work, as a percentage of average rent, continued to be in line with prior years. While move-outs remains at historic low levels, we are certainly aware of the potential for future store closures and are monitoring tenant performance and health. As you know, we’ve been in a heightened retail bankruptcy environment for nearly 3 years. During this time, Regency’s portfolio has continued to outperform posting same property NOI growth in excess of 3.5% with occupancy levels exceeding 96%. Our exposure to tenant bankruptcies and store closures has been minimal. And when we have received spaces back, we’ve had success in re-leasing to better operators at higher rents. We have leased or are in lease negotiation for nearly all of the spaces returned to us, following bankruptcy over the past 2 years. This year alone, out of our 9,000-plus tenants, we have only 21 store closures expected from BK [ph]. While we’re closely monitoring trends and have ongoing communication with our top retailers, our track record demonstrates the portfolio’s ability to withstand and succeed in this ever-evolving and challenging retail environment. I will now turn the call over to Mac.
Mac Chandler: Good morning, everyone. We continue to make excellent progress on developments and redevelopments, which were growing NOI and NAV and enhancing the quality of our portfolio. Our in-process projects are performing well and attracting strong retailer demand as evidenced by gains and percent leased. For example, The Village at Tustin Legacy in Orange County is 97% leased and committed. The majority of our tenants are now open including Starter Bros. and CVS, both of which reported strong brand openings. In addition, our 2 Whole Foods projects in the Northeast as well as our Wegmans project in Metro DC are approaching 90% leased and committed. And at Serramonte Center in the Bay Area, our 250,000 square foot expansion is substantially complete. All six of our new junior anchors have opened, traffic is up and the overall center is performing well. Subsequent to quarter end, we started Midtown East, a Wegmans’ anchored ground-up development in the affluent Midtown neighborhood of Raleigh. Midtown East will be Wegmans first store in the state of North Carolina. Regency’s first-class team continues to source compelling development opportunities and mine potential redevelopments, as starts were in line with expectations. Although the development landscape remains challenging, our industry-leading platform is well positioned to create value for both new development as well as redevelopment opportunities within our portfolio. We look forward to discussing future development and redevelopment opportunities in more detail at our Investor Day. Moving to dispositions and acquisitions. We are executing on our plan to sell 1% to 2% of our assets annually. Through October, we have closed approximately $45 million of properties and anticipate closing on an additional $180 million by only 2018. Looking back, we have been very successful implementing capital recycling to further enhance the quality of our portfolio by supplementing cash flow to fund the development and redevelopment, and reinvesting into attractive acquisition opportunities offering superior future growth. This recycling has resulted in a fortified NOI growth profile with greater long-term value creation and reduced exposure to disruptors, as evidenced by the minimal impacts we have experienced from tenant bankruptcies. We plan to continue to execute on our capital recycling initiatives on a basis that mitigates earnings dilution and the impact from the embedded tax gains associated with our dispositions. On the acquisition front, valuations pricing are strong from the quality centers we own, develop and buy. As you can see from our increased to guidance, we have recently sourced compelling opportunities that meet our high standards for quality and growth, and will match the timing of our targeted dispositions. The centers, which are in various stages of due diligence, are located in our target markets of Seattle, San Diego and New York, all benefit from strong demographics, productive anchors and best-in-class shop tenants. These investments, along with the Northeast opportunity we have mentioned in the past, our valued at approximately $225 million with anticipated closing dates spread over the next several months. I look forward to sharing more details on these premier centers in subsequent quarters after we have closed. I will now turn the call over to Lisa.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Mac. The team posted another really good quarter. And most importantly, I want to echo Hap’s comments, we are so grateful that our team members are safe following Hurricanes Harvey and Irma and that our property sustained minimal damage. And I also want to reiterate our thanks to the team for their amazing efforts following the hurricanes. In the third quarter, we did take a onetime charge of approximately $1.9 million or $0.01 per share related to repair and cleanup work caused by these hurricanes. Consistent with our practice for nearly 10 years, gains and losses in our captive insurance program have been excluded from same property NOI. Therefore, the charges incurred this quarter are excluded from same property NOI and given the non-comparable nature of events, the charges also added back to core FFO. Turning to 2017 guidance. We are maintaining our same property NOI growth of 3.2% to 4% for the full year. The lower growth rate in the fourth quarter is driven by an anticipated decline in percentage rent, driven by a handful of tenants, as well as the tough other income and bad debt expense comp. Although we have experienced a moderate increase in bad debt expense year-to-date, it’s important to remember that 2016 levels were far below historical norms and current projections are more in line with long-term averages. We have also decreased our net G&A guidance for the full year by approximately $4 million at the midpoint. With the merger, we plan to hire 70 new positions, but these additions took just a little bit longer to fill than initially expected. We have now filled these positions and expect next year’s net G&A to be in the $67 million range. Despite this delay in hiring, the merger integration has progressed extremely well. And at $67 million of net G&A in 2018, we will realize the $27 million in synergies. Lastly, we have raised our full year NAREIT FFO and core FFO guidance, reflecting the later timing of our dispositions this year and the lower than expected net G&A expense. This concludes our prepared remarks and we now welcome your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Christy McElroy with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
Katy McConnell: This is Katy McConnell, on for Christy. Can you update us on the timing of anchor commencements, which are largely released at this point, and the CapEx that is involved in backfilling some of that space. And then maybe if you could talk about how you’re thinking about the potential for further tenant fallout as we go into 2018.
Lisa Palmer: Katy, this is Lisa. I’ll let Jim handle more detail, if he wants to add some color. But just from a general perspective, if you think about -- when we look at our same property NOI growth, an important thing that we can see, which you all can see, is that our base rank growth contribution to that in the first half of the year was in the mid-3s and that’s accelerating in the back of the year to the high 3s. And some of that is driven by these anchor rent commencements. So I mean, I think, that that’s one of the key factors. And from the capitals, we’re seeing really healthy net effective rent growth. So even though it is taking some capital to prepare the boxes, we’re seeing rent growth at really, really healthy robust levels.
Jim Thompson: Yes. Katy, the only thing I would add is Sports Authority. We had five -- we have four leased and the fourth one will commence, all of them will commence rent by the end of this month. So we’re in good shape on our relets.
Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Craig Schmidt: I just wondered, in terms of a feeling in the transaction market, it looks like you have a number of high-quality general markets closing soon. Are people more willing to strike deals before the end of the year? Or are you seeing little change in terms of just the cadence and appetite for transactions?
Mac Chandler: Thanks, Craig. This is Mac. There is a typical seasonality that goes with transactions where people do want to transact by the end of the year. I don’t see that being different this year versus past years. But there certainly is a steady appetite for people to transact both on buying and selling, so not a big shift that we’re seeing in that regard. So no, not a whole lot of color to add to that question.
Craig Schmidt: And we are seeing some of the projections for holiday ‘17 that seem relatively robust to past years. Are you hearing any of that same sentiment when you deal with some of the retailers?
Mac Chandler: Well, in terms of retailer expansion, is that you’re talking about, Craig?
Craig Schmidt: No. I just -- are they feeling better? I mean, we’ve heard that Halloween was up this year and that holiday 2017, depending on which estimate, anywhere from 3.5% to 4.5% sales?
Hap Stein: It is early to tell. I think, when you look at the demand, our demand for space continues to be very robust. And that, to me, translates to retailers are doing -- continue to do business and are comfortable growing their business to the better spaces. I mean, they are being more deliberate. They are being more selective. But the successful operators and tenants are continuing to expand at a -- in pretty active pace.
Craig Schmidt: Okay. And Hap, congratulations on the ULI Visionary Award.
Hap Stein: Craig, thank you very much. It -- as you know, in my case, it really does take quite a team.
Craig Schmidt: Yes. Well, it just means that because you’re such a great visionary, you’ll provide excellent guidance next quarter.
Hap Stein: I’ll do whatever Lisa lets me do.
Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of Mike Mueller with JP Morgan.
Mike Mueller: I guess, a quick question on operating trends, meaning the same-store stats and occupancy and everything, really positive in your rent spreads there. Nice and healthy. But it looks like there was some moderation that occurred over the past several quarters, and just wondering what’s the color behind that? Is it just your things are good, but you’re just bumping up against tough comps? Does it feel like you’re in a level -- opposites level or we could see a little bit more on the moderation front? I mean, just any color there would be helpful?
Lisa Palmer: Mike, good morning. I’ll answer on the same property NOI growth trend line, and then I’ll let Jim address rent spreads because I think that that’s -- those are the two areas that would appear to be moderating. I’ll reiterate what -- how I started with my answer to Christy or to Katy in that our base rent growth is actually accelerating throughout the year, so the same property NOI growth moderation that we’re seeing is some noise in some of the other line items. We’re up against tough comps for other income as well as bad debt expense, and we’re expecting a decline in percentage rent.  And some of that -- once translated and transitioned the base rents, so that is driving some of that base rent growth, but we’ll take base rent growth -- we’ll take base rent over percentage rent any day. So we’re not necessarily seeing a moderation in same property NOI growth. It’s just timing throughout the year. I think, as you know, quarterly numbers are not going to be smooth. There is some lumpiness. We feel really good about our guidance range of 3.2% to 4%.
Jim Thompson: Yes. I think as to rent growth specifically, obviously, as I mentioned, our new growth was 17% for new deals and renewals were at 57%. And there’s a couple of things going on in renewal. We had a very large pool, almost 84% renewed this past quarter. Several anchors were embedded in that renewal pool that had flat option renewals which, obviously, drove the average down. When you kind of look at the deals we were able to negotiate, we were at 10% -- we drove at 10% rent growth number, which I’m very comfortable with and is consistent with expectation.
Lisa Palmer: And at the same time, we know that we’re in a really challenging retail environment. And if we can achieve high single-digit rent spreads, we’ll be really happy with that.
Hap Stein: We’ll take it.
Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.
Wes Golladay: Looking at your occupancy, it’s pretty high right now. Are you becoming more selective on who you allow into the center? And how is the quality of the demand overall versus prior years?
Jim Thompson: This is Jim. Again, I think the -- our pipeline is robust, continues to be very solid, so we are seeing good demand. Yes, we are -- we continue to be selective in our merchandising. I think that’s something we’ve taken a lot of pride in over time. So we continue to look for the best retailers in given categories and folks that, we believe, will be relevant in the future in this changing environment, and we’re finding good retail demand at this point.
Wes Golladay: Okay. And then some of the peers have commented on delayed tenant openings. Are you experiencing this to any degree?
Jim Thompson: As Hap mentioned, I think deals are taking longer from start to finish. A lot of negotiations. Good retailers -- know the good retailers and we feel like we’ve got good product and we know good retailers want to be in good product, and what that turns into is a detailed negotiation process.
Wes Golladay: Okay. And then, lastly, the company acquired, Equity One, they used to have a slide in their presentation called 50th birthday of grocery shopping centers, where they would get big upticks in this flat rents for the past 50 years. Are you seeing any of those roll next year or anything that will be meaningful on the new lease side?
Lisa Palmer: Wes, this is Lisa. Just very generally, if you recall, when we first announced the merger and talked about the strategic benefits of the merger, one of the key items is the fact that we believe that it would be accretive to our same property NOI growth, which has proven out. And as a result of the fact that there was some embedded mark to market in the leases, and we are beginning to see some of those. Yes. And more to come for 2018, but expect that we’ll see some more benefit next year.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from the line of from Vince Tibone with Green Street Advisors.
Vince Tibone: The spread between physical and leased occupancy continues to widen in the quarter in a range wider than some of the recent norms. It’s -- this is usually partly driven by some the Sports Authority leases you mentioned earlier, but is that the only reason? And when we expect that spread to kind of tighten to where it has been in the past?
Lisa Palmer: Again, I’ll let Jim give specific color, if he’d like to add after. But we’re at 240 basis points currently, we’re only at 220 a quarter, so it hasn’t increased that much. It would not be related to Sports Authority because those were already leased. So it will be related to some other new redevelopments that are underway because, if you will recall, we’re already 98% leased in our anchor boxes. So it’s 1 or 2 anchor deals, and Jim can talk about those. But we’ve, historically, we’ve been in a range of -- I think maybe once, 1 quarter we’ve had that 150. But we’re typically in the 200 -- 180 to 250 range, so it’s not out of the norm.
Jim Thompson: Right. Lisa hit on it. So it’s predominantly redevelopment with Serramonte being a big part of that, 40 basis points kind of baked into Serramonte. And then, obviously, the new leasing that we’ve done in the last quarter, too, adds to that number. The good news is, obviously, that’s a good tailwind going into 2018.
Vince Tibone: And then one more on just acquisitions. It sounds like all of them this year are going to be in coastal market. Is that solely where you’re focusing your external growth? Or would you consider acquisitions in high -- of high-quality assets in secondary markets? Like how do you think about what is the appropriate cap rate spread between coastal and non-coastal major markets?
Hap Stein: So Vince, as you’re aware, our target markets include not only the gateway coastal markets, but also the standard markets and growth markets, so 24 terrific markets throughout the country. We really, really liked the canvas in which we are able to own, operate, buy and invest. And we would certainly buy and invest in -- and interested in a Raleigh as we would -- or a Denver as we would in a coastal market. Just where these opportunities -- most of which we’ve been able to negotiate on a negotiated basis, which we’re real pleased with. And to a certain extent, there is a difference between markets from a cap rate and from a development return standpoint, but you have other issues related to the quality of the trade area and a trade area with strong barriers to entry and population density and above average household income and a strong anchor, is going to portray pretty strongly in pretty much every market throughout the country, and we’re also looking at what’s the embedded growth rate that’s going to be there. From a development standpoint, it depends on the risk involved and where the project is and when we get involved from a return standpoint. I don’t know if you have anything that you want to add to that, Mac?
Mac Chandler: It’s really a case-by-case basis. It’s really almost more about the immediate trade area and the customers being served and the job growth, than it is the greater metro area. And that’s -- so we’re looking at all these different markets. And by having a local presence in these markets, that really gives us an advantage. Some of these -- four out of five acquisitions that we’re targeting were off market, as Hap said. So we’ve sourced these directly and we think that’s a real competitive advantage.
Lisa Palmer: If I may, and Mike is far enough away from me that he can’t kick me. I don’t want to take any of our material that we plan to share at Investor Day. But we have done a lot of work for what we call our DNA project and would be very similar to what one house on the street has like a tabbed score. And we think that it’s, as Hap mentioned and Mac both mentioned, it’s really important the quality of the center and then that has to actually interact with the quality of the market. And we do have internal guidelines and thresholds and return thresholds related to those scores, if you will. So we do look at it that way and we will share more detail when we have are Investor Day in January.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Linda Tsai with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Linda Tsai: In your opening remarks you discussed how Whole Foods is expanding post acquisition by Amazon. Do you have any color on how these stores might be different from when the stores were just owned by Whole Foods? What’s the Amazon influence, if you have any thoughts there?
Mac Chandler: Well, it’s -- Linda, this is Mac. It’s pretty early and they’re not -- they play their cards very close to the vest by design, so we don’t have a lot of great color to give you. What I can tell you is we’ve been working on a redevelopment in suburban Virginia, very good quality location. They confirmed that lease. They had time to think about it. They recently stepped up to it. So we’re seeing good positive signs about that, a lot of good body language, but you’re not going to get a lot of details at this point. But we have close relationship with them and their teams and their brokers throughout the markets, and they are engaged. So we’re working on future opportunities, but still too early to say if their format is going to change dramatically. We hear lots of little things, but we haven’t actually seen anything physically.
Hap Stein: The Amazon acquisition of Whole Foods is a really good thing for Whole Foods. They’re reengaged. They’re expanding a combination, I’d say, robustly, but still on a very rational basis. So we feel very, very good about future prospects to continue to do business with a grocer who is a terrific anchor as far as attracting better shops, retailers, restaurants and service users.
Linda Tsai: And then any changes in the average length of leases that are being signed?
Mac Chandler: I’ve heard discussion about that from my friends in the industry talking about, but more on the mall and fashion, et cetera, but we have not seen anything to date with the community neighborhood retailers.
Operator: It appears there are no further questions at this time, so I’d like to pass the floor back over to Mr. Stein for any additional concluding comments.
Hap Stein: We appreciate your interest and your involvement. And hopefully, you didn’t stay up too late watching the World Series last night and your team won or enjoyed what was a great World Series. Thank you very much. Take care. Enjoy the rest of the week. Bye-bye.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s teleconference. Again, we thank you for your participation and you may disconnect your lines at this time.

Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Regency Centers Corporation Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Laura Clark. Thank you. You may begin.
Laura Clark: Good morning and welcome to Regency’s second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Speaking today on the call are Hap Stein, our Chairman and CEO; Lisa Palmer, our President and CFO; Mac Chandler, EVP of Investments; and Jim Thompson, EVP of Operations. I would like to start by stating that we may discuss forward-looking statements on this call. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to our filings with the SEC, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. On today’s call, we will also reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. We have provided a reconciliation of these measures to their comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release and financial supplements, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at regencycenters.com. I will now turn the call over to Hap.
Hap Stein: Thanks, Laura. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. Yesterday afternoon, we reported another quarter of solid operating results, our high quality portfolio shopping centers located in affluent and dense infill trade areas continues to perform well. Leasing levels are nearly 96% with small shop leasing surpassing 92%. These healthy fundamentals produce year-to-date same property NOI growth of 3.5% and fortify future sustainable growth. When combined with our development and redevelopment expertise, fortress balance sheet, and exceptional team, all of which were only made stronger with the integration of Equity One. We are well-positioned to achieve our strategic objectives and create value for our shareholders. At the same time, we remain very mindful that the retail landscape continues to change, including the ongoing evolution of the grocery industry. Amazon’s announced purchase of Whole Foods reinforces our conviction that a well-located bricks and mortar presence that is convenient to the customer is a critical component to the success of any omni-channel platform. The best grocers, which anchor the vast majority of our centers, are more focused than ever on advancing their own technology, pricing and shopping experiences to service their customers and grow revenues and profits. They benefit from extensive and irreplaceable platforms in our target markets with average sales of over $650 per square foot and healthy occupancy cost below 2%. We will certainly not be immune to the changes occurring in the retail business and are keenly focused on the disruptors facing us today and those that we might face in the future. We have a proven track record of successfully navigating and even profiting from industry challenges and we will continue to adapt and make decisions that will enable our retail centers to not only survive, but prosper over the long-term. We are prepared to own, operate and invest in a world where the bifurcation between the winning and losing grocers and retailers will accelerate as will the growing separation between the better shopping centers and everything else. That said, Regency’s unequaled national portfolio, where the best-in-class retailers will want to locate the physical stores, disciplined capital allocation strategy and experienced elite team position us extremely well for the future. I will now turn the call over to Jim.
Jim Thompson: Thank you, Hap and good morning. The quality of our portfolio and our team is truly evident in our second quarter results. Portfolio occupancy remains at historically high levels that we experienced a slight dip in overall occupancy driven by one anticipated anchor move-out. Our same property portfolio remains at nearly 96% leased. What I am especially pleased about is our shop occupancy, which jumped back above 92% and represents an impressive 30 basis point increase sequentially. We continued to experience steady demand for space from a wide variety of tenants across many categories, which include value retailers, fast casual restaurants, fitness operators, pet stores and service users among others. While retailers are being more deliberate and selective with their expansion plans, they continue to seek out the better locations, many of which are at our well merchandised centers. Leasing spreads on new deals in the quarter were 14% highlighted by strong anchor spreads of 26% and shop rent spreads over 12%. Regarding bankruptcies, our exposure to store closures remains minimal. Announced 2017 store closures represent only 20 stores in our portfolio of over 9,000 tenants. We have successfully re-leased or in lease negotiations for 95% of the anchor spaces we have received back over the past 18 months. Our second quarter results very limited exposure to bankruptcies and store rationalizations as well as our success in re-leasing locations that do close collectively demonstrate the differentiation of the Regency platform and leaves us confident in our ability to produce sector leading NOI growth and operating fundamentals. I will now turn the call over to Mac.
Mac Chandler: Thanks, Jim. Our development and redevelopment activity remains robust as we sourced compelling opportunities within our target markets and portfolio. Our in-process projects now exceed $600 million of developments and redevelopments with the expected returns of nearly 7.5% creating significant value that will drive future growth. During the second quarter, we started Mellody Farm, a $100 million ground-up development located within a highly affluent suburb of Chicago. The 250,000 square foot center is anchored by strong lineup featuring Whole Foods, REI, Nordstrom Rack and HomeGoods. Pre-leasing the best-in-class restaurants and service providers is off to an impressive start. Our development team is making significant progress on several exciting redevelopment projects within the portfolio. At Costa Verde in La Jolla, California, we are progressing with our approvals to densify the shopping center to take advantage of the vibrant growth in University Town Center. At Market Common Clarendon, located in Metro Washington DC, we are working well with the community towards repositioning the existing office building to attract the new retail and creative office tenants that will enhance the overall center. We also continue to make progress within our now integrated Equity One portfolio, including Westwood Shopping Center located in Bethesda, the Collection at Harvard Square in Cambridge and Potrero Center in San Francisco, just to name a few. I look forward to sharing further details on these as well as other exciting opportunities on the future calls. Turning to disposition activity, demand for the properties we are selling remained steady across all markets. As a reminder, we would use disposition proceeds to fund our new investment activities. As our development and redevelopment spending ramps up through the remainder of 2017, our disposition should as well. We are maintaining our previous guidance of $100 million to $200 million of dispositions. In regards to acquisitions, we remain under contract with the Northeast opportunity we have mentioned in the past. This is an acquisition of an exceptional ground-up development that we will close upon construction completion and anchor rent commitment. This opportunity may close late this year, but appears more likely to close early next year. Lastly, we are currently evaluating several compelling acquisition opportunities located entirely to target markets. In any of these opportunities, we could further enhance our portfolio quality and NOI growth profile. I would now like to turn the call over to Lisa.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Matt and good morning all. In addition to solid operating results from our high-quality portfolio and an impressive roster of in-process developments, we made enhancements to our already sector leading balance sheet by extending our maturity duration and lowering our overall effective interest rate. During the quarter, we completed a successful reopening of our 10-year and 30-year unsecured notes that we originally issued in January. We opportunistically raised $300 million across the two tranches to retire high coupon mortgage debt, preferred stock and pay-down our line of credit balance. While this offering was completed in the weeks following the news of the Amazon Whole Foods merger, which as most of you know led to significant volatility in the equity markets. It is important to note that we experienced minimal impact to demand or pricing. We were extremely gratified by the support shown from the fixed income investment community for Regency’s platform and our high quality and well located portfolio. A quick note on the merger/integration, the team has made exceptional progress highlighted by our operating results including a meaningful increase in shop space percent leased during the quarter. We are well on our way to achieving the $27 million in merger related synergies that we have originally projected. Turning to guidance, as a result of retiring secured mortgages, we incurred one-time costs of approximately $12 million in the second quarter. We will also expense the non-cash preferred issuance charges of approximately $2.5 million in the third quarter. This is related to the redemption of those deferred securities. These one-time items will reduce net income and NAREIT FFO per share by approximately $0.09 for the full year as reflected in our revised guidance. And additionally we have revised our net interest expense guidance to reflect these transactions. As Mac discussed, our disposition timing is tied to our investment spending needs and the majority of our dispositions are now expected to occur in the second half of the year. Due to this later than originally projected timing and therefore greater than expected contribution to NOI from these target dispositions, we have increased the bottom end of our core FFO guidance range. And also related to investment spending we have extended the maturity of our outstanding forward equity issuance to the end of the year as this better aligns the timing of the forward equity with our future funding needs. And finally given the solid results in the quarter and year-to-date, we are reaffirming our 2017 same-property NOI guidance as we expect this positive momentum to continue for the remainder of the year. That concludes our prepared remarks and we now welcome your questions.
Operator: We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Christy McElroy of Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
Katy Mcconnell: Good morning. This is Katy Mcconnell on for Christy. Could you provide some more color on the new development projects out of this quarter as far as pre-leasing demand and yield expectations relative to the rest of the pipeline and then just given halfway through this anchor, can you talk about any changes you expect in terms of the store build out following the merger?
Mac Chandler: Sure Katy, this is Mac. I would be happy to take that. We are very pleased with the progress of that project. We have been working this project for a number of years. The return looks very solid at a 6.9% return. And that’s in part because of the team we have had on place. We were able to obtain a $20 million and attract four very good quality solid tenants. Whole Foods is our anchor of submission, REI, HomeGoods and Nordstrom Rack are supporting it. Whole Foods is doing everything we have asked them to do. They are – they will be prepared to commence with their store once we deliver it. We are still upgrading at this point. But the shop leasing is going well. We have had a lot of demand. We are negotiating over 25,000 square foot – square feet in leases right now. So we like the progress, it’s still very early. But all signs point to a successful project. And I think that’s commensurate with the quality and the type of tenancy that we are looking for in other developments.
Katy Mcconnell: Okay, great.
Hap Stein: And regarding the impact on Whole Foods from the purchase by Amazon, we feel that it should be very positive for Whole Foods. We expect it would remove any uncertainty about new store openings. It appears like it’s going to allow Whole Foods to reduce their cost and be more price competitive. And obviously, Amazon’s direct and indirect industry presence will continue to grow. They are paying over $40 million a store, so we don’t expect them to do anything that would appear this wonderful brand Whole Foods has. So we don’t expect it to be convert them to 40,000 square-foot warehouse. But I am sure they are going to use some of the store to – for pick-up, delivery etcetera from an Amazon standpoint. And lastly I think it reinforces our conviction about the importance of retailers being able to conveniently service their customers through bricks-and-mortar. It is and it remains the most efficient way to deliver the last mile.
Katy Mcconnell: Great. And are you seeing that other grocers are thinking about new development projects differently today as a result of the Amazon deal?
Hap Stein: No, I mean it’s still early in the process. But we are working with several best in class grocers who are expanding and they are sticking to their expansion plans sometimes in market where they exist, sometimes new markets, but we haven’t seen a shift in strategy or execution at this point.
Katy Mcconnell: Okay, great. Thank you.
Hap Stein: Thank you, Christy, Katy sorry.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nick Yulico of UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Nick Yulico: Yes. Thanks. Just wanted to see at this point of the year what could push you to top or low end of your same-store NOI guidance?
Lisa Palmer: To your point that we are fairly halfway through the year and as you know at 3.5% year-to-date same-property NOI guidance puts us – I mean [indiscernible] same-property NOI growth puts us just below the midpoint of our guidance. So for this latter half of the year to even get to the midpoint would suggest that we are expecting some acceleration which is the case as redevelopments come online and also more a rent paying occupancy from the bankruptcy the bankrupt boxes from last year that we leased. So that plus if we have less than expected tenant fallout would put us towards the high end of the range. And the low end of the range would be if we have more than expected tenant fallout. But we have – we believe we have a fair amount of tenant fallout assumed in our guidance.
Nick Yulico: Okay, that’s helpful. And then on the – in the disposition market, I am wondering if you had noticed any changes there that may encourage you to sell even more assets?
Hap Stein: No, I wouldn’t say that. I would say certainly nothing would change our plan. For the better properties, the higher quality ones, we don’t think cap rates have changed really in the last couple of quarters they have held very solid. There is still a lot of competition for the best assets. For as you dropdown on the quality scale, cap rates have expanded on the real small markets and the weaker properties. But all-in-all, it’s pretty steady out there. There is a lot of demand. Buyers are able to get equity and source debt and pretty solid all we are at and [indiscernible] for the product we have.
Lisa Palmer: And I would like to reinforce how we think about dispositions as part of our business model. Disposition are a source of capital for us. First, we have free cash flow which is projected to be north of $150 million for this year to fund our development spend. After that we will use dispositions. And as we spoke about in our prepared remarks, we have been able to use our free cash for our development spend to this point and we will be selling properties to fund the remainder throughout the year. And to the extent we do have an acquisitions team in place. We don’t incorporate new acquisitions into our guidance. But to the extent that we are able to find a compelling opportunity we would increase our disposition guidance to fund that especially in light of the equity market today.
Nick Yulico: Okay. Thanks every one.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Hoglund of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
George Hoglund: Yes. Can you just provide a little bit of color on the change in development yields on the countryside shops in Point Royale?
Hap Stein: Sure I would be happy to. Our countryside shops the difference in yield is settled backtrack. But really the increase is in costs. And so last quarter we had written it as the first phase of the project. Now we have underwritten it to increase it by approximately $5 million to include a second phase of the project which is something we are going to go ahead with. So that’s the difference, it’s not cost first, it’s a scope increase and it’s not optional phase. Point Royale is a little bit different. Point Royale, the difference in yield has to do with, in the prior quarter we posted a return on a non-incremental basis, so on this quarter we posted as an incremental basis. So it’s the incremental NOI divided by the project costs, which didn’t materially change, that consistent with how we underwrite all projects and unfortunately last quarter we had used a different Equity One’s underwriting criteria for that one.
Lisa Palmer: Just a little more color, I think as you heard us speak to in the prior calls and Mac specifically talked about it. We took of a really hard look at every in process Equity One redevelopment that we bought on March 1 and re-underwrote if you will with applying Regency’s underwriting. And we just have different methods and as Mac said unfortunately in the supplemental last quarterly we applied their original underwriting rather than our own even though we have already done the work, so it’s just an oversight.
Mac Chandler: You might have also noticed that the projected cost of Serramonte came down about $5 million. Now that we have a chance to really full get arms around that.
George Hoglund: Yes. Thanks. I appreciate the color. And then can you just also talked about either a watch list or whether sort of categories you may be looking at more closely for the back half of the years any things kind of on your radar has changed in the past couple of months?
Jim Thompson: Georges, this is Jim I will answer that one. No real surprises on the watch list on this year’s toys are us, the Office Depot, Stables categories. But we continued to closely monitor other deteriorating categories, yesterday’s apparel, casual dining and obviously the general department stores, but at the end of the day we continued to strategically evaluate those spaces, we have proactive re-leasing spots in place and we collect, we are prepared should we get that space back to react appropriately.
Hap Stein: Yes. And more often than not, a couple of things happen. Sometimes when the store closures, we have the kind of locations that are the must keep locations. Secondly, we have longer term leases. And thirdly more often than not bad news and abating good news, so not that we are immune, not that we are not – can’t be negatively impacted, but more often than not long-term it’s a positive thing for the merchandising the portfolio.
George Hoglund: Thank you.
Hap Stein: Thanks George.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.
Ki Bin Kim: Thank you. Good morning. Could you talk a little bit more about some of the longer term projects that Equity One had Westwood Complex, Potrero Center, I know I jumped in the gun here, but any early thoughts on scope or yields on those projects and maybe you tie that into kind of changing landscape in retail and how that impacts your views on those projects?
Hap Stein: Sure, we would be happy to take that. Look, let’s take one at a time. Westwood is a project that we are very excited about and we are digging that very carefully in [indiscernible] with existing giant who would love to be part of a redevelopment property. So we are change – we have changed sort of the mix of the project to reflect market conditions. And right now we are evaluating that considering selling some air rights to builders who want to do town homes, apartments or seniors or some combination of the three. So it’s slightly different mix. We are probably suggesting less retail than Equity One had proposed. But we really we think at the end of the day, this is dynamic location. With a giant that has very well that will be part whatever future project that we ultimately decide on. And we also think because of the underlying entitlements, we should be in a position to start that project late next year. So coming together, but we don’t have at this time anymore to announcing that. I will say let’s jump to Potrero, that one is one of the longer range project. In any event it’s going to take 3 years to 5 years to entitle it even with the great underlying entitlements that. We changed architects in that project and worked in the midst of setting all the different potentials. There is tremendous amount of density available to us. And we are not quite ready to make any announcements on that one. That’s gong to take longer for us to ultimately program and ultimately approve. So I would plan on something like that for 3 years to 5 years from starting. Our recollection at Cambridge, that’s more of a near-term project, it takes three steps to get the entitlements. We are through the first step and that we are working on the second step which is the planning commission. That should be in a position to start late next year as well. And that’s a little more straightforward where we know it’s going to be a combination of retail and office. And will redevelop some of the buildings and then raise and rebuild others to create a cohesive project in a terrific location. So larger that overall changes that on the landscape apartment. We are still very disciplined about the amount of shops that we propose, about the anchors that we suggest. And we are only working with the best in class tenant. We have recognized that when you bring in other uses such as multifamily, it takes some time to find the right partner and we are patient about doing that. And we want to make sure our risk adjusted returns are appropriate. But at this point we don’t have really good guidance on those returns because we are still evaluating a lot of different possibilities.
Mac Chandler: And I would just say Ki Bin that in our view and obviously I think you guys see through the headlines but at the same time the retail landscape has changed, it’s the changes accelerating, but we still feel that highly productive grocers, restaurants, service users, fitness, pet and working where there is room, big box users with best in class retailers like T.J. Maxx, HomeGoods, Nordstrom, Ross and Ulta it remains a compelling combination that makes sense today and it’s going to make sense for the foreseeable future, but the retail landscape and our tenant mix is going to continue to change and evolve.
Ki Bin Kim: Okay. Thanks. And what do you think it’s the end game in maybe 5 years of how the grocer landscape looks like and I almost don’t care what the grocers are saying to you, but more so what do you think, do you think this is less grocers in the market, at this time curious on how that looks like in your view?
Hap Steins: Well, number one, I think it does start with Kroger, Publix, H-E-B, Wegmans are really good operators. They have extensive irreplaceable platforms that are conveniently located to the customers. And they are focusing on not only technology and click and collect, for instance, Kroger in 2015 had zero-click and collect locations they call a quick lift and they have I think its 700 today. So these changes are rolling these out. But they are also focused on enhancing pricing to be competitive. And they realize that they got to provide an exciting store experience. But what’s going to happen is the weaker change are not going to be able to compete, not going to be able to invest the capital and the same time something stronger operators are to be unwilling to invest capital in the weaker locations. So we feel, they are going to face challenges, but these changes when you think about it and you look at the challenges that Walmart, I mean Walmart 15 years ago had de minimis market share and they have what is 25% today and these chains are still surviving. They have adapted. They have got better. So they will be 40,000 grocery store locations that are out there – our plan is that take 15%, 20%, 25% are going to be closed in the next 3 years to 5 years with the locations that we have are ones where $32 million in sales, $650 per square foot over where bad news is going to be good news.
Mac Chandler: And occupancy costs less than…
Hap Steins: And what actually was cost less than 2%.
Ki Bin Kim: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
Vincent Chao: Hey, good morning everyone. Just sticking with the grocer topic here for a second, I was just curious I mean Amazon buying Whole Foods, clearly is going to cause some changes in the overall space, it sounds like you are not really seeing any changes in execution or strategy as of yet, but just from your opinion amended do you think that and you mentioned the click and collect for the one retailer, but do you think on net that the grocers have invested enough in the sort of omnichannel world and are they going to play catch up for a while and do you think they have the margins to what sort of to pay for all that?
Hap Steins: Kroger has and I mean the comments that we made is that in general there are still supermarket, grocery chains that are expanding. Whether that’s in the case of Publix, in the case of Wegmans, they are continuing the pace. In the case of Kroger they have announced that they are going to take the capital that has been invested in store expansion, investing that in technology. We think that’s a good thing for us, it may make the development opportunities that get less, we feel like we are going to get more than our fair share. But I think they have recognize and are making significant investments. Sometimes it makes impact their store expansion, but they are going to invest in technology, so they cannot only compete with Amazon/Whole Foods, but they can also compete with Walmart, they can also compete with all these and they also can compete with Lido.
Lisa Palmer: I think it’s important to note that my opinion I think shared by those around the table. The purchase of Whole Foods by Amazon didn’t change the end game. Amazon was intent on figuring out the grocery business. And the operators that operated in the grocery industry they knew that as well. So they had already – there were already talking about it, already strategically thinking about how they can compete, how they cannot maintain their share, but also grow their share in this new ultra competitive environment. The only thing that changed is potentially the pace of that changed. And I think that they are aware of that. And that when the announcement was made there was no doubt in my mind that every grocery operator called an immediate management meeting and sat down at the table and said what do we need to do differently, what we need to do faster. But the things that they were already focused on competing in the in the world of e-commerce and so these are really sophisticated operators with irreplaceable platforms.
Hap Stein: And Kroger’s click lift and Albertson has a similar program, Publix has a similar program. But these like I indicated Kroger started rolling it out in 2015 this was something that they adapted from their acquisition of Harris Teeter. And that was obviously several years before Amazon’s announcement that they were going to buy Whole Foods. Once again, we are not – the markets, the landscape is going to change, the landscape is going to be more challenging. We are not going to be immune to some of the fall out, but we think that we are very well positioned to not only survive, but to for shopping centers, but to perform real well and there is going to be some opportunities there come out of this.
Vincent Chao: Sure, I wasn’t trying to suggest that I guests who have not been preparing for this, but to the extent that the does accelerate things that that was more the question?
Hap Stein: And it is I am sure [indiscernible] with what Lisa said based upon our conversations those meetings did take place.
Vincent Chao: Right, you would expect that to be the case. Maybe different topic, not that every time when your peers buy the portfolio that you have to have looked at it maybe you did, maybe didn’t, but I was just curious in general, the Prime Store acquisitions that Federal had announced, just that strategy of may be going more specifically after a particular demographic or ethnic group, is that something that you guys are thinking about more seriously or and is there certain markets that that would make sense for you guys?
Hap Stein: Let me say this, we looked at that in past, it is a – and let me say this Federal is a very sophisticated and downward a very sophisticated capital allocators and we have got a tremendous amount of respect for them. And I am sure they will make good on this investment. But we have looked at this in the past and we feel that the best rather having a separate strategy, the best way for us to continue to have shopping centers that are going to grow in a while and they are going to grow and perform as they stick with our strategy and we think part of that we have shopping centers that are in highly large percentage of the Hispanic American communities with large and such center for Asian percentages of Asian populations and we found there is a lot of similarities there and I think we are going to continue to execute on that basis. Mac do you want to?
Mac Chandler: Well, I would say just living in Los Angeles, we are very familiar with the properties there and the opportunity set. And I understand what they are doing, they are trying to get a little better growth and they may accomplish that. But I don’t – I like the strategy we have on a one-off basis where we like neighborhoods with a lot of purchasing power with best in class tenants. So we can continue to execute what we are doing and we think we are – we have the best approach. Of course we feel very comfortable with.
Hap Stein: Best for us.
Mac Chandler: It’s best for us.
Vincent Chao: Right, okay. Thank you.
Hap Stein: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Samir Khanal of Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.
Samir Khanal: Good morning guys. On the disposition that you have the $100 million to $200 million which remains unchanged and it looks like it’s towards the back half of the year, I mean are there any sort of my guess would be these are more sort of Equity One assets or are they one-off assets, are they sort of markets you are looking to exit?
Hap Stein: Well, I would sit there through one-off assets, it’s on our portfolio. We have several properties under contract and somewhat where we are negotiating with buyers. The way in which we select the properties to sell hasn’t changed over time. There are properties where they may have limited growth, they may be in a market they may have some tenants at risk or just ones where we just don’t have the best believes that they will outperform the rest of the center. So we have seen good reaction from the buying community as you put properties under contract. And the plan hasn’t changed, it’s to sell 1% to 2% of our assets. So it doesn’t look like we have sold much today and that’s the fact, but we have several properties where we are coming together in terms with buyers and we expect to execute and hit our guidance y the end of the year.
Lisa Palmer: I think Hap and I were going to say the same thing, but it’s a mix of legacy Regency and Equity One properties.
Samir Khanal: Okay. And then I guess my next question I have is on the Equity One portfolio sort of putting that portfolio side-by-side with yours, just from a internal growth standpoint, is there – where is the opportunity there, do you have opportunity maybe sort of increase just of the annual contractual rent bumps, is there an ability to sort of push occupancy maybe on the smaller shops side or even or maybe increase rent spreads at this point, so I guess where is the biggest opportunity just when you think about it sort of ex redevelopment internal growth standpoint here?
Lisa Palmer: If you recall when we initially talked about the strategic benefits of the combined portfolio when – and then when we closed on March 1, so we initially talked about it. One of the strategic benefits was an enhanced same-property NOI growth rate. It’s hard to exclude redevelopments because that is the piece of it. And then on March 1 when we closed we significantly increased our same-property NOI growth guidance for the year. And that enhanced same property NOI growth for ‘17 and also for the next couple of years is coming from a variety of things. One, Equity One had just done a very good job of acquiring properties that were – that had lease rent rolls essentially with leases below market and so there was just inherent upside as leases are rolling. And we are beginning to achieve some of that. They had done a fantastic job in the very recent past of actually leasing up their shop space, but there is still room and as evidenced by our results this quarter, so some of it’s coming from there. And then they were great operators, but I am a little biased and I think we have got the best team in the business. And I think that we can apply our expertise in the field to enhancing those contractual rent steps. And again increasing occupancy, so you obviously exclude redevelopment, but that’s also a piece of it because I also believe that that best team in the business applies to our ability to create value at these shopping centers. And again the Equity One team had build a really nice portfolio of properties that essentially increased our menu of opportunities to create value. So all of that will continue to enhance our same-property NOI growth for – and for at least the next couple of years and then we will get to a much more stable, stabilized run rate.
Samir Khanal: Okay, thank you.
Hap Stein: Thanks, Samir.
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig Schmidt of Bank of America. Please proceed with your question 
Craig Schmidt: Great, thank you. I wanted to focus on the accelerating leasing volume you guys went from $1 million in the first quarter out of $1.7 million in the second quarter, incredible pickup. I just wonder was it anchor small shops part of new projects or was it mainly re-leasing in existing properties?
Lisa Palmer: Craig, I mean, unfortunately didn’t restate all of our statistics for kind of the comparable larger portfolio. So, a lot of that is just from the fact that we are just larger. The only thing that was adjusted was the same property NOI table.
Craig Schmidt: Okay, great and thank you. And then on the Whole Foods that you own, I mean, there has been a lot of talk and speculation that they are going to use these stores as distribution in pickup and delivery, that may require some changes to the property? I assume that’s an opportunity for you to be able to charge higher rent for any kind of changes they want to make on property sale lease from you?
Hap Stein: I think we have been very accommodating to the grocery stores in the past as far as pickup and deliveries as long as there is not a significant amount of capital involved there and my sense is just reiterate this, because this will evolve over time, but the vast majority of the Whole Foods space is going to continue to be as Whole Foods is today. I would also be – I would be very surprised if they didn’t – that wasn’t the case, but I’d also be surprised if they didn’t take a small portion of that space and devote it to distribution, pickup and delivery.
Craig Schmidt: Okay, great. Thanks.
Lisa Palmer: Thanks, Craig.
Hap Stein: Thanks, Craig.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Wes Golladay: Hello, everyone. Looking at the development across commercial real estate, we are seeing delays on construction due to subcontractor issues and also in some cases finding the right inspector to show up on time. It looks you actually pulled forward the anchor opening of 1 year projects and yields are stable if not increasing. So, wondering if you are not seeing this and how are you mitigating the other risk of delays?
Hap Stein: Mac and the team are really good. I think we are going to look [indiscernible] because unfortunately that is a fact of life these days. Cities have fewer inspectors than they used to and subcontractors have a wide array of job to bid on. So, I think we have budgeted well to account for it, but we haven’t been surprised by the events. So, our schedules and our budgets presume this is going to happen. And I don’t see that will be changing in the future. So, it has been and still is and maybe even more so. It’s scheduling, timing and cost controls are obviously major challenges all the time and historically have been from a construction standpoint and that’s still very, very much the case today. So, we obviously have a lot of focus and the team really has done a very nice job of addressing that issue.
Wes Golladay: Okay, thank you.
Hap Stein: Thanks, Wes.
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.
Ki Bin Kim: Thanks. It’s a quick one. Is selling the Barneys lease a 2018 or ‘19 event and maybe you can comment on the sales productivity in that store?
Hap Stein: We consider all assets as best as far as what goes on our distribution list and where those are prioritized and don’t specifically talk about any assets. And I would answer it that way, no matter what – no matter what assets you asked me about there. I mean, we focus – and I will also say given we don’t want to be driven by the headlines, but given by what’s happening in the business today, you can be assured and you can imagine we have once again thoroughly vetted the full portfolio and we prioritized those assets that have the lowest growth prospects and it makes sense to sell.
Ki Bin Kim: Okay, thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to management for closing comments.
Hap Stein: We appreciate your time and interest in the company and hope that you have and enjoy wonderful weekend. Thank you so much=.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Regency Centers’ First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Laura Clark. Thank you. You may begin.
Laura Clark: Good morning and welcome to Regency’s first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Hap Stein, our Chairman and CEO; Lisa Palmer, our President and CFO; Mac Chandler, EVP of Investments; Jim Thompson, EVP of Operations; Mike Mas, Managing Director of Finance; and Chris Leavitt, SVP and Treasurer. Before we begin, I would like to address forward-looking statements that maybe discussed on the call. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. On today’s call, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. In accordance with SEC rules, we have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release and financial supplements, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at regencycenters.com. Lastly, we request that callers observe a two question limit during the Q&A portion of our call to allow everyone a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. I will now turn the call over to Hap.
Hap Stein: Thanks, Laura. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. I am very pleased with our first quarter results and with the completion of our merger with Equity One. The team has made extraordinary progress integrating the companies. The combined portfolio is demonstrating its exceptional quality with another quarter of being 96% leased and producing over 3.5% same property NOI growth. Our developments and redevelopments continued to perform well. Substantial synergies are already being realized. These collective achievements are reflected in our increased earnings guidance. I cannot overstate our team’s excitement and enthusiasm with the merger and further enhancement to our four strategic pillars. One, we own an unequalled portfolio of neighborhood and community shopping centers. Two, we have an industry leading development platform. Three, our business activity is supported by a fortress balance sheet. And four, we benefit from a special culture in a deep team of talented professionals. This compelling combination will grow cash flow and earnings, which in turn grow NAV, dividends and shareholder returns. Now, I would like to provide some perspective to the current challenging environment for many retailers and the negative headlines that have become part of our daily reading. Although we will certainly not be immune, there are compelling reasons why I feel that the sky is not falling and why I remain optimistic that well-conceived, well-located and well-merchandised retail real estate will succeed in this environment and Regency’s outlook remains extremely bright. During the 4 years I have been in the business, competition, retail bankruptcies and store closures have been integral parts of the landscape. We fully understand and appreciate that technology, particularly online shopping and an overabundance of space are combining with other factors to accelerate store rationalization. As a result, a number of lower quality centers will be losers, centers which will either struggle or not even survive. However at the same time, it is important to keep in mind that winning retailers who excel at being relevant to their customers are continuing to expand at a notable pace as they will need bricks and mortar space to service and sell to their customers. Regency’s portfolio is a balance of shopping centers, where the winners will thrive, centers that are convenient to the neighborhoods and communities with substantial purchasing power and supply constraints and are well-merchandised to other highly productive winning retailers. The vast majority of our threat comes from best-in-class, local, regional and national tenants that offer a durable combination of convenience, necessity, service, value and better shopping experiences. When disruption causes retailers in our portfolio to rationalize their store count, we have often found that our locations are must-keep or if the user vacates, bad news is typically good news as we are able to attract a better user at higher rents. Finally, our experienced team has a proven track record of navigating major disruptions in the cyclical and secular changes in our business. We employ those lessons learned in a rigorous and proactive approach to capital allocation, recycling and asset manager. These factors have all served to reinforce our conviction that Regency’s portfolio has never been better positioned to withstand the challenges and prosper from the opportunities that we encounter in the shopping center business. And there is no better evidence that Regency owns the winning shopping centers that have minimal exposure to recent bankruptcy as well as our substantial releasing success for those sites that did experience store closings. Before I turn the call over to Mac, I would like to acknowledge his added responsibilities for transactions, along with development as EVP of Investments. I will now turn the call over to Mac.
Mac Chandler: Thank you, Hap and good morning. I am pleased to share our enthusiasm for the developments and redevelopments we have in process. They now reflect a total investment of over $500 million, including the additional projects acquired through the merger, which our team had successfully transitioned. Our in-process development and redevelopments are expected to generate returns of 79%, representing significant value creation. Regency’s proven development platform has delivered over $1.5 billion in development projects since 2009, at an average 8% return. Our industry leading development team continues to source compelling opportunities as evidenced by our two latest development starts and we are excited about the opportunities acquired through the merger. During the first quarter, we started two ground-up developments, representing a total investment of approximately $60 million. The Field at Commonwealth is a Wegmans anchored 190,000 square foot center located in Metro DC. Commonwealth will benefit from an affluent trade area with strong demographics, including household incomes averaging $140,000 as well as strong daytime population. Though construction has only just begun, the project is already 82% leased and committed. We anticipate project completion at mid-2018 at 7.5% stabilized yield. Our second development start, Pinecrest Place, is located within a premier infill submarket of Miami, with significant barriers to entry. The 70,000 square foot center will be anchored by a Whole Foods that is relocating from a nearby center and shadow anchored by Target. Similar to Wegmans, we continue to value the quality Whole Foods brings to a shopping center through high levels of food traffic and sales volumes, which attracts the best restaurants and side-shop retailers. Pinecrest is expected to stabilize in mid-2018 at a 7.3% return. Please note that we increased our guidance for the year and now anticipate starting between $175 million and $275 million of development and redevelopment projects. While the best development opportunities are limited and competitive, Regency is well-positioned to capture more than our fair share of future projects given our platform depth, enduring tenant relationships and demonstrated track record paired with our well-capitalized and flexible balance sheet. Turning to acquisitions and dispositions, we continue to control the Northeast acquisition opportunity we mentioned in our previous call, which we now hope to close in the second half of the year. In regards to dispositions, we have revised our guidance to $100 million to $200 million commensurate with Regency’s increased development and redevelopment spend. Importantly, our disposition strategy remains the same as we will continue to sell properties as needed to enhance portfolio quality while also funding new investments whether those are developments or redevelopments at attractive returns or acquisitions of premier shopping centers with strong NOI growth profiles. I would now like to turn the call over to Lisa.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Mac. Good morning all. I have to echo the gratification both Hap and Mac expressed on the performance of our portfolio in the first quarter and especially the efforts of our team in guiding the merger across the finish line. Our first quarter results were highlighted by combined same-property NOI growth of 3.7%, driven almost entirely by base rent growth. It is important to note we are presenting same-property NOI growth on a pro forma basis. The metrics are calculated as if all properties were owned and made the definition of same-property for the full calendar year. We remain highly leased. The combined same-property portfolio is 96% leased with shop space at almost 92%. Taking into account the combination of the two portfolios, there is essentially no sequential change in the percent lease of the same-property portfolio. And in fact, small shop occupancy is up 70 basis points year-over-year. Overall, leasing spreads for the quarter were 8.2% with shop space leasing spread showing continued strength at over 9%. Rent spreads on new leases, in what was a relatively small sample size this quarter, were substantially impacted by one anchor lease in the center that is targeted for sale. Without this one lease, new rent spreads were over 10%. The bottom line is that we continue to see healthy demand when leases expire and we also continue to have success despite the decreasing amount of remaining space left to lease and that decreasing amount is often some of our most challenging spaces. It is also important to note, as Hap alluded to earlier, that 95% of closures from bankruptcies that occurred last year have been re-leased or are in final lease negotiations. Our merger with Equity One closed on March 1 and our team has been focused on a successful integration allowing us to proceed towards our primary objectives of the merger; one, achievement of enhanced same-property NOI growth, two, execution of a larger development and redevelopment program and three, realization of synergies. All of these lead to accretive core FFO results. I am very pleased to report we have made tremendous progress towards achieving each of these objectives and as Hap mentioned, reflected by our revised guidance ranges. The integration of the two platforms has gone very smoothly. We have clear visibility to achieving the $27 million of operational and overhead synergies that we projected. Now I would like to discuss our revised guidance in more detail. We have provided a full update to our guidance that reflects the merged company. Updated core FFO is expected to be $3.60 to $3.68 and NAREIT FFO of $3 to $3.10. NAREIT FFO includes the impacts of the one-time merger transaction costs estimated to be approximately $80 million in 2017 or $0.50 per share. You may recall when we announced the merger, we did communicate that we expected the merger to be accretive to core FFO before the incremental impacts of non-cash purchase accounting adjustments. In our supplemental, on Page 39, we have provided a detailed reconciliation of the impact to core FFO from these non-cash items. It can be a bit complicated, but I will do my best to summarize for you now. Our pre-merger standalone 2017 core FFO guidance midpoint was $3.47 per share. Our revised post-merger midpoint is $3.64. If you exclude the incremental non-cash impacts, adjusted core FFO at the midpoint is $3.53 per share. That represents a $0.06 to $0.07 per share increase of which the majority has resulted from accretion related to the merger. We also increased our same-property NOI growth guidance to a new range of 3.2% to 4%. The increase is primarily driven by our strong first quarter out-performance. I would like to remind you that upon closing, we did increase same property growth guidance by approximately 80 basis points, simply as a result of the expected growth in the Equity One portfolio. Before closing, I do want to call to your attention that next quarter same-property NOI growth could fall below the low end of our range due to the timing of our CAM reconciliations. This is only a timing difference and does not impact full year expectations. That concludes our prepared remarks and we now welcome your questions.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Christy McElroy from Citi. Please go ahead.
Christy McElroy: Just on redevelopment, how are you thinking about some of the bigger, more complex redevelopment and densification projects that had been in Equity One shadow pipeline, sort of in the context of the current environment and maybe if you talk about sort of your approach to sort of development investment in general as you look forward to 2018?
Mac Chandler: Sure. Christy, this is Mac, I would be happy to answer that. I guess the first thing I would say is these Equity One properties, the ones that are sort of the typical ones for redevelopment are all tremendous properties. Very well located, in the best markets, so we are very excited just about the locational attributes. We will take a step back, that’s what our teams are doing now and we are looking at them. The redevelopments could be a straightforward retail redevelopment in which case there is great NOI growth profiles going forward. We are also looking at more complex retail redevelopments and then also mixed use formats. So we haven’t done any of these large projects to determine our path yet, we are still in – considering these various alternatives, but we are going to take a hard look at those in light of the fact that several of these projects take 2 years, 3 years – they take a few years down the road, actually to get entitlements in hand, even though they have great underlying entitlements. So we will look at them just like we have for decades here in our development program. We will look at risks, reward, timing of all that. If we do bring in a non-retail use, we would typically go out and seek the best in class non0retail partners, such as a multifamily developer and we have great relationships with the very best players – partners, who are well capitalized and experienced.
Christy McElroy: But there has been no change in sort of your overall approach to development in the current environment?
Mac Chandler: There hasn’t – no, I mean we are conservative by nature and we are diligent as we look at these projects and we don’t see any change to that. So as projects get closer to being realized, we will look at the current environment at such time, but many of these Equity One projects will take shape in the months and years to come as they flush themselves out of the entitlements.
Hap Stein: And the ground-up developments that we are looking at basically are very consistent with Regency’s strategy, strong anchors, strong demographics and many of them are going to be delivered 2 years and 3 years out. But we also not only have strong anchor sponsorship, but we also have a good inclination – indication from the side shop retailers how the project is going to be well received. It’s not specular development and it involves, Mac alluded to, the same and even more – maybe even a little bit more of a rigorous approach today.
Christy McElroy: Okay. And then just my second question, in the past part of your capital raising strategy have included equity issuance to fund or help fund incremental acquisitions, how are you thinking about your cost of capital today from a funding standpoint given what’s happened in the equity markets, especially, if you think about sort of funding this potential deal in the Northeast that you are working on, how does – and how does that impact your willingness to do deals?
Lisa Palmer: Christy, I will take that. Again, similar to what Mac said about developments, we haven’t changed how we think about, basically sources for our investment opportunities. If you think about how we provide guidance on our business model, it’s not dependent on acquisitions. We do have one that is under our control/under contract in the Northeast, which has been for a while. I will remind you that we have the forward equity that we priced last March, a very nice attractive price of close to $80 a share that we can draw down to fund that acquisition. And then going forward, again nothing has changed, same strategy we have always had. We will access the equity markets when it’s priced attractively. And I think we typically will say it’s not our job to tell you what’s NAV, but I know right now that we are trading at a discount to NAV. I think that’s pretty obvious. So I would not say that our equity is attractively priced today. So today, we wouldn’t be accessing that market. So we would be sourcing from dispositions to the extent; one, to fund our development spend, which is what our guidance incorporates and we do have an acquisitions team and we find it a very compelling investment opportunity which has attractive and future NOI growth profile that is accretive to what we have, so quality accretive, growth accretive. We could potentially increase our dispose to match fund that.
Mac Chandler: But the key point is we do not need to access the equity markets to continue to invest particularly in new developments and redevelopments or to extend any acquisition between free cash flow…
Lisa Palmer: I neglected to mention free cash flow. So free cash flow this year will be approximately $150 million and that is growing at a pretty good pace in future years.
Christy McElroy: Got it. Thanks for the time guys.
Mac Chandler: Thanks Christy.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nick Yulico from UBS. Please go ahead.
Greg McGinniss: Hi, good morning. This is Greg McGinniss on for Nick. 2017 synergies appear to be kind of accelerated from prior guidance, it looks like you are actually achieving $27 million of actual savings versus run rate savings, just wondering how you are able to achieve this goal so quickly?
Lisa Palmer: Actually, it was interesting as we still have some open positions. So as part of the merger, we had to add 65 positions to Regency and we have not filled all of those positions. So our updated guidance does, at the midpoint, we have increased G&A approximately $1 million. And the fact of the matter is, is that on day 1, a substantial amount of the G&A went away. And as we go through the year, we fill those positions we are going to get closer to what will be the run-rate.
Greg McGinniss: And then is there any expectation, I mean, you guys have – I know you only had couple of months to be looking at this merger, but is there any expectation for more savings potentially?
Lisa Palmer: We had pretty rigorous analysis when we actually evaluated the merger and feel really comfortable with the $27 million of synergies. And then going forward, we will see the company grow as it typically would.
Greg McGinniss: Great. Thank you.
Hap Stein: Thank you, Greg.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Vincent Chao: Hey, good morning everyone. Just sticking with the integration and synergies as part of the discussion, do you still anticipate sort of the full run-rate to be in place by the end of the year or do you think that can be sooner?
Lisa Palmer: I think that with our guidance, you will see that we have really already achieved the substantial majority of that $27 million. So, it’s in place and 2018 will be a typical run-rate for Regency.
Vincent Chao: Okay. And then on the integration, you mentioned that was going quite smoothly. I guess, at this point, what’s left either from a back office perspective, you mentioned still needing to hire a few more bodies. I am just curious what’s left in terms of the integration? And then was there any issues in terms of involuntary turnover or anything like that as a result of the two companies coming together?
Lisa Palmer: I will answer the last question first. We really – we are really pleased with the retention of the people that brought – we brought with us from Equity One. Equity One had a great culture and I think that their employees and their team members could see that they were joining a team that also had a great culture. So, hats off to David and Matt and Mike for that and that’s gone extremely smoothly. In fact, we have most of them in the office here today for an event. And in terms of the – what’s left to do, most of it is back office. Again, we do have some hiring to do in the field, but very little because we brought – of the 65 positions, approximately 40 of those were in the field/supporting the field and those people we did bring over from Equity One. The new positions that we had to hire were back office accounting, because we are centrally located here in Jacksonville and their accounting department was in Miami and New York. Offered relocation, we just didn’t have many takers. I can’t imagine why Jacksonville is a wonderful place to live. And – but what’s left is mostly back office. The purchase accounting is really complicated. It involves third-parties. I think, as most of you know, we received our third-party inputs, if you will, after the April 1. So, it’s been a really short timeline and right now, we are still working on it. So, our Q will have provisional purchase accounting. I think we mentioned that in our – you will see that when you read the Q. So that’s what’s left to do. And again, it’s complicated. The team has done tremendously well and really sprinting to get everything finished and integrated and we are really excited about the future of this company.
Vincent Chao: Okay. And just one last question for me on the same-store NOI guide that was increased a little bit from the prior fairly unique versus what a lot of your peers are saying and obviously, you have got the quality portfolio to support that. But I am just curious, what’s being embedded in the future outlook in terms of bankruptcies that we may not have heard about yet or store closures? Just curious if that’s changed at all since your prior guidance.
Lisa Palmer: We have incorporated obviously tenant fallout/bankruptcies, future bankruptcies into our guidance. We – in the first half of this year, we are obviously feeling the effects of the ‘16 – the ‘16 bankruptcies. So, the first quarter, in fact, the impact from bankruptcies was 70 basis points. As we get towards the end of the year, we are going to actually – those leases that we talked about – that I talked about, being 95% released, those will begin to rent commence in the latter half of the year. So, that will help our same-property and then at the same time, we are expecting that we may have some fallout. So incorporated in our guidance is about 25 to 50 basis points of total impact from bankruptcies, flat more or less from the ‘16 and then additional for this year.
Vincent Chao: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question is from Wes Golladay from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Wes Golladay: Hey, good everyone. Can you talk about what’s going on, on the small shop? I mean what are the local tenants doing? We hear everyday about all the national retailers that are struggling on the big box side, but just curious if it’s the exact opposite going on with the small shop tenant with the occupancy picking up nicely year-over-year?
Jim Thompson: Wes, yes, I’ll answer that question. It’s Jim. As we look at our key health metrics for our side shop folks, accounts receivable, bad debt, move-outs, those metrics all remain at relatively low levels, but we are obviously closely monitoring those. Our leasing pipelines continue to remain solid. We are seeing best retailers are making more disciplined leasing decisions, which I think – we think is very good, but it’s also quality, not quantity kind of attitude today. So overall, I think the side-shop program today is consistent to what we have seen in the past.
Hap Stein: Yes, being 92% leased is a historically high level it’s not the highest we have ever been at, but it’s historically high level and I think it is – it reinforces, as you indicated, the quality of the portfolio.
Mac Chandler: The only thing I would add is and Lisa touched on it, I think the production folks that came over from Equity had shared a very, very similar vision to us and both teams have done an excellent job over the last several years on the side-shop leasing.
Hap Stein: Not only leasing the space up, but upgrading the quality of the tenants. In Regency’s case, this is our fresh look initiative and approach.
Lisa Palmer: I feel like I have to take this opportunity to reiterate what I said in the prepared remarks, the fact that on a combined portfolio basis, our shops year-over-year, up 70 basis points is pretty impressive and hats off to the team.
Hap Stein: Yes, we are not taking anything for granted.
Wes Golladay: Okay, yes. And then going back to the bifurcation of the winning centers versus the losing centers, are you already starting to pull meaningful more amount of tenants from the adjacent centers or is it just all people just looking new retailers getting into the market?
Hap Stein: We are primarily expanding retailers, because we have already – for the most part, already attracted a lot of the better retailers, not that we aren’t able to take retailers from other shopping centers, but Jim, I would say, it’s primarily retailers opening up additional stores in the market or going into them.
Wes Golladay: Okay, thanks for taking the questions.
Operator: And our next question comes from Michael Mueller from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Michael Mueller: Yes, hi. Looking at the current development, redevelopment pipeline, it’s about $500 million, 50:50 split between new and redevelopment. If you are looking out over the next say, 3 to 5 years, do you think you will roughly have that same sort of split?
Mac Chandler: Yes, it’s a little early to say that, but what I will say is what you like about Equity One – one of the things we really like are some of these tremendous embedded opportunities within the portfolio. So a good chance that, that could be the case. In many of the specific opportunities, the range of how extensive of a redevelopment you could do varies and that will depend on market conditions, but I would not be surprised if it moves that direction and our teams are setup to take advantage of that. That’s one of the great things about our platform is our development teams are also the redevelopment teams and we are in the field and we are prepared to take those out. So, we certainly would be disappointed if that was the case. We would be equally as pleased.
Hap Stein: Yes. And from a cycle standpoint, I think adding this, as Mac alluded to, having the redevelopments come on, we may see a downturn in ground-up development opportunities and having these redevelopment opportunities will be a great fit for our development program.
Michael Mueller: Got it, okay. And then I guess on Serramonte, I mean how are you dealing that, is that a long-term hold for Regency or at least in the current form or it’s fully owned?
Hap Stein: I will be saying this is, is that obviously, given its size, scope and nature during our underwriting and since closing, Serramonte has garnered a tremendous amount of attention from our market teams and from our top management teams, so let me start off with that. Secondly, let me – which I think is also very obvious, it is located in a very dense area within 10 miles of San Francisco and strategically located between the Silicon Valley and Downtown San Francisco. So it’s a fabulous location with an unbelievable amount of traffic. I think that’s important to note. The center is performing well. Our mall tenants’ stores average $560 per square foot. Target is one of the best stores in the chain for Target. I will also say that the expansion that’s underway with value oriented retailers on the exterior of the mall, like Nordstrom Rack and TJX and Ross is going to be a great addition. You may also note that Dave & Buster’s recently opened up in the center and it’s one of the top Dave & Buster’s in the chain. The Macy’s and the J.C. Penney are two of the best locations in the mall. You may also be aware that Macy’s is closed within – I think, within 5 miles or 10 miles of Serramonte, two of their other stores, there was announced closings of those. And that the J.C. Penney store that they just opened up Sephora and it seems to be anecdotally performing extremely well. So the center is a good center and I think it’s continuing to get better and it’s a good center in a fabulous location and we feel very, very good about its future prospects.
Michael Mueller: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig Schmidt from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Craig Schmidt: Yes. Thank you. Prior to the merger, the small shop occupancy of Regency versus Equity One was separated by about 300 bps, it sounds like you might have closed that already, but my assumption here is that at some point, the Equity One will reach the level of Regency and if that’s the case, how long do you think that takes to achieve?
Jim Thompson: Craig, this is Jim, I will answer that. As I have mentioned, I think we have had excellent leasing progress from both companies over the past several years on the side shop. I think we are obviously operating at high levels closing in on 92%. We think there is probably some opportunity to grow that, but really I think we are nearing full capacity in that side shop regime.
Hap Stein: We are focusing on continuing to increase that, but for us, by far investment partners, our shareholders, they expect anything more than that would not be appropriate. But obviously, the team is focused on taking 92% up to 93%, but any expectation, as Jim indicated would be – wouldn’t be warrant.
Craig Schmidt: Okay. And then just the winning centers versus losing centers, have you ever measured a benefit of maybe sales transfer when you saw a neighboring center close and how – what lift you might have gotten at your own center?
Hap Stein: I don’t think we have measured that. It is going to be interesting to see how this plays out. But I do think there is going to be this acceleration that’s occurring and bifurcation between winning and losing retailers and wanting to own and owning, fortunately shopping centers that are going to attract the winning retailers because they are convenient to the communities and neighborhoods that the winning retailers who excel at being relevant to the customers want to be located.
Craig Schmidt: And do you have a sense of why that is accelerating, because we have been overstored for quite a while now?
Hap Stein: I do think that that the combination of – my sense is and let me say it, it appears like there may be some acceleration that’s occurring and that’s kind of the – what we are believing is going to happen, but there is no guarantee that that will happen and kind of as we have always said, we are not going to be immune to the overabundance of space, e-commerce or retailers are not going to, but we think we are in a very good place to continue to attract the better retailers. And to – and I think a couple of things just keeping it 96% leased, almost 92% side-shop occupancy and as Lisa has now said twice, 95% of the space – first of all, we didn’t experience the bankruptcies – that a lot of the bankruptcies occurred, but that – where we were impacted 95% of that space has either been at signed leases or in final stages of lease negotiations. And one last thing, our ongoing conversations with our tenant customers reinforces our points of view, whether it’s a grocery store, side shop retailers or the value oriented retailers that we work with.
Craig Schmidt: Okay. Congratulations on completing the merger.
Hap Stein: Thanks Craig.
Jim Thompson: Thanks Craig.
Operator: Our next question comes from Linda Tsai from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Linda Tsai: Yes. Hi. Recognizing that your outlook for the impact from bankruptcies in 2017 is low relative to your competitors and this is the result of operating high quality properties, I am just wondering, when you compare the closures that sort of ‘16 versus ‘17, are there any observations you can draw between the types of centers where the closures occurred maybe as it relates to the size of the center or whether it was grocery anchored or are there any other characteristics worth noting?
Lisa Palmer: I mean I will let Jim add, but I mean just thinking about where our Sports Authorities were located last year as well as Eastern Mountain Sports where we had other bankruptcies plus this year’s, I mean it’s – there is really no specific trends. I mean they are across the country. As you know, we are mostly grocery anchored, so most of them are in grocery anchored centers. One thing I can say, it’s going to be in centers with that have secondary anchors because they have got anchor space, but beyond that…
Jim Thompson: Yes. Beyond that, I think so far we are seeing more small shop RadioShack and Payless. We have only got two boxes of Gordmans and Overton’s that – and in both of those cases, we had – we are currently negotiating replacement tenants, so we are not seeing the big Sports Authority, which have – had a pretty big impact last year so.
Lisa Palmer: I mean, I will reiterate what Hap said in his prepared remarks and that is that there is going – that’s not just winning – it’s not winning and losing centers, it’s really winning and losing retailers. And our strategy and what I believe we own are the centers where if there happens to be a losing retailer, which Sports Authority was one, bad news is good news. That’s our strategy and that’s the real estate that we want to own. So it’s possible to have a failure in a great center and you know what, we welcome that.
Hap Stein: And we are not losers. We haven’t been perfect. We won’t be perfect. We are going to be impacted, but our track record is pretty gratifying of navigating those issues.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing comments.
Hap Stein: We appreciate everybody’s time and interest in Regency. And I hope that you have a very good day and rest of the week. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today’s teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Regency Centers' Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode and interactive question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Michael Mas. Thank you, you may begin.
Michael Mas: Good morning and welcome to Regency's fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Hap Stein, our Chairman and CEO; Lisa Palmer our President and Chief Financial Officer; Mac Chandler, Executive Vice President of Development; Jim Thompson, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Chris Leavitt, Senior Vice President and Treasurer. Before we begin, I'd like to address forward-looking statements that may be discussed on the call. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. In addition, on today's call we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. In accordance with SEC rules, we've provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their respective and most directly comparable GAAP measures, which may be found in the tables included in today's earnings release. As an added note, we request that callers observe a two question limit during the Q&A portion of our call to allow everyone a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. Finally, please understand that given our pending merger with Equity One, we will be unable to answer any questions related to that transaction and refer you to our filings for the latest information. I will now turn the call over to Hap.
Hap Stein: Thanks Mike. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. 2016 was an exceptional year for Regency on all fronts. As I've said many times Regency's year-end and year-out performance is the direct results are forward thrives and through principles. First, the [Indiscernible] replaceable portfolio at high quality assets driving superior NOI growth. In 2016, NOI growth was a strong 3.5%, representing the fifth consecutive year of growth at or above these levels. Second, the development and redevelopment driven investments strategy executed by an experienced and disciplined team, producing great centers that add meaningfully to our NAV per share; in 2016, we profitably executed on our strategy starting $220 million of high quality developments and redevelopments at attractive returns. Third, a fortress balance sheet that supports our growth, allowing us uninterrupted access to capital at the most advantageous pricing; throughout 2016 and in January of this year, we strengthened our balance sheet even further to the prudent use of capital markets, resulting in one of the most pristine balance sheets in the business. Finally, Regency's talented, dedicated and B team the best in the business. As always, I want to thank my colleagues for their hard work and dedication. The results of their exemplary efforts had led to average growth in core FFO over the last three years of almost 8%, and total shareholder return over that same period at the top of our peer group. Before I turn the call over to Mac and Lisa, let me remind you why we are so excited about our pending merger with Equity One. The transaction combines two high-quality, highly complementary platforms and firmly establishes our position as the premier national shopping center company, with several unique advantages. We will own an unparallel portfolios with an excellent mix of first-class neighborhood and community centers for the growth we anchored focus. As important, this merger deepens our concentrations in affluent and in-field trade areas with strong demographics to attract leading retailers, combined these factors will produce better merchandizing and higher rental and occupancy rates, driving stronger organic growth. Also the two portfolios have significant overlaps in many of the countries, but as attractive metro areas, providing us with enhanced brand presence and economies of scale contributing to the transaction substantial synergies. In addition, considerable value from the unmatched pipeline of development and redevelopment opportunities will be unlocked by our experienced team. The merger preserves our balance sheet strength and flexibility, maintaining our access to multiple sources of capital, at the lowest cost. Results of these compelling attributes will be a diversified cash flow stream with better NOI, better earnings and better NAV growth potential. I cannot overstate our excitement and enthusiasm, and we look forward to closing the merger and creating substantial value for many years to come. I’ll now like to turn the call over to Mac Chandler.
Mac Chandler: Thanks Hap and good morning. 2016 was an impressive year for development and redevelopment. During the year, we started 16 new projects representing a total investment of more than $200 million and a weighted 7.6% return. Despite significant competition for the best projects, we continue to source and execute on compelling opportunities in target markets that enhance our high-quality portfolio. I’ll quickly highlight a couple of our recent developments. In December, we started Chimney Rock Crossing, a 218,000 square feet center located with an affluent New York suburb, anchored by Whole Foods, Nordstrom Rack, and Saks Off 5th. This location will create a true regional drop, creating a dominate center for both best-in-class anchors and shopping center. We took ownership of the property with complex entitlements in place and anchored leases substantially negotiated, which created mitigated risks. The Village at Riverstone located within Houston’s fastest growing master-planned community also started in December. It would be a dominated Kroger-anchored center, aligned with meeting national and regional restaurants and restaurant providers, already more than 80% in Houston community before even start construction. This project will be an outstanding addition to our premier to Houston presence. These terrific new additions totaled more than $100 million of net new investments. At year end 2016, our in process developments and redevelopments represented a total investment nearly $300 million, yielding a blended return nearly 8%. Our ability to continue to execute on these great projects is a testament to our industry-leading national development platform, which is driven by a joint relationship, local market expertise and attractive cost of capital. This is why we are able to consistently source and deliver of the most compelling investment opportunities. As we look forward to 2017, I am enthusiastic about our pipeline. To that end, we have great visibility a couple of first half 2017 starts. The first [Indiscernible] anchored center in the DC market and the second a Whole Foods opportunity located outside of Chicago. In addition, we have other promising opportunities that are progressing nicely in target markets like Seattle, Miami and Raleigh. Likewise, I am particularly excited about the prospects of sharing with you our vision of Equity One's redevelopment pipeline in the months become. I would now like to turn call over to Lisa.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Mac. Good morning all. Our high-quality portfolio continues to perform extremely well. At year end, our same property percent lease is more than 96%, including 93% of shop basis. This is especially impressive given the team's accomplishment in the face of a handful of retailer bankruptcies. The benefit of such a strong portfolio running a historically high occupancy continues to translate in the better merchandizing and pricing color. Leasing spread for the quarter where the mid-teens including rent growth of more than 12% for new deals. This strength and core fundamentals led the same property NOI growth for the year of 3.5%, including nearly 4% in the fourth quarter primarily driven by growth in base rents. But as a reminder for 2017, we do anticipate moderating same property NOI growth impacted by last year's bankruptcy-related store closings. While we've largely backfilled these anchor boxes, the new tenants will be up and running until the second half of this year. Turning to the capital markets, maintaining a fortress balance sheet continues to be the foundational principle for Regency; and as we entered 2017, we have the strongest balance sheet in the Company's history. Subsequent to year-end, we issued our first ever third-year bonds with proceeds of $300 million at a 4.4% coupon. These currencies will be used to fund the full redemptions of our 6 and 5 days percent preferred stock. This issuance and the redemption significantly improved free cash flows and fixed charge coverage. At the same time, we also issued $350 million of 10-year bonds at a 3.6% coupon. These proceeds will be used for certain transaction cost related to the pending merger, including the refinancing of some of the in place Equity One's short-term debt. Importantly, in the unlikely event, if the merger does not close, these bonds include a mandatory redemption option. As a result of the third-year bond offering and the savings from the redemption of the preferred stock, we increased core FFO guidance by $0.02. At the same time, you will also note that we reduced nearly FFO guidance by $0.07 which is incorporating the one-time cost related to the preferred redemptions. More importantly, please note that we've not included any impact of the 10-year offering on the updated ranges and any merger-related impacts are currently excluded from all guidance metrics. We intend to update guidance to reflect the impact of the merger in the coming months. For acquisitions guidance, you'll note that it has not changed from previous disclosure, but I didn’t want to clarify that we do have a shopping center under contract in the Northeast, which we hope to close in the coming months. And as a reminder the majority of the remaining $90 million in the proceeds from our March 2016 forward equity offerings will be used to fund this acquisition. The echo of those have been met, 2016 was a great year on many fronts and we look forward to a tremendous 2017, as we are extremely excited about the prospects of not only closing the merger, but especially integrating and operating the combined company. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we are now open to your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Craig Schmidt from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Craig Schmidt: I wondered if you could comment on retailers appetite to participate in redevelopments, is that interest growing whole in steady or somewhat decreasing?
Mac Chandler: Thanks Craig. This is Mac. I'd be happy to answer that. I think it's steady to just growing, I mean retailers are constantly looking for shopping centers that are relevant, that are contemporary and we have a robust pipeline of active redevelopments, and one step we're working on some in the near future, but some also many years away. So, it's a healthy trend and we feel it's continuing to want to play a part in an active redevelopment.
Craig Schmidt: And then just on transactions. Are you noticing that transaction pace is slowing nationally? Or what should read on transactions for 2017?
Mac Chandler: You're talking about capital market transactions or you are telling about our leasing transactions?
Craig Schmidt: I am sorry, buying and selling of shopping centers. Maybe not that’s so much your outlook, but a national of its staying is active to '16 or slowing?
Lisa Palmer: We haven't seen any material change. And if you think about the arena that we play in, it's a much smaller set on the buying side than national. So, we may not even necessarily see everything that’s coming nationally because I think it's pretty clear to our broker relationships to sell a relationship of the higher quality set we are targeting to buy. But at this point in time, there is still a lot of capital pursuing, the higher quality premier shopping centers, and we continue to see demand for the lower growth, slightly higher cap rate properties, but we intend to sell.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christy McElroy from Citi. Please go ahead.
Christy McElroy: Lisa, I am thinking about the components of your same-property NOI growth in '17, realizing the slower growth rate is mostly bankruptcy related from 2016 closures. What are you assuming for releasing spreads? And has anything changed in terms of pricing power and lease negotiation given the tougher retail environment?
Hap Stein: I’ll start that and Mac or Jim, if anybody wants to add any color after. For same property NOI growth, we do have the headwinds of the bankruptcies we saw that a little bit in obviously latter half of 2016 as well. We also have -- we are also going to be in 2017 comping off relatively higher other income line item, I think you've probably saw that in our actual results of rather large easy payment, actually at one of our future redevelopments that Mac just kind of alluded to. But with regards to rents spreads, it's still really healthy robust demand, and we would expect that leasing spread will be very similar to what we have achieved in the past few years, which is double digit. I think that overtime, you may see us maybe stabilizing the high single digits, but we are still assuming that we are going to have very healthy double digit rent growth.
Mac Chandler: The only thing I would add is, I think at 96% lease we still have -- we're enjoying pretty strong landlord leverage. And with the qualities of portfolio, we feel good to see the spreads are going to maintain around the levels we have been doing.
Christy McElroy: Great, thanks. And then just a higher level, in your comments recent with groceries especially some of these specialty groceries, how often is the topic of on line new tick providers and sort of growth over that business come up in discussion of its future competitive thread, in a contents of sort of the overall thread from e-commerce to grocery?
Mac Chandler: Christy, it's Mac, I’ll be happy to answer that. We heard in conversations, the grocers actually especially groceries are well aware of it, but it's hasn’t dampened their expansion efforts whether desire to open new stores. So, some are trying to do it themselves. Some are outsourcing as we all know. But it hasn’t affected their core business, it's a sort of a unique component of that business, but it's not the first topic of conversation, but eventually it comes up, but it's not prominent in the size.
Jim Thompson: Ironically, they're focused from a new-store standpoint as investment filled in urban areas, which is why there is more off and online competition. So, like Mac said, they're not all mindful of it as we are not, but at the same time -- and they are being highly selective, but it doesn’t seem like it's we still got healthy demand for space.
Operator: Our next question is from Jeremy Metz from UBS. Please go ahead.
Jeremy Metz: I know you specifically can't talk about the Equity One deal here, but one of the attractive aspects is obviously the robust development pipeline, they had a lot of that was mixed used intensifying sites. So, maybe a question for Mac, but I was hoping if you could just more broadly talk about taking on bigger mixed used projects in today's environments, given the increasing pressure on retailers possibly for slowing demand for space and couple of this one is increasing sale and supply we're hearing about?
Mac Chandler: Well, I'll try to answer this in a broad sense I suppose to specifically to Equity One. The best way to perform on big larger scale mixed used projects is [Indiscernible] because you can be thoughtful and patient, and you can wait for the best possible outcomes in terms of entitlement and [Indiscernible] and design. So, those are easier to execute on, and we prefer those a lot. You are still seeing larger scale mixed used projects come out as well, that's apparent, but the trend you see in every major city. But most of those projects were conceived years ago, but there are still many people have equal number of projects that are on the boards and will see if they come out of ground. But the appetite doesn't appear to be accelerating or decelerating, if so pretty stay there, there is a clear demand from tenants and consumers to be in this box.
Hap Stein: And we will be starting knock on wood, a mixed used development within next quarter. But just once again, Jeremy, our focus -- and we had substantially enhanced with Mac and his team and the teams did well. Our capabilities from mixed used standpoint and our focus is on being better to mixed used to get to the retail portions of those mixed used opportunities where they are within our owned portfolio or new development opportunities.
Mac Chandler: Meaning to continue to partner with best-in-class developers and operators for the other sectors that would be part of the mixed used --
Hap Stein: Like we get in clear with and we have a long day
Jim Thompson: And like from this opportunity that we expect to start in the next quarter.
Jeremy Metz: Got it. Appreciated. And then just Lisa one for you, you had mentioned having a shopping center in a contract and using the outstanding forward to fund that. So, in terms of the zero to 90 million of dispositions, should we think about that only happening, if you identified additional acquisitions from here and therefore and maybe more of a source of funding? Do you find additional deals?
Lisa Palmer: The dispositions will fund our developments, and we do have developments in process that have spent that will happen this year. So, it's not even necessarily related to the new start although we have great visibility as Mac said in his prepared remarks on the call to several of those as well. If you think about free cash flows, which is almost a $100 million in 2016 and then disposed funding our developments.
Jeremy Metz: And anything on the contract today?
Lisa Palmer: The one that we have in -- you mean the acquisition that we have in contract in the Northeast, we will use the equity to fund that.
Jeremy Metz: Sorry, on the disposition front, you had any under contract?
Lisa Palmer: We do not.
Hap Stein: We had late close in December and that was one of the close-in into the first quarter of this year, but it was --
Lisa Palmer: Correct, the larger, the team across that you saw on our discloser, close to $50 million.
Operator: [Operator Instruction] And our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Ki Bin Kim: Could you just give a quick update on some of your development projects? I noticed that a couple of your projects expect the yield went down, any commentary on there?
Mac Chandler: Ki, this is Mac, I’ll answer that. We feel really good about our in process pipeline. It's performing well. There, we really have no specific terms to talk about. We did take a case in our Northeast project where we converted a pad, which we're going to ground lease and we converted it to building, a building that cause their cost to go up, but that’s pretty standard figure. But our returns are solid and we are hitting our underwriting lease. We feel good about that.
Lisa Palmer: I think its new development that we brought online that was a lower -- that's not so much shift in what was already in process.
Ki Bin Kim: Okay, I might be looking at the wrong column. So, never mind about that. Yes, and I am not sure how much you want to talk about the merger? But just broadly speaking, I was wondering if -- since announcement, if there is any kind of new things that you've learned whether it'd be synergies or the way you want to run the corporate structure overall, any kind of commentary on there?
Lisa Palmer: We love to talk about it, because we are really excited about it. But unfortunately the good point, we are really limited in what we can say. And since announcement, we work through separately operating companies and we have been operating in that way and are required to operate in that way. So, we can't wait to talk about it and we will do that at the appropriate time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Floris van Dijkum from Boenning. Please go ahead.
Floris van Dijkum: Question for Hap or Lisa. You guys -- you are about embark on this merger, you got fortress balance sheet, 4.4 times net to EBITDA and be of most of the sector. You have got all the markets to that everybody wants and the coastal markets, and you've increased that with the -- if you add the Equity Once. The question I have is, so what are your biggest worries? Or what are the biggest concerns? Or what you think are the biggest risks to the business?
Hap Stein: Let me just say, I think we've got it indicated before. While we are not on mindful of the economic challenges that are out there of the disruptors that are out there, but there is still a strong conviction on our part that well-anchored, well-located community and neighborhood shopping centers particularly those that grocery anchored are going to continue -- is going to be strong demand from the better retailers for those shopping centers. So that's number one. Number two, we believe that our development program is a great way to feel great shopping centers and redeveloped great shopping centers at attractive returns on capital that are adding to NAV. And I think you can have a high-quality portfolio and a right side and top core development program, and a fortress balance sheet that's the best way to navigate and an experienced management team to the challenges that are going to be out there. And I think, we are going to be very well positioned to the extent there is a downturn or a storm out there to weather that storm and even profit from those opportunities.
Floris van Dijkum: And does that mean that you feel pretty good where you are, but you are nimble enough to be able to withstand any sort of unforeseen events. Is that how we should read that answer?
Hap Stein: Well, to think that any entity in the world is going to be totally immune to changes and technology to changes in economic conditions, I think that is that's not going to be the case. But at the same time, I think we are extremely well positioned to not only survive what may happen economically and what may happen from a in a very changing world. I think it's a thriving true formula and I think also to not only survive, but to thrive. And it doesn’t mean that we are going to sit fast. Because as we said to ourselves, we are a -- we think we are good, but we think that there is an opportunity to continue to improve in every aspect of our business, on a journey of building a great company.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Gorman from BTIG. Please go ahead.
Michael Gorman: Just had a question on disposition, if you look back over call at the last five years or so, you sold or counting the 2017 guidance -- you've sold about a 1.2 billion in assets kind of ranging from 6.5 caps up to kind of sub-8. I'm just wondering as you look at portfolio today kind of what if anything is less than that potential disposition bucket, as we go through 2017 and start looking out into 2018 and beyond?
Lisa Palmer: We significantly reduce the number of properties and the percent of the value of our company that would fit in kind of the 6.5% to 8% cap rate and I mean significantly by virtue of selling and close to a $1 billion in property. So, we have very little out there. Shopping centers and neighborhoods half even just kind of alluded to a little there constantly evolving and changing, and there are always going to be centers that are going to be towards the lower quality and lower or above end of the spectrum in our portfolio. I don’t think it towards incident, if you will, but it's a really small percentage of what we owned. And when you think about our strategic funding model, we will use dispositions to continue to fund our development spend. And we will when appropriate access the capital market that’s we did in 2016. So, the best way to answer is this is very small part and what we would consider the low end of our spectrum is a pretty high bar, because I think we have one of the best portfolios in the business.
Michael Gorman: Great. So, Lisa, if I take your comments, is it's sort of fair to say that kind of going forward it's more -- it's less about, it will be less about getting rate of sort of a lower quality, but in a more just about preening and trading out what you consider to be the bottom end versus what's a better comp and development. So if there is future funding to developments at a disposition, the cap rates could be even lower than we are seeing right now?
Lisa Palmer: That’s going to be property specific, but even looking at the properties that we sold last year. We sold them that had a five in front of this. So, yes, I mean that’s the case because it's not only just necessarily lower quality, but its lower growth, because part of the model is top recycle the lower growth then it maybe because of the lower quality, but it could do business there. There is not allowed inherent growth in that asset, so recycling capital from lower growth into higher quality, higher growth property.
Operator: [Operator Instruction] Our next question comes from Chris Lucas from Capital One Securities. Please go ahead.
Chris Lucas: Just a big general question and it relates to sort of the amount of time it gets between a lease is signed to win rent commences. Has there been any shift either quick, more quickly or longer in that process say over the last year or so?
Jim Thompson: Chris, this is Jim. We really haven't seen any noticeable difference quite frankly. It does take time, it's probably close -- it's probably tough around the front end to have tenants really there very focus, they are very picky, once you execute to delivery, we are not saying expanded period of time.
Chris Lucas: Okay and then maybe expand a little bit on the Chimney Rock development, the yield is definitely lower than what we are using to see from you guys from a roundup perspective. What was the underwriting approach? And what is unique about this been has sort of value add beyond that sort of expected going in 6.5 yield?
Mac Chandler: Chris, really it's a risk adjusted return, that’s what the big picture we have looking at it. The family that has owned the site for decade or so, spent a long time getting a very complex rate entitlements, including some very expensive off sites, which were not only entitled, but actually delivered in site. So, they also brought along with the opportunity really all four incur leases, which were substantially negotiated in final lease form and one of them was actually signed. So from a risk adjusted basis, we were comfortable stepping into that project. The site was also 30% graded and had some very complex grading that went along with that and risky. And because they had taken on the first started it, they had mitigated the risk out of the project and determined how much [Indiscernible] was there, which they moved and remediated. So, we stepped into with it, it was not completely a layout, but very much different than the typical development. We feel that return was appropriate, still a good 150 to probably 200 basis points spread between that where we could sell it today, got good growth. They did a good job, negotiating the four anchored leases. So, they have good growth and good visibility towards the shopping leasing, and we're getting really good quality tenants with good growth, and we love the location well too. This is a high, high very density location, very affluent and just to be for the one of a kind center. It's the closest of those within 30-minute drive time, and we feel really good about it. It's failing to attract a lot of very affluent customers that triggers.
Jim Thompson: I would say to that I agree what Mac said, it's 200 basis points instead of saying or where we could sell today or where we could buy it today. So, this is fairly long and very long time, for a very long time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Dorman: Hey, it's Michael Dorman from Citi. Lisa you mentioned just you're operating two separate companies today and you still wanted to stay close in the merger to share more information. Can you just sort of let us know what the plan is in terms of timing of sharing that information? I know, you are planning a larger conference call post merger or you just kind of wait for 1Q results? Just for that we should know at what point you are going to come out with a more full from document and opportunity for us those questions?
Lisa Palmer: The Shareholder Meeting is on February 24th and then I'm certain that you read every page of the merger agreement, so you will then know that the schedule close would be March 1st based on the number of days post the Shareholder Meeting. And then, at this time our plan is to wait until our first quarter earnings call and certainly if that changes you guys will know, but there is a lot of complexities around the non-cash mark-to-market and we just want to be sure that we have all of that fully done so that we can give 100% disclosure rather than seeing it up to you guys and pieces. We are very competitive to being very transparent and we will do our best so I'll give the best disclosure at they all return. But will reiterate what we told all of you when we made the announcement in November and in subsequent Investor Meeting. We still expect it to be accretive to core FFO even before of that incremental non-cash mark-to-market and we expect it to be even more accretive to same property NOI growth than it is to core FFO.
Michael Dorman: Well, I don’t think the non-cash comes on cash and there is really no impact on our valuation really and I'm curious too much about that I think they care more you can see from the questions on the call about the integration the development the redevelopment operating structural personnel things like that. I'm just curious as you will you sort of host a more in-depth Analyst Day to go through the go forward as we see entities come together?
Mike Mas: Sure. Hi, Michael, this is Mike. A more fulsome Analyst Day and Investor Day is certainly in our minds, we haven’t hosted one in quite a long-time, and this would actually be the time to reach to reengage on that front. We are working on plans those plans would likely to be included event towards the end of the year and we are looking forward to that very much and introducing our thoughts around many of these projects that will be inheriting as well as go forward plans for the combined company.
Michael Dorman: And then just lastly just in terms of transition as we think about it. How much of the senior seats we exactly going to see from Equity One would come over? And that deal closes March 1st, should we expect any transition from the B team or is it more lower level, market level people that you are assuming of it initially?
Hap Stein: There would be done -- that can be pretty clear that there will be no sea sweep [ph] coming over to the combined company. And then the addition would basically be operation exposure field level and back half of this which lead to be new employee hires or Equity One plus.
Unidentified Analyst: Even on a transitionary period, so there is no one even coming over full period of time at all?
Hap Stein: We look at -- we'll address that.
Michael Mas: Not from the C.
Hap Stein: Not from C sweep [ph].
Michael Dorman: Okay.
Hap Stein: From transition a standpoint, we would obviously address which necessary to operate the properties to do the appropriate amount of accounting and the transition from, on from redevelopments.
Michael Dorman: Okay thank you.
Hap Stein: There wide work to be done but we feel very, very comfortable what I find as more to come on specifics.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing comments.
Hap Stein: We appreciate your time and we wish you to rest -- a good rest of the week and a great weekend. Thank you very much.
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Regency Centers Corp. Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Mike Mas. Thank you, you may begin.
Mike Mas: Good morning and welcome to Regency's third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Hap Stein, our Chairman and CEO; Lisa Palmer our President and Chief Financial Officer; Mac Chandler, Executive Vice President of Development; Jim Thompson, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Chris Leavitt, Senior Vice President and Treasurer. Before we begin, I'd like to address forward-looking statements that may be discussed on the call. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. In addition, on today's call we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. More information regarding these non-GAAP financial measures can be found in Company documents filed with the SEC. Further with respect to our supplemental disclosure, please note the change in presentation of certain financial statements which now reflect updated SEC guidelines on pro-rata disclosure. Finally, we request the callers observe a two question limit during the Q&A portion of our call to allow everyone a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. I will now turn the call over to Hap.
Hap Stein: Thanks Mike. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Our best-in-class team continues to perform at a high level executing on our tried and true strategy that has consistently delivered impressive results in every facet of our business. First, our operating portfolio, which by all relevant measures, is recognized as one of the best in the industry, is nearly 96% leased. This was achieved in the phase of recent bankruptcies and anchor move-outs and shop leasing remains vibrant and move-out louder. Further, the anchor vacancies present our team with opportunities for upgrades over the prior tenants. Our development and redevelopment pipeline is looking even more visible. Further positioning us to deliver on an average of more than $200 of annual new starts of high quality shopping centers at very attractive returns. Third, reinforced by our recent capital market's activity over the past few months, we will benefit from a sector-leading balance sheet that affords us complex ability to capitalize on compelling investment opportunities and whether and even profit from future disruptions in the capital markets. And finally our talented and B team is focused on executing our proven business model that capitalizes on this distinguishing assets and in turn creating shareholder value, consistent gains and core earnings and net asset value per share. Mac Chandler will now provide an update on development. Mac?
Mac Chandler: Thanks Hap, and good morning. Despite a highly competitive development landscape, Regency's industry leading development team continues to source and execute on compelling opportunities while enhance our high quality portfolio. Our newest start, the Village at Tustin Legacy is evidenced of our ability to extract significant value within our target markets resulting from a sharp shooter advantage. This ground-up development is located in the highly affluent in Orange County within the master plan community of Tustin Legacy. The project will benefit from in place and growing triggers and graphics including a population of 200,000 and average income of than 100,000. You can see this in our previous as we are already 80% leased and committed after only three months of site construction. I’m confident in high caliber retailers and distinctive fresh look design that will enhance Regency’s already from your presence in Orange County. Before turning over the call to Lisa, I wanted to touch on future development expectations. With good visibility into our fourth quarter start of what we will be an exceptional Whole Foods, Nordstrom Rack anchor development in the Northeast, and great or better on several other projects in our pipeline. We have raised the top end of our portfolio development guidance to 265 million. It looks like this momentum will continue into 2017 which will result in another year of delivering high quality developments and redevelopment at substantial spreads to where these projects were trade. Lisa?
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Mac. Good morning all. We continue to demonstrate the inherent strength of our high quality portfolio despite the headwinds from previously announced bankruptcies. The same property portfolio is 96% leased with shop space again contributing gains and nearing an impressive 93% leased. Same-property NOI growth for the quarter was just under 3% moderating as we expected and also as we communicated on the last earnings call but still a very strong 3.4% year-to-date. Further with more visibility into the fourth quarter, we tightened the same-property NOI guidance range with a new range of 3% to 3.4%. It is important to note however that we’ll continue to absorb the impact from bankrupt tenants in the fourth quarter and also in the first half of 2017 as we work to release these anchor boxes. Given this impact while I am not offering formal guidance at this time, it is reasonable to expect 2017 same-property NOI growth to more closely approximate growth from the latter half of this year. I did want to provide more detail behind our rent growth for this quarter. We executed a short term anchor renewal with ongoing landlord recapture rates at our recent Market Common acquisition. This will allow us to significantly upgrade the merchandizing upon expiration or recapture of additional space and further by taking this course of action we’re able to preserve income in the near term for a tenant that we had underwritten to base rate. We may take control of the space and we will be able to improve the future growth profile of the center. We do not feel landlord leverage softening at our centers. Even after the impact from this strategic renewal, total rent growth year-to-date is approaching 11%. Additionally our new shop rent growth remained very strong at 14% for the quarter. Overall the leasing environment remains healthy and with our premier real estate and with limited supply, we continue to able to push rents and negotiate mid-term rent steps to solidify embedded growth. I’ll conclude by touching on the updated guidance ranges for NAREIT and core FFO. With more certainly surrounding bankruptcies and move-outs we increased the low end of both ranges by $0.03 and raised the top end of these by a penny. Thank you for listening. We now welcome your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeremy Metz from UBS. Please go ahead.
Jeremy Metz: Hi guys, good morning. You talked about more visibility on the development front and you obviously took the high end of your development starts up and you mentioned you're thinking your private seller level in 2017. Are you more broadly seeing any bigger shifts in tenant mindset towards new development at this point?
Mac Chandler: This is Mac Jeremy. I wouldn't say a different set of mindset. I think it’s been consistent over the last several years we’ve had a very healthy pipeline working with best-in-class tenants like Wegmans, Whole Foods, Publix, Kroger and our pipeline historically and when we look out forward it's filled with projects like that. So we have opportunities every broadcast but we haven’t seen a shift in the quality of the projects or the location. It seems to be really consistent with our strategy historically we’re going forward. So no broad shifts there.
Jeremy Metz: Okay. And then just on the shop leasing, we've heard about some of the fast casual dollar stores are pairing back openings. Can you talk about what you're seeing on the ground there and the leasing front of that segment. Maybe how much higher you think you can drive that 93% in the next 12 to 18 months?
Jim Thompson: Jeremy, it's Jim Thompson. Obviously we’re seeing very robust small shop leasing. We expect there is still some runway there. We're seeing continued good growth. I think the sectors that continue to be active are the fitness, the food although there is some saturation in that category we’re seeing the new been replacing old and it’s kind of a normal cycle. We’re aligning ourselves as we always do with who we consider the best-in-class in that sector and continuing to freshen the portfolio.
Jeremy Metz: Just, sorry just -- in terms of how much more you can even get out of that 93% increase, can we go to 94% to 95% here?
Jim Thompson: We try - as hard as we can but…
Lisa Palmer: I trained Jim, well he is not going to give you a formal – we've talked about this before, the quality of our portfolio is so much better today than it was ten years ago. And ten years ago we reached just north of 92% on the shop space percent leased. We're obviously north of that today. So it's really uncertain, but we continue to see strong demand for the space and even more importantly over the past, really two years the number of move-outs in our small shop space continued to decline as a percent of space, right. This year we’re projecting move-outs of just about a million square feet and - which is almost - it’s a little bit higher than last year, but that's almost offer for anchors. I mean our move-outs out in the small shop space is so small. So as long as we can continue to do some new leasing, I would expect that we're going to continue to see that small shop lease tick up.
Jim Thompson: And the focus is not just on filling the space, but it’s also on a quality of tenant and the merchant - new ability to merchant - as a merchant.
Jeremy Metz: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Christy McElroy from Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Christy McElroy: Hi, good morning, everyone. Just a follow-up on that question, Lisa, I think you mentioned shop rent growth of about 14% in Q3, or that might have been the year-to-date number. As you, you know, get close to that 93% number and potentially beyond, presumably you're getting to some of that tougher lease space. What should we expect in terms of potential impact of that on releasing spreads as you see -- you've said you're likely to go higher.
Lisa Palmer: This is a great question Christy, and that’s why it becomes a lot harder to project. But with the limited supply in the environment and with the quality of our portfolio in the high percent lease even with that being potentially lower quality space, we still anticipate that leverages more in outcome and then and there. So we still believe that even with that we should continue to see high single-digits to low double-digit rent growth moving forward.
Jim Thompson: And those rents in those spaces were starting from a lower based, so…
Christy McElroy: Okay. Then in thinking about that decelerated pace of same store growth into 2017 that you talked about, presumably that's predominately impacted by some of the re-tenanting that you're doing with the stores that's already in other boxes. How should we think about this trajectory? Should that pace be slower in the first half versus the second half as you're replacing some of that down time and re-leasing that space? How should we think about that pace?
Lisa Palmer: Absolutely, because if you think about when those came offline, we had a lot of that income in the first half of the year. And assuming we are able to release those relatively quickly, even if we do that, we still were getting some until the latter half of the year, so the first half will certainly be lower than the second half of next year.
Mac Chandler: [Indiscernible] in timing - and finding better tenants to fill the spaces.
Christy McElroy: Okay. So that is the biggest impact? There's not anything else in there we should be thinking about in terms of drivers?
Lisa Palmer: No.
Christy McElroy: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig Schmidt from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Craig Schmidt: Yes, I wanted to get your opinion on Lidl, the German discounter. From their point of view it sounds like they are trying to make a pretty aggressive push into the Southeast and the mid-Atlantic. On the other hand, when I talk to people on the ground, they seem somewhat skeptical. What's your take on their entry into the U.S.?
Mac Chandler: Craig, this is Mac. We have seen some evidence on the ground, either on ground expanding and they’re well capitalized and appear to have a very aggressive appetite. But they're also quite secretive at the same time. So you don’t see a lot of broad announcements as to where they’re going. We haven't talking to them, about one type that we own in the City of Texas and the conversations ebb and flow as they with any other retailer. So I think there is quite a bit of room before we can really give you on assessment of how they are as a competitor and a threat, and a player, but clearly they are making some moves here and they're trying to do it in a big way. That's about as much as a big return. Jim anything to add?
Jim Thompson: That’s really - we know they're tied up in and have purchased sites. They really haven’t opened anything yet. So it’s very difficult, but they’re clearly our force overseas, so they are an operator.
Craig Schmidt: Okay.
Hap Stein: And I think if you look to the Fresh & Easy history, as Mac said, this is too early for us to project out all our GAAP results, because I think they all thought they would do well prior to opening because you heard about how they did their market research and they had their people living in the U.S. and studying consumer behavior and something it's just unknown of how that will translate to hear.
Mac Chandler: The only I might add is their model is more about all the model, which is very low price, high value and that typically hasn't affected us as much as some of the higher end or mid-market groceries. We're just in more affluent higher locations so in that sense, they’re something to keep.
Craig Schmidt: I guess I tend to lean toward that view. When I look at what's happening in the U.K. and some of the established supermarkets there, how they've been impacted by their reach into that country, I just wanted to hear what you were thinking, so thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Jay Carlington from Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
Jay Carlington: Good morning, guys. Just to go back to the leasing spreads we're beating up here a little bit. Is there any noise in there, whether it's from re-tenanting in the sports stores or anything? Because it seems like a decent pull and trying to get a handle on the sequential deceleration we've seen over the past couple of quarters there.
Hap Stein: You mean beyond what we mentioned in the prepared remarks?
Jay Carlington: Correct. Yes, the 5A, the mid single digit range that we see versus the low double digits the last couple of quarters. It's a decent pull, so I'm trying to get a sense if there's any -- if the rent increases that you're pushing through just aren't as aggressive any more.
Lisa Palmer: No, I mean I would again just reiterate what we did say in the prepared remarks, that when you do exclude that one lease that had a pretty significant impact. So when you do exclude that then we are in the double-digits for rent growth. So that’s – I mean I think that’s you can’t just ignore that and that was a strategic renewal, newly acquired property that we had underwritten to vacate and we felt really good about being able to reserve some of the income in the short-term while we worked to capture some of the other space back, so we can remerchandize a larger portion of the center. So I think that that’s really important. And beyond that, I think it’s also important to know the actual absolute, so it’s a mix as it often is the absolute rent for our leases that we sign this quarter. I think it’s the highest in 12 months. If – I am not looking at the supplemental, if I recall correctly, I think the rent was $24 and last quarter it was a little low $20 again from memory, but that’s still much higher than we’ve seen. So it is a little bit of mix issue as well.
Jay Carlington: Okay. I probably missed that in the prepared. Maybe just a quick follow-up. Is there any sense -- I know the retailers don't give you sales but is there a sense of what their OCRs look like today versus a couple of years ago?
Lisa Palmer: We really don’t get a lot of sales data, I mean I looked at Jim or Mac for just maybe any informal feedback that they’re receiving in the field, but we don’t have that many tenants that report. So those – that do typically tend to be the anchors and we’re seeing them continue to have even our grocers have healthy...
Jim Thompson: Pretty healthy growth here.
Lisa Palmer: Yes, a healthy sale increases.
Jim Thompson: I think you could see in the renewals, if tenants weren’t able to absorb their rent, they wouldn’t be able to exercise their renewals that they are. They feel confident about their business, so they can make the ratios work and that’s probably the best way to see it play out.
Hap Stein: And you see pick up and move out.
Jay Carlington: Okay, all right. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.
Ki Bin Kim: Thank you. Going back to your development-start guidance, it's a pretty wide gap. What is the two large processes that you're contemplating and when you said next year might look very similar to this year? Does that mean the midpoint, or the range should be similar next year, as well?
Lisa Palmer: Ki Bin, I’m going to repeat the question to Mac, I think he might have been distracted for one second. He makes sure that in about the wide range of development starts and what was that we had this year that is causing that to be a wide range?
Ki Bin Kim: Yes.
Mac Chandler: Really the big difference between this quarter and prior ones is we’ve been presented with an opportunity in the Northeast, very compelling opportunity, where an owner of the site has been working on it for 15 years entitling it. It’s really all about the five yard line and just about done. And we have an opportunity that we will really like to be able to step into and shuffle ready project if you would, that’s 50% preleased. So we don’t have 100% visibility to it occurring this calendar year, but it looks very positive and we want to make sure our guidance included that if it were to close this calendar year. Going forward to 2017, I’d say the range is similar with previous years of 125 – 225, but we would like $200 million, we would like to get it up to $300 million if we can find that right compelling opportunities that meet our disciplined approach. So that’s really the change behind this quarter.
Ki Bin Kim: Okay. And just a quick question on market rent growth, do you have a sense of, not leasing spreads, but what market rent growth has done in your portfolio in 2016, and maybe if you have a forecast of what you think market rent growth would be in 2017?
Hap Stein: It’s been pretty modest market rent growth has been and I think our expectation is for to continue especially for high quality premier shopping centers.
Jim Thompson: If you just look at basically the act like the absolute dollars for rents that we’ve signed, I mean we are looking at double-digit increases. But again think about the universe of shopping centers and what a small percentage are owned by REITs. Those REITs ownerships tend – the own the highest quality and then the higher quality REITs owned the higher quality of the high quality. So I think what we’re seeing in our centers may not be a very good proxy for the entire market, so we do continue to see really healthy growth and again it comes back to 96% REITs when almost 93% REITs on our shop space. We have leverage and we’ll continue to arrive that while we have it because we know that it’s not going to last forever.
Ki Bin Kim : Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from George Hoglund from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
George Hoglund: Good morning. Just wondering if you can comment on any recent trends in construction costs, how are they trending on a year-over-year basis?
Mac Chandler: Hi, George, this is Mac. So we watch it carefully and we’ve seen some of these changes and anticipated them. So we have been fortunate that our development budgets have all held. But we are seeing changes of say 3% to 6% depending on the market and really tied mostly to a shortage in high skilled labor, and that seems to be a common thread throughout. But I think we’re underwriting it appropriately, and we have been surprised by too much. But we always underwrite at inflation and escalation factor for projects that we know we’re going to start several years out. Hopefully that helps.
George Hoglund: And geographically, are you seeing any significant differences?
Mac Chandler: Certainly the coastal markets, the increases are more. Seattle is the market probably only – certainly one of the top two or three house markets that could be little bit over there. San Francisco and certainly, Silicon Valley, actually there is a sort of big one. We’re not in New York metros, but I would imagine that playing out as well.
George Hoglund: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Chris Lucas from Capital One Securities. Please go ahead.
Chris Lucas: Good morning, everyone. The follow-up question on Ki Bin's question about the development starts. Is there a discrete number of projects that get you to the high end? I'm trying to understand what the scale or the likelihood is as we think about year-end starts?
Hap Stein: Sure. Chris, there are three projects that we’re counting out that are ground up projects. We think we’re all going to happen, but we can’t say for sure because fixed development and there is some intergradient to actually come together here in the next month. But the one that we added is about 70 million that should give you some guidance. There is another one anchored by White Mint that we mentioned, we’re working on and third one anchored by Krogers. So there are three significant sized projects, certainly $70 million is little bit bigger than typical one.
Jim Thompson: There is a one – it’s not widely that they won’t happen. There may be a decent change they can get twist into first quarter of 2017. No guarantees they are going to happen for sure, but we feel very, very confident that that’s going to happen. It is development, but that can be get pushed into 2017.
Chris Lucas : Yes, and is that the timing issue regulatory-driven? Government approvals, or is there something else that may be impacting the timing?
Hap Stein: All three, it’s actually regulatory approval.
Chris Lucas : Okay. And then just one quick question, on the timing or potential timing for the remaining 1.25 million shares under the Ford sales agreement, any sense in which we should be thinking about modeling those in?
Lisa Palmer: Remember, we have until the middle of next year essentially to draw it down and we do have some visibility into potential acquisition in the first quarter of next year. I think anything prior to that at this point would be too conservative.
Chris Lucas : Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I’d now like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing comments.
Hap Stein: Thank you very much for your interest and time on the call. And enjoy the rest of the week and all the best. Thanks.
Operator: This concludes today’s teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Operator: Welcome to the Regency Centers Corporation Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mike Mas, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets for Regency Centers Corporation. Thank you, Mr. Mas, you may begin.
Mike Mas: Good morning and welcome to Regency's second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Hap Stein, our Chairman and CEO; Lisa Palmer our President and Chief Financial Officer; Mac Chandler, Executive Vice President of Development; Jim Thompson, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Chris Leavitt, Senior Vice President and Treasurer. Before we begin, I'd like to address forward-looking statements that may be discussed on the call. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on forms 10-K and 10-Q which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. In addition, on today's call we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. More information regarding these non-GAAP measures can be found in Company documents filed with the SEC. [Operator Instructions]. I'll now turn the call over to Hap.
Hap Stein: Thank you, Mike. Good morning and thank you for joining us on the call. Our talented team continues to deliver impressive results in each of the key aspects of the business. The underlying fundamentals of Regency's high-quality portfolio remain strong. The portfolio is distinguished by sustainable advantages from locations and desirable trade areas and by merchandising to highly productive grocers and best-in-class retailers and restaurants. And we're continuing to find value-add developments and acquisitions with superior growth prospects. In addition and as we have clearly stated, having a fortress balance sheet is integral to our strategy to provide the financial flexibility to efficiently capitalize on compelling investment opportunities and profitably weather future storms that may arise. With that in mind, just a few weeks ago we successfully raised $400 million of equity capital which further strengthen our balance sheet by reducing leverage on an earnings accretive basis and creating additional capacity to fund a growing investment pipeline. I want to stress that we will remain disciplined and selective to ensure that any allocation of capital is consistent with the high quality of our existing collection of grocery-anchored neighborhood and community shopping centers and offers attractive prospects for growth and/or value creation. Finally and n most important of all, I want to emphasize how well positioned Regency is for the future. First, our portfolio which by all measures of quality is among the top in the sector, is poised to sustain 3% NOI growth. Second, our development program which is widely recognized by key anchors, retailers and restaurants and by the important market players as best in class, will enable us to start and deliver $200 million of premier centers at attractive returns. Third, our balance sheet which is one of the most pristine in the whole REIT sector, provides an incredible amount of flexibility to cost effectively fund compelling investment opportunities. And our team which is guided by Regency's special culture, is in my mind without peer in terms of talent, depth and engagement. These distinguishing features ensure we're better positioned than ever to compound future core earnings per share growth that should average 6% to 7%. This, together with consistent gains in NAV and accelerated dividend increases, will be our recipe to sustained growth and shareholder value. Mac Chandler, our Executive Vice President of Development, will now provide an update on investments. Mac?
Mac Chandler: Thanks, Hap. Good morning. On our last call we shared with you our plans for two pending acquisitions. Mid quarter we closed on the retail portion of Market Common Clarendon in Metro DC. This iconic mixed-use project anchored by a high-volume Whole Foods and a strong mix of exceptional retailers including Apple boosts upside from redevelopment which will be expertly mined by our DC team. Subsequent to quarter we acquired Klahanie Shopping Centers in Seattle for $36 million. Anchored by Krogers QFC banner, Klahanie is located in a very affluent community where we already own several high-performing centers. These two new acquisitions will enhance Regency's portfolio with trade areas benefiting from high income [indiscernible], productive grocers, best-in-class retailers and the opportunity to capitalize on below market rents. The centers are projected to generate substantial NOI growth and IRRs that roughly average in the mid-6% range. With respect to our development program, our capabilities positioned Regency to profitably enhance portfolio quality and generate premium returns to comparable acquisitions. Take our La Floresta Whole Foods development in Orange County which we completed this quarter. It's a great example of superb execution of Regency's fresh look merchandising and design. And it's already at 99% leased to a fabulous lineup of local, regional and national retailers and restaurants. The returns reflect a spread to market cap rates of over 300 basis points. Our in-process developments are also performing extremely well and are approaching 90% leased. More specifically, our Springwoods development in Houston represents further evidence of the combination of well-conceived development and fresh look. Although we just broke ground, more than 80% of the Center is leased and committed, including a top-notch set of retailers to complement our best-in-class grocer. While there's still a good bit of work to be done, we remain confident in our ability to start an average of $200 million of developments and redevelopments annually and maintain our full-year guidance range. Our expectation is that the vast majority will begin in the fourth quarter. Lisa?
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Mac. Good morning, everyone. I am again pleased with the results this quarter. As Hap mentioned, the critical ingredient of our winning strategy is the quality of our portfolio. Highly productive anchors and great locations together with the team's focus enable us to merchandise to best-in-class retailers. This proven combination drives pricing power, percent leased and in turn, NOI and earnings growth. The result of our efforts are evident in our numbers again this quarter. Same-property NOI grew by 3.4%, with base rent once again as the primary contributing factor. Full-year same-property NOI guidance remains unchanged, though, as we do expect growth to moderate throughout the second half of the year as we face higher comps from rent-paying occupancy and as we begin to feel the impact of previously announced bankruptcies. Regarding these bankruptcies, our leasing teams are working diligently on replacing these tenants with more productive operators. We already have some good news to report at our location in Northern California where Target has acquired the former Sports Authority space, resulting in no down time and no loss of rent. We're excited about this clear upgrade for the center. Another factor expected to impact the second half of the year is the large-scale transformation of one of our centers near Aventura Mall in Miami. Most of the tenants at this location will be offline as we scrape and rebuild the center which will feature a podium format Publix with parking underneath. Although we will experience loss of NOI in the near term, this renovation will add substantial value and future NOI growth to our portfolio in the long run. The leasing environment continues to be robust with shop spaces in the same property portfolio at 92.4% leased, an increase of 40 basis points sequentially. In fact, shop space fundamentals have been strong all around, with rent growth at 12% in the last two quarters. We find these trends to be highly encouraging and positive indicators of the leasing environment and tenant health. Turning to Capital Markets, our ability to create meaningful value for our shareholders through disciplined capital allocation is a key component of our strategy. I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing several transactions we've executed since May which further underscores the enviable position that Regency is in today. In the interest of time, I'll just quickly touch on the highlights and ask that you please refer to the press release for more details. First, we settled a portion of our forward equity offering to acquire Market Common Clarendon and Klahanie Shopping Center. Second, we issued $400 million of equity that will allow us to eliminate high coupon debt in mid-August. And finally we expanded our term loan by $100 million, taking our line of credit balance to $0. Most importantly, these actions have significantly improved our current long-term projections of key performance metrics, including growth and earnings, dividends, free cash flow and a sector-leading net debt to EBITDA which is currently well below 5 times, offering incredible flexibility to enhance Regency's performance even further.  Before turning it over to Q&A, I'll touch on the guidance changes that are detailed in our press release and supplemental. We revised our full-year NAREIT FFO guidance to a new range of $2.71 to $2.76. This incorporates the one-time charges from the early redemption of our 2017 bonds and the settlement of our forward starting slots. In addition, we raised core FFO guidance to a new range of $3.22 to $3.27 per share, driven by increases from our recent acquisitions and interest savings from our bond redemption.  In closing, I'm extremely gratified by the accomplishments our team has achieved, positioning Regency to sustained growth and shareholder value. Thank you for listening and we now welcome your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Jay Carlington from Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.
Jay Carlington: Lisa, just to touch on your balance sheet comments there. I guess, has the decision to maybe redeem your notes and the recent equity offering indicate you guys are going to pursue a more conservative balance sheet? And maybe as a follow-up, can you remind us what your long-term debt targets are?
Lisa Palmer: Sure. I think that pursuing a more conservative balance sheet isn't new. I hope that we've been delivering that message for the past several years, that we've really worked towards improving the balance sheet. The most important thing is to ensure that we have a well laddered profile. And we now don't have any significant maturities until 2020. So that's really important, but then secondly, to maintain a net debt to EBITDA below 5 times throughout the cycle. So when we can take advantage of being much lower than that so that we have the flexibility to really be offensive and act on opportunities if they present themselves at a time when the markets aren't as open and aren't as cheap, then that's the position we want to be in. And as we're today. So we absolutely want to be conservative. And long term we'd like to average around 5 times.
Jay Carlington: Okay. Maybe just changing gears on your guidance page for your NAV disclosure. I guess there's an additional color on undeveloped land or land held for future development. Is that just fine tuning or is there land that was reclassified there?
Mac Chandler: That's just fine-tuning of the disclosure, Jay. And there's no change to any of that from a strategy sampling, just trying to make it a little more prominent for the users.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Christine McElroy from Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
Christine McElroy: Lisa, sorry if you mentioned this. Just looking ahead to further use of this capital. When do you expect to settle the remaining forward equity? Is that in your 2016 guidance?
Lisa Palmer: No, Christine. We actually don't have a set time. We would like to use that for new investments. We have until June of next year to settle it. It is not incorporated into our guidance.
Christine McElroy: Okay, got that. And then in terms of acquisitions and new investments, just realizing that's not in the guidance. But what are you sort of seeing in terms of the pipeline? Are there more opportunities today? And how do you think about -- how are you thinking about acquisitions and investment differently as your cost of equity continues to decrease with the strength in your stock price?
Lisa Palmer: I think that we've been active over the past two years with acquisitions. So there has been more opportunities than meeting our investment criteria. We certainly haven't been successful on every opportunity that we've pursued. And in fact I think probably for every 10 we may underwrite and look at, we're probably successful in 1 or 2 of them. So we continue to see opportunities, although there's no guarantee that we will be the successful bidder. To the extent that we can get --
Hap Stein: Or decide to buy.
Lisa Palmer: Or decide to buy. To the extent that we can see off-market opportunities which are really hard to come by, they typically come through relationships. So for every maybe 50 we look at, 1 is a true off-market opportunity. Those are the best. And we will continue to try pursue those. The way we think about our cost of capital, especially now that we've already raised some and we have -- we do have capital available to buy, we're targeting unlevered IRRs in the 6% to 6/2% range which is lower than it was three years ago.
Hap Stein: And in addition to that, we only want to buy centers that are going to be accretive to our long-term growth rate and meet our quality standards.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Tayo Okusanya: Just a couple from me, first of all, could you quantify the NOI loss you do expect from scraping the asset that's right next to the Aventura Mall? Just want to make sure we have that in our numbers
Lisa Palmer: I'm not sure. I think of bps in terms of same-property NOI growth. And Jim may have the actual NOI number. But I think it's about 15 basis point impact to same-property NOI. So it's significant.
Hap Stein: In 2016.
Tayo Okusanya: So that's helpful.
Lisa Palmer: For one property, that's significant.
Tayo Okusanya: Okay. And then second of all, could you just give an update in regards to Sports Authority and kind what's happening with those boxes within your portfolio?
Lisa Palmer: Let me answer kind of big picture and how it's impacting our numbers. And then I'll let Jim talk about the actual real estate. So we did have one move out. And again, he can add color to this. We had move one out the end of the quarter. So, that impacted our percent leased as of period end. We hadn't experienced any NOI loss yet year to date. So we do expect bankruptcies to have a negative 50 basis point impact to our same-property NOI growth in the second half of the year. So when you weigh that with the Sports LA, Eastern Mountain Sports bankruptcies and other smaller ones, the impact of bankruptcies on the full year, on same-property NOI percent growth is about 40 basis points. I'll let Jim actually talk about the real estate. But that's the impact to the numbers and the guidance.
Jim Thompson: Yes. As Lisa indicated, Target assumed our Northern California lease which is a huge merchandising upgrade for us. Our two remaining other leases, both stores are closed today. We expect a slight discount to in-place rents with 12 to 18 months of downtime associated with those. But we're actively engaged with -- in dialogue with replacement retailers. So we feel pretty good about the replacement prospect at this point. Obviously, a upgrade to quality of the retailer.
Tayo Okusanya: Just one more for me. The Clarendon asset that was acquired close to a 4% cap, could you talk a little bit about what ultimate stabilized yields would be after all the mark-to-market and as well as the redevelopment of the adjacent parcel? Like, what could that number look like and how soon could you get there with that?
Lisa Palmer: In terms of how soon we could get there, the way we took, I believe, a conservative approach to underwriting the redevelopment opportunity of, really, the vacant building and don't expect to receive any income from that parcel until 2018. So we do have time. I'd also like to point out, we've already outperformed our initial underwriting with some tenants -- a tenant exercising a renewal option and then also we had projected the sports club that there's to move out. And they've actually -- they're still paying rent as well. In terms of stabilized yield, it's in the same ballpark as all the others. And we're looking at our acquisitions that with going-in cap rates of a 5% to a 5.5% and stabilizing near 6%. Market Common Clarendon will not be any different than that which is evidenced by the north of 5% NOI growth that we're projecting there.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Floris van Dijkum with Boenning. Please proceed with your question.
Floris van Dijkum: I had one question for Lisa in terms of -- and obviously you guys have done a great job on the balance sheet. I noticed you got -- as you think about terming out your debt, are you going to be looking to -- for any new bond offerings, et cetera to look to extend the maturity on your existing debt outstanding?
Lisa Palmer: Floris, it will really depend on if we have -- if any other investment opportunities. We still have some equity to put to use. But to the extent that can find acquisitions or increase the size of our development pipeline and we would think about funding that not with -- just not just with equity but potentially with new debt and also potentially with property sales. And it will depend on really the capital markets at that time because right at this moment, there's no need for additional debt.
Hap Stein: Tremendous amount of flexibility, as both Lisa and I indicated.
Floris van Dijkum: Right. And then the other question is more of a strategic question in terms of Clarendon. And I know, Lisa, you and I've probably talked about this over the past couple of years. But as you look out 2 to 3 years, do you expect that Regency is going own more of these kinds of big, dominance sort of lifestyle centers? Or do you think this is sort of a one-off?
Hap Stein: We'll be on several larger community shopping centers. We have a great property in Raleigh, North Carolina, kind of shopping center that we've owned for well over 10 years. We redevelop an iconic property, made it iconic, in Westlake in Southern California. So community shopping centers, some of whom -- some of which have some lifestyle components has been a part of our strategy long term and will continue to be. But I would still say that it's in the 20%-plus percent range today as a percentage of NOI. And it may go up some, but not substantially. As we said often, our strategy is community and neighborhood shopping centers and will continue to be so.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt from Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Craig Schmidt: I guess my question is also on the Market Common Clarendon. You mentioned near-term expiring. And it sounded like in Tayo's question you mentioned the Washington Sports Club maybe leaving. Are there any other anchor or junior anchors leaving? Or is the rest of the near-term lease expiring in line shops?
Lisa Palmer: We don't -- the renewal also was the bittersweet. It was actually Barnes & Noble. So we did -- there is significant upside in that rent, even after. Renewal option was even a large increased. What we had underwritten was that it was going to be down for little while, while we replaced it with a better operator. Such that it was bittersweet. We kept the income at a higher rent, but now we have to wait, I believe, the renewal was for five years. So now we have to for another five years in order to replace that tenant. Beyond that, we do have -- so Washington Sports Club is also a short-term renewal. And we anticipate that we will have the opportunity to replace that as well at a higher rent
Jim Thompson: And we have the right to terminate when we find a replacement later.
Lisa Palmer: And then the other upside is really -- it comes from smaller spaces and then the redevelopment of the vacant parcel.
Craig Schmidt: The vacant parcel, is it eat or west of the center? Does it have Clarendon exposure?
Lisa Palmer: I'm a female. We don't think north, south, east, west. It actually -- so the front door today actually comes out to Clarendon Boulevard. So it's facing the Barnes & Noble. We could potentially reconfigure that so that that the door could face the Whole Foods and do ground-floor retail so that it is -- it does have Clarendon exposure. We think that there's incredible amount of upside there.
Hap Stein: It really does sit on the pin corner of the property.
Craig Schmidt: Okay. I notice you have a Cheesecake Factory. In the renovation of that out-parcel -- I'm sorry, parcel, would you be adding maybe more restaurants?
Lisa Palmer: So Cheesecake Factory is down the other -- I guess that would be, it's toward DC, I know that -- no, it's the other way. It's opposite DC. It's down the other end. Very well could be restaurants. But I wouldn't anticipate it being a large-use restaurant like that. I would anticipate smaller and have some outdoor seating because there is a little bit of a courtyard there. But again, we're in the really early stages. We did give ourselves some time to really explore what would be the best long-term use
Hap Stein: Throughout the project we expect to be able to add some additional excellent restaurant operators. We think that's a real opportunity there. And just to note, the parcel that's available is an old Sears which is, as Lisa and Jim indicated, is strategically located on the site.
Operator: There are no other questions in queue. I'd like to hand the call back over to management for closing comments.
Hap Stein: We appreciate your time and interest in Regency. Thank you very much. And everybody have a great day and the rest of the week. And if you're in hot weather, stay cool.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And have a wonderful day.

===== 2016 Q1  (2016-05-04 14:00:00) =====
Executives: Mike Mas - SVP of Capital Markets Hap Stein - Chairman & CEO Lisa Palmer - President & CFO Mac Chandler - EVP, Development Jim Thompson - EVP, Operations
Analysts: Jay Carlington - Green Street Advisors Jeff Donnelly - Wells Fargo Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets Anthony Hau - SunTrust Greg Schweitzer - Deutsche Bank Chris Lucas - CapitalOne Securities
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Regency Centers Corporation First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to your host Mike Mas.
Mike Mas: Good afternoon, and welcome to Regency's first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Hap Stein, our Chairman and CEO; Lisa Palmer, our President and Chief Financial Officer; Mac Chandler, Executive Vice President of Development; Jim Thompson, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Chris Leavitt, Senior Vice President and Treasurer. Before we begin, I'd like to address forward-looking statements that may be discussed on the call. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. We also request that callers observe a two-question limit during the Q&A portion of our call in order to give everyone a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. I will now turn the call over to Hap.
Hap Stein: Thanks Mike. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Regency's team continues to execute well on the critical components of our well-honed strategy. The underlying fundamentals of our portfolio remain very healthy. This is evident by growth in core FFO per share of 8%, strong rate growth in occupancy and same property NOI growth of 4% for the seventh consecutive quarter. We continue to reap the benefits from the quality of our portfolio amplified by the tail winds of favorable market conditions. Retail supply remains tight while demand for space in prime locations continues at a rational pace. We are experiencing particularly strong demand from quality quick-serve restaurants, health & fitness users, leading traditional grossers, discount para retailers and pet stores. And while the fundamentals are healthy for most of the retail, restaurants and service companies, they are represented in our centers, fallout from industry store rationalization will continue. We are now obviously witnessing this play out in the sporting goods sector which include a bankruptcy filing of the sports authority in Eastern Mountain Sports. While there will likely be some impact or end of life growth, the quality of our real estate affords us the ability to cap on these opportunities in the long run. We are placing a struggling operator with the more productive line, has been and always will be better for a long term NOI growth rate. Turning to development, our industry leading local teams continue to source compelling new development and re-development opportunities building the pipeline that positions us to start and deliver average of $200 million or more of exceptional projects. This quarter we started one ground up project in Houston, located in a master plan community that includes Exxon's World Headquarters. A large scale re-development near Aventura Mall near Miami and completed two whole food centers one in D.C. and one in Dallas. As I said before the development business is not for novices. And the environment remains competitive for the limited opportunities that made our criteria. With that said I believe we have the right team to capitalize on the expansion especially investing class traditional grossers. They continue to find investment opportunities supported by this expansion with demand from shop and category leading junior anchor retailers. As I look forward as we have a keen eye on the mature state of recovery, and understand the volatile nature of the capital markets, I am confident we are well positioned to continue our positive momentum. Will we find ourselves in a pro-longed recovery or an economic downturn or whether the pace of rationalization accelerates, my confident stems from the outstanding quality of our portfolio, our disciplined and proven development capabilities, our rock solid balance sheet and our extremely talented team focused on growing shareholder value. Lisa?
Lisa Palmer: Thank you Hap and good afternoon everyone. NAREIT FFO for the quarter was $0.86 per share. This includes approximately $7 million of gains on land parcels as well as pursue costs related to acquisition activity which I will address later. These items together with expected additional acquisition pursue costs are incorporated into our new NAREIT FFO per share guidance range of $3.22 to $3.28. This is an increase of $0.04 at both ends. As Hap noticed Core FFO for the first quarter increased 8% for the first quarter of 2015 and same property NOI growth once again exceeded 4%. Consistent with prior quarter's base rank continues to be the largest contributing factor. We do expect the property to analyze moderate throughout the moderate of the year as we expect higher costs for commenced, camera conciliations and the potential impact of the recently announced bankruptcies. I also want to caution that the second quarter has the potential to fall below the bottom end of our guidance range. As the second quarter is the quarter where the majority of our prior year reconciliations are finalized. So with that said, our full year 2016 same property growth guidance remains unchanged at 2 and 3 quarters at 3.5%. With respect to the recently announced bankruptcies the legal process remain fluid. Between sports authority and Easter Mountain Sports we have five locations at risk. We fully reserve against any unpaid pre-petition reg. After second situation specifically released two-tenths and studying the competitive positions of our impacted locations we developed what appears to be reasonable set of functions and probabilities supporting our same property growth rate range. These assumptions included combination of accepted and rejected leases but do not include the scenarios of full-loss at every location. From an occupancy standpoint the same property portfolio rose back above 96% lease with shop base right at 92% lease. Move outs and bad debts remain low and we avoid the usual first quarter seasonal dip in occupancy. This is a very good proxy for the underlying portfolio. As our portfolio achieved higher occupancy levels we are able to be very selective with merchandizing and leverage pricing power through better steps and strong releasing stretch. In fact, rent growth for new lease assigned during the first quarter was 50%. This is primarily due to the release of one of our Haggen bosses that we purchase out of bankruptcy. ‘ We released it to one top specially grossers in Southern California. It's another classic example of where bad news is great news when you have the opportunity to re-merchandize or redevelop quality real estates as we have accomplished time and time again. Turning now to the capital markets activity. We seek out to enhance our balance sheet by astutely accessing capital to efficiently fund investments. As we did with the forward offering completed in March. To that end we are leased to share some high level information on our pending acquisition activity as well as offer our general guidance on when we intend to draw down our forward equity. We currently have great visibility in the two acquisition opportunities. The first includes the retail portion of an iconic mixed-use property in Metro D.C. strategically located in island scenario which most of you do know that is one of the premier neighborhoods in that region. Consistent with our mixed use strategy we are partnering with Avalon Bay one of the most well respected in the industry. They will own and operate the residential component. The resale featured several key anchors and many leases below market, they are exceptional analyzed growth potential for even further upside redevelopment. The second opportunity is located outside Seattle in a highly desirable sub-market that will augment our platform which is already deep in that market. This property will be a perfect addition to our North West portfolio. Combined this acquisition should approximate $325 million in total purchase price. And we expect to close on each before the end of the second quarter. For each closing we intend to draw down a portion of our forward equity offering while at the same time expanding our existing term loan facility to provide for an additional $100 million of debt capital. Our new amended term loan will have similar pricing of what it has today but will mature in 2022 adding 2.5 years to the existing maturity date. The remaining forward equity proceeds will be available for additional acquisitions between now and June of next year. Finally, we closed on another great shopping center during the quarter. Garden City Park located on Long Island not only increases our presence in metro New York but also presented us with an immediate redevelopment opportunity. This well located center offers significant upside with below market rent and re merchandizing potential. We plan to begin work on the redevelopment within the next 60 days. Most importantly of all, the NOI growth on levered IRR to Garden City and the two pending acquisitions are accretive to our portfolio. To wrap it up I am very pleased with these quarter's results and the accomplishments our team has achieved. I thank you for listening and we now open for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jay Carlington with Green Street Advisors, please proceed with your question.
Jay Carlington: Hey thanks for taking the question. I guess just a follow up on Sports Authority in Eastern Mountain, can you give a little bit more color on the assumptions you are expecting there? How that impacts same property on a wide growth in 2016?
Hap Stein: Sure I will address what happened in the first quarter and then I will let Jim talk about with individual stores in what we are comfortable with saying in public anyways. So in my prepared remarks hopefully you heard that we do fully reserve all unpaid pre-petition rent. So for the first quarter that was approximately $250,000. If you look at that in isolation, its' less than 20 basis points. However, obviously you can't really look at that in isolation, we evaluate the health of all our tenants and the remaining tenants in maybe Eastern Mountain Sports and few others that are struggling a little bit are extremely healthy. And going forward obviously I said in my prepared remarks, that we are assuming we already know for example one location that was a closed on our list but others, we just have a list of assumptions as to when that store may close if at all and we are assuming that some of them may be accepted. So again just to reiterate, those assumptions are incorporated into the range in 2 or 3 quarters right now, I am not sure I am giving you that much more detail today.
Jay Carlington: Okay. So maybe as a quick follow up, you mentioned the Q2 weakness you are expecting here, is some of that more Sports Authority or that's more the comps that are effecting that?
Hap Stein: It's all free, higher comps from percent, the higher comps from camera reconciliation and then there is also the bankruptcies.
Jay Carlington: And maybe switching gears on the acquisition, is there a rough slit you can give on Seattle and D.C. in terms of the size and then can you maybe talk about what type of IRR you are underwriting for those acquisitions?
Hap Stein: So we increased our guidance to 340 and we have already closed on one property in the first quarter so basically the Seattle asset, we are not allowed to disclose the purchase price for the market common clarity at this time. Once we close on that we will be able to do that. So I would tell you that the Seattle asset is in the range of $35 million to $40 million per purchase price and then in terms of under-writing I would just again reemphasize that the NOI growth and the IRR composed are creative to our portfolio and also I will give you some color for current market. As of this quality today if you were to talk to some of the brokers in the market, they will tell you that Gateway markets, they are trading at 5.5% of unlevered IRRs. And in market common ours is 75 to 100 basis points north of that and for the Seattle asset add another 100 blips to that so we feel very good about these acquisitions and the returns we are getting and we are able to add value with the expertise and talent that we have from our team. The Long Island is even better than that, double-digit IRRs, unleveraged, all unleveraged.
Jay Carlington: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Jeff Donnelly: Good afternoon folks, question on leasing trends. I am curious about leasing trends specifically for inline spaces. Are you able to break that our for us for new and renewal away from the activity?
Jim Thompson: Yes, on the shop space leasing we are basically 12.1% growth on the new and on the renewal I guess 12%, on the renewal per shop space and shop space is smaller than 10,000.
Jeff Donnelly: And maybe, I am curious how you are thinking about maximum occupancy your next goal because you are pretty close to 92% on small shop leasing and wondering if there is as far as you can push it or is there another goal post Regency is going to set where it wants to be?
Lisa Palmer: Many of you probably heard me say this before, we own 212 properties today, though 212 was the whole portfolio that we owned back in 2006 which was our priority and that same pool of properties for 2006 and 2007 was 96.7% and 96.6% lease so basically maintaining percent lease above 96.5% for over four quarters at least. So I do think we have a little bit more runway and you can't underestimate how much we have improved the quality of the portfolio from 10 years ago.
Jeff Donnelly: Was that shop occupancy or overall occupancy?
Lisa Palmer: That's overall occupancy. So the shop occupancy was north of 92%.
Jeff Donnelly: Okay. Understood and one other follow up, I think Regency has about 50 properties located outside of top 50 MSAs, it's not a big part of value or big part of base rent but many of those properties have rents that are inline or even above the base rent of your top 50 markets so do you see those assets or markets as a source of funds down the road or it just strikes me that they might have a weaker return on investment profile in your top 50 assets?
Unidentified Company Representative: I believe one of those markets is Raleigh Durham which is outside of top 50 markets Jeff and we see a very good not only about the portfolio but the portfolio in Raleigh or the upside of that so I mean you have to be careful about where that might be, so I feel good about the upside throughout the portfolio and we are all continuing to evaluate as we have proven in the past to sell those assets and shopping centers who have lower long term growth profile. And the only other color I would add to that is often the - the university town will be outside of the top 50 and we have enjoyed significant growth in a lot of those assets as well.
Jeff Donnelly: That's great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Lena [ph] with J P Morgan. Please proceed with your question.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, what are your plans for refinancing your perpetual preferred coming due next year?
Hap Stein: The perpetual preferred doesn't actually have a maturity date, that's what we really like about it so we have no intentions right now to either call next year but no plans to do that right now. That's the thing we really like about preferred stock.
Jim Thompson: And the call option which is our period.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Got it thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets, please proceed with your question.
Rich Moore: Hello guys, good afternoon, first thing Lisa I am curious that you guys have always been Core FFO sort of place and I am really big on using NAREIT FFO but I get used to the idea that I was supposed to use Core FFO for Regency and now you are citing NAREIT FFO, are you switching the focus to NAREIT FFO, which I think would be great by the way but I am just curious if you are?
Lisa Palmer: Appreciate your opinion, over the last year probably longer we have been providing both and providing guidance on both. We think both are relative metrics and as long as we provide all of the information and are fully [ph] so that you all see what is in Core FFO and what is not, we'll continue to report both.
Unidentified Speaker: Yes, Rich we noted NAREIT FFO in press releases because we updated that range so we only update the ranges that are impacted.
Rich Moore: Yes, okay thank you and then I am curious on Houston, we have heard all this concern about Houston and it clearly hasn't come to pass and you guys have roughly 5% or so of AVR there, how is Houston doing if I was to start another project there and do you have any specific like same growth metrics for the market or anything you can share specifically on Houston?
Hap Stein: Yes, on our portfolio itself it's one of our stronger portfolio. We have got 7 out of 10 properties that are located in master plan communities. Out of that portfolio we are 98.7% leased today. Q1 we are seeing 6.6% property NOI growth so we feel very good about that market, retailers are pressing strong sales which continue to drive expansion and we are real comfortable with the market today. Yes, this is - it's part of the reason why we like the Springwoods, it shows similar characteristics. It's got - being a master plan community. It's anchored by one of the top grossers in long term base and we have seen results. We have got great producing activity or 71% lease-to-date following [indiscernible] 8% so we love that and we think that's why we are really in Houston and we would love to see more opportunities similar to this one.
Rich Moore: Okay. Good thank you and I sort of had the same question as a follow up on the San Francisco, Oakland MSA as well because now that's the new hot spot where San Francisco is going to become the new ghost town because of the technology and I wonder if you guys are seeing any softness there?
Mac Chandler: Yes, I think I can speak to that. This is Mac and we are not, I think that's the large part because of our centers. We have great centers, they are with big grossers, and they are necessity based retailer for the large part so part of what makes them unique is tremendous [indiscernible] in the past cycles so it's very supply constrained and are performing really quite well and we're not going to lose about that market, it's one of our best portfolios.
Rich Moore: Okay. Great thanks guys.
Mac Chandler: Thanks Rich.
Operator: Our next question comes from Anthony Hau with SunTrust, please proceed with your question.
Anthony Hau: Good afternoon guys the story in part of this call so someone maybe already asked this question but can you comment on why the lease occupancy went down by 200 bips?
Mac Chandler: Sure, this is Mac. It's pretty simple in that case, we actually signed a lease with a hair salon and prior to us delivering the space to them they ran into some trouble at some other locations and they basically backed out of the lease and we have backups we are already talking to so.
Hap Stein: It's not about the whole thing on where we are on the leasing standpoint even though the center has just been completed.
Mac Chandler: Yes, the Whole Foods opened last month and they are doing tremendous, well above their projections. If you get a chance, this side of the North Orange County, it is one of our best developed, best looking asset and that's merchandise asset so we are 90% leased. We could have reached really two or three times over, we have turned away a lot of cash so we have been very patient and we held out a couple of spaces and we really see no issues getting those spaces leased up. So if you are in Southern California please take a chance to stop by.
Anthony Hau: One last question, I know that Sports Authority didn't have a huge impact on the portfolio and hence you guys have only three stores but have you guys adjusted those stores ready and are there any potential upsides for those boxes?
Mac Chandler: Yes, we have already talked about those properties, I will let Jim talk about the real estate.
Jim Thompson: In general I wouldn't expect to see a lot of upside but at the end of the day we are comfortable with the real estate, there will be good demand for our retail spaces.
Hap Stein: As we said in our prepared remarks, to replace the struggling operator with a better operator is going to be better for the long term.
Anthony Hau: Okay. Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Greg Schweitzer from Deutsche Bank, please proceed with your question.
Greg Schweitzer: Hi everyone, just going back to - just apologize if I missed the spec. in terms of the upside from the market leases that you mentioned with the retail component almost fully leased, when do some of those leases rollover where you could realize those gains?
Hap Stein: We have retailed the entire Basin building which has some upside as well, I don't Greg if you have had an opportunity to visit the center, and it's across the street. No, that's what we are buying so there are different parts within the center. The main retail component is anchored by Barnes & Noble and I will agree when I said the prepared remarks, that would be half the example of where bad news would be great news. As we would love to get that space back. But the center was built a little over 10 years ago, we would expect we are going to really realize some of that growth profit, it will certainly increase over the next 12 months but I think you will see the bigger step certainly in 2018 as when we start to see growth in the underlying.
Greg Schweitzer: And then on the potential redevelopment that you mentioned could you share any details on the scope or what you are thinking about there?
Hap Stein: It’s really early in the process and there are many different alternatives so it's a little too early to share much detail but it is a potential to be retail and perhaps multifamily shop, could be all retail, there could be a potential of moving some of the candidates to that, the other existing candidates to that location but it's way too early. We could lease it till one year though.
Greg Schweitzer: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question is Chris Lucas from CapitalOne Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Chris Lucas: Yes, hi good afternoon everyone, just a follow up on market comments, is there an office component to that I believe is that correct?
Lisa Palmer: So we really are evaluating the different alternatives as to what we may do with that parcel and no decisions have been made. No matter what we do there will be significant offices from what is existing there today.
Chris Lucas: Can you guys disclose what the relationship is, is it sort of percentage ownership between you and Avalon at this point, has it been discussed?
Lisa Palmer: Go for it Mike.
Mike Mas: Chris it's not the way we have seen it, written about, talked about as a joint venture and although technically we will close as JV the idea is to kind of minimize immediately so we will have to make a structure out of it. So we will have physical and legal ownership of only our component. We can't at this point in time unfortunately talk about purchased price details and the difference between the multifamily retail and looking forward to doing that on closing and you will release a press release at that time.
Hap Stein: We will get all the economic benefits from the retail and Avalon will get all the economic benefits from the multifamily and we expect to have the thing before the end of the year.
Mac Chandler: I would like to reiterate, as Mac said, as you know typically we are not releasing the purchase price prior to closing so as soon as that happens more than happy to share that information publicly.
Chris Lucas: Can I just go back and tie though the office building ownership into that? Kind of where does that?
Mac Chandler: That is 100% ours.
Chris Lucas: That is yours that is your upside?
Mac Chandler: Correct.
Chris Lucas: Thank you that's all I needed.
Mac Chandler: We look at that as a vacant building with significant amount of upstart.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time, I would like to turn the call back to Hap Stein for closing comments.
Hap Stein: We appreciate your time wish you a great rest of the week and a terrific weekend. Thank you very much.

Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Regency Centers Corporation Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Mike Mas, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets. Thank you. You may begin.
Mike Mas: Good morning, and welcome to Regency’s fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Hap Stein, our Chairman and CEO; Lisa Palmer, our President and Chief Financial Officer; Mac Chandler, Executive Vice President of Development; Jim Thompson, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Chris Leavitt, Senior Vice President and Treasurer. Before we begin, I’d like to address forward-looking statements that may be discussed on the call. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. We also request that callers observe a two-question limit during the Q&A portion of our call in order to give everyone a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. I will now turn the call over to Hap.
Hap Stein: Thanks Mike. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call. The hard work and talent of Regency’s team is clearly visible as we continue to achieve our strategic objectives, highlighted by delivering growth in Core FFO per share, nearly 8%, and total shareholder return well in excess of the peer average on a one, three, and five-year basis. I’m very proud of these achievements. Results like these are a product of four simple ingredients. First, our irreplaceable portfolio continues to benefit from its inherent quality. Historically, low levels of new supply and tenant demand to locate in the best centers. The result was same property NOI growth at or above 4% for the fourth consecutive year. Second, our industry-leading development team remains focused on applying a proven disciplined strategy to create and enhance centers at compelling spreads to the cost of acquiring centers of comparable quality. In spite of the limited number of opportunities that meet our criteria, combination of our development, and redevelopment starts, and our pipeline position us to deliver an average of $200 million of exceptional projects annually. Third, we continue to cost-effectively finance new investments through our match funding strategy. This year we have improved our net debt to EBITDA ratio to 5.2 times, while lessening near-term maturities, and reducing our overall cost of debt. And the last key ingredient is our dedicated team and special culture. You only have to look to our recent promotions to understand the strength and depth of Regency’s bench. This past November, following the announcement of Brian Smith’s retirement, we were fortunate to move quickly with the appointments of Lisa Palmer as President and Chief Financial Officer, Jim Thompson as Executive Vice President of Operations, and Mac Chandler as EVP of Development. All three have held influential positions with Regency, averaging over 20 years of tenure. While we are fortunate to welcome Jim and Mac to our Senior Executive Team, we are equally excited to backfill their leadership positions internally, enabling us to maintain our effective regional structure and capitalize on the breadth of talent that we at Regency take pride in cultivating. Before handing the call over to Lisa, let me quickly say that although we feel Regency is extremely well-positioned for the future, we have a wary eye of the fragile nature of the economy and financial markets. That said, given the quality of our portfolio, our disciplined development program, rock-solid balance sheet, and the focus and talent of our team, we are well-poised to build on our positive momentum, and expect to thrive in good times, while weathering and possibly profiting in difficult times. Lisa?
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Hap, and good morning everyone. I’ll be brief today with the recap of results, followed by a summary of our guidance, which we did release in early January. First, Core FFO for the year increased nearly 8% over 2014. As Hap said, same property NOI growth, of 4.4%, marked the fourth consecutive year of at least 4% growth. Base rent continues to be the largest contributing factor, resulting from gains in leased shop space, strengthening embedded rent steps and strong re-leasing spreads. Small shop percent leased increased nearly 92% as move-outs remain at historically low levels. In terms of the same property portfolio, we ended the year at 95.8% leased. And this includes an impact of 30 basis points from two Haggen supermarket locations that we successfully recaptured late last year. We’re already well on our way to upgrading these shopping centers with new vibrant anchors, allowing us to create value in the near-term. The Haggen bankruptcy is a prime example of a triggering event that can lead to unlocking significant value creation through re-tenanting or through redevelopment. These opportunities exist throughout our high-quality portfolio, and our team works actively to harvest them. In fact, including our expectations for 2016 we will have invested more than $250 million in redevelopments over a four-year span at very compelling returns. Turning to G&A, let me add some color given the elevated level in the fourth quarter. As previously disclosed, please recall that we incurred a one-time expense of $2.2 million in the fourth quarter related to our recent executive management changes. Excluding this charge, net G&A expense for the full year was within the guidance range that we originally provided. Looking at 2016, our guidance remains unchanged from what we released a few weeks ago. Core FFO per share at the mid-point is expect to grow my more than 6%, with same-property NOI growth in the range of two-and-three quarters, to 3.5%. This includes a positive impact from redevelopments of less than 50 basis points. In terms of occupancy, we expect our same property portfolio to end the year in excess of 96% leased, with the possibility of a modest dip in the first quarter as we have traditionally experienced that. Turning now to capital markets activity, we continue to cost-effectively strengthen an already conservative balance sheet. By continuing to match fund our investments with property sales or common equity, when that common equity is priced reasonably in line with our view of NAV and a compelling use of funds. Consistent with that strategy, we raised $24 million during the quarter through our ATM, which will pre-fund a portion of our development spend this year. We also continued to experience healthy demand and pricing on the properties we’re taking to market. Lastly and as you saw in our press release, we announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.50 per share. The continued strength of our operating performance and our financial position enables us to increase our dividend, while maintaining a conservative payout ratio. Thank you for listening, and we now welcome your questions.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Craig Schmidt: Just given your eye on the economic and financial markets; has that impacted your thinking regarding growing the development pipeline at this point, or has that not reached at that point?
Hap Stein: No, it’s just we -- our developments are extremely well-conceived, focused on shopping centers that are going to make sense for the long-term. We do a significant amount of pre-leasing, it’s definitely sponsored by great anchor tenants, and where we have a strong indication of interest from side shop retailers. What we may do though is we may decide as a result of kind of what may be happening out there is, in the environment, is decided to, and we’ve done this in the past, is decide to pay some of the side shop space. But at the same point in time, we’ve got a very focused development program. Our exposure to development is substantially less than it was going into the last down cycle. So we feel like we’re very well-positioned to continue to grow the development program on a disciplined basis.
Craig Schmidt: Okay. And then just, I think you have three sports authority, do you have a sense of where their rents are relative to market?
Hap Stein: I’ll turn that question over to Jim Thompson.
Jim Thompson: We do have three sports authorities. And at the end of the day, we’re not seeing a lot of upside in those deals, but we feel very confident that if we get them back that there’s a good re-let opportunity, and I guess about a 50 basis points of total rents. So our exposure is unanimous.
Craig Schmidt: Okay, thank you.
Hap Stein: Thanks, Craig.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Metz from UBS. Please go ahead.
Jeremy Metz: Hey, good morning. Lisa, I know you guys just settled the forward, but as you're thinking about the sources and uses of capital this year, is that something you’d consider again given the flexibility it gave you, or you just stick with dispositions and the ATM as a means to fund development in any, I guess, potential acquisitions?
Lisa Palmer: Jeremy, an important thing I think to point out for the reason why we actually use the forward is because we had a definite use of proceeds. If you’ll recall, we went under contract to buy University Commons very early in the year, right, when we basically did the forward, with the delayed close. So for a forward to make sense, I think that there needs to be a very definite use of proceeds, with a definite time to sell that. Without that we would simply rely on property sales and the use of equity when it makes sense in terms of how it’s priced relative to our view of NAV.
Jeremy Metz: Okay. And then just in terms of acquisitions, dispositions, are you seeing any movement today in pricing or bidder pools across, I guess, both what you’re trying to sell, which is more, maybe called secondary today? And then how does that compare to the stuff that you’re looking at buying, you know, are your deal guys underwriting or getting more conservative on what they underwrite for new deals today?
Lisa Palmer: Really, I guess, three separate questions. I’ll take each one separately. First, in terms of what we’re trying to buy, we have not seen any changes still highly competitive in nature. There’s not a lot of product even coming to market for the types of centers that meet our investment criteria. And when they do, especially for marketed deals, there’s heightened competition. We haven’t had the need to change how we’re underwriting. We do a look-back on everything we buy and develop. And our underwriting -- our actual performance, from everything that we have bought and developed over the last four to five years has exceeded our underwriting expectations. From what we’re selling, we’re starting to hear that there’s some softening, but we haven’t seen -- for the secondary lower-quality properties. But we haven’t seen it yet. And I think I’d like to think that even though we’re selling our lower-quality, lower-growth properties, our lower-quality/lower-growth properties, on a relative basis, are still of moderate quality, if that makes sense. So we haven’t seen a whole lot of movement in those cap rates yet.
Jeremy Metz: All right, thanks.
Hap Stein: Thank you, Jeremy.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christine McElroy from Citi. Please go ahead.
Christine McElroy: Hi, good morning guys. Lisa, just for the 2.75 to 3.5% same store NOI growth forecast in 2016, what’s the expected impact from redevelopment?
Lisa Palmer: 50 basis points plus or minus in 2016.
Christine McElroy: I’m sorry, what was that? How many?
Lisa Palmer: About 50 basis points, 5-0.
Christine McElroy: Okay, great. Got you, thank you. And then just compared to your re-leasing spreads of 9% in 2015, what are you expecting in 2016? And given that your spreads on execution average more like 10% to 11% in the back-half of the year, much of that reflects these that's actually commencing occupancy in 2016?
Lisa Palmer: I’ll answer, and then I’m just going to shoot it over to Jim to add some color. But our expectations for 2016 are that we hope to be in the very high single-digits to double-digits again. And the back-half of the year, so much of the rent growth is going to be driven by if there are anchor leases to be done. So it’s really going to be driven by mix. So it’s not necessarily -- we have really high demand for our space. We’re pretty well-leased, as you know. And we expect that we’ll continue to be able to drive rents as a result of that. Well, Jim, you want to add anything?
Jim Thompson: Not a lot of color. I think the categories we’re seeing the most activity on today would be the restaurants, typically the chef-driven restaurants, the specialty fitness-type uses, as well as the pet category. And as we continue to get space back, our remerchandising, we get some pretty good pops when we go to those categories. We see those rents generally significantly higher than all the rest.
Christine McElroy: Great, thank you.
Hap Stein: Thank you, Christine.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of R.J. Milligan from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
R.J. Milligan: Hi, good morning. I was wondering if any of the macro volatility has given pause to some of the retailers, whether it would be new store openings on signing on renewals.
Hap Stein: Jim, you want to take this? And then back, and talk about from a grocery standpoint?
Jim Thompson: It’s a macro economy. It’s causing retailers to slow down; new store openings.
Hap Stein: We’re not seeing that. Our teams continue to be very bullish about the market. Our pipeline is continually on par or pace with what we’ve seen in the past. So really we’re not seeing a slow down at this point, quite frankly.
Mac Chandler: Yes, I'd say on the develop side it’s almost to the contrary. We’re seeing on the specialty grocers, and the best-in-class traditional grocers, they’re expanding to new markets. So two examples, Wegmans has announced they’ll push into the North Carolina, which is one our favorite markets. And Publix is moving up into Virginia. So, really to the contrary, we’re seeing expansion by these best-in-class grocers.
Hap Stein: A comment on both on the side shop retailers and restaurants, and on the grocers, and secondary anchors, there continues to be good demand for the best base, the best center, et cetera, but one of the things that is reassuring to me, and different from going in the last downturn, is they seem to be making very thoughtful and rational decisions. And that is somewhat comforting to us. Because I think that provides a more sustainable and more positive outlook for the long-term.
R.J. Milligan: Okay, thanks, that’s helpful. And the development, and redevelopment guidance for the years, 125 million to 225 million. Can you talk about the different factors that would drive you hitting either the low-end or the high-end of that guidance range?
Mac Chandler: Well, it’s really no different than most years. We have a very full pipeline of projects. But whether our projects start or not, sometimes it’s dependant on external forces, such as entitlement, such as an anchor lease getting signed in time. So projects can move forward, certainly by external events. And that’s why we got into somewhat wide, but really if you look at the pipeline for ’16, ’17, we’ve got $600 million worth of projects that we’re deep into. And they’re not all unique, but the pipeline visibility looks really good, and they’re best-in-class grocers, we like what we see.
Hap Stein: And that includes - that pipeline includes both developments, and redevelopments.
R.J. Milligan: Okay. So that range isn’t giving sort of a leeway for a potential pause and some of that activity, given the macro environment? This is more entitlement-based? And what projects pencil-out over the year?
Mac Chandler: It doesn’t, but it’s a pretty broad range, as you know. It’s only 30 days old. So we stand behind it.
R.J. Milligan: Okay. Thanks guys.
Hap Stein: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Vincent Chao: Hey, Jim. Good morning everyone. Just sticking with the macro environment, it sounds like the operating environment hasn’t really changed much for you, and best markets haven’t shifted just yet from what you’re seeing. And clearly, your balance sheet has been pretty good shape. I was just wondering if things get -- continue to get worse, would you consider taking leverage down even further from where it is, or are you pretty comfortable where you’re at?
Lisa Palmer: We’re certainly very comfortable with where we are. But that doesn’t mean that we wouldn’t consider taking leverage down further, as the opportunity present itself. We would do it if it only made sense on an opportunistic basis, whether that means issuing equity if equity is priced favorably, in order to invest in a new acquisition or to fund our development program, or if even, though this would have to be a significant, significant premium -- has it made sense to deliver more by using cash, and or equity to reduce the amount of debt we have outstanding.
Vincent Chao: Okay, thanks for that. And then just on the commentary about the 1Q occupancy dip which is traditional, seasonal dip there, just curious based on what you saw in the fourth quarter and so far in the first quarter if there's any reason to think that that seasonal dip might be bigger than it's been historically, anything on the watch list side of things?
Lisa Palmer: No, not at this time, and I think you might recall, last year, we actually didn’t really see that seasonal dip. But 2016 is a different year, and they’re, as we’ve talked about on this call already, the economy is even more fragile than it was 12 months ago. So I think there is just -- we just can’t be certain what may happen for the rest of this quarter.
Vincent Chao: Okay, but that’s not based on anything specifically that you’re following it sounds like?
Lisa Palmer: No, it is not.
Vincent Chao: Right, okay. And then, just last one from me, just as you think about the Fresh Look program, do you have enough data at this point to kind of compare and contrast some of those centers versus the others in terms of from a performance perspective?
Mac Chandler: Well, I guess I'd answer that a couple of ways. Our Fresh Look initiative really permeates the entire portfolio. So some centers are identified as Fresh Look and others are not. Really it’s a philosophy of upgrading tenants throughout the portfolio, and in select redevelopments that help our competitive position. But if you look at some of our recent redevelopments, in those we’ve had the opportunity to really dig deeper into the design aspect of those projects and the remerchandising. Those have performed really well, and you can look at the incremental returns. They are very strong and the spreads on those are very compelling. So we think it’s a successful program, but it never ends. We start over every year. So we think it’s a real competitive advantage for us.
Hap Stein: And what we are also seeing is an uplift in merchandizing related to that -- related to merchandizing part of Fresh Look and place-making part of Fresh Look, we’re also getting better rate growth and better NOI growth even above what we have originally anticipated.
Vincent Chao: Okay. Thank you.
Hap Stein: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Hau from SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Anthony Hau: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Are there any markets or submarkets that you have concerns about today? And I guess on the flipside, are there any market size you are particularly optimistic about for 2016?
Hap Stein: You want to -- Jim, you want to address…
Jim Thompson: I think in general if you kind of look at the board spectrum of our portfolio and look back at ‘15, I think really every market held it's own and there is really no laggards or challenges. As we look forward to ‘16, I think the same is true. One market that’s kind of outperformed is Florida, but that was probably quite frankly one of the last to pop back. So it’s throwing up some good numbers over the last three years, but in general, across the board, all the four pillars are performing quite well.
Hap Stein: And one market that obviously has our attention and we're lot focused on is Houston. You might speak to that, Jim.
Jim Thompson: Right. In Houston, we are blessed with a -- I think a very strong top performing portfolio. The assets are well located with average household incomes of $140,000; 98% leased, almost 5% same property NOI growth for 2015, which was over pretty good hurdle in ‘14. So we feel like we’re somewhat insulated from economic headwinds there, but we obviously are -- keep our finger on the pulse and making sure we’re keeping an eye on that. So we feel good about that -- very good about that portfolio.
Anthony Hau: Okay. Just one last question; what’s the component of growth for same store NOI in 2016 in terms of occupancy, rent bonds, and lease spreads?
Lisa Palmer: First, let me answer by saying what ‘15 was because I think that when you think about in relative to ‘16, I think it’s an important comparison. In 2016, we actually had about 100 -- I am sorry, in 2015, we had approximately 150 basis points of our growth came from occupancy list, if you will, so percent lease commenced. And then we had 140 basis points from rent steps and 110 from rent growth. And I know you all get sick of us pointing to our slide in our investor presentation about how we’re going to achieve our 3% same property NOI growth, but it’s really important to think about that. So when you think about ‘16, we should get about 140 basis points from our contractual rent steps. And with rent growth near double digits over the past 12 months and with the same expectation going forward, we should get another 110 to 120 basis points from that. So that gets us very near to bottom end of our range. Then we have 50 basis points plus or minus that we’re expecting from redevelopment. That takes us up to about -- call that 3.25, and so the range moving down the 275 or up to the upper part of our range will really depend on how some of these bankruptcies and/or move-out may impact or the ability just to continue to push our percent lease and our percent commence north of what it is today.
Anthony Hau: Okay. Thank you.
Hap Stein: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Jeff Donnelly: Good morning, folks. Lisa, I may be staying with that, I guess what aren’t your re-leasing spreads a little higher in 2016? Because it looks like your in-placed rents on lease is expiring this year are actually lower than they were I think in 2015. And if I am hearing you guys correctly in your commentary and the markets, it sounds like you guys continue to expect to see market rent growth. So I guess am I thinking about that right? I would have thought maybe spreads might have picked up.
Lisa Palmer: Yes, one thing that’s really difficult to communicate to you all is the number of those leases that have stated options. And when you have larger boxes with either smaller increases in rents and their option period or even flat which is very often the case, the lease expiration schedule doesn’t capture that.
Jeff Donnelly: Okay, understood. And maybe just a second question. Just concerning the dividend, I was curious what the thinking was behind the roughly 3% increase you guys put through? Was it just to manage down that payout ratio, I think you talked about, or I was expecting maybe it could have been more in line with FAD growth?
Lisa Palmer: Yes, but our general philosophy on dividend increases is that basically manage it down until we get to the point where we are more or less at our legal limit and the dividend increase will mirror our earnings increase. And reason for that in terms of managing down, you know,, cash is king and we are developer, and to the extent that we can use free cash flow to fund our developments versus issuing equity or selling property, we believe that makes a lot of sense.
Jeff Donnelly: Can you tell us, I mean, how far you are from that target that you’re looking for?
Lisa Palmer: Given that the legal limit is probably somewhere in the low 60s and we’re slightly below 64% on a Core FFO ratio and low 70s on AFFO, and we’re just about 72%; we're awfully close.
Jeff Donnelly: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Sullivan from Cowen Group. Please go ahead.
Jim Sullivan: Thank you. Good morning, guys. First question, just kind of follow-up to what I think Hap had commented earlier in response to a different question. We tend to think that if we’re going to get an economic slowdown that the small shop tenants being kind of thinly capitalized would be probably more vulnerable to whatever the economic slowdown entails. And I am just curious, Hap, are you hearing at all from small shop tenants request to either renegotiate leases or anybody indicating regret that they have agreed to bumps in their leases or anything that indicates any kind of distress on their part?
Hap Stein: We have a tin ear towards the latter. Obviously we are very close to it and with kind of all the noise that’s out there, we are focused on a couple overall comments is our portfolio given what we’ve sold and what we’ve invested in through acquisitions and development in our view is in much better shape than it was in 2007. We also believe that through our remerchandising efforts and if those -- also those tenants that have survived through the downturn and they are still operating and still expanding that the health of our tenants are much better from that standpoint. So that’s kind of a macro view. Jim, you want to comment kind of on at the property level, portfolio level what we are seeing?
Jim Thompson: Yes, Jim, you hit it on the head. That is absolutely smoke signal when you start to hear tenants coming back and trying to renegotiate and balking. We are not seeing any of that at this point. But again our property managing folks and folks in the fields clearly understand that is the smoke signal, a warning sign. And our property management folks are also -- sales is a big indicator, so they are out, they are talking to tenants, talking to grocers, and getting anecdotal information almost on a weekly basis. So we are keeping our finger on the pulse.
Jim Sullivan: And then, second question regarding what’s happening among the grocers. We’ve clearly seen a series of announcements recently about major banners looking to expand whether it’s in North Carolina, Virginia, and it is looking to be a very competitive market share battle there. And I guess that kind of gives rise to kind of a two-part question. On the one hand, that would seem to present some ground up development opportunities for you or even some redevelopment opportunities. And I just wonder in that respect if you are able to given the competitive situation among the grocers, get better returns on whatever incremental capital you would invest. And kind of conversely the other side of that, to what extend do you get concerned that there might be too new supply planned for those markets?
Hap Stein: Well, I want to scale it, and Mac will speak to little bit of the specifics. But from an opportunity standpoint, I think that allows us to be more selective from a development standpoint, which is a good thing. And not every development opportunity we see is going to meet our criteria. And we are going to make sure that our development program is right-sized. From an overall competitive standpoint, that’s one of the reasons that we focused on. So there are grocers that are highly productive. And $600 a square foot and $30 million in sales are two metrics that we kind of focus a lot on. And when we are selecting and operator for development, a grocer for development, we’re going to look at who we think is going to generate the sales and also attract the better side shop retailers and not get outflanked either by existing or new competition. Lastly, I would say is while we haven’t been perfect, I think we’ve got a very good track record as far as being able to navigate the ongoing consolidation, ongoing competition in the grocer business. Mac, is there anything?
Mac Chandler: Yes. The only thing I would add is with tenants expanding in the new markets, I don’t think it provides so much competition that our returns are going up, development still is competitive as always. So, we don’t think that will change. And we’re seeing some markets where people have actually dropped their returns. But in certain of those cases, those are risk adjusted returns. But when we look at new development, we always look at the quality of grocer, the location, and if the center once complete going to be accretive to our quality. So we are very mindful of too many grocers in any one trade area and that’s a big part of our discipline that goes into who we sign up.
Hap Stein: Yes, and key is from our standpoint is we would rather give up a few basis points in returns to have the right risk adjusted -- have the right development and even pass on the development, or we have the right development with the right anchors and the right lineup of side shops and maybe even phases and pick up the return when there is a little bit more certainty out there.
Jim Sullivan: Okay, great. Thanks, Hap.
Hap Stein: Thank you, Jim.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Michael Mueller: Hey, thanks. I know you touched on before what you saw happening to non-core acquisitions and sales and stuff, but if you’re thinking about the core stuff that you tend to buy, what’s happening to that buyer pool? Are you seeing pure buyers? Are you seeing folks back off the accelerator in terms of being aggressive? Same amount of competition -- can you just size that up for us?
Lisa Palmer: I’ll start now, and I will let Hap add any color if he wants, but Mike now, in fact we’re not seeing any change whatsoever. There’s not a lot of supply of that type of center that meet our investment criteria. And when they do come to market -- and it’s very difficult to find them off market transaction as you know. There has to be some type of established relationship connection for that to happen. So for those at our market, we’re seeing our REIT brothering still competing for those centers and a lot of institutional capital as well. There is evidence of a center that traded recently in San Francisco with an un-levered IRR in the mid size. There is still a lot of capital pursuing the high-quality grocer anchor shopping centers.
Michael Mueller: Okay. Thank you.
Lisa Palmer: Thanks, Mike.
Hap Stein: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Moore from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Rich Moore: Hi, guys. Good morning. You have had a lot of stuff on the macro side of things. And I guess the one area that I am still thinking about is the consumer themselves. Have you seen any change in behavior of consumers whether it’s lower sales at the grocery stores or different mix of sales or some of the shops not doing as well as the other shops within the center that kind of a thing?
Hap Stein: Well, once again, we -- we are a little bit of a lagging indicator from that standpoint in that as opposed to malls there is a limited amount of -- we don’t get as much sales information from our tenants, and what we get from the grocers is it’s a year of rears. So what we are depending upon is the conversations we have with the retailers both at macro level that Jim and Mac and the team has, and Lisa and I have, and then what the property managers are hearing. And we are not hearing anything either from a reduction in the amount of new space. There is a certain amount of, as I said, rational caution on the part of the retailer, but we are not seeing anything more today than we saw six months ago. And all of our indicators -- all of our health indicators are fine right now. But our eyes and ears are open. Is there anything you want to add, Jim or Mac?
Rich Moore: Okay. Okay. So the other thing I was going to ask you is, is there any change in mix at the centers in terms of tenants? While there were some of the medical uses in like urgent care centers those kinds of things were getting popular, I mean are you seeing any shift in different types of tenants wanting space?
Hap Stein: Yes, as Jim and Mac said, it’s restaurants, it’s fitness, and it’s pet stores; those are the three, so to speak, [technical difficulty] service users out there.
Lisa Palmer: And I’ll just remind you, Rich, even though we may have had more medical kind of the doc in the box, the dentists, the chiropractors, and we like those uses. It was a never meaningful percentage of our space. It went from 2.5% to 5%. So it’s a meaningful increase, but still a pretty small percentage of our space.
Rich Moore: Okay. All right, good. Thank you guys.
Hap Stein: Thanks, Rich.
Lisa Palmer: Thanks, Rich.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.
George Hoglund: Hi, this is George on for Tayo. Just a couple of questions on the overall retail environment, I mean how are you guys feeling relative to three months ago in terms of kind of a store closure and bankruptcy and environment, and what you are seeing? And then also in terms of some of these concepts like the fitness locations; are you starting to get worried about kind of over-saturation of too many concepts?
Hap Stein: Well, I mean I can tell we haven’t seen significant change in the last three months. In terms of broad-based expansion by tenants in all different categories, we feel positive about it. I mean the natural cycle of retailers, you’ll see certain categories get too crowded. We’ve seen that in let’s say burgers for example or frozen yogurt, but they are very small margin. And we’re very selective with the tenants that we sign up and that's because we have the right amount of shop space, and you can see that in our occupancy and you can see in our rent growth. So, no material change from three months ago, but as we mentioned before, we are remindful of that and our ears are to the ground. But we haven’t seen anything to reveal.
George Hoglund: Thanks.
Hap Stein: Thanks, George.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Lucas from CapitalOne Securities. Please go ahead.
Chris Lucas: Yes, good morning everyone. Lisa, just a quick question on the balance sheet, You have $300 million of debt maturing in June of next year, the stock price is within a couple of bucks of the cycle high and you have the 10-year at 1.6%, today anyways. How are you thinking about maybe dealing with an advance the maturing unsecured debt for next year? And what are your options as you think through the current environment?
Lisa Palmer: Sure. Chris, for better or for worse, we already thought about the fact that we had a pretty chunky maturity in 2017, a couple of years ago. And we have hedged -- we have $220 million of forward-starting slots in place. So our interest rate risk is already hedged, if you will, for approximately -- for a $250-million unsecured bond offering, and we have no other plans at this time to do anything beyond that.
Chris Lucas: Okay, great. And then, I guess, Hap, maybe again going back to the demand side. One of your peers last week talked about demand coming from large boxes, the mom-and-pop's are back. It seems like the tenor of this call is completely different than just a week ago, but I just wanted to make sure that I'm not missing anything that in fact the demand remains broad and deep from the retailer side?
Hap Stein: Demand, I just want to be clear. Demand remains broad and deep. But at the same time, I think anybody in this environment that isn’t cognizant of the macro-events that are going around -- I mean, look, using a baseball analogy, this expansion has lasted a while. Let’s just say we’re in the seventh inning. There is a chance that we -- that this expansion could get rained, postponed due to a recession. And we don’t know whether the recession is going to be very shallow, like 2000, or deep, like in L.A. Most of the recessions in the past, just except for one or two have been pretty shallow. And that 2000 recession had very little impact, if at all on our rent growth, our occupancy, and our NOI growth. Or, I think there’s still a better chance that we’re going to continue –- the economy is going to continue to muddle on at least to the ninth inning. And it may be even to -- but it’s going to end at some point in time. And the key thing is the things that we can control, is the quality of our portfolio, the quality of our tenants within that portfolio. And the team is intensely focused on that. The quality of our developments and making sure that our development program is right-sized, and it has importance is at all, is the quality of the balance sheet. And our balance sheet has never been in better shape. And those are the ingredients that, well, as I said, not only allow us to thrive if things continue, if the economy continues to grow or muddle through, but also to withstand and weather the next downturn, and maybe even profit from that. So we just wanted to let you know in the call that we’re aware of the macro environment that’s out there. And I would think another key thing is, we haven’t seen any indications yet, whether it’s capital markets, from a demand for our shopping center, whether it’s tenant demand, both on the side-shop basis, or the anchor and the secondary-anchor basis.
Chris Lucas: Great, thank you.
Hap Stein: Thank you, Chris.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jay Carlington with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
Jay Carlington: Hi, guys, good morning. Maybe a quick question going back to Jim's question on the small shop leasing. I think you've mentioned that 92% is in your long-term peak occupancy target. I'm curious, what vacancy guidance for small shops this year?
Lisa Palmer: I don’t know that we’ve ever set a feeling of 92%. Let me go back a little back of history, back -- we reached our peak of small shop percent lease of 92.1, I believe in ‘06 or ’07, maybe even early '08, but as Hap just said, our portfolio is of much higher quality today due to a lot of the actions that we’ve taken. So I do believe that we could exceed the 92%. However, we’re not necessarily counting on it. So I go back to my -- the earlier question about the components of growth in our 2016 guidance. And for us, to reach the upper-end or our range, we’re going to have to increase the percent lease of small shops. And I would say the lower end would be more stable.
Jay Carlington: Okay. And maybe just a quick one; you took a $1.8 million impairment in the JV. Just curious what that was related to?
Lisa Palmer: I thought it was 100% owned properties, one that we did have. I’ll have to get back to you on that.
Jay Carlington: Okay.
Lisa Palmer: I’m not aware if we’re in the JV.
Jay Carlington: Okay. Yes, it was just on the JV portion, so, yes, we’ll follow-up offline. Thanks, that’s all I had.
Lisa Palmer: Okay.
Hap Stein: We will be back in touch.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have no further questions in queue at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Management for closing comments.
Hap Stein: Thank you for your time on the call. And everybody have a great rest of the week, and a great weekend. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude our teleconference for today. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Greetings and welcome to Regency Centers Corporation Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Mike Mas, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets.
Mike Mas: Good morning, and welcome to Regency’s third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Hap Stein, our Chairman and CEO; Brian Smith, our President and COO; Lisa Palmer, our Chief Financial Officer; and Chris Leavitt, Senior Vice President and Treasurer. Before we begin, I would like to address forward-looking statements that may be discussed on the call. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. We also request that callers observe a two question limit during the Q&A portion of our call in order to give everyone a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. I will now turn the call over to Hap.
Hap Stein: Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our results continue to be extremely gratifying. We’re achieving Regency’s key strategic goals and objectives. First we’re sustaining a long term same property NOI growth in excess of our goal. As evidenced by excellent visibility into a fourth straight year of 4% growth. Second our development team continues to source high quality shopping centers for development and redevelopment allowing us to deliver an average of $200 million of great projects annually. Third, we are strengthening an already conservative balance sheet to disciplined match funding of investments and efficient accessing of multiple sources of capital. At the same time we’re enhancing the intrinsic quality of our portfolio which is by all relevant measures one of the best in the sector. Ultimately the combined results of these strategies are consistently compounding core funds from operations and net asset value by 5% to 7% annually. As important Regency is well positioned to continue to consistently deliver on these key objectives in the future. Lisa.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you Hap and good morning everyone. We’re pleased with our results this quarter with core FFO per share of $0.76 representing a 7% increase over the third quarter of 2014. Year-to-date same property NOI growth excluding termination fees was 4.5% with base rate continuing to be the largest contributing factor as move-outs remain as historically low levels and we experienced gains in commenced occupancy. Through the first three quarters NOI growth has exceeded our expectations, although it is projected to moderate slightly during the fourth quarter as we face higher comps especially in the other income line item. We’ve raised our guidance accordingly and we now expect full year same property NOI growth to be in the range to 4% to 4.3%. Moving now to capital markets activity, I would like to spend just a few minutes updating you on the status of our forward equity offering. As a reminder we completed the offering in January on a forward sale basis. This allowed us to best match the proceeds with the intended use. As discussed at the time of the offering and on subsequent earnings calls, we identified three uses for the proceeds. First, the acquisition of University Commons in Boca Raton, Florida. Second, repaying $100 million of near term debt maturities to further enhance our balance sheet. And finally, prefunding a portion of our ongoing development and redevelopment pipelines. We closed on University Commons in September and yesterday we notified the holders of our bonds maturing in the summer of 2017 that we will be redeeming a $100 million or 25% of that issuance at the end of November. Given the certainty of timing we’re now planning to fully settle the forward at that time. As a result of this early repayment, we’ll incur make-all premium of approximately $8 million in the fourth quarter. This will be added back for purposes of [indiscernible] in core FFO. Driving for well laded maturity profile and managing interest rate risks, our both key balance objectives, it will provide us with more financial agility. Today’s capital markets backdrop and elevated maturities in 2017 support the partial retention as the most cost effective debt repayment alternative at this time. And further, we expect our estimated net debt to EBITDA to improve to 5.3 following the settlement. In summary these capital markets activities combined with the continued strong results of the same property portfolio as well as some straight line rate increases driven by the exceptional leasing of our development properties resulted an increase to the midpoint of our guidance range for core FFO per share of $0.04 to a new range of $3 to $3.03. Brian?
Brian Smith: Thank you Lisa and good morning everyone. 2015 is shaping up to be another successful year by all key measures. On our same property basis the operating portfolio planned a 96% lease to quarter end. The largest growth continues to be in small shops which rose to 91.5%. Demand for quality space remains high well shop space move-outs as a percent of leased space continues to surpass historic lows. Despite the trend in move-outs translated into retention rate that exceed historical averages which is another measured portfolio health. Retention rate was very strong in 80% for the operating portfolio year-to-date again well above our long term average. The momentum from the strong leasing trends gives me confidence from our portfolios ability to achieve additional occupancy gains as we continue to benefit from robust demand from retailers of the restaurants which – by low levels of new supply. The favorable leasing environment affords us to leveraged execute leases with higher starting rents and embedded rent steps. Rent growth by new leases signed during the quarter was nearly 19% while we continue to attain an average of nearly 2.5% annual growth embedded in the vast majority of our deals. Our consistent occupancy gains and pricing power produce same property NOI growth in excess of 4% for five consecutive quarters and lease explained have enabled us to raise our earnings guidance for the current year. This positive trends also give us confidence in our ability to sustain long term NOI growth of 3% or higher. Turning now to acquisitions, we continue to be able to find exceptional shopping centers with superior growth prospects. At least to mention as many of you are already aware, we closed on our most recent acquisition University Commons last month. University Commons is a 180,000 square foot center located on the major east-west quarter in an densely populated market of Boca Raton. It also benefits from a significant day time population from the nearby Florida Atlantic University. The center features a top performing foods as well as best in [indiscernible] for national retailers including [indiscernible]. With current rents at 25% below market there is a sizeable opportunity for this property to add to our long term NOI growth profile. Focusing now at our ground-up development this quarter we completed our Persimmon Place project in the Bay Area. This 150,000 square foot center took only 20 months from the start of construction to completion and had 99% leased incremented. We’ve already received overwhelming positive feedback from our line up a fresh tenant to share, they’re performing well beyond their expectations. The exceptional quality and performance of this project demonstrate the accurate, best in class development team and has already led the new development opportunities. After the close of the quarter we purchased three acres of land adjacent to our end processes line market in Dallas for second phase of this already successful alters into project. CityLine phase 2 which is 100% leased even before breaking ground will have an 22,000 square feet to the 80,000 square foot center already under construction. We’re projecting a return of 8.6% on invested capital for the second phase. Looking briefly on dispositions during the quarter we sold Glen Gate in Mariano’s anchored shopping center in Chicago for $50 million for a cap rate of 5.1%. Consistent with our match funding strategy Glen Gate was identified as a potential disposition for the funding of the acquisitions given it’s lower than average growth profile well also enabling us to reduce our exposure to Roundys. As evidenced by the increased guide range for acquisitions, we do have a good visibility into compelling acquisition opportunity in the north east at a comparable cap rate to Glen Gate sale. Lastly I would like to touch on [Hagen] in light of their recent announcements. The six locations represent a minimum amount of base rent in our portfolio and with restock and gross debts our potential exposure is less than 13 base points. The good news is we’re confident in the desirability of our real estate and our ability to enhance the quality of earnings accounts. With average base rents in the single digit there is potential to unlike substantial growth and redevelopment opportunities. In addition the leases are guaranteed by [indiscernible]. Thanks for listening, we’ll now turn the call over to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operation Instructions] Our first question comes from Christy McElroy with CitiBank, please proceed with your question.
Christine McElroy: Hi, good morning guys. Lisa to follow up on your comment, in November do you expect to settle this form out of the equity offering and then did the sale of Glen Gate to help fund the Boca deal impact to your decision to go via the settlements?
Lisa Palmer: Yes. As you know that cash is fundable, we did complete our bond offering in the middle of August and where we closed on University Commons in September. And the Glen Gate sale did happen, but even with that said we still intend to fully settle the full amount at the end of November. And the Glen Gate proceeds have been earmarked for the increased acquisitions in the guidance that we gave.
Christine McElroy: Okay. And then Brian, just looking at your acquisition guidance beyond the Boca deal, sorry if I missed this, is there another deal that you are close to that maybe you have under contract at this point I notice that it’s now up to $80 million to $90 million, I didn't know if there was an $18 million deal you are working on?
Brian Smith: We do. We have got – we have a couple of properties under contract in the North East. We are in the process of due diligence right now and we would – we haven't determined yet if they are going to close because the due diligence that we do have a couple under contract.
Lisa Palmer: And one is a little more certain than the other which is the one that we have included in the upper end of the guidance.
Christine McElroy: Where in the North East?
Lisa Palmer: That's on the long island. And the other one is in the Boston area. 
Christine McElroy: Great, thank you. 
Brian Smith: Thanks Christine.
Operator: Our next question is from Jay Carlington with Green Street Adviser. Please proceed with your question. 
Jay Carlington: Thank you. Lisa or maybe Brian, I am just kind of wondering how difficult is it to forecast the redevelopment contribution at the beginning of the year?
Lisa Palmer: What we do is that basically the answer – right at this time now we are looking at all of our potential redevelopments that may begin over the next 12 months. In many cases you are going to need something else to happen though. We usually have pretty good visibility a year in advance. So, we have a pretty good understanding of what’s going to happen. However, there could always be delays. It could be that you are negotiating with an anchor that's already in there right maybe for an expense, tear down, rebuild, and that is – there is always some uncertainty to that timing. But roughly we have pretty good visibility into the next 12 months. 
Brian Smith: This is just the start to and when the anchor decides we want to open and sometimes that changes. We got the permitting but then we also have approval that are also required by the other anchored and that can take a longest amount of time.
Jay Carlington: Okay and maybe a quick follow-up to that I guess, how does your year-to-date redevelopment contribution compared to kind of what you are thinking at the beginning of the year?
Lisa Palmer: I think we are pretty much right on target.
Jay Carlington: And Brian, did put a question here, kind of want to get your thoughts on, if you think the markets observing the recent wave of bankruptcy that we’re seeing in and the store closures and maybe some of the mergers that are coming down the pipe that may result in other store closures?
Brian Smith: I haven’t seen much concern about the store closures impacting us, we don’t have that many big boxes and the kind of assets that we’ve got, we’ve got – I think of our vacant big boxes half of them we’ve activity on. The bigger issue in terms of the bankruptcies and the mergers so forth is, what it means for developments going forward it means, right now all the activity and developments coming from the grocers and largely from the specialty grocers, but they have all got their 16 pipelines full, they’ve got their 17 pipelines full and then you got all the [Hagens] on the west coast where people were wondering what’s going to happen there and still have – down in Chicago, you got the AMPs that are out there, you still have some recommends. So, it’s more, can we get any development going, I’d say the flip side of that the good side of that is the grocers are only taking the top deals given those pipelines are full and given the excess inventory out there. So, if you got one, then it’s really, really good projects.
Lisa Palmer: Jay, I want to go back to your first question, I think something that’s really interesting about the contribution of redevelopments. The ones that are already in process, we’ve really good systems in place to understand what that contribution is going to be. It’s those that we haven’t started yet that we may or may not start in the current year that we’re trying to project and could be – property is not considered a redevelopment until we put it in the supplemental in our disclosure as a redevelopment and a great example of that is the center that we have in South Florida near the Adventure Mall that we have been allowing tenants leases to expire so it’s not very well occupied because we’re getting right into a full scale redevelopment there and that is right in our same property pool. It is not considered a redevelopment even though I believe the asset is 70 some percent brand. So that one is most difficult.
Jay Carlington: Got it that’s very helpful, thank you guys.
Brian Smith: Thanks Jay.
Operator: Our next question is from Jim Sullivan with Cowen Group, please proceed with your question.
Jim Sullivan: Just kind of a big picture question Hap, the internal growth here has been exceptionally strong and with cap rates in the acquisition market being as low as there, I guess when we think about the value creation margin with your both ground-up developments as well as redevelopment set back grant that margin is probably as high as do you ever seen it. I’m curious and this sort of goes on – follows what Lisa just said, but the redevelopment opportunities in the portfolio were seen to be very value accretive, and I wonder if you think about those as a source of growth on the one hand as opposed to what I’ll value add acquisitions. Do you see scope for more growth and either both of those given how profitable they’re – value accretive they are given the margins?
Hap Stein: Well, there is no barriers of our capital then a redevelopment of the existing portfolio because what we are doing is we are enhancing typically and already good center making a great center, we are getting an attractive return on capital and we are going to increase our growth profile on a go forward basis. So that's – that is priority one. Priority two would be we still believe that ground up development in the exceptional cases that Brian indicated still make sense and we can do that hit margins. Well not as good as they were coming out of the downturn. We are not as good today but they are still very compelling and we are building great shopping centers that are going to be great addition to our portfolio in the long term basis. And then thirdly, from an acquisition standpoint, what we are doing there is we are incrementally increasing our growth rate. We don't consider that to be an immediate value creation but we are selling like in the case of Glen Gate a low growth asset in addition to that we are reducing our exposure to round these and reinvestment that capital at roughly comparable cap rates into the shopping centers that's going to generate much more growth longer term.
Jim Sullivan: And I am curious in terms of, as you think about that acquisition market cap rates of course have come down and stayed low for some time now. And there seems to be a significant number of potential buyers out there who want to stable project, well located with long term leases and place. Just how competitive is the acquisition market for the value added acquisitions something where there is some hear on or some issues that maybe that long term stable coupon type buyers now really looking at it or looking for maybe as a scale set to redevelop?
Hap Stein: I think Brian can add color to this. I think market is still is very competitive. But from an acquisition standpoint an acquisition with upside potential would be our top priority. And one of the properties that we are working on in the North East has that both –
Brian Smith: We basically have two and one that we are trying to get contract. So we have got three of those we are working on its competitive. I mean all the acquisitions are competitive. We are seeing in the a), grocery market is what we thought our cap rates from Florida four and three quarters we had to compete [indiscernible] going in the low four and whereas I thought the IRRs were then around six and we are seeing 6 to 6 in the quarter we are not seeing couple of properties grow a remiss by a wide margin where pension funds are sold per 5.5 to 5.3 quarters on leverage side. It's competitive in the As and it's competitive in the value add. 
Jim Sullivan: Okay, great, thank you. 
Brian Smith: Thank you Jim. 
Operator: Our next question is from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Craig Schmidt: Thank you. Brian given the six locations from [Hagen] would there still be grocer and if they are what are some of the names you like to replace them with?
Brian Smith: Well, there would be grocers for all six properties we’ve got interest, in fact on five of them we have at least two, I am sorry five of the properties have at least three interested parties and there is two interested for all six and some of the names that they are out there stocking, you got smart and final and we have also got [Galsons] and we love [Galsons], in particular there are – they are more compatible I think with their high end demographics but you got target [inaudible] interested there is whole -- North West [Winco] is interested. [Lazy Acres] which is part of – farms so pretty much a whole host of good names.
Craig Schmidt: Great. 
Brian Smith: And the offers that are coming in are also remains to be seen whether we can get control of these leases are whether they’ll – by somebody else at auction one of the grocers but the offers that we are seeing are just really, really strong I mean you talked about $4 rents going to $28. 
Craig Schmidt: Wow! And then I notice for ABR you have got 17% restaurants given the consumer demand for this type of product, would you be willing to raise that exposure?
Brian Smith: I think we love to have as many great restaurants as we can get. The problem is that we are restricted, in some cases we are restricted by the grocers who have prepared food they want to sell and the biggest issue would be the parking and city code how much restaurants you can do.
Craig Schmidt: Great. Thank you.
Brian Smith: Thanks Craig. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Rich Moore: Hi. Good morning guys. Last quarter you mentioned that you were looking at about $650 million of potential development is that still the case?
Brian Smith: It is. We are working on $650 million in 2015 and 2016, we are getting near the year end I think we are going to – you’ve seen our guidance I think we will end up it's a very high end of that guidance and then next year it's going to be a strong year. More guidance to come but I wouldn't be surprised if we were in the $250 million to $300 million range and so therefore we would be averaging around that $200 million a year that we talked about lumpy but on average we are going to hit it.
Rich Moore: Okay. So do you Brian still feel that within the last quarter you said you felt that the current environment was the best environment you have ever seen for tenants and we’ve seen a little bit of, I don't know maybe uncertainty in some of the other reports this quarter, do you still feel like it's the best quarter you have ever seen – the best environment you have ever seen for leasing and for your business? 
Brian Smith: I do think it's still the best environment just given the fact that there is so little development going on that the retailers are doing well. I mean when I look at our portfolio I see nothing that's showing any reason for concern I mean the leasing environment is strong, that there is no let up in momentum when it comes to the new leasing, tenants are not moving out. We have had the second highest year of renewals in our quarter renewals and the lowest quarter of move-outs. All those trends continue really, really strong. The only thing that I would say is that whether it's talking to brokers out in the market if you go to the regionalized CSC, you go to ULI I think everybody is and if you talk to our own tenants they are just cautious. They are taking a long time to open. They are being very, very careful about opening new stores and that’s part of why I think it's a really good environment because nobody is getting caught up in the exuberant. And they can't really point anything but it's just that market is nothing to worry about little bit you hear that the traffic is down but conversions of sales are up. So, it's just that I think it's a healthy caution out there. But it's not translating to anything we’re seeing in our current metrics or in our pipeline.
Hap Stein: Just reiterate that last point that Brian made, is I think this healthy caution on the part of retailers and restaurants and tenants in general is a very healthy trend because you are not sitting there, they are making it appears to be very rational decision and on the last cycle sometimes maybe we should have scratched our head and said, what the tenants doing doesn't make sense or why are they doing that now they are cautioned and they are – when they do move forward it does make sense so I feel good about that.
Rich Moore: Okay, good. Thanks guys. The other thing is I wanted to ask you second – it was a [Liddell] on two German grocers are you running into those guys and kind of what you think of them?
Brian Smith: We are putting all the – in one of our centers a back filling them and then up in North Carolina [Liddell] is going across the street from one of our developments. I don't know anything about [Liddell] I hear what they are talking about that we heard about that from Fresh Needs on the West coast that didn't pan out so I just reserve comment on that one. All the I would say by and large I think they are obviously good retailers and they drive a lot of traffic but they typically are going to go and demographics are different from our portfolio.
Rich Moore: Okay, good, great. Thanks very much.
Hap Stein: Thanks Rich. 
Operator: Our next question is from Michael Mueller with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Mueller: Couple of questions on the Boca acquisition I mean, should we think of that as just stabilized core acquisition or is there something significant that you kind of do with it overtime?
Brian Smith: Well yes, I mean we have a saying around here that we would like to invest in properties where bad news becomes good news and this is the ultimate center like that I mean the bad news here is that the tenants are generating mall like sales, I think they are averaging about $850 a foot across the entire center. It is now the number one whole foods in our portfolio. [indiscernible] if the sales are absolutely at the top of their chain. Same with [indiscernible] and beyond. We get calls through brokers, competitors, head of real estate congratulating us. So the growth you see there, it's about 3% is contractual over the next ten years but after that we are going to see a lot of growth and it's any of these retailers – whoever should go out the rents across the board are about $1.6 million below market. So if you could just bring that up to market, which we will get to do obviously eventually I mean there is a huge pop in value.
Michael Mueller: Okay and then you talked about contractual growth. Can you just walk through I know you have been trying to push bumps a little bit harder get more frequent bumps in leases, get higher escalators, can you just kind of walk through how that whole process has been trending in the past couple of years? 
Brian Smith: Sure. If you look at our – we have been focusing on this for two and three years – we’ve been focusing forever, but the focus on the midterm steps is relatively new. So our portfolio on the deal specific basis so just the leases that contain round steps averages about 1.6% if you look at what we average for the last three quarters it's about 2.3%, so 70 basis points higher. That's pretty significant and then if you translate that into all leases including those that don't have steps but remember we are getting this now from about 90% of our tenants. The growth in the portfolio is about 1.2% and we have been averaging over the last five or six quarters about 2% so really, really healthy midterm increases.
Hap Stein: And you have to take time that percentage increase but I think we are projecting with the next three to five years we got to be another 30 or 40 basis points in that.
Michael Mueller: Got it. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from [indiscernible] with Evercore, please proceed with your question.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning guys. As you guys kind of look in the next year and I know that you haven't provided any kind of official guidance could any kind of this proactive re-tenant or re-bunch merchandising efforts that impact NOI growth like some of the other REITs or sort of start to mention 4Q next year, could that impact growth I am just trying to get a sense of how should we think about growth rate for next year?
Lisa Palmer: As we have communicated in the past we believe that we can generate 3% plus same property NOI on the sustainable basis given the quality of our portfolio along with some of our re-tenanting and redevelopment activities and we hope that that would get us to the 3.5% range. I will remind you that this year if we stay north of 4% which is looking extremely likely at this point that that will be our fourth consecutive year of 4% and as you know, for our product type that's difficult to achieve and so something that we are really proud of. When you think about the contribution of redevelopments and Jay was asking this earlier it is going to vary and it's going to depend on how many properties that we are actually redeveloping at one time and we have given general direction that we would expect that that spent could be $20 million to $50 million and so at any given year redevelopments could be a positive contribution of 50 basis points roughly to 100 basis points. And so if you think about our contractual rent steps that Brian just talked about plus our rent growth that gets you to about 2.5% and then the redevelopment activities would add $50 to $100 so that's your 3% to 3.5%.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it and just curious on your thoughts about [Howard] square assets that one of your peers announced this morning as an acquisition. I know you guys likely looked at it considering your interest in sort of increasing exposure to the North East?
Brian Smith: I am not aware of it.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. It was one of your peers announced that acquisition I was just curious. Okay thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities, please proceed with your question.
Chris Lucas: Good morning. Just wanted to see if there has been any change in the cycle or getting leases completed, in other words have tenants been accelerating the process or they have been slowing down given where we are in the cycle?
Brian Smith: I think it’s slowing down. If you look at our down time it was above this quarter, so largely that's because we are leasing space and they can last longer. I think if you look at the vacant two to three years we did 49% of our leasing was in that category whereas just the prior quarter just 34% so that accounts for some of it. But I think overall it's taking longer because everybody is just battling. It's kind of what happens talking about they are going to be really careful about not doing a bad deal. We are fighting for all those things that just take a lot of time and we are striving to get not only the economics like fighting for the initial rent growth or the bumps in there but things like termination rights, relocation rights, so we can do renovations and redevelopments. We are fighting those kinds of things. So a lot of it’s a negotiation and then just getting the stuff through the cities is taking an awful lot of time. Having said that if you look at our development that’s working on right now I mean lots of rep, as we parked out and we expected it to, we talked about Persimmon on the call but that thing in 20 months is 99% leased and now we have started CityLine phase two and we haven't broken ground it's 100% lease. And I think the first phase is 98%. So, we are getting things done very rapidly. We are finding robust demand. We are working on a project in Huston and we hope to announce next two or three months and that one maybe three months away from closing and we have activity on 93% of the space. So, while they are cautious and while there is many things to slow down the process and it is taking longer, it’s still pretty robust. 
Chris Lucas: I guess the follow up then Brian would be and you mentioned that Huston and so maybe I will call that out, but are you seeing the decision making processes that being impacted by market or is it very specific to location?
Brian Smith: I don't think it's that specific to location. I think the locations we have people are excited about it's just getting the leases signed. It's difficult we have that situations where retailers will change their hurdles and they will have to go back to their committee and again you get through that it's a good thing because they are being cautious but I think that's more across the board rather site specific.
Chris Lucas: Okay. great. Thank you very much. 
Hap Stein: Thanks Chris.  Operator The next question is from [indiscernible] with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning. Brian I was just wondering if you could quantify the move-outs in the quarter relative to your expectations and then maybe I will just start to think about 2016 is there any reason to think that move-outs will normalize or do you expect that they will continue to be these historical levels?
Brian Smith: Well we haven't been very good at predicting that. It is pleasantly surprised us – surprised last two years. What we do is we do two things and try to estimate them. We start with the field and go space by space, who is struggling, who do you think is going to be moving out, who told you they’re going to move out and we start there and then what we do here Jacksonville, we make an adjustment and what we do is we look at the trend of move-outs not absolute but as a percentage of occupied space. And then stuff happen. That trend has been on a downward slope since 2010 but also a bit accelerating so in 2014 it was 1.6% of occupied space, so in 2015 we budget 1.7 and year-to-date it's 1.4. So I don't see anything right now that would, well it's getting so low you would think that if it just flattened out at this it would be great because our move-outs for this full year are going to be about a million square feet less than it were in the 2008 – 2010 time frame so at some point they can’t keep going low. But I don't see anything that's going to cause that trend up.
Lisa Palmer: I will add that I mean Brian hit it right on it's just really difficult we are – we have been talking about this internally because we really have continued to overestimate what we have thought move-outs would be and it might offset by chasing all downhill. So in 2010 or 2009 with the highest, but even 2010 is a little bit more of a normal year the number was 2.4% and it fell to 1.6% of occupied space basically of people moving out and we thought we were being reasonably conservative if you will by budgeting 1.7. So thinking that move-outs would stabilize the quality of our portfolio has significantly improved. The tenants help has significantly improved and all that is contributing to and this continues to improve and we don't know when it will stabilize and obviously at some point it's going to go the other way. And so, we are trying to being as reasonably conservative but realistic.
Brian Smith: Virtue of cycle is a good thing. 
Unidentified Analyst: And then maybe just one more question following up on Texas I can see the leased rate is up versus last quarter but I guess I am just curious what you are hearing from retailers about there is sales in that market and if you are seeing any change in future demand there? Thank you.
Brian Smith: Sure. So what we are hearing is kind of what I mentioned before for those in the portfolio everybody is happy. Nobody is moving out. The renewals are up again. But they know there is going to be a slow down at some point. But if you look at the new demand our pipeline is stronger now than it was even a couple of quarters ago and again what we measured that as a percentage of vacant space. I will talk about new leasing so if you look at this year it looks like we are going to lease about 71% - 72% of our vacant space. If you compare that to the average in last five years, the average last five years about 75% so it continue to do a lot of new leasing not so much on absolute basis but we continue to lease a smaller and smaller amount of vacancies. And if you look at our pipeline it was over the last four quarters about 46% of vacant space and this quarter it's 54% so tenants start moving out we are continuing to do a lot new leasing and the pipeline behind it remains strong.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. great. Thank you. 
Hap Stein: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from [indiscernible] with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey good morning.
Brian Smith: Good morning.
Unidentified Analyst: So, a question for you first on construction labor, I wonder if you are seeing any labor related bottleneck in your development activities. I asked because the number of home builders in particular who share your market footprint largely have noted these labor related bottlenecks I am curious if you are seeing anything on that front?
Brian Smith: You see those on the smaller projects. I mean overall we have not experienced the problem. We are aware of where cost are trending and we budget for them. But you are right, whereas material costs are pretty benign that labor is increasing I think what’s driving that is the construction spending and spends of 2008 and you are seeing worker shortage is growing. The unemployment for September was 7 year low and employment was 6 six year high and the interesting thing is if you look at the actual wage increases year-over-year it was the highest since 1986. And we are seeing across the country especially in the Mid West the associated general contractors reporting significant labor shortages. So that's translating this past year about 5% increase and 4.5% increase in total cost but you see that as high as 10% or even higher on small projects where basically the contractors don't want to work on it if you want them to pay them enough then they will work on it but for a large projects we haven't seen that. 
Unidentified Analyst: Okay and just the few clarification. So first of all it sounds like you are not taking that issue yet but then I just want to clarify the numbers if you’re discussing and those are purely labor cost doesn't reflect materials or land rate?
Brian Smith: Yes that's correct. That's just labor and then the materials I mean if you look at cement, concrete, that's pretty much like I said 3% -4%, precast is 2% to 3% glass is stable, the only material were we are seeing – we’ve been given notice that you can start to see increases would be on steel and this was about three months ago they said they expect 10% increase in steel prices. But overall material prices are pretty benign.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Appreciate that and then Lisa for you, sorry if I missed this but a clarification on the partial notes redemption. The $100 million I guess redeem next month. Just curious want to make sure that one these costs are baked into the current guidance and then also any current – any update on current thinking on the remaining $300 million of note that will be outstanding pro forma?
Lisa Palmer: First yes, the make all is in our existing guidance and we will – it would be, there have to be some unusual reason why we would not just let the notes go to maturity and then refinance them at that time because I will remind that you that we have a forward starting swap in place for $250 million of that issuance so at a minimum we certainly expect to refinance at least $250 million.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you. 
Hap Stein: Thank you very much.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks. 
A - Hap Stein: We appreciate your time. And want you to have a great remainder of the week. Great Halloween and great weekend. Thank you very much.
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your line at this time.

===== 2015 Q2  (2015-08-06 11:00:00) =====
Executives: Mike Mas - SVP of Capital Markets Hap Stein - Chairman and CEO Lisa Palmer - CFO Brian Smith - President and COO
Analysts: Christine McElroy - Citi Craig Schmidt - Bank of America Jay Carlington - Green Street Michael Mueller - JP Morgan Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets
Operator: Greetings. Welcome to the Regency Centers Corporation Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the following presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Mike Mas, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets. Thank you, Mr. Mas. You may now begin.
Mike Mas: Good morning, and welcome to Regency’s second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Hap Stein, our Chairman and CEO; Brian Smith, our President and COO; Lisa Palmer, our Chief Financial Officer; and Chris Leavitt, Senior Vice President and Treasurer. Before we begin, I would like to address forward-looking statements that may be discussed in the call. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. We also request that callers observe a two question limit during the Q&A portion of our call in order to give everyone a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. I will now turn the call over to Hap.
Hap Stein: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Regency’s team continues to produce impressive results in each key facet of our business. Our portfolio is performing at a high level as demonstrated by nearly 96% leased, including small shops at more than 91%. As you’ll hear from Brian, the team is succeeding in both growing rents and driving future rent steps which combine with the increase in rent-paying occupancy that helped us to achieve NOI growth of 4.4% for the first half of the year. This follows three years of 4% NOI growth. The portfolio is well positioned to sustain future NOI growth by benefitting from historically low levels of new supply, robust tenant demand across our markets, the substantial purchasing power in our infiltrate areas, the drawing power of our anchors and our fresh-look initiative that is further enhancing the merchandising and place-making of our centers. As is evidenced by the impressive performance of our end process developments, Regency’s best-in-class development team continues to demonstrate its expertise by delivering exceptional shopping centers at compelling spreads to the cost of acquiring centers of comparable quality. We know firsthand the challenges and time it takes to develop a great shopping center, particularly the best ones that are located in infiltrate areas with strong anchors. We will maintain high levels of patience, discipline, focus and persistence to ensure that Regency will continue to deliver projects that exceed the high bar we have set. Brian will discuss our development progress in more detail. Finally, as Lisa will discuss, our balance sheet remains extremely strong and provides us with substantial flexibility. We are committed to continuing to cost-effectively finance our investments through disciplined match funding and by astutely accessing the public markets on a favorable basis. Lisa?
Lisa Palmer: Thanks, Hap, and good morning, everyone. Our overall financial results were solid again this quarter with core FFO per share of $0.75, representing an increase of 5.6% over the second quarter of 2015. Same property NOI growth, excluding termination fees, was 4.3% for the quarter. Base rent continues to be the driver as move-outs remain low and commenced occupancy increased nearly 95%. Redevelopments contributed a net positive impact of 50 basis points this quarter. Through the second quarter, same property NOI growth has exceeded expectations, though it is expected to moderate slightly over the next two quarters as we face higher comps from the back half of 2014. As a result, we have revised our full-year guidance for 2015 accordingly. We now expect same property NOI growth, excluding termination fees, to be in the range of 3.6% to 4.1% and core FFO per share in the range of $2.95 to $2.99. I also want to note two other forward-looking updates. As Brian will discuss in more detail, we lowered development start guidance for the year to a new range of $75 million to $125 million. It is important to highlight that our shadow pipeline remains robust. And this change in guidance is not indicative of projects falling out but just delayed timing and start. One result of these delays is a reduction in development and leasing overhead capitalization for 2015 which does impact net G&A. We now expect the quarterly net G&A run rate to increase just modestly in the second half of the year. And still, we will finish the year at the upper end of our previously communicated range of $60 million to $63.5 million. Moving to the balance sheet and our liquidity position, we continue to cost-effectively improve Regency’s already strong balance sheet through organic earnings growth and discipline match funding of investments. Developments and acquisitions will continue to be funded primarily through the sales properties while equity will be used as a source of capital only when we believe it is priced favorably. As a reminder, the forward equity offering completed in January remains outstanding. We still intend to settle a portion for the acquisition of University Commons in Boca Raton, Florida which is expected to close in September. We also plan to settle a piece of the offering when we address the refinance of our $350 million unsecured bond maturity which we paid off earlier this week using our line of credit. After we exit our blackout, we will access the market to source new long-term debt when conditions are appropriate. But we do remain well positioned to remain patient. To afford us the ability [ph] of providing this flexibility, we diligently monitor future commitments, including development spend and debt maturities to maintain ample capacity should an opportunity arrive or should we encounter unforeseen disruptions in the capital markets. Consistent with that objective, we amended our $800 million revolving line of credit this quarter, reducing the borrowing spread and extending the maturity date. In all, our strong balance sheet was recognized by Moody’s when they upgraded our credit rating to Baa1, validating the enhancements we’ve made over the last several years. Brian?
Brian Smith: Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. Over the last several quarters, the hard work and talents of our local team have continued to translate into tangible operating results which is evident in the numbers again this quarter. The operating portfolio once again benefited from historically low move-outs but also experienced the highest number of new leases signed in any quarter since 2013. This momentum pushed the same property portfolio to nearly 96% leased, a 40 basis point improvement over the prior year and 20 basis points sequentially. The primary contribution was from small shops which increased over 91% this quarter. This represents a gain of 80 basis points over the prior year. With the portfolio so highly leased, low levels of new supply and the continued demand for quality space, the team is laser-focused by driving rents and executing deals with higher and more frequent rent steps. At the same time, as part of our fresh-look initiative, we thoughtfully select the best retailer or restaurant for each space. Rent growth for shop space was double-digits for the third quarter in a row and we have successfully executed embedded rent steps in 90% of our leases over the past four quarters. Our progress incorporating rent steps into more of our leases, coupled with our consistent rent growth, has been instrumental to our success in achieving same property NOI growth in excess of 4%, not only for four consecutive quarters but potentially four consecutive years. Turning now to our ground-up developments, this quarter, we completed our Fountain Square project in Miami. This 180,000 square foot center is located in one of the most densely populated areas of the Miami metro market that also benefits from a huge daytime population from Florida International University. The center is anchored by Target, Publix, Ross and T.J.Maxx. The success of this project yielding a return of over 250 basis points to market cap rates and approaching 96% lease is a good example of what our best-in-class development teams can produce. The momentum from the successful project is leading to future investment opportunities in the highly desirable Southeast Florida market. $180 million of ground-up developments currently under construction are generating average returns of 8% and approaching 92% leased and committed. The Village at La Floresta anchored by Whole Foods and located in a master plan community in Orange County continues to impress me as it attracts top-tier operators with the ability to support higher rents and returns than original underwriting. La Floresta will feature unique, fresh local restaurants like Mendocino Farms, Urban Plates in the best casual seafood sensation looking to grow its presence in Southern California. In addition, this project will feature place-making enhancements, including an outdoor amphitheater and permanent space for Farmers Market designed to increase shopper dwell time and enrich the retail experience. CityLine Market in Dallas, also anchored by Whole Foods, has such strong retail demand that as phase one approaches 100% lease, we’re now negotiating leases on 95% of the retail space for our phase two project soon to commence, adding to the already impressive mix of retail, restaurant and service uses. Looking forward with the shadow pipeline of likely starts in excess of $500 million over the next few years, plus an even greater amount of additional opportunities we’re working on, we expect to secure great projects that set our disciplined criteria to start an average of at least $150 million to $200 million of developments and redevelopments annually. Hap?
Hap Stein: Thanks, Brian and thanks, Lisa. In closing, I remain very proud of the progress our team is making in building a great company. The critical ingredients are portfolio, development program, balance sheet and culture are combining to make it a company that measures up to the title of Jim Collins’ book, Built to Last. Thank you for your time and we now welcome your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Christine McElroy with Citi. Please go ahead with your questions.
Christine McElroy: Hi, good morning, guys. Just, Lisa, I wanted to follow-up on your comments regarding the refinancing of the $350 million of unsecured that you just paid off with your line. I just wanted to get a sense for how long you expect to hold that on the line given how much accretion will obviously result from that, the longer that you do before you do another bond offering. And maybe you can give us a better sense for, again, sort of timing of the bond offering and size and expectations around you [ph] would be helpful.
Lisa Palmer: Sure. Christine, it’s more important to us to secure the financing than to worry about the short-term earnings accretions. So we just need to wait till we come out of the blackout and we’ll be ready to go. But as I said in my prepared remarks, we can remain patient because we do have the flexibility to do so. But we expect to be ready as soon as possible. And as we’ve talked about in the past, part of the forward equity offering, we do intend to use and address to not do as large of an offering. So the offering will be in the 250 [ph], probably to 275 [ph] range.
Christine McElroy: Okay. So you’ll pull this forward offering or the proceeds, the portion of that when you do the sub bond [ph] deal?
Lisa Palmer: Correct.
Christine McElroy: Okay. And then just with Riocan embarking on a strategic alternative process with US Trust, are you familiar with that portfolio and if they did go-to market with some of that, would you be interested in it, the portion of it given the concentration [indiscernible]?
Hap Stein: Obviously, we’ve read about that. Somewhat familiar with the assets. We’re familiar with the assets. And we’ll evaluate them. But they have to meet our criterion B, not only do something that makes sense from a financial standpoint, but also they have to be the quality criteria that we have.
Christine McElroy: Thank you.
Hap Stein: Thank you, Christine.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.
Craig Schmidt: Yes. Thank you. I wondered if you could give maybe a little bit more color on the delayed timing of the starts that led to the lower development starts?
Brian Smith: Sure, Craig. So as we said, our stated objective would be to have an average annual delivery for development and redevelopment of 150 million, 200 million. But it can be one payment [ph] and that’s really what you’re seeing. There’s no change in the project. They’re all still on track. It’s just difficult to know the delays which have pushed some projects in the 2016 and somewhere a flip of the coin whether it will happen in December or January, around those time periods. So the issue isn’t the opportunity. It’s just the timing of the starts. But if you want to get the specifics on what exactly happened, we’ve got about eight projects we’re working on that we’re hoping at the beginning of the year would happen in 2015. Three of them are mixed use, so you’re dependent on the other uses to some extent. If there’s an issue there, then you’re going to get delayed as well. Two are master plan communities where there’s some issues in the master plan developers are still working out. One of them is a zoning change. And the city pushed that in 2016. One had issues with the anchors in terms of [indiscernible] being way too much risk in some of the lease terms. That looks like it has since been worked out. And then one for sure will start this year. But as I look at what’s going on as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, there’s no shortage of projects. We’re working on $650 million of development between now and 2017 of which I’d say about well $500 million are ground up. And at this point in time, I feel confident that $350 million to $400 million are likely, it’s not guaranteed, but they’re looking real good, of which about $250 million to $300 million are developments.
Craig Schmidt: Hap, that’s helpful. It sounds like the anchors are getting more appetite in terms of opening ground up, is that true?
Hap Stein: Well, the specialty grocers, for sure. The original grocers, they’re on fire. The boxes are still cautious and conservation [indiscernible] is good for the industry. They want spaces and all the portfolios and everything, but you don’t see a whole lot of box development just because the rent from those for a particular use haven’t gotten back up to where they were pre-recession. But the grocery side, there’s a lot activity.
Craig Schmidt: Okay. Thank you.
Hap Stein: Thank you, Craig.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Jay Carlington with Green Street. Please go ahead with your questions.
Jay Carlington: Hey, Brian. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned that the Florida development was leading to future opportunities in there. Can you elaborate on that a little bit?
Brian Smith: Nothing particular. It’s just we get a couple of things. I would say in the developed world, success begets success. And that project is so successful that we are seeing a lot of opportunities come to us either through brokers or potential joint venture partners. We’re still working through those. But we do have a project, for example, that was target excess land that they took out to an RFP and we were successful in getting that taken care of. We won that and that will likely be a whole food development. And then just some other things that are percolating [indiscernible] not to talk about.
Jay Carlington: Okay. And maybe just switching to JVs. I was looking at your stuff from 2010 where you had 180 properties in a JV. And I guess today, we’re sitting at 119. So I’m wondering where you think that number is going to be in the next five years.
Lisa Palmer: Jay, this is Lisa. As we’ve talked about in the past, we like our stable of JV partners. And at this time, there’s really no intention of significantly growing them or reducing them. So we’d expect that each of our partners may - we follow the same strategy in terms of recycling. So you may see some recycling through those, but probably right about the same number of properties.
Jay Carlington: Okay. Thank you.
Hap Stein: Thank you, Jay.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Michael Mueller with JP Morgan. Please go ahead with your question.
Michael Mueller: Hi. Just a quick one on leasing spreads. So they’re coming out high single digits this year. Last year, they were a little bit more on the low teens. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about either what was propping them up last year or why the modest deceleration.
Brian Smith: Well, it all has to do with the anchor leases, new anchor leases. We talked about last year in the second and third quarter, we had four anchor leases that their average size was greater than 40,000 square feet and the combined or the average rent gross of the four is about 135%. So as you know, the new anchor leases is what moves the needle because of the size of the spaces as well as the tax of those are all leases and have the biggest mark-to-market. In the last three quarters, we’ve done a total of three anchor leases, new anchor leases. And they’ve been small. The three of those average 15,000 square feet. So with the anchors being 99% leased and our renewal rates for anchors being 90%, what we’re really getting in the last three quarters is mostly renewals of anchors. And of course, renewals are fixed option rents. And they’re more flattish. The new leasing of the last three quarters has been almost entirely shop. That’s why if we look at the shop rent growth, it’s been double-digit the last three quarters. And in fact, this quarter, it increased 20 basis points. And then the other thing I would just say is it’s not that we’re not doing new anchors leases. It’s just that a lot of them are non-comparable. So where the rent growth is not getting factored into the - or where the increase in rent is not being considered rent growth. An example will be [indiscernible] centered up in Baltimore center up there. There, we’ve got a Staples box that we’re splitting and re-leasing both spaces. And the cash spreads on that are greater than 50%. But that kind of stuff is not showing up in rent for [indiscernible] is not considered non-operable.
Michael Mueller: Got it. Okay, that’s good color. Thank you.
Hap Stein: Thank you, Michael.
Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.
Rich Moore: Yes. Hi, guys, good morning. It’s been a long earnings season. And Brian, I thought I heard you say, but I probably didn’t that you’re thinking you’re going to do 4% plus same-store NOI growth for the next four years? That’s fantastic, guys.
Lisa Palmer: I think, Rich, that was in Hap’s opening comments. And I think he mentioned that we have done 4% for three consecutive years. And 4% is in the realm of possibility for this year given our range of 3.6% to 4.1%.
Hap Stein: We should make it 4% in consecutive years.
Rich Moore: All right, I got you. I got you. So this is the best guidance I’ve ever heard. But I want to ask you guys, the occupancy level that you’re at that I have is a record for all the years that I’ve been keeping track of you. Is that as high as you can go? I mean is there sort of like the space remaining, a small shop space remaining or whatever it is, not terribly leasable at this point that’s left over?
Brian Smith: I don’t think so, Rich. I mean we increase shops 80 basis points year-over-year. And the leasing environment remains really strong. Demands clearly exceed supply. The renewals as I mentioned are very strong. They’re 81% for the portfolio. But also the highest renewal rate we’ve ever had for the shop for our pipeline of new leasing is also everybody is strong as it has been. In fact, it’s a little bit higher than the last four quarter rolling average. And we did the highest number of leases, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, this quarter, that we’ve ever done. So rents are still rising. Pricing power is good. We’re seeing the retailers taking tougher spaces. We’re seeing improvements in the weaker markets. So I don’t know why we can’t just keep going.
Lisa Palmer: And Rich, I’ll add a little bit of color to that. We’ve done some analysis. We have a lot of history. And with our existing portfolio, when you look at the properties that we reached our peak prior in the 2007-2008 range, when you look at the properties that we still own today that we owned then - and that’s not counting the really high quality properties that we’ve added through acquisition and development. We actually sustained north of 96% with those properties for over a year. So we’ve significantly improved the quality of our portfolio over the past five to six years. And I think with that, we should be able to sustain a higher peak than we have in the past.
Brian Smith: One thing I will add about the environment too, just a little bit of color from my perspective is, I think this is the best environment for landlord that we’ve seen, not necessarily for developers, but for landlords. And it’s not because it’s easy and retailers are getting and opening stores wildly. In fact, it’s just the opposite. It is really a battle. The retailers fight hard, which is why it’s taking us longer to get spaces leased and then to rent paying. You’re seeing them taking approvals backed committee where they’re changing their return threshold. In tenants that we signed leases, it went maybe a dozen leases. One start from scratch on the lease negotiation. So I think that’s just really healthy for the sector that retailers are cautious and deliver - but they have a desire to grow. And it’s one of the reasons why the growth in supply is still limited.
Hap Stein: We totally agree. And that’s important. It is a very healthy environment from our perspective.
Rich Moore: It’s great color. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Thank you. At this time I’ll turn the floor back to management for closing comment.
Hap Stein: We appreciate your time and your interest in Regency, and wish that everyone has a great rest of the week and weekend. Thank you very much.
Operator: This concludes today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2015 Q1  (2015-05-07 11:00:00) =====
Executives: Mike Mas - SVP, Capital Markets Hap Stein - Chairman & CEO Lisa Palmer - CFO Brian Smith - President & COO

Operator: Welcome to the Regency Centers Corporation First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mike Mas, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets. Thank you, Mr. Mas. You may begin.
Mike Mas: Good morning and welcome to Regency's first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Hap Stein, our Chairman and CEO; Brian Smith, our President and COO; Lisa Palmer, our Chief Financial Officer; and Chris Leavitt, Senior Vice President and Treasurer. Before we start, I would like to point out two additional disclosure items in our supplement. First, the added disclosure of the impact of redevelopment on same property NOI growth, on pages 7 and 11. And second, an added reconciliation of net income to AFFO on page 10. Because AFFO definitions can differ, our intent is to highlight for our shareholders certain non-cash income and expense items, as well as capital expenditures. I would also like to address forward-looking statements that may be discussed on the call. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. We also request that callers observe a two question limit during the question and answer portion of our call in order to give everyone a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please rejoining the queue. I will now turn the call over to Hap.
Hap Stein: Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. We had another really good quarter and the results speak for themselves. So I'll be brief before passing you along to Lisa and to Brian. The combination of successful execution of the four main components of our strategy will continue to distinguish Regency. First, our high quality portfolio is well positioned to sustain superior NOI growth. This is supported by another strong quarter of operating results, including NOI growth that exceeded 4% and follows three full years at this level. Second, we're making progress on a visible pipeline that supports our ability to deliver $100 million to $200 million of development and redevelopment starts and deliveries in 2015 and in future years. In a few minutes, Brian will share with you more details on our efforts to create great shopping centers and compelling value. Third, our balance sheet remain strong. And as Lisa will discuss, we're astutely enhancing it through organic earnings growth, cost-effective match funding and opportunistic capital markets activity. And most importantly our talented team remains highly engaged, with developing and employing best-in-class operating systems and continues to successfully execute this strategy. That said, we understand this is a marathon and gold medals are not handed out for short-term results. I have no doubt that Regency's exceptional team will continue to differentiate our company with high levels of performance in each of the key aspects of our strategy, delivered consistently over extended periods of time. Lisa will now walk you through our results.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Hap and good morning, everyone. Our first-quarter results were very strong. Core FFO per share was $0.74, representing an increase of more than 7% over the first quarter of 2015. Same property NOI growth excluding termination fees was 4.4% which includes a net positive impact from redevelopment of 120 basis points. Although we benefited from move-out levels that were lower than we typically experience in the first quarter of the year and also better than expected percentage rent, base rent growth of 4.2%, driven by last year's robust leasing and double-digit rent spreads continues to be the largest contributing factor to same property NOI growth. The low move-out volumes in the first quarter, along with the additional percentage rent, will have a positive impact on full-year results, allowing us to raise the low end of our guidance ranges for same property NOI growth by 20 basis points and Core FFO per share by $0.02. With respect to G&A, our first quarter is moderately higher than the projected remaining quarterly run rate. Development and leasing capitalization are expected to increase modestly through the year as leasing activity and development starts increase, providing a quarterly net G&A run rate closer to $15 million over the remaining three quarters. We continue to expect that we'll finish the year within the original range provided of $60 million to $63.5 million. As Hap said, maintaining and further enhancing Regency's conservative balance sheet is a critical component of our strategy. We'll rely heavily on organic earnings growth as we generate results like we have over the past several quarters. We'll also continued to match fund our new investments, with the primary source of capital for development and acquisitions being the sale of lower growth properties. And importantly, when matching an acquisition, the disposition will have a comparable cap rate as the acquisition, but a lower growth profile. Also, when the use and pricing make compelling sense, we will opportunistically use equity as a funding source, like we did with the forward offering completed in January. As a reminder, the forward structure allows us to drawdown proceeds and issue the shares through the end of the year at the per share closing price on the offering date of $67.40. We expect one of the identified uses for the equity offering which is the acquisition of University Commons in Boca Raton, Florida, to close in the third quarter. We will drawdown the necessary proceeds at that time, effectively matching our capital needs with the funding source from both a cost and timing perspective. We will also settle a piece of the forward offering to address a portion of our unsecured bond maturity in August and to fund develop and spend throughout 2015. Brian?
Brian Smith: Thank you, Lisa. Good morning, everyone. Our portfolio is performing better than ever which is apparent in our consistently strong results. We continue to focus on leasing to high-performing gross re-anchors, best-in-class operators and unique restaurants and retailers that differentiate and activate our shopping centers. And in doing so expand our trade areas and increased shopper traffic. Our centers are located on great quarters in affluent suburbs and infiltrate areas with substantial purchasing power and barriers to entry. This combination provide sustainable, competitive advantages that allow us to capitalize on landlord-favored market and leverage the high quality real estate in our portfolio. This portfolio strength is demonstrated by our same property NOI growth that once again exceeded 4%. The health of our tenant base is evident in percentage rent that surpassed expectations, due to higher than forecasted sales volumes. It's also apparent in our rent growth which has approached or exceeded double digits for some time now. This quarter, rent growth on new leases was nearly 30%, coming entirely from shop space. Another indication of our portfolio strength and tenant health is a low level of move-outs which were well below our expectations for the first quarter and have trended at low levels for the past four quarters. In fact, as a percentage of occupied space, this was the lowest quarter of move-outs that we have on record which is particularly noteworthy, given the typical seasonality of higher move-outs in the first quarter of the year. As Lisa said, this will have a positive impact on earnings which allows us to improve our outlook for the remainder of the year. I'm also pleased with the strides that our industry step developing team is making on our pipeline which gives me confidence in our ability to meet our development and redevelopment goals. Although ground upstarts this year will be back-end loaded, for each of the projects we expect to start, we either control or own the land and assign leases where we have firm commitments from the anchors. As we've said on prior calls, the success of Regency's development program is occurring despite the dramatically lower level of new shopping center development starts and our own stringent criteria and disciplined focus. Persimmon Place is a prime example of exceptional quality, performance and compelling spreads of our in-process developments and redevelopments which totaled $300 million. The Whole Foods anchored center that is yet to open is already 96% leased and committed. Unique to this Whole Foods offering will be a wine tasting and tap room, a noodle bar and a build-your-own-pizza venue. Adjacent to Whole Foods, Persimmon will feature a large outdoor plaza area that will accommodate live performances and connect the center to the community. These place-making enhancements, along with our lineup of fresh-look tenants capture the theme of our center which plays to the Bay Area food and wine culture. Specifically Sur La Table will bring a unique culinary offering, along with two new and exciting restaurant concepts, Urban Plates and Pacific Catch. The projected return of 7.5% represents a spread of approximately 300 basis points above the cap rate at which we could purchase this irreplaceable shopping center. In closing, I'm extremely pleased with this quarter's results and excited about the team's focus and how well Regency is positioned for the future. Thank you for listening. We will now turn the call over to the operator for question and answer.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. 
Jeff Donnelly: Thank you for the additional disclosure around the redevelopment contribution to NOI. Can you tell us what embedded in your 2015 NOI guidance from the redevelopment contribution?
Hap Stein: I can give you an exact number I can give you a range. When you think about what we expect to do on an ongoing basis, a target of somewhere between $30 million and $50 million of redevelopments annually that should add with our disclosed returns of 7% to 10% -- that should add somewhere in the range of 50 to 100 basis points annually to our growth rate and in 2015 we're on the higher end of that.
Jeff Donnelly: Maybe just a follow-up, it might be kind of that two parter. The last call I think you guys were talking about having like a 92% objective for occupancy on your small shop leasing it pullback in the quarter what I suspect is a seasonal step back. Are you guys still confident in that objective? I noticed the same thing with kind of your leasing spreads were a little lower, is it just sort of a one-time blip that's more seasonal? Just curious what your take was?
Hap Stein:  Yes, Jeff, it is seasonal we lost ten basis points in total occupancy and usually for the first quarter we lose about 24 so less than half of what we usually lose in the first quarter. In the small shops we lost 30 basis points and that's also about half of what we normally lose in the first quarter. So we're not worried about the leasing it's actually very strong, we’ve got of lots of demand, our pipeline is right where it's been in other quarters last four quarter rolling average, so it all looks good.
Brian Smith: And I would add, Jeff, if you look back to [indiscernible] first quarter 2015 over first quarter 2014 we actually did more leasing transactions in the first quarter of this year than we did last year it was primarily in the small shop space, so the actual square footage was just a little bit lower like 70,000 square feet lower and then also our new lease rent growth for the quarter for spaces they get less than 12 months to close to 30% so that did not decelerate.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Craig Schmidt: Where do you guys expect cap rates for openers centers to trend? Do you think they'll further compress in 2015? Or, what do you see going forward?
Hap Stein: Craig we haven't been very good about predicting that, I wish I had position to do it. But  what's happening right now is after been steady what I would say for the last while, last several quarters, at 5% I think with the continued influx of private capital and particularly foreign capital we're seeing those cap rates go down. I would say the average now is easily 44.75% to 5% depending on growth and IRR is now dipping below 6.5%. There is a couple of transactions that are out there right now I think both give good examples they're both very expensive one is over $100 million and other one and is in the $90 million range and those look like they are going to be going in the mid-4%'s and IRR is going to be down below low 6s it just very competitive out there.
Brian Smith: From our perspective, once again, as Lisa alluded to, our strategy, anything we're going to be buying is going to be match funded so if we happen to be buying a lower cap rate deal, we’re going be selling a lower cap rate center but the center that we're selling is going to have a much lower growth profile and upside prospects than what we're going to be buying.
Craig Schmidt: Okay. And this is more of an industrywide question than just to focus on Regency. What you see as the biggest impediments to seeing an increasing ground-up development in the strip category?
Hap Stein: Well, there are several things that are making it really tough. I mean first of all, for the next -- for the short-term the grocery pipelines are pretty full. I mean there is obviously a of over hang out there, if you look at Chicago you've still got 29 vacant Dominic's I think on the West Coast you still have concerns on the part of grocers -- not concerns but there may be opportunities to pick up some Haggens. So I think unless you have a really, really good grocer anchored opportunity for the grocers they are not going to go for it which I think is healthy for the industry and I think when you look at the projects that we're doing makes you feel better about them. I think just the areas that we're looking where the retailers are looking, they are still focused on the in-fill, the denser closed-end locations and those are just very, very difficult to do. I have a lot of capital to do it, nobody seems to be venturing out into emerging areas. And land prices, land prices continue in those areas to get higher. I think for example at La Floresta, if that were to come on to the market today I think the land price would be more than double what we paid for and the returns would probably be closer to 6% than where we're at mid-7s.
Brian Smith: And that’s our whole food center in Northern Orange County.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christine McElroy with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Christine McElroy: I just wanted to follow-up on Jeff's question on small shop occupancy, I think last year just a clarification last year, you thought about a 200 basis point move higher from trough in Q1 to peak in Q4 in that lease rate. So I'm wondering given that you had the lower move-out to Q1, sort of what your expectations are for that small shop lease trajectory for 2015 and you didn't change your overall occupancy forecast for yearend, but does that Q1 activity sort of give you more confidence in the higher end of the range at this point?
Hap Stein: I think at least in terms of where we think small shop occupancy can go I don't think we've changed our opinion on that at all. I think we can get to 92% I think we can get above that. As I mentioned, Christy, the demand is definitely still there, the biggest thing that's been holding us back, frankly besides first quarter, is just a lack of move-out. I mean it helps our occupancy but it doesn't help us with new leasing. So I think we can continue to get there with the demand that we're experiencing, it's just a question of how high it goes.
Brian Smith: And when you get there.
Christine McElroy: Okay. And regarding Juanita Tate Marketplace I'm wondering can you discuss the nature of that cell and the pre-negotiated yield? And will that $7 million gain on sale in Q2 flow-through FFO in the second quarter since it was recently completed or will that be considered an operating property?
Hap Stein: I will handle the first part and then let Lisa, handle the second part of that quick question, Christy but some history is really relevant here on Juanita Tate. That deal literally started 21 years ago when I was at a prior company. There is a local nonprofit community organization called Concerned Citizens for South Central Los Angeles and they very much needed and wanted to have a grocery anchored neighborhood center in their community. There was nothing around, there was no fresh food offerings, they had no idea how to do it they had this land under contract and so I worked with them for a couple of years to show them the development process, try to help them get through it. When I moved over to Regency, the predecessor company two or three years later and it was just clear they weren't going to be able to get through this. So we took the project on our sales, but, the area back then, 20 years ago was nowhere near the area it is today. It has evolved into a much better area. And frankly the concern back then was once we developed it, we knew it would be successful, the demand was huge and the supply of competing centers didn't exist, but we were frankly concerned about the safety of our property managers going to the property. So, the only way at that time we were interested in doing this is if we had a commitment to sell it up front.  Concerned citizens of South Central Los Angeles always wanted to be part of the project and they always wanted to maintain ownership of the end of the day so we negotiated this and at that time the development returns were in the neighborhood of 12.5% and we negotiated about a 25% profit margin, I think it was 10 cap presale that we negotiated. It obviously took far longer than you can imagine, anybody could imagine, just the difficulty of developing in real urban areas and so what we did is we continue to adjust the spread to maintain pretty much the profit margin but we would love today to own this. I mean if we were starting all over this would be a property we would want to own, we frankly were hoping that the deal would fallout but we gave our word, we had a commitment to this nonprofit and we're honoring it.
Brian Smith: And it certainly doesn't represent a change in strategy to margin development.
Hap Stein: And with regards to whether it's in or out of FFO in the spirit of trying to adhere even more closely to NAREIT defined it will now be part of FFO, so we will not be including any gains on sale of properties.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jay Carlington with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.
Jay Carlington: So just a follow-up on that, if it was pre-negotiated, why wasn't it disclosed?
Hap Stein: While I think you never knew for sure if it was going to happen. I mean Concerned Citizens themselves does not have any financial strength so they had a partner up with somebody for the long-term ownership in the purchase of it and one of the grants the Section 104 grant had to be approved by the redevelopment agency to transfer to the new buyer. So it was unclear whether that was going to happen and as I said we were kind of hoping it would fallout, there was just too low level of certainty.
Jay Carlington:  I know just switching gears here. So I guess granted your one disposition this quarter was extremely small but looking at that at a 9% cap and then you take into account Juanita Tate and Auburn Village call it a low 7% and mid6%'s you're looking at blended cap rate of low 7%'s or high 6%'s on those sales. So how do we think about that in the context of matched funding with university commons at a 5% cap?
Lisa Palmer: First, we didn't change our disposition guidance, so our guidance cap rate is still 6.5% to 7% number one. Number two as I said in my prepared remarks and hopefully we’ve been communicating for the past, gosh I don't know how many four to eight quarters. So the match funding strategy, the disposition of those -- the lower -- when you think of the Regency's quality, Regency's lower quality, it may not be lower quality to all, but Regency's lower quality shopping centers that funding our developments. So 6.5% to 7% cap rate on those dispositions basically are funding our developments where our returns are higher than that. So that's a positive spread. University Commons we would match fund that with the sale of a more comparable cap rate property in this case we actually match fund that with equity. So that's not in our disposition guidance because we're going to draw down on our forward equity to fund that acquisition.
Jay Carlington: Okay, that makes sense. And just to double check on the guidance the redevelopment development spend is it still 25% I think on redev and the rest on development?
Lisa Palmer: I'm not certain that we've actually given that guidance. Just the spend or the start?
Jay Carlington: Just the dollar amount on the spending guidance that you’ve given. I think it's mentioned on the last call roughly 25% of that would be redevelopment but maybe that's not the case?
Lisa Palmer: Yes. It might be a little north of that.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] with Capital One Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Unidentified Analyst: Just first on the active development pipeline it was stable quarter-over-quarter. How is the shadow development pipeline trending?
Hap Stein: Well, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks it's going to be back end loaded. We expect we're going to do 100 million to 200 million of those probably $70 million is going to be redevelopment and we feel very good about those. So in order to hit the guidance we've got to do ground-up developments of between 30 million and a 130 million. We're working on nine projects that could happen in 2015. I think seven of those look real promising and a total of $140 million. So we currently have the properties and the opportunities, the real challenge is not will they happen so much the timing on these. And the reason for that is we've got some that are mixed-use where we’re dependent upon the multifamily or other use. Some of them are part of the master plan community where the developer has to perform certain responsibilities and [indiscernible]. And on the final one we're actually dependent on what happens on an adjacent parcels. So everything as I said feels real good, it's just a question of the timing, we hope they all come in the fourth quarter and that's my expectation.
Unidentified Analyst: And with regards to sort of leasing in the quarter I know there is some seasonality there but can you sort of talk about the renewal ratio as a percentage of overall expirations and how that was overall? What's for anchors and small shop?
Hap Stein: The renewal rate was over 75% in total which is higher than average, the shop I think we were 66% and that's about average and the anchors were almost 90%.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Sullivan with Cowen Group. Please proceed with your question.
Jim Sullivan: Hap, I'm curious we've been seeing more grocers take space in the past few years in both power centers. As well as open more stores in mixed-use urban locations. Given your very strong relationships with pressures how aggressive will you be considering either of these alternatives for future grocer unit growth and which is your preferred focus of the two? And when I say preferred focus, I'm not thinking in terms of power centers, it's not so much about ground up development but rather potentially value added acquisitions given the impact that putting a grocer in a power center can have on the value of the property?
Hap Stein: Jim, I think that value added acquisition opportunities is next to redevelopments because they ultimately become redevelopments would be investment priority one so that's our primary focus on those that we think are going to make sense and have upside potential we're also expanding our net to include mixed-use projects that make sense, not necessarily the urban, dense urban vertical developments but with primary focus on horizontal and somewhat on the near urban with some amount of verticality to that.
Jim Sullivan: So for example the kind of standalone grocer that we’re seeing go into some of the urban locations where it's just a grocer that kind of development is less appealing?
Hap Stein: That is less appealing we like to have we're looking at an opportunity where we're on the ground floor with a grocer and then on adjacent building we have an opportunity to purchase the ground floor which will give us an opportunity to have and include shop space, retailers and restaurants and that's more our cup of tea where we think we can really add value on the side shop space next to a strong grocer and also have all the activity around and all the daytime population around the vertical development that’s either adjacent to or part of the development.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Mike Mueller: Yes, looking at the 2015 development start guidance the range the upper end of the yield expectation looks like it moved up a little bit, just wondering if you could just talk about that, was it just one project or just some view that yields could be a little bit higher going forward?
Mike Mas: The guidance from last quarter was actually 7% to 8.5% I think the e-mail that you probably received our supplement from included a 7%, 8% range and it was corrected within two minutes of that distribution, so there has been a change to our expectations on yields.
Operator: There appear to be no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.
Hap Stein: We appreciate you taking the time on the call and your interest in Regency and wish you have a great rest of the week and a great weekend. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

Martin E. Stein: Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Later on the call Lisa and Brian will cover the exceptional results that Regency delivered in all facets of the business in 2014. I would like to first take this opportunity to briefly review the extent of what Regency's team has accomplished over the last 3 years. We increased percent leased in our operating portfolio of more than 200 basis points to nearly 96%, while rent growth grew to 12%. We achieved same property NOI growth of 4% for 3 straight years. This was driven by the combination of our high-quality portfolio, historically low levels of new supply and robust tenant demand across our markets from anchors, small shop retailers and restaurants. We completed the development of more than $500 million of high-quality shopping centers that are generating average returns of 8%. With the current spread between our developing yields and existing market cap rates, we continue to create value for our shareholders by capitalizing on these distinguishing core competency. We astutely manage our balance sheet that compares favorably other REITs with a net debt to EBITDA among the lowest in the sector. And in spite of the investments to enhance the balance sheet, we averaged nearly 6% annual core FFO per share growth. These achievements translated into returns for shareholders approaching 90%, which represents a substantial outperformance of the shopping center peer average. Even though I'm proud of these results and Regency's progress, I'm even more excited about Regency's future prospects. Brian, Lisa and I firmly believe that we will continue to distinguish Regency and grow shareholder value by persistently executing Regency's tried and true strategy of, first, sustaining superior NOI growth from a high-quality portfolio that is primarily grocery anchored. Second, developing and redeveloping great shopping centers at compelling spreads. Third, enhancing a strong balance sheet through organic earnings growth and cost effective match funding. And finally, engaging and focusing a talented team that is employing best-in-class operating systems. Lisa?
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Hap, and good morning, everyone. Our 2014 results were strong. In summary, core FFO per share was $2.82 for the year, representing an increase of more than 7%. Full year same property NOI growth, excluding termination fees, was 4%, including a net positive impact from redevelopments of 70 basis points. And as Hap said, this marks the third consecutive year of 4% NOI growth. Importantly, base rent growth continues to be the largest contributing factor. The portfolio averaged 95% leased throughout the year ending at 95.8% and spaces less than 10,000 square feet gained 90 basis points year-over-year, ending the year at 91% leased. As Hap said, we are proud of how we've enhanced an already strong balance sheet by taking measured steps to deleverage and capitalizing on opportunities. Cost effectively maintaining a conservative balance sheet through organic earnings growth and match funding remains a critical component of our strategy. The forward equity offering we completed in January, together with our fourth quarter ATM activity is consistent with this strategy. In terms of the forward sale, the amount of capital was committed to us at the share price on the offering date, and then we will draw down the proceeds and issue the shares over the next 12 months as the identified uses occur. As for the use, we closed 2 acquisitions in the last weeks of December and are working to close an additional acquisition opportunity. We will also fund development spent throughout 2015 and address our unsecured bond maturity in August. In addition to this forward sale, we also raised approximately $55 million through our ATM during the quarter. With respect to our earnings outlook for 2015, as noted in our press release in January, the offering has no impact on our previously released guidance for core FFO per share. The only impact is to acquisitions and dispositions. Our updated acquisition guidance range of $0 million to $80 million captures a potential opportunity and we reduced the high end of the disposition guidance by $65 million. In essence, a $145 million net increase in capital required for 2015. And the offering is the funding source for this capital requirement. Brian?
Brian M. Smith: Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. I also want to express how pleased I am with the fourth quarter and the 2014 operating results and the continued strength of the portfolio. I'm proud of 5.3% fourth quarter same property NOI growth and I'm certainly proud of full year NOI growth of 4%. But especially for achieving it 3 years in a row and also ending the year at 95.8% leased. What we've accomplished in terms of development is equally gratifying. In 2014, we started a $160 million of new ground up projects and completed nearly $100 million of high-quality shopping centers at close to 97% leased. These 4 completions had an average return on incremental costs approaching 10%. I introduced most of these development starts on prior calls with the exception of our fourth quarter start, The Village at La Floresta. La Floresta will be an 87,000 square foot Whole Foods anchored center located in North Orange County in California. It boasts very strong local trade demographics with average household income of $105,000 and a population of 113,000. The project is already 75% leasing committed and is projected to generate a spread of approximately 250 basis points, above private market cap rates. The fresh look design, tenancy and placemaking features at La Floresta will clearly place it as one of the top neighborhood and community shopping centers in Orange County. Despite the height in competition, I expect our development capabilities and presence in target markets, as well as relationships with key retailers, will enable us to continue to deliver an average of $150 million to $200 million of developments and redevelopments annually. In terms of fourth quarter acquisition activity, as Lisa said, we acquired 2 properties in December. The first, Indian Springs is an ATB-anchored center located in The Woodlands master planned community, North of Houston. We've owned a 50% interest in this property for some time and we acquired our partner's remaining interest this quarter for nearly $27 million. Our second acquisition is Broadway Market, a mixed center located in the heart of Seattle. The center encompasses an entire block in Seattle's more densely populated neighborhood Capitol Hill, which has a population of 223,000 and average annual incomes approaching $100,000. It has a 111,000 square feet of retail and 30 residential units, and is anchored by Kroger's QFC banner with very strong sales volumes. These acquisitions, together with those previously announced, as well as the developments we've completed and the properties that we sold during the last 3 years, have combined to enhance a portfolio that by all measures was already one of the best in the country. I'd like to briefly comment on Albertsons' purchase of Safeway and the merger between Staples and Office Depot. As you know, Safeway and Albertsons are divesting 168 stores. Six of the stores are in our portfolio and will be acquired by Haggen. One of the properties is in Seattle market, where Haggen has strong brand recognition as a good operator. The other 5 properties are in Southern California where Haggen will be new to the market. In any event, the real estate is strong and the leases are at very low rents. The office supply sectors problems are nothing new. We've been evaluating the situation for some time and have proactively worked to reduce our exposure. Today we have 11 fewer office supply stores in our portfolio than we did in 2009. The remaining 17 stores represent less than 1% of base rent. More importantly, they are located in great centers, with 15 of 17 internally graded as A properties. We think there will be significant demand for these boxes given the very limited supply of quality junior anchored space on the market nationwide. In any event, we have plenty of time to deal with the issue, as the merger will not be finalized until year-end and only 3 other leases have terms that expire prior to 2017. Tenant store closings are part of the constantly evolving nature of retail, which our teams anticipate. We aggressively and proactively manage our portfolio, and whether we're dealing with chain-wide problems or simply want to upgrade the merchandising mix, we're way out in front of the issue. In summary, we've spent a great 3 years. While I'm certainly proud of what we've accomplished, I look forward to continuing our progress and producing the results we desire and expect. The quality of our portfolio, our team's dogged ability to execute on our strategy and the current market backdrop give me confidence that positive momentum will continue into 2015. Hap?
Martin E. Stein: Thank you, Brain. Thank you, Lisa. I would like to close by reaffirming our focus on excelling in each facet of the business. Growing earnings, NAV and shareholder value, and distinguishing Regency among our peers and within the REIT sector. We thank you for your time and we'll now turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Craig Schmidt of Bank of America.
Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: The 2005 same-store NOI midpoint of 3.5% is lower than the 4% in 2014 and the 5.3% in your fourth quarter. I just wonder what are some of the factors that are impacting you to guide on that slightly lower performance?
Lisa Palmer: Craig, it's Lisa. I'll start and look to Brian to add any color. First, I think, I'd be remiss if didn't say how proud we were of the fact that we did achieve 4% for 3 consecutive years. And remind you, even pointing to some of our prepared remarks, that our strategic goal is to sustain 3%-plus NOI, same property NOI growth. And obviously, you know our sector well, even that's not necessarily going to be easy for everyone to achieve, but we believe that we will be able to sustain 3% NOI growth because of the quality of the portfolio, as well as some of the redevelopment efforts that we're doing. And so if you think about the components of growth, over the last 3 years, we have had some lift from increasing our percent leased and then also narrowing the gap of percent leased to percent rent commenced. So we've had some of that and that contributed to our 2014 growth. And then looking to 2015, we'll still gain some from having more rent paying tenants. But clearly, that is decelerating just from the fact that we're nearly 96% leased.
Brian M. Smith: Yes. Craig, I guess I would add that -- there's a few things. While we have really strong base rent growth than we're forecasting, I think, we will continue to see the kind of results that we've been turning over the last 3 years in that regard. We may be conservative right now at this point in terms of looking at prior year recoveries and we're showing some drag there, time will tell that we can do better than that. We certainly hope so. And then we're up against some pretty big other income, things last year like a payment from Kroger in Ohio and [indiscernible] that we sold out in California. We haven't identified anything specifically to replace those. So there's probably a little bit of conservatism until we have better clarity on those.
Martin E. Stein: And just finally, I'll pipe in and say, it would be really nice on this call next year to be able to say 4% 4 years in a row, and the team is really focused on enabling up. Brian, Lisa and I had a talk about that.
Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. Sounds like you'll be going for the four-peat.
Lisa Palmer: Yes.
Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Just -- one question just because you guys do have a broad focus geographically. Are -- I know your Houston exposures isn't all that great. But what are your expectation is the impact on oil on those shopping centers? And are you hearing anything to date?
Brian M. Smith: I don't think, Craig, that the impact on us is going to be meaningful at all. I mean, first of all, the economy overall is very diversified. There's -- it's been white-hot. I think it's fair to say that there's got to be a deceleration, but Houston is a strong market, Texas is going to continue to grow. I think, the impact is going to be probably greater on office and multifamily. If you just look at our portfolio, it's been established there for a long time, it's in very affluent areas. Our average household income in that portfolio is $140,000 and we're occupied greater than 98%. So -- and they're also mostly master planned communities with the Woodlands and Cinco Ranch and the likes. So you've got some protection. I think if we had some land that we closed on with the expectation of maybe some office mixed use it might be a different story, but there's none of that going on.
Operator: The next question is from across from Ross Nussbaum of UBS.
Jeremy Metz - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Jeremy Metz, I'm with Ross. Just thinking about the small shop side today, can you talk about -- have you seen an increase in mom-and-pops looking for -- to lease space? Or is this still largely national and regional tenants taking space then? And second part of that, your occupancy is now 91% for the small space. How much higher do you think you can push it and sort of what's baked in the guidance for '15?
Brian M. Smith: I don't -- we haven't seen much difference. I'll tell you the leasing is still about 20% mom-and-pops. I think it's important that we identify kind of what we mean by mom-and-pops. None of the retailers or restaurants that we're dealing with would be first-time operators who just decided to open up a business. I mean, these are people who have been in business, they're either -- it may be that they have 1, 2, 3 stores. And we're really big on, frankly, having local operators. Because if you look at the whole millennials, what are you reading in all the researches? That they like new, they like fresh, they like authentic, they like local. And they can react, particularly the restaurants, faster than the national chains. So we do about 20%. And just kind of some examples of the people that we deal with would be -- that we call mom-and-pops, would be Lily Rain in Houston. This was the guy who started Francesca's chain, took it public and then decided to leave that and he opened up his first store at our Woodway Center in Houston. Out in California, this guy, Chicken Charlie's, he was on ABC News. He's got tremendous publicity and press because of his operation which he ran out of a food truck. We opened him at Balboa and have lines out the door and the press is covering him now just because of the sensation. In terms of where we are now. We're at 91%. I think we will -- we should be able to blow through 92%. Don't know exactly how high it goes, but I would tell you our pipeline today is stronger than it has been in some time. It's about 50% of the remaining vacant spaces have activity going on right now, whereas the last 4 quarters average is more like about 43%. So I think it's going to keep going, and I'm not sure how high it gets.
Lisa Palmer: And Jeremy, I will just add from just a pure mathematical standpoint. If you look at our percent lease for our anchors being nearly 99% leased and our guidance for 2015 of actually the high end of percent lease guidance being 96.5%, that obviously all have to come from small shop space.
Jeremy Metz - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. I appreciate that color. And then second one for me. Lisa, just -- with the debt coming due, obviously, I think $250 million of the hedge and then just -- it looks like with the forward equity offering, you're obviously choosing to use that method to pay down some of that in order to bridge that gap versus using the term loan that you have existing. Just some of the thinking there versus using the term loan given what the rate it's at, it's pretty cheap cost of capital there.
Lisa Palmer: Yes. Just to remind you that we did decrease our disposition guidance. So the equity is going to fund some of our new investment as well. And then we do have a $350 million bond maturity in August. We've hedged, basically, $250 million of that. The acquisition opportunity that we've also identified as a use for our forward equity actually has a mortgage on it. So we'll be assuming some debt, cash is more or less spongeable. So the debt that we're assuming on that property, in essence, is what we'll -- we're going to be applying that and paying down the bond, if you will. So instead of refinancing at the full $350 million, we'll probably do somewhere between $250 million and $300 million. Does that make sense?
Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Yes. Appreciate the color.
Operator: The next question is from Christy McElroy of Citi.
Christy McElroy - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Brian, just wanted to follow-up on The Village at La Floresta. Can you discuss the competitive landscape of that location? It seems like there's a fair bit of grocery presence already including 2 Sprouts nearby. And then just given the number of Whole Food deals you have in the pipeline, can you talk a little bit about the extent of your partnership with them in regards to development and new location?
Brian M. Smith: Sure, Christy. Actually what's interesting about La Floresta is I wouldn't call Sprouts a full-service gourmet grocery store. This is the only full-service gourmet grocery store in North Orange County. The nearest Whole Foods is 15 miles away. So what we're finding is, because there is such demand for that kind of use that we're literally getting our pick of the litter when it comes to the small shops, which is one of the reasons why we emphasized in the introductory remarks the merchandising aspect of our Fresh Look approach to this. Whole Foods, we -- as you know, we did 5 new development starts with them this year. We have come a long way with them. If you look at the end of 2008, we had 4 Whole Foods in the portfolio. Today, we have 17 and we have a pipeline of another 11. And that's combination of development, redevelopment and the acquisition that's coming probably this next quarter or this quarter. So we just think the world of them. Anytime we have a Whole Foods, you can guarantee that it's an area that has both high income and high education, because those are the 2 most important criteria they look for. And those are areas, obviously, where you have the ability to grow household income and enhance drive sales and drive rents.
Christy McElroy - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And then Lisa, just to follow-up on some of the question on same store NOI guidance. Can you just remind me, does your same store NOI growth include the impact of redevelopment? And then just looking at 3% to 4% forecast in the component, can you give us a sense for what leasing spread could look like this year? Does your higher occupancy give you sort of more pricing power? Or if you get up into 96%-plus occupancy range, is that incremental leasing sort of that harder to lease space that you can see lower spreads on?
Lisa Palmer: Brian said he'll take the leasing spreads. I'll follow-up with the same property.
Brian M. Smith: Yes. I mean, the leasing spreads, we expect would continue to be strong. The fundamentals are strong. We know there's no new supply with this tremendous demand out there. And we also know that from our own experience that as soon as you get to 95% lease, you definitely have more pricing power, just pure supply demand. I think if you look at 2014, the difference between those centers that were over 95% and those that were under 95%, have about 420 basis points difference in the rent growth spreads. So we're starting to get -- we're -- we got pricing power in almost all of the markets now. I mean, if you look even at the markets that have lagged today that have maybe been a drag on rent growth, North Florida, Arizona and Sacramento and Central Valley, all of those markets are at least 95% having enjoyed real strong occupancy gain. So I think it's certainly -- there's nothing that would make us less optimistic that we'd be in double-digit rent growth for next year.
Lisa Palmer: And then on the same property, we do include the impact of redevelopments for the quarter. It was 100 basis points and 70 basis points for the full year, positive.
Operator: Our next question is from Jay Carlington of Green Street Advisors.
Jay Carlington: Lisa, I think you mentioned the strength in the base rent component this quarter. So curious what's driving that? Is that higher rent steps? Or redevelopment? Or are there any onetime items in there?
Lisa Palmer: I'll let Brian -- I mean, basically, nothing onetime. It's percent, basically, effective rent paying or percent commence, whatever you want -- whichever term you want to use, that's significantly increased. And then also just higher percent -- just higher rent steps. What the team has been really focused on, getting mid-term rent steps, more contractual rent steps at a higher rate. And we've made a lot of progress towards that. But I'll let Brian add some color.
Brian M. Smith: Yes. No, it's -- again, it's kind of odd view to sort of well balance. We had some other income, as mentioned earlier. The rent steps Lisa just talked to were very strong. I mean, in the fourth -- I'm sorry, the rent steps were 2% for all leases versus 1.3% for the whole portfolio. So I'm not sure if that answers it...
Martin E. Stein: It's across-the-board, but primarily -- it's the underlying fundamentals of, basically, base rent growing.
Jay Carlington: Okay. Okay. Great. And maybe switching gears...
Lisa Palmer: And base rent, obviously, also impacted just by the strong rental rate growth we've had over the past year as well. I mean, that's all -- everything contributing to it. And we expect that to continue into 2015.
Jay Carlington: Okay. Great. And maybe switching gears. I know we haven't talked about your land bank in a while. I'm just kind of curious that $56 million in market value you have there. What do you think has happened to that value of that land over the last year? And maybe as a follow-up, what's left in that bucket?
Brian M. Smith: I don't think it's necessarily increasing value. It's down from about a $150 million a few years ago, probably one of the biggest pieces in it was a project that we're starting out in Southern California, it's going to be a development with Target, Lowe's and several others, had it all leased and then the market went bad. And I think, it looks like we've got activity on that, we would like to see that sell this year. We're kind of hoping that we reduce that by another $10 million in 2015.
Jay Carlington: Is that all allocated...
Lisa Palmer: Let me just -- I'm sorry, Jay, let me clarify. Were you -- you were talking about the expansion land that's adjacent to our properties that's on our guidance page or were you talking about land bank. Because those are different. Because we mark land to market every quarter, but not if it's adjacent to an operating property and it's not -- basically, on the balance sheet separately.
Jay Carlington: Okay. So all that $56 million or so, that's just -- without parcels and land next to your current?
Lisa Palmer: Correct.
Operator: The next question is from Mike Mueller of JPMorgan.
Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: It looks like you have 6 co-investment relationships. And if you're looking out, say, the next 3 to 5 years, does that number stay static? Does it go higher? Does it go lower?
Lisa Palmer: I would expect that it would stay static. We're really happy with our partners. As you know, Mike, that they were an important part of our growth when you look back 15 years. And over the past more recent years, they've stayed pretty static.
Martin E. Stein: I think, as a percentage of our NOI that's involved in partnerships has incrementally come down and I think it will continue to come down. And we're not looking to add any new institutional partnerships at this point.
Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. Are they expanding? Like what portion of them are expanding?
Martin E. Stein: I think, they'd like to expand, but we're -- and we did the Broadway acquisition up in Seattle with our partnership with the State of Oregon. And also, I'll remind everyone that we have distributions in kind in all of our partnerships. So to the extent that those partnership -- we end those relationships, and there's no desire to do that, we've got great partners, we would end up with our pro rata share of properties.
Operator: The next question is from Jim Sullivan of Cowen and Company.
James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: I wonder, you have this -- given that the new development pipeline that's been expanding and it's expanding in many different markets, I wonder if you could kind of remind us, number one, what kind of a limit, if any, do you have or do you think about in terms of how much of your capital you want to be allocating to ground up new development, number one? And number two, I think, Christy alluded to it earlier, clearly, Whole Foods is expanding. I wonder if you could just give us a feel for the ground up development with the gross or anchored centers. Is it because of the anchors entering new markets? Or is it because of the anchors looking to just have a newer better footprint into the existing market?
Martin E. Stein: I will make a quick stab at the second part of that question, and I think the answer is yes. I think they're looking for better footprints, better infill locations and sometimes new markets. But the anchors focus has been more infill and that's been aligned with what our current focus is. From a capital allocation standpoint, we have established a guideline of -- or a limit of 2x EBITDA as far as our exposure, including our future commitments to development. And that's a little bit under $900 million. And that's something that ought to grow organically is our -- in effect, our balance sheet grows. At this point in time, we're less than half of that number. We're still looking to -- looking for opportunities, but there's not as many opportunities that meet our criteria as far as the opportunity to develop great shopping centers at compelling spreads. But we do feel in spite of competitive landscape, I think as Brian indicated and I indicated on my remarks, we ought to be able to average $150 million, $200 million of new developments and redevelopments a year. We could do somewhat more than that if compelling opportunities that met the criteria were available.
Brian M. Smith: And Jim, while we're heavy on Publix this year, I mean, we certainly are not limited to just them. I think it was reported in one of the news outlets that we're working on a Wegmans opportunity, and that's real. We think the world of them. We got Kroger concepts that we're working on. So we're doing a lot of different grocers. And in terms of where we're doing them, it's -- we have some where the grocer is moving into a new market, most of you like the Publix like we started at Willow Oaks in North Carolina, as Publix has moved up into Charlotte. But by and large, it's high barrier markets where it's tough to get stores going. And I think, La Floresta is an example of that. Whole Foods have been trying to get the North Orange County for a long time. They're certainly well represented in Orange County and in a lot -- in the whole Southern California area. But it just takes time to do those. Same thing with Belmont in Washington DC, and that's a master planned community that's been in the works for many, many years. And that was our only opportunity since there will be one grocery center in that development. So mostly it's infill in existing markets, but every now and then we have something like the Publix still to go into a new market.
Operator: Our next question is from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust.
Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Could you talk a little bit about your G&A cost run rate in the fourth quarter, it looks like your gross G&A went up. Pretty measurably but also your capitalized portion of that went up, which is major net G&A looked pretty static, I'm just curious what the run rate looks like going to 2015. And if there's any reasons why those things change during the quarter?
Lisa Palmer: No. The G&A was higher in the fourth quarter. There's a portion of our incentive comp plan that's not finalized until the fourth quarter. So we'll always see more in G&A in the fourth quarter assuming that we have incentive comp to pay more in the fourth quarter than in the prior quarters. We do accrue for some, but not for all. And then for our guidance for G&A that we provided in mid-December was flat to up 3.5%, and that remains unchanged.
Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: But the capitalized portion is that just -- is it just a pro rata movement?
Lisa Palmer: Again, the capitalized piece is -- the part of this incentive comp that we don't finalize until the fourth quarter is related to our development program. And so a lot of that, that was -- that happened in the fourth quarter was actually capitalized -- capitalizable incentive comp. And it's just a result of our increased development activity. And we would expect selling into 2015 that capitalized development costs will actually be down some. But still in the -- not as high $16 million but stays in the $12 million to $15 million range.
Martin E. Stein: That incentive comp is paid based upon development performance on the back end once the properties are complete and leased up. And that's -- just so you know, it's the field that earns that -- will earn that incentive compensation.
Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: And that all gets factored into the development yields that you disclosed, right?
Lisa Palmer: Of course. Yes.
Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: And just the last quick one. What is the average cash rent step up for your portfolio on average?
Lisa Palmer: I'm sorry, I didn't hear the question.
Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: What is average cash rent step up that your portfolio generates in any given year? The embedded bumps?
Lisa Palmer: You mean, the mid-term contractual rent steps.
Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Yes. Yes.
Lisa Palmer: Okay.
Brian M. Smith: So for the entire portfolio, our midyear rent steps are 1.3%. Although as I mentioned earlier, we have really been focused on that part of the business for the last of couple years. And for 2014, all the leases we signed had an average of 2% rent bumps and we get it 87% of the time, which is a lot higher than historically is in the average.
Martin E. Stein: So our objective is to take that 1.3% contribution to NOI growth up to 1.5% or 1.6%.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question is from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies.
Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: My question is around the acquisition outlook. Just curious, again, if there are opportunities to do transactions of decently large portfolios in markets that you guys want to get more of a presence, and very similar to what you were trying to do with AmREIT, whether those kind of opportunities exist either in the private or public markets?
Martin E. Stein: There's a limited number of large -- I mean, of portfolio opportunities and/or one-off opportunities that meet our criteria that have superior NOI growth. And just once again, when we buy a shopping center, we're going to finance it, primarily or kind of our go-to financing is sell a shopping center at roughly comparable cap rates that has a much lower growth rate. But it's a very competitive market out there and not a lot that meet our criteria. But our team works very -- Brian's team work very, very diligently to find market transactions and has had a decent amount of success for finding great centers with good upside.
Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: So that's helpful. And then just one more question on the small shop side. If you could just talk about any change in regards to demand from new types of tenant for that space or is it still kind of the same group of people who have been seen in the past 12 months to 18 months?
Brian M. Smith: I think it's pretty much the same. I mean when we talk about the retailers that are doing well, those are the ones that are looking to expand. And that has a long list. But primarily, I would say the common thread would be anything that's related to health, whether that's restaurants, whether it's exercise places, athletic apparel, massages, those are really the ones that are in big demand. There's very few categories I'd say that where the retailers are struggling and aren't really looking in -- and you know that list, it hasn't changed, toys, office, tanning supplies, dry cleaners, books. Other than that, it remains very vibrant across-the-board.
Operator: We have no further questions in queue at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back over to management.
Martin E. Stein: We thank you and appreciate your time. And wish everybody a great President's Day weekend. Thank you very much.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Regency Centers Corporation Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Mike Mas, Senior Vice President, Capital Markets for Regency Centers Corporation. Thank you. Sir, you may begin.
Michael Mas: Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2014 conference call. Joining me today is Hap Stein, our Chairman and CEO; Brian Smith, President and COO; Lisa Palmer, our Chief Financial Officer; and Chris Leavitt, Senior Vice President and Treasurer. Before we start, I would like to address forward-looking statements that may be discussed on the call. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Hap.
Martin E. Stein: Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll be brief. Our results are excellent in all facets of the business. And I know that Lisa and Brian are looking forward to walking you through the details of the impressive performance of the operating portfolio, development program and the cost-effective execution of our match-funding strategy. We expect this positive momentum to continue into next year. As you'll hear from Brian, our results to date and my optimism about future NOI growth prospects are indicative of the health of the portfolio, which by all objective measures, is one of the industries' best. We are also benefiting from the favorable supply environment and continuing strong demand for better centers from expanding retailers. I'm especially proud of our disciplined development and redevelopment program that is also performing exceptionally well in spite of increased competition. I believe that our market teams and their relationships, their local knowledge and experience should allow us to continue to win more than our fair share of the opportunities to develop great shopping centers at compelling profit margins. Before I turn the call over to Lisa, I want to congratulate Kerr Taylor and the AmREIT board for achieving an exceptional result for their shareholders. Lisa?
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Hap, and good morning, everyone. The positive underlying fundamentals produced strong financial results in the third quarter with core FFO per share of $0.71, representing a 9% per share increase over the third quarter of last year. Same property percent leased increased 50 basis points from the prior quarter to 95.8%, and same property NOI growth, excluding termination fees, was 4.1% for the quarter and 3.6% year-to-date. As in prior quarters, and importantly, base rent growth was the largest contributing factor to overall NOI growth. I would also note that redevelopments had a positive impact of 70 basis points on year-to-date growth. With these strong results, we are raising the midpoint for core FFO per share by $0.04 to a new range of $2.80 to $2.83. I will quickly run through the drivers of this increase. First, NOI from the same property pool and developments continues to exceed our expectations. We now expect same property NOI growth in the range of 3.5% to 3.8%, and we expect the same property pool to finish the year in the range of 95.5% to 96% leased. Second, the robust leasing volume that we've experienced has also outpaced projections and is favorably impacting G&A through higher capitalization than originally planned. Lastly, the timing of dispositions in 2014 has continued to become more back-end loaded, and while this benefits earnings for 2014 by approximately only $0.01 per share, it will slightly dampen 2015 FFO growth. That being said, and as Hap indicated, early projections are showing that same property NOI growth next year should meet and possibly exceed our long-term growth target of 3%. We currently plan to release more detailed 2015 guidance in December through a press release. In terms of capital markets activity, during the quarter, we raised nearly $50 million using our ATM at a weighted average share price of $57.35. This will fund a portion of this year's and next year's development spend. As a consequence, we lowered the top end of 2014 disposition guidance by $35 million and now intend to sell $15 million less next year than would have otherwise been the case. This is consistent with our match-funding strategy that we've shared with you in the past. We have and will continue to fund our visible development pipeline with property sales, but will also be opportunistic and use equity when it make sense to us. Brian?
Brian M. Smith: Thank you, Lisa. Good morning, everyone. For some time now, we've been confident that the steps we've taken to enhance our portfolio in terms of quality, location, grocer sales and demographics as well as our efforts to upgrade our merchandising, will begin to take our operational results to an even higher level. Since the beginning of 2012, we've really seen that unfold and continue to gain momentum. It's worth repeating that the same property portfolio is now 95.8% leased with small shops exceeding 91%, which represents a gain of 200 basis points year-over-year. As occupancy levels heighten, we continue to benefit from limited new supply, giving us even more purchasing power and allowing us to achieve double-digit rent growth in every quarter of this year. In addition, contractual rent steps have been a significant area of focus, and we're making great strides, receiving better midterm increases from both national and small shop tenants. In fact, rent steps for all leases signed year-to-date have averaged nearly 2%. This represents a meaningful increase over the current portfolio average of 1.3%. Total and small-shop moveouts have also trended very positively over the last 5 quarters and continue to be well below historic norms despite our proactive efforts to terminate leases where we have the opportunity. For these reasons, as Hap and Lisa both indicated, the outlook for 2015 operating fundamentals is looking really good. Turning to development. Competition is increasing, but today, we fared well in this competitive landscape due in large part to our experience, local presence, credibility and strong retailer relationships. We've also been successful in leveraging our relationships with residential and office developers to become a retail developer of choice in many master-planned communities. This was the case with our 2 third quarter starts, which I'd like to further describe. The first, CityLine Market, will be an 80,000 square-foot shopping center anchored by Whole Foods. CityLine Market will be part of a 186-acre mixed-use project in suburban Dallas. The initial phase of the project is currently underway, with 2 million square feet of office space that will be occupied by nearly 10,000 State Farm and Raytheon employees, along with 1,000 multifamily units in an Aloft Hotel, all having walkable access to our center. Construction on this phase of the project will be complete prior to CityLine's opening in early 2016. And that's just the beginning. Subsequent phases will triple the build-out I just mentioned. Because of the premier location and consistent with our fresh-look branding, we're focused on ways to increase connectivity between retailers and customers, enhance the walkability of the community and incorporate large open spaces into the design to encourage customers to come, shop and stay. To date, we've had overwhelming interest in this project, with quality prospects for more than 95% of the space. Some exciting restaurant concepts and premier health and wellness-focused service providers round out the current lineup. Our second development start, Belmont Shopping Center, is equally impressive. Belmont will benefit from a very affluent trade area, boasting the highest median income in the country. It is well located at the entrance of Toll Brothers' master-planned community of Belmont at the interchange of a major east-west thoroughfare linking the community to Tysons Corner and downtown Washington D.C. The Belmont residential component is fully built out and consists of nearly 2,200 homes and townhomes, with the highest price point of any community in the Toll Brothers portfolio. It also includes the Belmont Executive Center, which is approved for 1.4 million square feet of other uses. Belmont Center will also be anchored by Whole Foods and already has an outstanding lineup of restaurant operators, including West Coast-borne MOD Pizza and The Habit Burger Grill, each choosing Belmont as their first location in the region. Despite having just started construction, this center is quickly approaching 85% leased, and along with CityLine Market, is a stacking up to be an exceptional addition to the portfolio. Turning to dispositions. During the quarter, we sold 5 assets for a net pro rata proceeds of nearly $60 million. Interest has been strong and our assets marketed for sale. We're seeing improved pricing and often receiving multiple offers. This, combined with the fact that we're taking better properties to market given the overall quality of the portfolio, is allowing us to match fund acquisitions with dispositions at comparable cap rates. As a result, I'm confident in our ability to continue to cost-effectively fund developments and acquisitions with property sales. Hap?
Martin E. Stein: Think you, Brian, and thank you, Lisa. To close, I'm extremely gratified by the positive results that Regency's dedicated and talented team continues to produce. In addition, I'm excited about Regency's future prospects to sustain growth in net asset value and earnings per share through our formula of NOI growth from a high-quality portfolio, value-creating development and redevelopments and a strong balance sheet. We look forward to seeing many of you in Atlanta for NAREIT's annual REITWorld conference. We thank you for your time, and we'll now turn the call back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jay Carlington with Green Street Advisors.
Jay Carlington: Brian, you hinted that that 2% contractual rent number for leases signed. It was -- I guess, that's kind of above your 1.5% long-term goal. Is that kind of a good run rate to think about? And what does that imply to your longer-term NOI growth?
Brian M. Smith: Well, our goal is to get this up to 1.5% for the whole portfolio from the 1.3%. I think the run rate for the leases that are signed each quarter in the 1.8% to 2% range is about right. But given that that's still is a small percentage of the whole portfolio, it's just going to take a while to lift the entire portfolio.
Jay Carlington: Okay. So does it feel like that's something that's sustainable through '15, that kind of 2% type number with new leases signed?
Brian M. Smith: Yes. I think, it's like 2% for the quarter and 1.8% year-to-date. But if anything, we're getting more momentum in that regard, so I think it is a good run rate.
Martin E. Stein: But [ph] over it. Okay, and [indiscernible] period, the number could exceed 1.5% to 2 -- go, of course to 2%. In effect, we're turning about 10% of the space a year, so think about it that way. So to get it to 1.5% will take us a few years to get that, but I think the run rate beyond that is pretty encouraging.
Jay Carlington: Okay. And Lisa, I think you've said in the past, you consider equity issuances as a financing alternative when the stock was trading favorably in relation to your NAV. So curious how you view the recent share issuance of the ATM this quarter.
Lisa Palmer: I would again just reiterate that the use of equity is consistent with our articulated match-funding strategy to fund our development. We, first, look to property sale, low growth assets, but as you said, Jay, to the extent that equity is trading within -- each quarter, what we do is we establish -- or not even each quarter, it's really daily, we think about equity and we establish a relatively narrow-range view of NAV based on current private market pricing. And when we believe that equity is trading within that range, we will cap the ATM program.
Martin E. Stein: But not all the time, as -- but as a component of our match-funding strategy.
Lisa Palmer: And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the extent that we do raise equity, it will be replacing property sales. It's not in addition to it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi.
Christy McElroy - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And this is Christy here for Michael. Brian and Lisa, you both touched on this in your remarks. But I'm just wondering, as the external NOI growth expectations have continued to be revised higher throughout the year, what would you say has been the biggest positive surprise to internal growth in 2014? Your -- some of your comments would suggest occupancy, but you also talk a lot about the contractual rent, so just looking for more color on that. And the occupancy, would you say that incremental leasing or fewer moveouts was the greatest factor?
Brian M. Smith: It's all that. The -- it was driven by base rent. And so it's all the components of the base rent. We had strong leasing. I think overall, it's about 10% for the pro rata basis, higher than it was the same quarter last year. Our rent steps are higher, our rent growth continues to trend up and we've also had very, very favorable moveout. I think I mentioned last quarter that's it's rare that the moveouts get to 300,000 square feet per quarter, and that 3 of the 4 quarters, we're at or below 300,000. This quarter, it was 224,000. So it just shows you the continued positive surprise on the moveouts, but also strongly seeing rent steps and rent growth.
Christy McElroy - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, and then I'm not sure if you're able to comment on this, regarding the bidding process for AmREIT and sort of how you thought about value, the assets and the context of what your maximum bids be, and maybe what you think about the ultimate deal price as about the frothiness in the market.
Martin E. Stein: Well, we have work as -- I'm not going to comment on the process. I will comment from the standpoint as we think that -- as I said, I think the company achieved great pricing and a great result for their shareholders. And being a shareholder, we're very happy with the outcome. I'll also note that as you, Christy, know, and others on the call may know, we've already got a wonderful platform in Houston that we feel really good about and we're happy to have that.
Christy McElroy - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Can you say what your total costs were associated with the pursuit of AmREIT?
Martin E. Stein: No.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities.
Christopher R. Lucas - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division: Just a quick question, Brian or Hap. On the escalators, I guess, really just in terms of your leasing approach right now, how do you balance out your opportunities to push escalators versus control of the space versus the TI dollars. How are you thinking about your leasing approach to tenants at this point?
Brian M. Smith: Well, the #1 thing we're looking at is the quality of the user. So first and foremost, that's what we want. Market rents continue to go up and we expect to get at least market rents. And then from that point on, it's the escalator. So it's really all of the above to the extent you got an incredible retailer that provides some kind of a wow factor with a center, we think would enhance the leasability of that center and the overall -- I think, the overall NOI growth, then we may work with them on the steps versus the initial rent. But what we found so far is that's not the case. On the -- if you look at kind of the Fresh Look tenants we've been putting in, we've not only been getting the high initial rent, but we've been getting consistent steps and the build-outs have been very modest. So we look at the mall. It's a lease-by-lease situation but right now, they all seem to be going in our favor.
Christopher R. Lucas - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division: And then just on the shadow development pipeline of things that you're looking at, is that getting incrementally larger? Or how are you thinking about that over the long haul, over the next sort of 3 years? Is that -- what's the outlook for that pipeline?
Brian M. Smith: Well, first and foremost, we are very focused on the developments because we think developing these quality centers in strong protected market is an important driver of NAV and it's a differentiating competitive advantage for us. We have the desire and the capability to do more but it's pretty tough out there. So for 2014, we expect we'll be at the high end of the guidance range, about $240 million. After that, we're looking at $150 million to $200 million and that could be lumpy, just -- that's the nature of development. And as much as we'd love to do more, we are limited by the opportunity set, given the discipline that we're showing in terms of what kind of properties, what kind of markets we want to pursue. And then, as you are aware, we're also restricted by the limit that we put on it of no more than 2x EBITDA for total commitments.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]
Martin E. Stein: For those of you all that took time away from NAREIT, it's greatly appreciated and we'll let you go back to whatever you do related to NAREIT. Thank you very much for your time on the call. And everybody, have a great day, and look forward to seeing a lot of you, as I indicated earlier, in Atlanta. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mike Mas. Thank you. You may now begin.
Michael Mas: Good afternoon and welcome to our second quarter 2014 conference call. Joining me today are Hap Stein, our Chairman and CEO; Brian Smith, our President and COO; Lisa Palmer, our Chief Financial Officer; and Chris Leavitt, Senior Vice President and Treasurer. Before we start, I would like to address forward-looking statements that may be discussed on the call. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Hap.
Martin E. Stein: Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before discussing our results for the quarter, I want to briefly address our proposal to acquire AmREIT and reaffirm our interest in pursuing a combination of our companies. As you know, on July 10, we publicly announced Regency's proposal to acquire AmREIT for $22 per share in cash or stock. At the time of the announcement, our proposal represented a 20% premium based upon the average closing price of AmREIT's common stock over the 30-day prior period and was 10% above AmREIT's all-time high. The combination would offer significant benefits to shareholders of both companies, including an opportunity to leverage synergies to grow same property NOI, a robust balance sheet with readily available capital for growth and a strong platform to realize additional value through development and densification. We were pleased when last week on July 29, AmREIT confirmed it will commence the process to explore strategic alternatives. We expect that this process will be fair, open and robust. We look forward to participating and receiving adequate information to make this compelling combination a reality. That being said, I would like to stress that we will be highly disciplined and, as always, shareholders' capital will only be deployed if we are confident that the opportunity meets our stringent investment criteria and creates value for Regency shareholders. This process will not divert our team's focus on growing that operating income, delivering high-quality developments and redevelopments and maintaining a rock-solid balance sheet. With that, let's turn to the purpose of this call and discuss our extremely gratifying quarter and Regency's strategy for continuing the success. As you'll hear from both Brian and Lisa, Regency's team is truly firing on all cylinders, executing our strategy and making progress toward our goals. First, the occupancy, pricing and merchandising power of Regency's high-quality portfolio continues to gain momentum. As evidenced by strong NOI growth, double-digit rent growth and a portfolio that is more than 95% leased, the underlying operating fundamentals are very strong and still improving across our attractive target markets. And the team has been successful not only in driving rents, but also with contractual increases. Looking forward, we expect to continue to benefit from the historically low level of new supply, robust tenant demand for premium spaces and, particularly, the inherent quality of the portfolio, including the potential for redevelopments enabling us to achieve annual NOI growth of 3% over the long term, even as we remain above 95% leased. Second, the outstanding characteristics of the developments we started since the downturn clearly demonstrate Regency's best-in-class development expertise and disciplined focus. We are delivering these projects at meaningful margins to the cost of acquiring centers of comparable quality. The reputation we crafted as the leading developer and the relationships we've long held with players in our target markets position us to continue to win an outsize share of the limited number of development opportunities that will meet our stringent criteria. Third, this quarter's capital markets activity is aligned with our goal of maintaining and opportunistically strengthening an already strong balance sheet that measures up to other blue chip REITs. Lisa will describe our recent activity in greater detail, but it's clear that our balance sheet provides us with the capital sources and flexibility to astutely and cost effectively take advantage of attractive opportunities. Looking forward, we will continue to keep our eye on executing the fundamentals while evaluating compelling opportunities to generate shareholder value and to remain at the forefront of our industry. We are constantly exploring ways to enhance our leading edge and our teams are very focused and very engaged. Lisa?
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Hap, and good afternoon, everyone. Financial results for the second quarter exceeded our expectations with core FFO per share of $0.71, representing a 6% increase over the second quarter of last year. And further on a year-to-date basis, core FFO per share has increased by nearly 7% over last year. Same property percent lease reached 95.3% and same property NOI growth excluding termination fees was 3.8% for the quarter and most importantly, the primary driver of the same property NOI growth was an increase in base rent. In April, we issued a $250 million Green Bond, making Regency the first U.S. REIT to issue this type of security. We are extremely proud of this accomplishment, as we believe it reflects the quality of our industry-leading sustainability program. And at closing, just a reminder, we settled our previously executed forward-starting swaps. And with these swaps, we will recognize interest expense at an effective rate of 3.6% for the life of the bonds. During the quarter, we also modified our term loan providing us with an additional $90 million of capacity and bringing the total commitment to $165 million. We have the ability to draw these additional proceeds through August of 2015 coinciding with our next unsecured bond maturity. The spread over LIBOR was reduced by 30 basis points and the term was extended to June of 2019. As Hap said, these and prior transactions have shown that our balance sheet provides us with multiple sources of capital, allowing us substantial flexibility to fund future opportunities. Through the second quarter, we've outperformed on many components of the plan and as a result, we increased full year guidance for core FFO per share to a new range of $2.75 to $2.80. There are multiple drivers of this increase and I'll quickly run through a few of them. First and foremost, because of our consistently positive operating results, strong leasing and low levels of moveouts, we're benefiting from higher NOI in the same property pool, as well as in our in-process developments. This impact is evidenced by our increase in guidance ranges for both same property NOI growth and percent leased. We now expect same property NOI growth in the range of 3% to 3.7% and we expect the same property pool to finish the year in the range of 95% to 96% leased. Second, third-party fees and commissions are also outpacing expectations, a result of the continued strength of the leasing environment. And finally, the timing of dispositions is tracking behind our original plan so we are seeing a small benefit from that standpoint, as well. Specifically on dispositions, we raised guidance and reduced the projected cap rate. These changes reflect the combination of increased visibility for development starts, as well as our most recent acquisition, which Brian will describe in more detail. This is consistent with our matched funding capital strategy, whereby we match development spend with dispositions of noncore assets and we match acquisitions with dispositions at roughly comparable cap rates of lower growth assets. Brian?
Brian M. Smith: Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, we saw the hard work, the experience and the creativity of our teams continue to translate into strong operating results. We think volume remains very healthy as we take advantage of the high demand for prime space. This coupled with historically low levels of moveouts, drove same property percent leased above 95%. Small shops led the way gaining 60 basis points over the prior quarter to 90.3% leased. Given retailers' appetite for expansion in the high-quality shopping centers like ours, we still have room to run to push percent lease even further. The caliber of our properties, the demand for quality space, the lack of new supply, and our high level of occupancy, these are powerful forces for driving rents, and our local teams are taking full advantage of this environment. Rent growth in the second quarter was 15%, representing the 13th consecutive quarter of positive rent growth. And midterm rent steps from leases signed in the quarter, exceed the portfolio average, both in terms of annual growth and a percent of leases from which we get these increases. We recently started ground-up development on a Publix-anchored center in the Charlotte market. Willow Oaks Crossing will be Regency's first ground-up development in Charlotte and we're excited to expand our footprint in the Carolinas as Publix enters this market. We also started redevelopment work in Westchester Commons, which is an affluent suburb of Chicago where Mariano's is taking the former Dominick's space plus an additional 30,000 square feet of adjacent space and there's no downtime involved. Additionally, we'll be redeveloping our Brighten Park center in Atlanta. As part of the process, we'll replace Loehmann's with a fresh market, which is a great outcome and will inject new vitality and generate increased daily traffic for the center. We completed our Juanita Tate development near downtown Los Angeles. By every measure, this project has outperformed, not only do we complete it at a high return of nearly 10%, but it reached 100% leased in only 14 months from groundbreaking. This project exemplifies our market base development expertise and our disciplined approach. Since 2009, we started 19 projects, representing an investment of nearly $500 million. 12 of these projects have been completed and average 98% leased with a combined incremental return that is greater than 9%. The demographics, excellent locations and merchandising make these centers outstanding additions to our portfolio. Although new development competition is heating up, particularly in areas where we compete with high-rise, multifamily developers, I continue to believe that Regency's experience, our well-connected local development teams, with our strong retailer relationships, the credibility we have in the markets and the inherently redevelopment potential within the operating portfolio will yield an ample amount of compelling future value-add opportunities. The combination of these factors, along with the progress we've made on projects in the pipeline, enabled us to increase the low end of guidance for 2014 development and redevelopment starts. Turning to acquisitions. We continue to see very limited amounts of A quality assets coming to market. And when they do, pricing is hypercompetitive with some centers trading well below 5% cap rates. We successfully acquired properties off market, as we did most recently with our Clybourn Commons acquisition. Clybourn Commons is located in Lincoln Park, which in our view is one of Chicago's most attractive submarkets. It boasts a 3-mile daytime population of nearly 1 million people and a combined purchasing power that exceeds $600,000, placing it among the top assets in our portfolio on this measure. The center is 100% leased and provides plentiful on-site surface parking that is rarely found in dense urban locations. We're really excited about the long term upside potential of this center. As Lisa noted, Clybourn Commons and the earlier acquisition of Mira Vista are being match funded with the sale of 3 properties that will be sold in an average cap rate in the upper 5% range. The slightly lower acquisition cap rates for Clybourn and Mira Vista will be more than made up by their superior NOI growth profile and upside, compared to less than 1% growth that is projected from the centers being sold. As far as dispositions go, while timing is slower than expected, demand is strong with multiple offers on many properties. As a result, we are confident we'll reach our full year guidance and achieve better pricing, which is reflected in the 50-basis-point reduction in our cap rate guidance for dispositions. Our better cap rates reflect not only a strong transaction market, but also the fact that the assets we are selling are of better quality than in previous years as a result of the substantial progress made in eliminating low-quality properties from the portfolio. Looking forward, as we move beyond 95% leased, I can assure you, there's not a trace of complacency. I'm gratified by the results, but even more excited about our prospects, and the team is intently focused on finding opportunities to add value to NOI growth, redevelopments and new developments. Hap?
Martin E. Stein: Thanks, Brian, and thanks, Lisa. In closing, we are pleased with our results this quarter, highlighted by strong NOI and developments that are translating into growth in core FFO and NAV. At Regency, we have the right strategy, the right balance sheet and especially the right team and our quality portfolio and development capabilities position us well to deliver for our shareholders. We remain committed to enhancing value by executing our proven business strategy and capitalizing on compelling opportunities. We really appreciate your time. We thank you for it, and will now turn the call over to the operator.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Christy McElroy with Citi.
Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Can you provide your expectations for timing of the remaining dispositions for the balance of the year, sort of the volume that's in the guidance range right now in each of Q3 and Q4? And how much did the change in timing actually contributed to the guidance increase, the FFO included?
Lisa Palmer: I'll handle the -- I'll answer the second part first and then I'll let Brian to add some color on the disposition market in general. But the earnings increase is really related -- so dispositions are a piece of that and depending on the timing and when we close, if we assume that we close all of them by September 1, it could be up to $0.03, really kind of a drag or dilutive for the remainder of 2014. But it's sort of depending again on when they actually close. It's going to be anywhere from $0.01 to $0.03 for the deceleration of 2014. And then the rest of the increase is related to, as we've noted on the call, third-party fees and commissions have come in above our expectations, and that's our Retailer Services group, as well as leasing commissions from our co-investment partnerships. And then we are also favorable on interest expense. We had projections in for our bond offering and it wasn't until we closed that we knew exactly what that spread would be, and that came in tighter than we had expected and then the rest is really just driven by the increases in same property NOI and development NOI, as well.
Brian M. Smith: Christy, in terms of the timing, the reason for the delay is so far is just that in the pool properties we're planning on selling this year, 7 of those properties are joint ventures, so it's taken longer than we expected to go to them and in the case where they have right of first offers actually come back to us whether they want to take advantage of those and also whether they wanted to buy out our shares. So we've since gotten past that, we've closed one of the properties since the end of the quarter and we've got a total of almost $100 million that are either under contract with our deposits or in negotiated contracts. So we feel really good about getting to the $170 million, $175 million by year end.
Christy McElroy - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And then, Lisa, just following up on that increase in same store NOI guidance. I'm assuming that it would have been an even greater increase if you haven't had the weather related impacts in Q1. I know you tend to start out with more conservative expectations, but can you just provide a little bit more color around sort of specifically what's occurred that's been better then you expected when you first gave guidance?
Lisa Palmer: It's actually really related mostly to lower moveouts than what we expected and then also just a more -- the spread between percent rent paying and percent leased had narrowed more quickly, really not related to expenses or reimbursements. We do have -- our reconciliations are done in the first half of the year and we did have approximately -- it rounds up to about $2 million of prior year net recovery income, but that's almost exactly what we had last year. So that's not contributing to our growth.
Christy McElroy - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Is it lower moveouts, lower early moveouts or lower moveouts on the lease expiration?
Brian M. Smith: It's just lower moveouts in general. We had this year or this quarter 294,000 square feet in the operating portfolio and it's pretty rare to have less than 300, yet 3 in the last 4 quarters have been averaging around about 300,000. And in particular, our small shop moveouts, first half is the best half we've ever had and that follows the best year in 2013, so we're off to an even stronger start than our best year.
Lisa Palmer: And so -- I mean, if you put it in context, it's amazing how kind of little it moves the needle, right? 50 bps of same property NOI growth on a portfolio of our size, which is only 26 million square feet pro rata, is only 130,000 square feet of space.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Jim Sullivan with Cowen and Company.
James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Two questions for me, guys. First of all, you've obviously done a great job in terms of the occupancy rate with the increase in the guide this year for the -- or this quarter for the full year. Looking at or thinking about that on a regional basis, 2 of the more important states in the portfolio in terms of the percentage of annual base rent are below that midpoint in the occupancy guide and obviously Florida is very important, as well as Colorado. And I'm just curious, as you think about the strength or weakness for the portfolio, what's your outlook for Florida and Colorado? Those are 2 states that set up occupancies. Are you optimistic that you can raise the rate to the overall average?
Brian M. Smith: Yes, especially when you talked about Colorado, Colorado is one of our stronger markets in terms of rent growth and you -- I think it's the one market that stands out where there's no correlation between pricing power, which we have there and occupancy, which is low. And the reason for that this really is just we have that one vacancy in South Lowry where Safeway went dark. But other than that, the occupancy is good and we do have pricing power in that market. In terms of other markets that have lagged in the past, we're starting to see a lot of improvement, we don't yet have pricing power there, but if you look at for example, Arizona, we had 770-basis-point increase in occupancy this quarter and over 1,100 basis points year-to-year. So we're seeing activity, we're growing occupancy and with that, will come pricing power, which hasn't come yet. And then Florida's pretty much the same story. We're up 210 basis points in North Florida, which has been the weaker part, that's a quarter-to-quarter number. A lot more activities you've seen in the past and then we're even seeing, I think, some 180 basis points increase in the Inland Empire. The only market that we didn't have rent growth was the Central Valley, California. We have very little presence there. So we're starting to see contributions from markets we haven't seen in the past.
James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay, then the second question for me and I guess, primarily this would be for Hap in your -- Hap, in your letter to AmREIT, you talked about working -- looking forward to working with that company on the densification of a couple of their projects. And I'm just curious about the appetite on the part of Regency for more urban or infill locations where densification would be a bigger part of the value creation than maybe what you guys have been doing in the past?
Martin E. Stein: And I'll make my comments in general rather than specifically as it relates to AmREIT. Based upon where our developments are taking place and our acquisitions, including the Clybourn Commons acquisitions in Lincoln Park, there is a tremendous amount of focus or greater emphasis as far as our strategy relates to investing in more near-urban locations like Lincoln Park. And at a number of our developments, for those of you that have been to Cameron Village, we have mixed-use components. And that will continue to be -- mining that part of our existing portfolio and being involved in developments like Glen Gate, which is in Chicago, which -- where we bought the whole property and sold off a portion to an apartment developer. The Riverside development near downtown Jacksonville is also adjacent to 2 apartment buildings. So we view that as being a growing component of our investment strategy, both within the existing portfolio and where we look for new developments. Most of what we've done to date have been what I call horizontal, mixed-use horizontal densification. Obviously, and we have a couple of projects where it's more vertically oriented, but that involves a lot more costs, a lot more complication, not that we wouldn't be embracing that, but we are cognizant of issues related to what I would call vertical integration on projects.
James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay. Then actually, if I could, a third question and this might be more appropriate for Brian. But with the Safeway-Albertsons transaction now having been approved by Safeway shareholders, as we think about the endgame there and what might have to happen in terms of either store closings or dispositions of assets, I'm just curious if you anticipate any kind of risk or opportunity in your portfolio from a fallout that might result from that transaction?
Brian M. Smith: It's hard to tell at this point, Jim. We -- I just found out a couple of minutes ago that they're apparently going to announce it in the next couple of days the store closures. But our view on having gone space by space through the portfolio is that there's more opportunities than there is risk. We think that, by and large, they'll continue to operate a vast majority of the properties. Several of our markets we don't have any overlaps, so we don't see much risk there but good assets. Where we do have significant overlap, an example -- the perfect example, really, is San Diego and that part of Southern California. In that area, I think, we'll probably get some help from the FTC because both of those companies have significant market share in that -- there. So they're not going to be able to just close stores. So I don't know what's going to happen there, but overall, we see more opportunity than the rest of the -- the rents in Safeway portfolio are pretty low. They're -- and what I think will happen is, if we get any of those spaces back, it's likely we'll have the same kind of outcome we had when we released Dominick's to Mariano's with 160% rent growth or the Randalls down in Houston when we released at 150% rent growth.
Lisa Palmer: And then to clarify, the comment about getting help from the FTC, what Brian is referring to is that they won't be able to basically prevent us from re-leasing that space. So if they're forced to close it, they can't keep out another grocer. And that's why we would be able to recapture the space and then capitalize on the opportunity to re-lease it.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.
Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: On the leasing spreads, I was wondering if you could give us a sense as to where you see them trending as we move into 2015, because they've been heading up every quarter, it seems like?
Brian M. Smith: Well, they have been heading up every quarter, I think, that there's no reason why that can't continue to happen. It's obviously being driven by fundamentals, which remain strong. The lack of supply is obviously some wind in our back. Our pipeline of leasing right now is higher as a percentage of vacant space than it has been in any time in the last 5 quarters. Our occupancies continue to grow. We're well over 95% now. And we know that in our portfolio, those centers that are leased greater than 95% enjoyed 600-basis-point higher rent growth than those that were less than 95%. So I see no reason why this can't continue to happen. We just learned in July of a very significant rent growth we're getting from anchor that renewed that we actually hadn't counted on. So I don't see anything right now that's going to slow it down. We are just going to continue to mine the portfolio for opportunities and use of aggressive asset management, get back spaces where we think we can create some more value through rent growth.
Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Do you think you could be in the high-teens in 2015?
Martin E. Stein: The trend over -- that we're basically about is continuing -- hopefully continuing to double-digit rent growth that we've experienced the last couple of quarters.
Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. Brian, you talked about new developments heating up where end markets where you're seeing high-rise being built for multifamily. Was that a comment about the competition for land versus those developers or just about retail supply coming on?
Brian M. Smith: Well, we're seeing increased competition everywhere. In terms of the north players that we're running into competing for size, it has definitely grown. But that is particularly true in the urban areas and when you look at the pricing in urban areas where the really hot markets could be in the peninsula in the San Francisco area, if you're competing against people who can take that land and go vertical with office or multifamily, then we don't stand a very good chance, unless we control the site first, which is exactly what happened in our situation, Hap mentioned Glen Gate in Chicago. So overall, there's more competition, it's very heated and it's tough to compete with when it's urban and there's other uses. But I'd also say that it's happening in the suburbs, particularly in markets like Houston, where you're seeing things that frankly we haven't seen since 2006, 2007, where people are -- they're putting up hard deposits day 1. They're closing in 60 days where they got entitlements or anchored tenants or not and in the case of suburbs, actually doing land banking. It has to have an impact yet on supply because this isn't -- it's still not even close to the amount of development we saw in the heyday. But it is -- there is more competition.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America.
Juan C. Sanabria - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I was just hoping you could elaborate a little bit on the potential longer-term plans for the newly acquired Lincoln Park assets and if you have any sense of scope, dollar size or square footage of any redevelopment work that you could potentially do there?
Brian M. Smith: We don't have any plans for anything right now. It's one of the sites that has endless possibilities, but we like the way it is. It's got it all, whether -- density, the affluence, the education, the great streets, the walkability to the neighborhoods there. It clearly could go vertical. What it has is a tremendous competitive advantage and it has a lot of ample surface parking that you traditionally find in the suburbs and not in these urban areas. This is going to be one of those things where should any kind of bad news happen, it's going to translate into good news and the opportunities for us, but until this thing happen, we're just content with the asset where it is.
Juan C. Sanabria - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Is there any sort near- or medium-term lease maturities that could spark a redevelopment at that asset that you could take advantage of?
Brian M. Smith: Not enough to do a whole redevelopment.
Juan C. Sanabria - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then just on the small shop space, you noted an improvement there, I guess, sequentially and year-over-year. What should we be thinking about over the next, I guess, 12 or 18 months? And where is that demand coming from? Is it a pickup in the mom-and-pops type tenants that are getting better access to financing? Or is it the regional and national tenants still driving that?
Brian M. Smith: It's still predominantly the national and regional tenant's, franchises. A lot of expansion that we're starting to see from restaurants and retailers that maybe had 1 or 2 or just a handful of locations who were more cautious in years past are now willing to expand in the new markets, oftentimes new states and increase their store count. A lot of the new concepts coming up particularly in the restaurant category. And we're starting to hear about funding from that hasn't been available in the past, but again, that's never been a big focus for us since the downturn.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Jay Carlington with Greenstreet Advisors.
Jay Carlington: Great. Hap, just to circle back on AmREIT. Have you had any direct conversations with their board? And can you give us some insight in how positive or receptive they've been? And then maybe as a follow-up, can you give us an update on your current ownership in their stock and how do think that could change?
Martin E. Stein: I think that we've been pretty clear, Jay, as far as what public information is out there, and I guess, because I indicated. We're pleased that they're proceeding -- or based upon what they've said on the call and what they said in the press release that there proceeding with a process, that based upon those words, it's going to be open, robust and fair, and we're very happy about that. And our ownership that we announced at the time was 4.2% and obviously to the extent we would exceed 5% in ownership, we'd have to make a public announcement about that.
Jay Carlington: And then, Brian, maybe just switching over to, I guess, the match funding that you've talked about lining your acquisitions with dispositions of similar cap rates and lower growth profiles. Can you kind of give us a sense of how big a pool of assets that could be? And is there a common denominator between them, whether it's property type or location?
Brian M. Smith: Well, the pool, frankly, because we sold 5 of our higher-risk assets this year-to-date. It's really the pool would be any of the disposition candidates are out there, which would be -- could be high -- for the match funding would be high quality, but low growth assets, for example, we sold 5 Points this quarter. We sold the title [ph] to CVS. Those are both really good assets, but they were low growth. So the pool, I think, would -- say, the opportunity is there.
Lisa Palmer: I think we identified about $250 million worth. So I mean, it's not a huge pool and what I think what you're going to begin to see, Jay, is the kind of the 2 pools that we talked about. So we -- the one that funds the development and what's going to fund our acquisitions that they're going to start to merge as we sell our lower kind of noncore -- our lower quality noncore assets, we have very, very, very little of that left. And so now the focus is really just going to be on those lower growth assets and many of them have lower cap rates.
Martin E. Stein: And I think, the discipline that this match funding strategy, as it relates to acquisitions, what we're basically saying to our team is that if you want buy an asset, you've got to come up with an asset that we can sell at a roughly comparable cap rate and with as visibility if the NOI growth rate is significantly lower in what we want to sell and what we're looking to buy.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust, Robinson, Humphrey.
Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Just first quick question on your FFO guidance. I don't like to focus on too much just given that there's many moving parts to it, but I just trying to reconcile, particularly $1.42 per share you've earned this first half and then just kind of used simple dumb math and doubled it, it still is above your guidance of $2.775 [ph]. What are the pieces that can take that $2.84 or projected number down to a $2.77?
Lisa Palmer: Again, it's part of what I answered in the earlier call is the reimbursement income, it's heavy in the first half of the year. So that's about $0.02 that does not recur in the first half of the year. It recurs annually in the first half. It's just part of the seasonal variations in our income. And then the fact that the question that Christy asked at the very beginning, how much is the timing of the dispositions, our disposition guidance has actually been increased, yet we've sold very little here today. So with that being back-end loaded, that's going to have a drag of $0.01 to $0.03. And then G&A could potentially, the run rate for G&A could potentially be $500,000 to $1 million higher per quarter for filling open positions.
Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Sorry about that. I guess, I missed that part. And then just second question on AmREIT, if I go back to your opening remarks and you said you expect to receive adequate info, would it be correct to categorized the current situation as you haven't gotten much live dialogue with the company, just based on your kind of commentary? And tied to that is, obviously the upside of AmREIT, lot of it stems from their redevelopment or development potential. When you guys walk around AmREIT's assets, especially like uptown park, do you see a different vision from those types of assets and at least what they lay out in their public information?
Martin E. Stein: I'm not going to respond to the second part of it -- that question. The first part, I just -- basically, what we said is that they made an announcement both on the press release and their earnings call and we take those words to be sincere that they're going to run a robust process. And we based our comments both in our press release and in my prepared remarks that, that's the case. And how we continue to evaluate the portfolio and we'll continue to do that at the process and we get the additional information that we expect to get to the -- up to the process unfolds.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley.
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: So you've identified a portfolio in the marketplace and AmREIT, which meets a number of the criteria you're looking for, that's income, density, future development opportunities. I guess I'm curious if in your preliminary thoughts on potential funding of an acquisition of AmREIT, how that perhaps might have changed, how you look at your own assets today. Have you identified incrementally more assets in your portfolio that you would potentially look to sell that you may otherwise have sold further down the road beyond the $250 million that you've talked about on today's call?
Martin E. Stein: We said that we'll look at -- I think we have a lot of flexibility, both on our line of credit, both on the debt that would be available to us, so we wouldn't be suffering from maturity risks, both from selling assets in the portfolio and other balance sheet steps that we could take. If we consummate any transaction, we will consider all the alternatives that are out there to cost effectively and astutely finance that transaction.
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. So it sounds like you do a portfolio review, if in the case you were successfully able to consummate transactions down the road at some point. Another question on ground-up development, the Charlotte deal here. We've heard consistently from -- I mean, it appears that rents aren't quite necessarily where they need to be for a new development to pick up in a meaningful way. So curious what about the market or submarket location that appeal to you. And curious perhaps what other markets of opportunities you are looking at today in terms of development?
Brian M. Smith: Well, we've heard that for quite some time that the rents are just fine, but I guess all I can point to, again, with this $500 million of starts that we've done since the downturn and the fact that we had development in terms about 9% and the ones that have been completed average 98% leased. So we've proven that there's demand, and proven that the demand is at good returns. In terms of this particular property, we just like the fact that we like Charlotte. We like the Carolinas in general. It's performed very well for us. The -- it's under retailed there. If you can measure the GLA per capita in terms of the national average and we are very fond of Publix. It's one of the great restaurants in the country and this should be a Publix-anchored center in a very high growth area of Charlotte. It's at the corner of main on main of the new extension of George Liles Parkway and it's rightsized and has a possibility to expand it and it's also an excellent return in the mid 80s. So there's a lot of things that we do like about it.
Martin E. Stein: Just to further amplify on Brian's comments is that, as he indicated and as I indicated, the opportunity set of developments that check the boxes from a quality, from a criteria standpoint and from return standpoint is very limited. We just think we are well positioned to get more than our fair share of those developments that we check the boxes, including returns.
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. Fair enough. Maybe [indiscernible] quickly, Lisa, with your recent Green Bond issuance, I guess I can understand the social value, but can you perhaps quantify any discount in pricing or any other benefits that may not be, well, as apparent to that type of observer?
Lisa Palmer: It so difficult to really quantify if there is any benefit at all. It certainly didn't hurt us, but I don't believe that there's any pricing advantage as a result of it. We did have a number of SRI investors in the book, but I don't think that it narrowed the spread at all.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets.
Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Lisa, I don't usually see a half full term loan. So I'm guessing you guys are going to -- because I realized it's new, the increase capacity. But I'm guessing you guys are going to fill that term loan as a first source of capital and a run to 19, is that probably accurate?
Lisa Palmer: I think the key thing and it was in my prepared remarks, so it's just that we have the ability as a delayed draw up until August of next year, which coincides with our bond maturity in 2015. We have a pretty -- we have a large maturity next year of $350 million. And thinking about staggering our debt maturities, we would likely do 2 different tenors to refinance that. So this is a means of doing that.
Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay, okay, I got you. And then as you look at the mortgages that you have coming due, would you ever encumber anything else at this point, I mean, or re-encumber any of these assets? Or as these mortgages mature, do you plan to take them off and always replace with some sort of unsecured instrument?
Lisa Palmer: That certainly would be in the plan except in our coinvestment partnerships. We would continue to refinance with mortgages.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Nathan Isbee with Stifel.
Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: Hap, as the news of the AmREIT proposal, the amount, I think the collective reaction was, "Wow, that's pretty un-Regency like." And I guess, are we witnessing a change in strategy or DNA? Or was there something about this deal, specific, that set it apart?
Martin E. Stein: I guess we indicated in our letter that we made public that we tried to negotiate with them. We ask for information and then when they decided not to provide us with that information and sit and negotiate with us, we decided in May that it was too compelling of an opportunity for their shareholders and for Regency's shareholders and that prompted us to go public. And I just -- I'll leave it at that.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Jonathan Pong with Robert W. Baird.
Jonathan Pong - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Just following up on Jim's question earlier. You guys have always been very prolific developers and looks like that's playing out again this cycle. A question is how do you account with growing that development risk further as percentage of your offering portfolio, particularly if you close on deal like AmREIT, given how much of that -- how much value in that story depends on development upside?
Martin E. Stein: I think that, as we've said, we're going to be...
Lisa Palmer: Let me first -- I'm going to say he's answering this, strategically, as a Regency generic, nothing to do with the AmREIT.
Martin E. Stein: At least we said that we're going to look at that investment on a very disciplined basis and what makes compelling sense for our shareholders. And I think we've said, and I think we demonstrated since the downturn and we're committed to a very disciplined development program of developing those assets that meet our criteria and also limiting that as a percentage, how much balance sheet exposure that we're going to -- in terms of -- as a multiple of EBITDA. And I don't see anything that's going to change that because I got the strategy and the guideline that makes compelling sense and it's going to make sure that we're making the right investments for the right reasons.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Chris Lucas with Capital One.
Christopher R. Lucas - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division: Hap, actually, could you just remind us what that percentage or multiple approach is right now for the company, as it relates to the development risk exposure?
Martin E. Stein: It's 2x EBITDA, which translates into approximately, today, about $850 million and that is the amount that we have under construction plus future commitments and we're a little bit less than half of that right now.
Christopher R. Lucas - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division: Okay. Great. Brian, just I guess I'm trying to understand on the tenant moveout issue, maybe if you could put it in a context of tenant retention rates, how -- what you're seeing, say the last couple of quarters compares to the 2005, 2006 sort of top of market environment?
Brian M. Smith: Well, in terms of moveouts, whether you look at it -- it's a mix, less than $300,000. It's just really unusual. You can go back to 2006 or any of those years and still $300,000 was very low and yet ours has been averaging that for 3 of the last 4 quarters. Maybe it's the small shop. It's the best first half we've had following the best second half. So that's takes into consideration all those quarters back then, and it's just -- and you got to remember, too, that we're doing a lot of strategic moveouts where we're trying to get space back, we want to move the tenants out. We've had multiple examples recently of names you'd recognized whether it's Outback Steakhouse or Dunkin' Donuts or others who want to renew, and we're saying, "no," and you'd think that would elevate the moveouts. So it's a very healthy portfolio right now. We just put a survey of all our tenancy and we have 1,250 responses and less than 4% came back and said that they were likely not to renew. So there's not only strong external demand, but the returns of those portfolio wouldn't stay.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Thank you.
Martin E. Stein: We thank everyone for their time. It does appear that there is a question, which I'd be happy to answer or pass along to Brian or Lisa.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Just a quick question, just on the development side of things. Again, I appreciate all the commentary about increasing competition and that kind of thing. I'm just curious, though, are you seeing an increase in breadth of demand from sort of traditional anchored tenants to take space? Or are these competition, are they moving forward without sort of that anchor backing?
Brian M. Smith: Yes, we're seeing -- as I mentioned earlier, we are seeing a lot of people, a lot of developers taking down land where they don't have the anchor in place at all. Whether that's a land bank or they're just going to -- they just want to be able to compete, get the property and they have confidence they'll be able to do something. We particularly see that, again, would be in the urban areas, in markets like the Bay Area, in Houston where things are so hot that if they can't make it work as retail, there's alternative uses in offices or residential.
Martin E. Stein: And a lot of the competition is non-retail.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. Got you. And then just a question, a clarifying point on the $250 million secured. So obviously you have the flexibility to draw down the term loan, all the way out to debt maturity, but just curious, given where rates are today and your expectations about rates over the next -- until that maturity comes due, I'm just curious if it would make any sense to pull that forward?
Lisa Palmer: I will remind you that we actually hedged $250 million already of our 2015 by [indiscernible] at a treasury plus swap rate of 2.67%. So that is our interest rate other than the term loan is obviously is floating over LIBOR.
Operator: And it appears there are no other questions in the queue at this time. Would you like to proceed with any closing comments?
Martin E. Stein: Yes. We appreciate everybody's participation in the call. Thank you and everybody have a great day and into the weekend, have a great weekend. Thank you.
Operator: This does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you all for your participation and we wish you a very wonderful day.

First, building on the enhanced and intrinsic quality of the portfolio in its better pricing, occupancy and merchandising power to sustain annual average NOI growth of 3%, even as we've achieved 95% leased. Second, profiting from our expertise to deliver annual average starts of $200 million of high-quality developments and redevelopments at attractive returns on invested capital. And third, maintaining a strong balance sheet that now compares favorably to other blue-chip companies, but costs effectively match-funding investments. As we have shared with you the positive condition of the portfolio, development program and balance sheet has allowed us to pivot from being a net seller. Any further enhancements to the portfolio and balance sheet will be achieved organically and opportunistically. The progress on sustaining 3% NOI growth at 95% leased is evidenced by this quarter’s double-digit rent growth. The underlying fundamentals not only remain strong, but are continuing to gain momentum. Our team is keenly focused on increasing the frequency and amount of rent steps, growing rents and moving the percent leased beyond 95%. Their efforts in achieving NOI growth in excess of 3% for the third consecutive year and in the future of being aided by the historically low level of new supply, robust tenant demand and health and particularly the inherent quality of the portfolio. The development results in prospects continue to exceed our high expectations. Regency’s ability to create exceptional centers in our target markets at meaningful margins to the cost of acquiring centers of comparable quality is a driver of significant value. Despite an environment that remains supply constrained and intensely competitive we continue to win more than our fair share of a limited number of development opportunities that meet our high standards. Our success has allowed us to increase development start guidance for 2014. It is also worth noting that we have nearly $90 million of redevelopments in process and the potential to commence more than $50 million next year. I now want to share some thoughts on how we are addressing the changing retail environment due to technology driven shifts in consumer behavior, demographics and alternative delivery channels, most particularly the rise of millennials, social networking and e-commerce. Due to the strength of the portfolio, particularly its demographics and anchor tenant sales, the recent elimination of virtually all of our weaker centers, the addition of many fabulous new centers including a meaningful amount now anchored by specialty grocers, like Whole Foods and Trader Joe’s, and the necessity convenience orientation of the tenant mix, there are many reasons to believe that the portfolio should perform well in the changing environment. At the same time, given the dramatic changes that are taking place, we’re not going to stand still. We need to continually take a fresh look at our shopping centers and operating systems to ensure that we will have a portfolio that not only survives, but more importantly, thrives. Future developments, redevelopments, acquisitions and sales will continue to play a role in keeping our portfolio relevant. But also, key to this is Fresh Look, our three-pronged initiative that includes merchandising to best-in-class retailers and restaurants that are injecting more energy into our centers. And these retailers and restaurants are also effectively utilizing social media Internet strategies to drive sales, adding place-making features using architectural and design elements to make centers more inviting that increases the shopper dwell-time and connecting our retailers and our centers to our surrounding neighborhoods and communities.  While we are still in the early innings with much to be accomplished our teams have really embraced this critically important issue. Brian will offer some examples of how Fresh Look has already positively impacted the portfolio. Lisa?
Lisa Palmer:  Thank you Hap and good morning everyone. Financial results exceeded our expectations for the first quarter with core FFO of $0.69 per share and FFO of $0.71 per share. Operating percent leased declined by only 20 basis points since the end of the year as a result of lower than normal seasonal move-outs and it is up 60 basis points when compared to this time last year. Same-property NOI growth excluding termination fees was 2.9% for the quarter, driven primarily by higher base rent. This was achieved despite the increase in snow removal costs, resulting from that never ending winter which many of you experienced firsthand. But fortunately this increase in expenses was mostly offset by a resulting increase in tenant recoveries. However, without the resulting increase, net expense, it’s important to note that same-property NOI growth would have been above 3%. Quickly on G&A, the first quarter was slightly below expectations, due to the timing of capitalization related to development starts. We continue to anticipate finishing 2014 within our full year guidance range of $57.5 million to $60.5 million, which we initially introduced to you back in December. This implies a quarterly run rate of approximately $15 million. Turning to full year guidance, we increased core FFO per share by $0.02 on both ends. This change is primarily attributed to the delayed timing of dispositions. We also increased FFO per share guidance to a new range of $2.68 to $2.74. It now mirrors the range for core FFO per share as we recognized a gain in the first quarter on the sale of a parcel of land. This gain effectively offsets the other reconciling items between the two measures. Operating results were generally in line with expectations for the first quarter, causing percent leased and full year NOI growth guidance to remain unchanged. As Hap said, due to the progress we made converting our development pipeline into starts and the heightened visibility of additional targeted developments and redevelopments, we increased our guidance for 2014 by $40 million. Consequently, we also increased disposition guidance by the same amount. We are highly confident that we will successfully execute match-funding of our development spend with dispositions of non-core assets. And as a reminder, our guidance doesn’t assume any acquisitions should we acquire any additional centers, they will be done on a basis that is accretive to NOI growth and these will be funded with additional sales of lower growth assets with roughly comparable cap rates. And as always, equity issuances will be considered as an alternative when our equity is favorably priced in relation to our view of NAV. Lastly, we plan to capitalize of what continuous to be a borrowers market, as we address our outstanding line balance in the April bond maturity. Included in our current projections is a $250 million bond issuance on which we have already hedged our base rate exposure. Brian?
Brian Smith:  Thank you, Lisa. Good morning everyone. As Lisa and Hap both said, momentum continued to accelerate through the first quarter of the year. What stands out most this quarter is that rent growth returned to double-digits at nearly 12%, moreover the strength was broad-based with positive growth in every market and with both anchors and shops contributing in a meaningful manner. This strength reinforces the fact that leasing leverage is in our favor and not only allows us to push starting rents but also to increase the amount and frequency of embedded rent steps. It also reflects our changing perspective on the move-outs, more than ever we welcome them as an opportunity to both upgrade our tenant mix and to drive rents. While we did experience a seasonal decline in occupancy for the first quarter, it was well below historic norms especially for shop tenants whose move-outs were particularly low for a first quarter. This follows the record low level of shop move-outs for both the fourth quarter and for all of 2013. This trend has also continued into April and exemplifies the improvement of both the quality of the portfolio and the tenant base. And given the limited supply environment and robust demand for space, I am optimistic about the team’s ability to drive the same-property portfolio beyond 95% leased. As Hap indicated, our Fresh Look initiative, which includes aggressive asset management focused specifically on merchandising, design and place making the shopper experience in connecting our centers to their communities, is starting to gain traction throughout the portfolio. Our teams continue to find ways to improve our centers, making them unique and more exciting places to shop, thus enhancing the customer draw and resulting in better sales for our tenants. We have had much success adding best-in-class retailers, restaurants and high-end fitness facilities. For example, we are bringing Mendocino Farms, a highly successful gourmet sandwich and salad restaurant that currently has seven locations within the Los Angeles area for a center in West Lake Village, California. Mendocino Farms is not your typical sandwich shop, the restaurant offers farm to table seasonal… [Technical Difficulty] (Operator Instructions) During the first quarter, we opened Juanita Tate Marketplace in Los Angeles. The center's grocer, Northgate Gonzalez, described the store as an incredible success with the highest sales for first 10 days in their chain’s history, the center is 98% leased. Finally all the recent development projects continue to demonstrate impressive results. Of the 11 projects started as of 2009 is since completed, seven are 100% leased and collectively the projects are more than 98% leased. This tremendous leasing progress combined with compelling returns reinforces our belief that right size and focused development makes a lot of sense, Hap?
Hap Stein: Thank you, Brian, thanks Lisa. I am extremely excited about the positive momentum being created from the underlying fundamentals, together with the quality of our portfolio, our value-add developments and redevelopments, the strength of our balance sheet, the talent and engagement of our management team and the industry leading operating systems like Fresh Look and Greengenuity. We thank you for your time and we now welcome your questions.
Question: 
and: 
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from Christy McElroy of Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Christy McElroy :  Hi. Good morning, everyone. Now that you closed on the Fairfield portfolio, can you talk about possible additional investment opportunities with Clayban? I know they own a lot in Fairfield County which is a target market for you for acquisitions. 
 Citi:  Hi. Good morning, everyone. Now that you closed on the Fairfield portfolio, can you talk about possible additional investment opportunities with Clayban? I know they own a lot in Fairfield County which is a target market for you for acquisitions. 
Hap Stein: Well we’re all set up to do a lot more with them in a sense that on our existing properties we have a right of first refusal for the shopping centers that are up there, so if anything happens there, there is an opportunity for you to take advantage of that. In addition we are looking at various ways to add additional value to what we’ve already done. We have, we know that in one of the centers there is an opportunity to eventually put together some space to create a specialty grocer who has been looking in that market for a long time. We can add -- we’re looking to buy an adjacent property to one of the centers that would allow us to increase the density. And then there is some densification which we can do on the existing centers, including buying a pad, turning into a multi-tenant pad and adding to what we’ve already got. And then to the extent they find that they’re completely unrelated opportunity -- development opportunity we’ve spoken about doing it together but we don’t have anything lined up right now.
Christy McElroy :  And then Lisa, I'm not sure if I heard you correctly. I think you said that you would think about issuing equity if it was viewed favorably to NAV. What is your view of NAV today versus where the stock is?
 Citi:  And then Lisa, I'm not sure if I heard you correctly. I think you said that you would think about issuing equity if it was viewed favorably to NAV. What is your view of NAV today versus where the stock is?
Lisa Palmer: Christy that’s not, that’s a question you know that -- and the way we would think about it is, should we’ve got nearly 20 plus analysts that cover us. And I would say consensus cap rate is sub six, so I think that that’s probably a fair way to -- that certainly gets in the ballpark.
Christy McElroy : So you would think about issuing equity today where your stock is today or you would wait?
 Citi: So you would think about issuing equity today where your stock is today or you would wait?
Lisa Palmer: If it was in -- with an applied cap rate of sub six, we certainly would be considering it and everybody is going to have different methods of valuing our developments and process and our third-party fees, but the majority of it is going to come from NOI.
Christy McElroy : Thanks Lisa.
 Citi: Thanks Lisa.
Hap Stein: And it once again depends on use of funds and alternative sources.
Christy McElroy : Got you.
 Citi: Got you.
Hap Stein: We haven't issued equity to-date.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We ask that in the interest of time that you please also limit yourself to two questions before rejoining the queue to give everyone a chance to ask their questions. Our next question is coming from Jake Harlington of Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.
Jake Harlington : Great, thank you. Brian, you are one of the most active developers out there. And I wanted to get your thoughts on how you think about what type of grocer you are slotting in some of these new centers? And I ask because there is a ton of dislocation in the food retail market with traditional players and even some of the specialties. What drives your decision there? Is it primarily local demographics? Is it minimum productivity levels? And has that changed over last five years?
 Green Street Advisors: Great, thank you. Brian, you are one of the most active developers out there. And I wanted to get your thoughts on how you think about what type of grocer you are slotting in some of these new centers? And I ask because there is a ton of dislocation in the food retail market with traditional players and even some of the specialties. What drives your decision there? Is it primarily local demographics? Is it minimum productivity levels? And has that changed over last five years?
Brian Smith: It really, it's always been who is we think is the dominant grocer in the market as well as simply do the best leasing of first site shop tenants. So, if you look at what we've got this year, we may do, we're going to do seven or eight new developments, and I think we got five Whole Foods, two Trader Joe's and one Publix. so, there's a heavy spend this year towards Whole Foods and the specialty grocers, and I think that is a growing trend. If you look at our, excuse me, our portfolio since beginning of 2009, and you look at the rent that comes from shopping centers, anchored by specialty grocers it's gone from less than 10% to over 20%. However, there are certainly markets where we would default to a non-specialty grocer or you look at Texas if you could Kroger or HEB. So, it really kind of depends, but at least, right now, we're doing more in the way of specialty grocers. In terms of all the developments, the redevelopments, that we either have under construction right now, or we have signed leases, but not yet under construction or that are in the pretty high probability pursuit category. There is about 29 grocers, and just a breakdown of those would be about nine Whole Foods, six Publix, four Kroger’s and then some other smaller specialty grocers, like Fresh Market, Trader Joe’s and alike.
Jake Harlington :  Okay. And maybe just another development question, the East San Marco project -- I don't know if you talked about that one. But where does that one stand and have you said what the size of that one could be?
 Green Street Advisors:  Okay. And maybe just another development question, the East San Marco project -- I don't know if you talked about that one. But where does that one stand and have you said what the size of that one could be?
Brian Smith: Well, we control the property, we have for some time, and the retail has been ready to go. It would be a smaller version of Publix with some side shops, and what we're just waiting for is the residential which was originally planned to be condos and then of course that market tanked in late ’08, and so now we're out vetting different residential developers for multi-family residential. We expect that that would start next year.  
Jake Harlington : Okay. And just lastly on the acquisition in Austin, 5.2 cap rates for it looks like a stabilized asset was that an off market purchase or was that a competitive bid process? 
 Green Street Advisors: Okay. And just lastly on the acquisition in Austin, 5.2 cap rates for it looks like a stabilized asset was that an off market purchase or was that a competitive bid process? 
Brian Smith : That was fairly competitive. I would not call that one an off-market bid. No.
Hap Stein: And the thought process is low five as you may have indicated is low five cap rate with significant growth in that -- projected growth in excess of 3.5% and we're financing a significant portion of it by the sale of a CVS that has very-very flat rent and cap rate is going to be -- we think it's going to be sub five.
Jake Harlington : Right.
 Green Street Advisors: Right.
Brian Smith: If you just put that perspective in that market, there was an HEB Steinmart property that traded about six months before or a few months before us in Austin and that was at a six, five IRR and this IRR was a growth, Hap just mentioned is north of seven.
Jake Harlington :  Okay, thank you. 
 Green Street Advisors:  Okay, thank you. 
Mike Mas:  Thank you, Jake. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Haendel St. Juste of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Albert Lin : Yes. Hi, guys. It is actually Albert Lin for Haendel. Following up on the development question, some of your peers have mentioned that overall rents haven't quite gotten up to the level to justify new development. So it seems like it would be even more important to pick your spots. You have a couple in California, a couple in Florida. So just wondering if there are any other locations you were looking at? 
 Morgan Stanley: Yes. Hi, guys. It is actually Albert Lin for Haendel. Following up on the development question, some of your peers have mentioned that overall rents haven't quite gotten up to the level to justify new development. So it seems like it would be even more important to pick your spots. You have a couple in California, a couple in Florida. So just wondering if there are any other locations you were looking at? 
Brian Smith: Well, we just finished a very large one up in the Pacific Northwest in Seattle. We're active in Northern California. We're active in Southern California. We're very active in Texas. We're active in the Carolinas. We're active in Florida and we're active in Chicago. 
Chris Leavitt: But as you said, you got to pick your spot and have the right corner with the right anchor tenant, that's going to, as Brian answered to attract the best-in-class side shop retailers, that'll make the developments pencil out as are the last 400 million that have been started have very well.
Albert Lin : Okay. And then a question on dispositions, we have heard the assets are getting better pricing than expected. But looks like dispositions were a little lighter this quarter for you guys. Curious on the strategy, if this a function of being a little bit aggressive and looking for the best price, which might be a change in mindset after all the assets that you already sold and you were more pressed to sell in the past?
 Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then a question on dispositions, we have heard the assets are getting better pricing than expected. But looks like dispositions were a little lighter this quarter for you guys. Curious on the strategy, if this a function of being a little bit aggressive and looking for the best price, which might be a change in mindset after all the assets that you already sold and you were more pressed to sell in the past?
Hap Stein: Well, let's start with your strategy question. So, we are pretty much through as we have talked about before, the sale of our lower-quality properties. But we still have a base plan of about $120 million, $125 million that we plan to sell this year, and the cap rates there are going to be in the 7% to 7.5% range. Now, we did not do very much first quarter, but that's not unusual at all. If you look at last year at this time, we had zero sales, and we ended that year greater than $300 million. So, we feel very confident that we're going to be within the range that we've set forth in our guidance. The second prong of that strategy is to do the match-funding for acquisitions and there what we're going to do is take the, whatever we're buying, we want to go ahead and do dispositions of lower growth assets Hap alluded to a little bit earlier that would narrow the spread between the acquisition cap rates and the disposition cap rates. So, right now, with the property I mentioned that's under contract as well as Mira Vista, we've got about $45 million worth of match-funding to do and in one of the ones that would be a match-funding asset is that CBS and Washington DC, at sub 5%.
Albert Lin : Okay, thanks.
 Morgan Stanley: Okay, thanks.
Mike Mas:  Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
Vincent Chao : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Sticking with development, last quarter you had talked about seeing some modest increases in develop -- competition for developments. I'm curious how that has trended over the last quarter? And then the other question is just on land side of things, just curious how big a barrier land availability is becoming for the types of developments that you are trying to accomplish?
 Deutsche Bank: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Sticking with development, last quarter you had talked about seeing some modest increases in develop -- competition for developments. I'm curious how that has trended over the last quarter? And then the other question is just on land side of things, just curious how big a barrier land availability is becoming for the types of developments that you are trying to accomplish?
Brian Smith: Well, in terms of the environment, Hap said it best we are getting more than our fair share of opportunities. We've got a big pipeline for this year. There is no reason to think that we won't continue to average somewhere in the neighborhood of $200 million a year, developments, redevelopments. I do think the environment meet the competition for land seems to have picked up. We haven't seen a whole lot more of the ground, but you're seeing the return of retailers like Target on more site plans. As we compete for properties, especially if there are mixed used sites, you see a lot of competition for them and that competition is getting more aggressive in terms of willing to close with a very short due diligence period, perhaps to that entitlement without an anchored tenant. But we haven't had to go there. We don't plan to go there, for whatever reason we're finding the opportunities. And in terms of the availability, where we've been looking, the more urban infill areas, that land has always been hard to find. And I think that really is one of the benefits and differentiating aspects of our team is the experience and the amount of time they have spent looking for those kind of assets and the relationships they have developed to get them.
Vincent Chao : And can you just comment on how land prices in those kinds of markets have trended? Over the past year, say?
 Deutsche Bank: And can you just comment on how land prices in those kinds of markets have trended? Over the past year, say?
Brian Smith: The only place where we've seeing really significant increases in land prices would be in those markets that are very high and could go for any use and the two that come to mind would be Houston and San Francisco Bay Area, where to be able to do a single storey retail development is tough just given the land price and therefore instead you'll see a lot of multi-families. We're incredibly fortunate to have been able to develop the only two single storey retail properties in the Bay area that I know of with our Petaluma project which completed last year and in the double home we just announced this year. I mean, but those are the markets where land prices are really high because of the residential demand.
Vincent Chao : Okay. Thank you.
 Deutsche Bank: Okay. Thank you.
Mike Mas: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.
Ki Bin Kim : Just a quick one here, if I look at your total base rent, it is about $17.75. Could you provide an update on where you think that portfolio mark-to-market is today? And also how much TI/leasing commission dollars per square foot do you project in your guidance for ’14?
 SunTrust: Just a quick one here, if I look at your total base rent, it is about $17.75. Could you provide an update on where you think that portfolio mark-to-market is today? And also how much TI/leasing commission dollars per square foot do you project in your guidance for ’14?
Hap Stein: See in terms of the rents, it's all going to depend on the mix whether it's the anchors or whatever, but if I look at the expiring rents and compare that to what we've signed in this past quarter, it would imply that in the anchors we could see about 40% growth on the stock much more reasonable more like 5%, 6%, 7%. So, just depending on what the mix is of anchors versus shops will depend, will dictate what that growth is, but the trend in rent growth as well as just the trend in the average base rents, both of them continue to be positive and we think that trend will continue.
Brian Smith: And the other thing that will have an impact on how much we can harvest is whether the anchor tenants, when their lease expires, even though they may be meaningfully below market, where they have additional term or additional options and unfortunately in often case they do have that.
Ki Bin Kim : And then just that second part of that question was your TIs. They seem to bounce around a little bit quarter-to-quarter which is completely understandable. What is embedded in your guidance, your TIs and estimated dollar per square foot prospectus?
 SunTrust: And then just that second part of that question was your TIs. They seem to bounce around a little bit quarter-to-quarter which is completely understandable. What is embedded in your guidance, your TIs and estimated dollar per square foot prospectus?
Hap Stein: I'll let Brian just comment on the trends on TIs. I mean leasing commissions will be completely dependent on how much leasing we do. And I mean you can estimate that based on our percent lease guidance. From a TIs perspective we don't provide specific guidance for it, we obviously of course plan for it internally and we plan for it based on trends we're seeing. I'll let Brian talk to that.
Brian Smith : Yes, if you just kind of look at the page 21 of our supplemental in terms of the committed TIs, they were down significantly and the total TIs were down over 30% and the new TIs really drove it being down 50%. Now, while the TIs remained below historical average or near it, the reason really for that big decrease is because we're giving it less often than we used to. I think we gave it 24% of the time versus 57% of the time this quarter, but what was really lying underneath that is that our redevelopments in Hinsdale in Chicago area, that was one of the Dominick's that left. And they sold that lease to Whole Foods which was great upgrade for us. But in that particular case, Whole Foods wanted to downsize, they didn't want to take the full size of that space. So what they ended up doing is, keeping the rents where it was and they put in all the capitals. They put in the capitals to demise the space, to do new facades to separate utilities from mechanical systems. So we're basically getting a brand new Whole Foods space and we're getting a brand new 12,500 square foot space we can lease and probably rents would be twice as high as what they were and we're not putting a dollar into it. So I think that kind of drag that number down. Renewals, same thing, they're low, they're up a little bit this quarter but that was really due to just one lease and that was a 24 Hour Fitness in Southern California, it was only $10 square foot of TI. But because it such a large building, it really drove it up. If you subtract it out that one lease and you go to your supplemental page of $0.73 a square foot for renewals, that one lease taking out will reduce it to $0.41, so both all TIs are inline.
Ki Bin Kim : Okay, thank you.
 SunTrust : Okay, thank you.
Mike Mas: Thank you.
Operator:  Our next question is coming from Juan Sanabria of Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Juan Sanabria :  Hi, good morning. Thank you. Lisa, I think you mentioned earlier you're capitalizing more interest through G&A, at least through the first quarter. Can you talk a little bit about your expectations for capitalized interest for the year? And how you think about allocating that capitalized interest in between G&A and interest expense?
 Bank of America:  Hi, good morning. Thank you. Lisa, I think you mentioned earlier you're capitalizing more interest through G&A, at least through the first quarter. Can you talk a little bit about your expectations for capitalized interest for the year? And how you think about allocating that capitalized interest in between G&A and interest expense?
Lisa Palmer: First, let me clarify the prepared remarks. I was talking about capitalized development overhead not capitalized interest. And the development overhead, although it also relate to interest being a little bit early with the start of [indiscernible] place in the first quarter. That was what caused us to -- from a timing perspective, capitalized more earlier than originally planned. And in terms of the actual capitalized interests go back to our December guidance presentation; we actually did give guidance on what we expect to capitalize interest to be for the year. And that was 7 million to 8.5 million. And that simply just netted out of our growth interest expense.
Juan Sanabria : Okay, great. And can you just comment a little bit about the Fresh Look initiative and kind of how we should be thinking of that in terms of dollar spend and returns? And is it essentially just going into the redevelopment spends or how should we be think manager that from a dollars perspective and return perspective?
 Bank of America: Okay, great. And can you just comment a little bit about the Fresh Look initiative and kind of how we should be thinking of that in terms of dollar spend and returns? And is it essentially just going into the redevelopment spends or how should we be think manager that from a dollars perspective and return perspective?
Brian Smith: Let me stress the philosophy you are asking about, first don't kind of get to the cost of newness. It's really just the philosophy of what we're doing. And that is -- as Hap mentioned, the world is rapidly changing, I read a quote that said, customers live in an ever-increasing sensory-stimulating world that elevates their requirements for uniqueness. And basically the millennial today are just saying, we hear this when we sit down with the retailers and we talk to them that newness is important, they want exciting, they want updated brand. They just don't want the same old, and they are impatient. They want immediate gratification, which includes customer service and just the whole experience they get. They are not anti bricks and mortar, they are comfortable in both the real world, additional world, but if you're going to bring them to your centers, you got to make it as fresh and exciting as you can. So with that in mind, there is three prongs to get to improving that experience. One is the merchandising where we want to attract, really we want to attract the best tenants we can for the center whether that's one of our higher end centers or our bread and butter, expand the trade area with them, and therefore attract other better retailers, attract more traffic, which would grow sales, which would create a virtuous cycle that'll lead to higher NOI. And we've got lots of examples of that; we got in our Westlake development, Le Pain Quotidien, Pitfire Pizza there, Mendocino Farms we talked about. We talked about in the call Bartaco. So part of part of this merchandising, the second part is twice making it. We just want to make it a more inviting experience. You know this was a center you like to go to, you like to kind of just hang out there versus the ones you can't wait you to kind of get in and out because shopping done. And then the third thing we just speak connecting to the community and that can be technology with a social media the like, or it can just having the kind of tenants and having the kind of design that allows for things like sponsoring a 5K race. One of our tenants at Cameron Village is a fitter store, and they work these post work up pub crawlers with all of the restaurants and everything, so that's kind of theory. In terms to the cost the cost really having proving to be an issue yet. If you look at that Bartaco deal that we talked about in Atlanta, the return cost for doing that deal was over 10%, about 10.5%. If you look at Westlake village there is really four of these transformational tenants that we brought and the TIs are $25 to $30 per square foot. But including that $25 to $30 per square foot are money there are going to have to spend to do work that we would normally do. For example, we did not deliver restrooms or lighting. The restaurants want to provide their own restrooms and lighting. So that brings your TIs down to more like the $15 square foot range, which is very, very typical of what we do. I do think with these kinds of attention you can expect that TIs will go up somewhat, but again we're not going to do it unless we think the overall impact is going to be raise NOI for the entire center. And then I would say in terms of cost for each individual center, if it is a redevelopment, it's going to be part of redevelopment cost, where it's no part of redevelopment, I think expense on the centers, some centers might be $100,000 and others it could be as low as $10,000. So it's really going to depend on which profits we are talking about.
Juan Sanabria : Thanks for that color. I appreciate it.
 Bank of America: Thanks for that color. I appreciate it.
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jim Sullivan of Cowen. Please proceed with your question.
Jim Sullivan :  Good morning. Thank you. Hap, this is really a question for you, I think. The spread between your stabilized development yield and acquisition cap rate is pretty wide. And is suggesting that the margin, in terms of value creation in the development pipeline is maybe as wide as it has ever been for Regency, I don't know. Strikes me that over 30% is a pretty wide margin. I'm just curious as you think about that, are you tempted to drop the hurdle rate on development? I know that you haven't done so far. It has been pretty disciplined. How do you think about the potential for doing that, given the demand for quality product in the investor market?
 Cowen:  Good morning. Thank you. Hap, this is really a question for you, I think. The spread between your stabilized development yield and acquisition cap rate is pretty wide. And is suggesting that the margin, in terms of value creation in the development pipeline is maybe as wide as it has ever been for Regency, I don't know. Strikes me that over 30% is a pretty wide margin. I'm just curious as you think about that, are you tempted to drop the hurdle rate on development? I know that you haven't done so far. It has been pretty disciplined. How do you think about the potential for doing that, given the demand for quality product in the investor market?
Brian Smith: Obviously, if we can -- developing in a urban infill location, the going in return maybe justified at a lower rate than if you're developing what I might call a suburban infill or part of the planned unit development. And that spread could be, you know were supposed to in this more suburban location, like Cinco Ranch, which has been a highly successful, Kroger anchor development in the fastest growing planned unit development in the country, that's going to end up being a 9% initially underwrote it to 8%. We can get into the mid sevens, possibly even a little bit lower on a risk adjusted basis for the right kind of development in the right location, where we do think that we're creating substantial value Jim. So that is, that does from risk, location, market comes into the equation as we look at trying to evaluate, which appropriate as far as developing a shopping center with the returns that we need and the margins we like to have.
Hap Stein: Joe, if I can just amplify in that, we had discussions within the last couple of days about mix used project, where we'd be -- we'd have to retail to ground floor of multi-family. In that particular case, you're talking urban as you can get, downtown of a major city and the multi-family developer would deliver the completed shell, have taken all the risks on the entitlements. Basically it's an acquisition with you just finishing up the small shops, which aren't that great. In that case, we view this having, it is being very desirable with the lot less risk, in that case we would go to a lower cap rate.
Jim Sullivan : Interesting. Looking at your tenant list, obviously your combined exposure to Safeway and Albertsons is very significant. And assuming the transaction that has been where the pricing has been agreed to, when it goes through at the end of the year. I would assume given the significant overlap between the two retailers, particularly in the West Coast markets, I'm assuming there would we be the likelihood of significant divestitures or store closings assumed. You are coming up to the ICSC later this month. Is this a topic of conversation with those specialty grocers who are looking to break in and expand in those markets and might not have any choices? Is there a buzz out there, that there is going be some significant opportunity space opening up as a result of that merger?

Is there a buzz out there, that there is going be some significant opportunity space opening up as a result of that merger?
Brian Smith: Yeah, absolutely, and it's not just because of this. I mean, we've all known for a long time that certainly Albertsons and Safeway have had their struggles, and I know probably two years ago, we talked to a one of the specialty grocery chains about all of our Albertsons Holdings in Southern California, and at that time they said that they would be definitely interested in taking a couple and probably interested in taking several more. So, we know that interest is there, the specialty grocers are having a tough time finding opportunities and this will be good way to do it. In terms of the potential closures, following along that theme that we have been anticipating it, since 2009, we have 28 -- we disposed of our released 28 Albertsons and Safeway across the country.  So, I think we’ve gotten out ahead of it. And those that we’ve kept are the kind we think we can replace with our better operators as we did with the five Dominick's in Chicago and they ran as you may recall in our redevelopment in Huston where we got a 150% rent growth, with Whole Foods and then Mariano taking with the Roscoe in Chicago. So short-term, we don't expect there's going to be much change. Some of markets, where we have no overlap really to speak of, when you think about Washington DC and the Northern California and Texas and where we do have stores in those markets, we've got replacements already calling us. We are very interested in going. If Southern California was really your question and set Northwest for this overlap, we went through them space by space and we feel really good about our real estate, particularly, I think, Safeway. We think there may be a handful of the stores where because of overlap they could close. We certainly don't know, but it is just a handful and of the ones we think there is some potential risk, which really key is, you have a right to recapture the space and looking at both the Safeway and the Albertsons similar situations, there is only one lease where we don't have the right to recapture. So we think bad news will turn into good news.
Jim Sullivan : Great. Okay, guys. Thanks.
 Cowen: Great. Okay, guys. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mike Mueller of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Mike Mueller : Hi, when you are looking at this quarter leasing spreads, just wondering, were there any significant geographical variances? And how sticky to you think they will be as you move throughout the year?
 JPMorgan: Hi, when you are looking at this quarter leasing spreads, just wondering, were there any significant geographical variances? And how sticky to you think they will be as you move throughout the year?
Brian Smith: Well, it's not so much the geographical differences as it is big leases drive. So if you look at our rent growth, it was good and that was despite the fact we had two anchored tenants that were new -- one was the new, one was the renewal lease at zero rent growth. So and we have one that was renewal to almost 30% down. So, despite those three drags, it was still good rent growth. On the other hand, we did have a large tenant in Washington DC as part of redevelopment, there was an old-old lease for carrying down or expanding it and there is about 240% rent growth from that one and we had another one in the Pacific Northwest. So, we had two leases that really drove it to the positive and then we had two that held it flat and one that drove it down. And that's really summarizing it.
Mike Mueller : Okay, so nothing really -- if you are saying the Southeast compared to the West Coast or anything like that?
 JPMorgan: Okay, so nothing really -- if you are saying the Southeast compared to the West Coast or anything like that?
Hap Stein: I guess, Brian indicated, we had good rent growth throughout in every market and small shop and anchor tenants. 
Brian Smith: Yes, I mean it really was broad-based, all markets had rent growth, I think ten of them had double-digit rent growth and then the shops rent growth was almost double-digits too it was 9.8%.
Mike Mueller : Got it. Okay, great. Thank you.
 JPMorgan: Got it. Okay, great. Thank you.
Mike Mas: Thank you, Mike.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Rich Moore of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Rich Moore : Hi, guys. Good morning. I wanted to make sure I understood from your earlier comments in your prepared remarks. It sounds like the bankruptcy outlook for the year is pretty benign? And with that the outlook for bad debt expense probably pretty benign as well?
 RBC Capital Markets: Hi, guys. Good morning. I wanted to make sure I understood from your earlier comments in your prepared remarks. It sounds like the bankruptcy outlook for the year is pretty benign? And with that the outlook for bad debt expense probably pretty benign as well?
Brian Smith: Bankruptcies have been partly anything, this quarter we had the Quiznos and the Dots and Ashley Stewart, Ashley Stewart really had one of them and that is one of our premier properties in Northern California. We've already got two tenants to take that space, the Dots is only six locations and Quiznos we've known for some time, and have been working to release those. And in both cases the Dots and the Quiznos, the vast majority, vast majority of those are A properties and we've already released the lowest quality of each one of those. So, we just don't see any issue there at all. 
Rich Moore : Okay. And then the same thing, go ahead sorry.
 RBC Capital Markets: Okay. And then the same thing, go ahead sorry.
Lisa Palmer: I was just going to average for the actual bad debt expense. I mean last year was a pretty healthy year for bad debt expense as well and we would expect that to continue. I think we finished the year in less than 50 basis points and gave guidance that this year should be at least equal or better to that. And when you look at our accounts receivable that are outstanding greater than 90 days we're at 0.5% of revenues, which is the lowest that we've been for as long as I can remember, I mean even going back to 2007 we're 0.7, 0.8, 0.9.
Rich Moore : Great. Thanks Lisa. And then as you guys think about the other side, the store closing side, you’re talking a little bit about small shop closings being, small shop move-outs being very light. I mean, do you see the retention, I guess, you want to call it that retention ratio of guys who's leases are expiring, staying high where it is or getting some deterioration there?
 RBC Capital Markets: Great. Thanks Lisa. And then as you guys think about the other side, the store closing side, you’re talking a little bit about small shop closings being, small shop move-outs being very light. I mean, do you see the retention, I guess, you want to call it that retention ratio of guys who's leases are expiring, staying high where it is or getting some deterioration there?
Brian Smith:   Well, the move-outs as I said in the prepared remarks are remarkably note that the best first quarter we've ever had for shop move-outs following fourth quarter being the best quarter ever of all quarters and 2013 being the lowest of any year. So, we're feeling really good about that and that's despite some pretty aggressive proactive move-outs that we've been, we've got. If you think about some of the aggressive things we're doing, one of them is we're not renewing a lot of tenants. I mean if you think about some of the ones we did this year, this last quarter, we've got that for Taco deal that was previously leased by a national tenant, who wanted to renew, but we had built into their lease, and clause require them to renovate their space, when they didn't do it, we refuse to renew them.  We had another situation, we've got Loehmann's Plaza up in Atlanta, where we're doing a complete renovation, we are replacing Loehmann's with a specialty grocer. We're replacing OfficeMax with a really neat tenant, it's not signed yet, so I won't mention who it is. So, with that in mind, we had a tenant that want to renew and we said no. We know we can do better. They actually hired an attorney, try to find a landlord default to force us to, to keep them and they couldn't do it. So we got rid of that. So, we've got lots of these examples of being very aggressive in terms of our asset management and not allowing tenants to renew or terminating them when we see the AR start to increase.
Rich Moore :   Great thank you, guys.
 RBC Capital Markets:   Great thank you, guys.
Mike Mas: Thank you, Rich.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Samir Khanal of ISI Group. Please proceed with your question.
Samir Khanal : Hey, good morning. I know we've talked quite a bit about traditional specialty grocers but just want to get your view on something here. How much of a cap rate differential do you think there is between centers with traditional grocers today versus one with maybe a specialty grocer and it's sort of all else being equal, I just want to kind of get your thoughts on that.
 ISI Group: Hey, good morning. I know we've talked quite a bit about traditional specialty grocers but just want to get your view on something here. How much of a cap rate differential do you think there is between centers with traditional grocers today versus one with maybe a specialty grocer and it's sort of all else being equal, I just want to kind of get your thoughts on that.
Brian Smith: I don't think it's necessarily whether it's specialty or not, it's how good the grocer is. I mean, if you got a Kroger on a lease, you got Publix, you got a H.E.B, you're going to have good cap rate. But I will say that, for example, our Shops on Main outside of Chicago, in fact we're adding a Whole Foods to that center, I think it's going to change the cap rate probably 50 basis points across the whole center. So, the specialty grocers particularly the Whole Foods, just have so much cache, there is a lot for your properties but really high a quality traditional grocery well as well.
Hap Stein: The issue is though is they typically Trader Joe's and Whole Foods productivity is so high. So we do have a lot of number of H.E.Bs that are doing comparable quality, comparable sales in Publix's and Kroger's. And when that is the case, that shows the strength of the location and as Brian indicated, you'll get the comparable cap rate.
Samir Khanal :  Great, thanks. 
 ISI Group:  Great, thanks. 
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ross Nussbaum of UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Jeremy Metz :  Hi. Jeremy Metz on for Ross. Can you guys just talk about what kind of growth or value add and redevelopment opportunities you're underwriting right now that gives you comfort buying at these peak evaluations we're seeing?
 UBS:  Hi. Jeremy Metz on for Ross. Can you guys just talk about what kind of growth or value add and redevelopment opportunities you're underwriting right now that gives you comfort buying at these peak evaluations we're seeing?
Brian Smith: Well the redevelopment we separate from the decision to buy some of these acquisitions we're doing. The acquisitions what we're looking for would be best infill markets with the dominant grocers, high barriers to entry, excellent demographics that provide superior growth. If you've looked at the Fairfield portfolio or Mira Vista, there's good growth in there, and they check all the boxes on everything else I just mentioned. The redevelopments are generally within our operating portfolio and there we, there is a couple things going on, we can take a center that where we may tear down the whole center and go ahead, or part of it, and rebuild and expand the anchors like we did in Village centers in Tampa where we built a brand new expanded Walgreens and brand new expanded Publix. Or it could just a renovation of the entire center where you may replace the grocer as we're going to do with whole foods, replacing a Dominick's or Mariana's replacing a Dominick's. Or they could just be Phase IIs or expansions of GOA, or previously developed properties. So one way or another, we are adding values to a center that's already there versus the acquisitions where we're buying the value based on growth.
Hap Stein: And I would add that, Jeremy. I think that, what you've probably seen over the past year or so for the assets that are being competitively bid, with Mira Vista being an exception. Assets that are being competitively bid, not only Regency, but many of our publicly traded peers aren't necessarily winning those. For those that don't have some type of value add opportunity. And because the pension funds cost of capital and the other private equity is just a lot more aggressive right now. But for those opportunities, where there is a value ad, I think you're seeing Federal and Equity One and Regency be a more often successful on those. And then it maybe our relationships that come into play, that one might get the edge over the other and to give the example of -- it was a couple of years ago at this point. But Balboa is a San Diego acquisition. And we had a relationship with CBS and we're able to have a conversation prior to going higher on the contract that gave us the comfort that we were going to be able to complete that redevelopment, whereas a private equity buyer was not able to do that. So I do think that there's some of that happening and that we are looking at acquisitions that way as well.
Brian Smith: But in acquisition that doesn't have a redevelopment opportunity. We are not doing unless the growth is substantial, 3% plus and unless we're confident that we can do a trade and a roughly comparable cap rate and the asset that we're selling as meaningfully flatter growth profile. So that is -- in our view is a good trade. The IRR on what we're buying because of the growth is going to be higher than the IRR in what we're selling.
Jeremy Metz : Yes. And then I think that's right. If you're buying a 97% leased asset, kind of five cap I mean, they are just getting much embedded, you only have what's embedded there. So there just stays in a high growth pro forma necessarily. As a second question, just wondering on the selling side, have you seen any change in the buyer pool for non-core assets you're selling, more private equity institutional interest driving tighter pricing as some of the As become harder to acquire?
 UBS: Yes. And then I think that's right. If you're buying a 97% leased asset, kind of five cap I mean, they are just getting much embedded, you only have what's embedded there. So there just stays in a high growth pro forma necessarily. As a second question, just wondering on the selling side, have you seen any change in the buyer pool for non-core assets you're selling, more private equity institutional interest driving tighter pricing as some of the As become harder to acquire?
Brian Smith: Yes. I mean, I'd say again that the average cap rate out there is, for A quality properties in the good markets with growth and all is low to mid 5s, but I think your -- I've seen another transcripts, there's the property that we looked at and actually try to buy long ago, 10 years ago in Reston, Virginia, that thing set a new low in terms of cap rates. My understanding is, it's somewhere in the low-fours with IRR about six. So the -- but the end pricing has been tight and it's because we all know there's very, very, very little product that comes to market, and there's huge demand. The C market, there's always been an interest in that, because there's a lot of people, who believe the dream that they can create the value to turn that thing around. It's the B pricing, I think, where we've seen the most tightening, and I think that's mostly spill-over for the lack of products available for the As. So I think the cap rates are tightening for the B property, although, that's being offset little bit by the fact that there's quite a bit of product available there. So that's sort of holding in the check.
Jeremy Metz : Okay, thanks.
 UBS: Okay, thanks.
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question is coming from Tammi Fique of Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Tammi Fique :  Hi. Most of my questions have been answered, but last quarter you mentioned comfort that leased rates at the end of the year would be towards the high-end of the guidance range. Are you still comfortable with that today? 
 Wells Fargo:  Hi. Most of my questions have been answered, but last quarter you mentioned comfort that leased rates at the end of the year would be towards the high-end of the guidance range. Are you still comfortable with that today? 
Brian Smith: Sure. I'll take it. I mean, we did not change our guidance. And as we mentioned earlier on the call, our seasonal move-outs were the lowest that they've been in quite some time. So we are still very comfortable with our guidance, and would expect that we should end the year towards the higher end of the range. 
Tammi Fique : Okay. And then with regard to acquisitions, maybe just turning back to that for a minute; you have identified a couple of acquisitions that you are looking at today. But maybe beyond that, do you have a pipeline of opportunities? Are there any portfolios or opportunities within your existing JV's to acquire those interests?
 Wells Fargo: Okay. And then with regard to acquisitions, maybe just turning back to that for a minute; you have identified a couple of acquisitions that you are looking at today. But maybe beyond that, do you have a pipeline of opportunities? Are there any portfolios or opportunities within your existing JV's to acquire those interests?
Brian Smith: We're always looking at everything, but I would say right now the pipeline is fairly thin as I mentioned about it. About a $100 million we've identified is having a reasonable chance of seeing them happen. And again that's going to depend on our ability not only to negotiate a favorable deal for us, but also to be able to match funded. There is plenty of other things we're looking at, but most of them just don't meet our criteria for growth. 
Lisa Palmer: And on the partnership side, there's really very little opportunity. There are partners, are generally either at or under allocated to core retail. If anything they'd probably like to add to that? Okay, yes, disposing of property doesn't necessarily fit their objectives?
Tammi Fique : Okay and then maybe just one last one, sort of turning back to the decisions to sell assets versus issue equity. Is that just really dependant on where the stock is, when you're finding acquisition opportunities or is there one you'd be more inclined to do versus the other?
 Wells Fargo: Okay and then maybe just one last one, sort of turning back to the decisions to sell assets versus issue equity. Is that just really dependant on where the stock is, when you're finding acquisition opportunities or is there one you'd be more inclined to do versus the other?
Brian Smith: We balance what we want to -- when we think about selling, with where the stock pricing might be trading and with the investment opportunity might be, and we look at all those considerations, all I can say is that to date, first part of the year we haven't -- we were basically relying to date totally on our asset sales. We just -- last year we did a mix.  
Tammi Fique : Okay, thank you.
 Wells Fargo: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question is coming from Chris Lucas of Capital One. Please proceed with your question.
Chris Lucas : Lisa and Mike, thank you very much for the enhanced presentation and disclosure detail in the supplement; that’s very helpful. First question really relates to just the leasing environment. Brian, I guess just thinking about how you have described the activity between the better lease-spreads and just a larger development redevelopment pipeline that you guys are envisioning, in terms of the starts for this year. The question I'm wondering about is, is there a tangible change in the retailers perspective? Is there a greater sense of urgency to get deals done now, and say, even 90 days ago. Are you getting that feeling?
 Capital One: Lisa and Mike, thank you very much for the enhanced presentation and disclosure detail in the supplement; that’s very helpful. First question really relates to just the leasing environment. Brian, I guess just thinking about how you have described the activity between the better lease-spreads and just a larger development redevelopment pipeline that you guys are envisioning, in terms of the starts for this year. The question I'm wondering about is, is there a tangible change in the retailers perspective? Is there a greater sense of urgency to get deals done now, and say, even 90 days ago. Are you getting that feeling?
Brian Smith: I think we’ve felt that for a while. There is clearly a sense of urgency. I think -- whatever thing I am hearing, I was on the phone speaking with Michael Niemira, the Chief Economist for ICSC and he was talking about factors. The reason I called him, there is so many studies out there on move outs and store closings and everything, what was his take on it. And his view is that, while the store closings have hedged up that the new demand from the retailers up in more stores is outpacing it and the debt trend is widening. So there is just a real difficulty in the retailers getting quality stores in the kind of locations they want. I think you've seen in our development pre-leasing. So there is a sense of urgency, because they're just not finding the stores.
Chris Lucas : And then, Lisa, a question for you related to real estate expenses, the tax side. Are you seeing pressure now in some of the states that have seen a significant rebound in value like Texas, Florida, and California in your portfolio in terms of the real estate taxes that you're being assessed?
 Capital One: And then, Lisa, a question for you related to real estate expenses, the tax side. Are you seeing pressure now in some of the states that have seen a significant rebound in value like Texas, Florida, and California in your portfolio in terms of the real estate taxes that you're being assessed?
Lisa Palmer: I mean, obviously, as you know they were much lower last year. So, anything we would see increases, but nothing that would materially affect our numbers, not yet anyway. 
Chris Lucas : Okay, great thank you.
 Capital One: Okay, great thank you.
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question is coming from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Tayo Okusanya : Most of my questions have been answered. I just wanted to add my appreciation, as well, for the improved disclosure. One more question. On the in-process developments, when you say it’s 86% leased and committed, does that mean the rents associated with that are already in our numbers? Or the rents are still yet to come when the centers open up?
 Jefferies: Most of my questions have been answered. I just wanted to add my appreciation, as well, for the improved disclosure. One more question. On the in-process developments, when you say it’s 86% leased and committed, does that mean the rents associated with that are already in our numbers? Or the rents are still yet to come when the centers open up?
Lisa Palmer: It's generally. They would generally fall in the prelease bucket. Part of our disclosure we did actually, we're now disclosing, we call that percent comment. And that's kind of the proxy if you will between what's the difference between those that are rent paying versus not rent paying. And a lot of that prelease will fall in as a result of our ground-up developments as well as our redevelopments.
Tayo Okusanya : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much.
 Jefferies: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, I like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing comments.
Hap Stein: We appreciate everybody's participation in the call. I apologize for any technical difficulties that occurred, and wish that you have a great rest of the week. Thank you.
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And have a wonderful day.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Regency Centers Fourth Quarter Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mike Mas. Thank you. You may now begin.
Michael Mas: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are Hap Stein, our Chairman and CEO; Brian Smith, our President and COO; Lisa Palmer, our Chief Financial Officer; and Chris Leavitt, Senior Vice President and Treasurer. Before we start, I would like to address forward-looking statements that may be discussed on the call. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. I will now turn the call over to Hap.
Martin E. Stein: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. In 2013, we reached 2 crucial landmarks. First, we increased the percent leased in the operating portfolio to 95.2%. Second, same-property NOI growth was 4% for the second consecutive year. While those accomplishments stand out most in my mind, we also attained gratifying results in other critical facets of our business. We completed the development of 3 terrific shopping centers that are already 96% leased, representing an investment of $160 million and generating an 8.6% return on incremental capital. And we started nearly $150 million of new ground-up developments, where pre-leasing is already ahead of expectations, as well as more than $50 million of redevelopments. We also generated $350 million from the sale of nonstrategic assets and $100 million from ATM equity issuances at an average price about $53 per share. This activity allowed us to invest in the development and redevelopment projects that I just mentioned to acquire exceptional shopping centers in key markets that will be accretive to our long-term NOI growth profile and to further strengthen what was already a very strong balance sheet. A part of these positive results is the intense focus from our top-notch team of professionals to drive growth in core earnings, NAV and shareholder value by fully employing Regency's 3 inherent strengths: our portfolio, our development program and our balance sheet. When I look at Regency, I see a portfolio that compares positively to our peers by all key metrics. A company with the unique and core competency to create value to the development and redevelopment of exceptional shopping centers in the country's top markets and a balance sheet that clearly measures up to other blue-chip companies across the REIT landscape. As we discussed during our guidance call in December, the current health of the portfolio and balance sheet enables us to pivot from being a net seller towards placing more emphasis on growing core earnings. While we will continue to sell lower-growth assets, the primary rationale will be as a source to fund investments. Any future acquisitions will continue to be of the highest quality and have superior growth and/or upside prospects. They will be funded with additional dispositions of identified properties with low growth rates and cap rates that are roughly comparable to those we are buying. Equity could be an alternative source to fund acquisitions and developments, if the price becomes sufficiently favorable in relationship to our view of NAV to justify the high bar that will continue to be set for issuances. The end result of this net investment activity will be an even higher quality portfolio with an enhanced future NOI growth rate. Lisa?
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Hap, and good morning, everyone. Core FFO for the year was $2.63 per share, which is at the upper end of the most recent guidance provided in mid-December. FFO per share was $0.03 ahead of guidance due to the delayed closing of our Fairfield, Connecticut properties, which pushes the related transaction costs into 2014. As Hap said, in 2013, we made significant progress towards the achievement of our strategic objectives, not the least of which was reaching and exceeding 95% leased and achieving same-property NOI growth of 4%. In addition, in terms of the balance sheet, we ended the year with $90 million of cash on hand and no outstanding balance on our $800 million line of credit. Our net debt-to-core EBITDA ratio now stands at less than 6x, and we are comfortably on a path to achieve our targeted ratios through organic growth and core earnings over the next few years. We also strive for a low-laddered maturity profile and manage interest rate risk when appropriate by locking in long-term rates. We hope to capitalize on what continues to be a borrower's market as we address our April unsecured bond maturities. Included in our current projections is a $250 million bond issuance on which we've already hedged our base rate exposure. Even if there's a modest expansion from today's credit spreads, we'd still be looking at an all-in effective rate of less than 4%. We are also hedged for $250 million of 2015 maturities at just 30 basis points higher. Looking at 2014, our guidance for operating metrics and financial results remains unchanged from what we presented in December. Core FFO per share is expected to be in the range of $2.66 to $2.72 per share and to be relatively evenly distributed throughout the year. I'd like to remind everyone that the $100 million of equity issued, combined with net property sales in 2013, impact this year's growth by roughly 5%. In terms of occupancy, with the possibility of a few identified junior anchor and seasonal move-outs, we could see a dip in the first quarter, but we expect to end the year at the high end of our same-property percent leased guidance range. You will notice changes to both acquisitions and dispositions guidance. The majority of these changes to account for the timing of the closing of the Fairfield, Connecticut properties, which Brian will discuss later. As discussed during our December call, we simply rolled the acquisition from 2013 into 2014. The loan assumption process is almost complete and we anticipate closing on this portfolio in the very near future. We also increased acquisition and disposition guidance, each, by $25 million on the upper end as we've recently gained control of another high NOI growth acquisition opportunity in Austin. We plan to fund that purchase with additional property sales. As Hap said, the cap rates should be roughly comparable for the dispositions that will fund our acquisitions. Lastly, but importantly, we announced an increase to our quarterly cash dividend. Many factors go into the decision to raise the dividend, the most important of which is our view of the positive prospects for future increases in earnings and operating cash flows, balanced by our intent to maintain conservative financial metrics including the payout ratio. Brian?
Brian M. Smith: Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. As Hap and Lisa both stated, the results for 2013 were strong. The teams have been dogged in their execution of our strategy and the result has been steady and marked improvement in nearly every operating metrics. Same-property percent leased climbed to 95.1% at the end of the fourth quarter. Small shops were nearly 90% leased at year end, representing 150-basis point improvement over 2012. The team built percent leased by signing 5 million square feet of new and renewal leases during the year. In addition, we continue to see a positive trend in move-outs compared to prior years. Combined move-outs in the third and fourth quarters totaled less than 600,000 square feet, making it the first time since 2006 we've seen 2 quarters with move-outs that low. Rent growth for new leases was positive 10.7% in the fourth quarter and an even stronger 17.7% for the year. These accomplishments resulted in 4% same-property NOI growth, excluding term fees, for the second year in a row. With our high-quality portfolio now above 95% leased, same-property NOI will benefit as pre-leasing converts to rent paying. But in general, occupancy gains will play a lesser role. Therefore, the operation team's emphasis is on taking rent growth back to our historic level of 10% or more. In addition, the team continues to successfully execute leases that include higher and more frequent contractual rent steps. Rent growth and embedded steps are key components of our formula to meet our objective for future NOI growth. Moving to development, we completed 3 projects in the fourth quarter. Combined, they are more than 96% leased, with an 8.6% return on incremental capital. What's more, the projects took, on average, only 21 months to stabilize from start of construction. While each of these projects is exceptional, I can't help but continue to spotlight the team's hard work and success at our Grand Ridge Plaza project, a 325,000-square foot center to celebrate its grand opening at 99% leased. It took only 18 months for commencement and construction to complete. The community response following the opening has been overwhelmingly positive. In my 30 years in the development business, it's one of the best projects I've seen. Our in-process developments are also performing extremely well. The 6 projects, including 2 that have not yet started vertical construction, are 82% leased and committed. During our third quarter call, we discussed our fourth quarter starts, Fresh Market-anchored shops on Riverside in Jacksonville and the Mariano's-anchored Glen Gate in Chicago. These new starts, along with our other projects, are progressing nicely into tracking best-in-class operators, including a new Whole Foods that will be added in our Shops on Main project in suburban Chicago. We also started 6 redevelopments during the fourth quarter, with total cost of $16 million and a projected return approaching 10%. This brings our total in-process redevelopment pipeline to $53 million across 13 active projects. Turning to the fourth quarter transactions, we acquired 2 properties, Fellsway Plaza in Boston, which we introduced in the third quarter call, and Holly Park. Holly Park is a 160,000-square foot center with a prime location within Raleigh's Inner Beltline. The center benefits from a strong daytime population and has several anchors, including the highly productive Trader Joe's. As Lisa mentioned, we're also under contract on a portfolio of 3 properties totaling 315,000 square feet in partnership with the current owner of the centers. The portfolio is located in Fairfield, Connecticut, an affluent community with extraordinary trade barriers [ph] and a 96% market occupancy rate. They are dominant centers, with the 2 downtown properties representing the heart and soul of the town. Regency is acquiring an 80% interest in the portfolio for $120 million. Similar to Fellsway, the Fairfield partner is a local sharpshooter and we really like the potential to work together on future opportunities. Across-the-board from leasing to development to portfolio enhancement, 2013 was certainly a successful year, and I look forward to that trend continuing into 2014. Hap?
Martin E. Stein: Thank you, Brian and Lisa. I want to close by mentioning 2 remarkable milestones that we celebrated last year. 2013 was Regency's 50th year in business and its 20th year as a public company. We've grown by a good bit since then, since the company was founded and went public and we are only 1 of only 18 REITs out of the 45 in the class of 1993 that are still around. Most important of all, we are proud of Regency's total annual shareholder return of nearly 12% since our initial public offering, which has outpaced both the REIT and shopping center indices. In the 50 years since the company was founded and the 20 years since we went public, we've made monumental strides in building Regency. Learning as we grow, adapting to change, sharpening our strategy, delivering value and doing what is right. We've done so by always keeping the best interest of our 4 constituencies in mind: our people, our communities, our retail customers and our shareholders. By staying true to these values, I'm confident that our company will flourish for another 50 years. We thank you for your time and now welcome your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kin Bin -- Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust.
Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Could you talk a little bit about your big markets, Florida, California and Texas? And how those individual markets are performing relative to your portfolio?
Brian M. Smith: Sure. Southern California -- California is really -- continues to be I think a tale of 2 states. You've got Coastal California and you've got non-coastal. Coastal California, which is where virtually all of our assets are, is really on fire. And if you look at Northern California, in particular, I think we are 97% leased there, very strong, and I would say that's pretty much true with Southern California as well. With, again, the non-coastal California, it is improving. But right now, Sacramento and the Central Valley would remain weaker markets, although they have significantly improved. Texas is a large market. Texas is one of the -- all of the markets in Texas are outstanding markets. Austin, Houston leading the way, but Dallas is also strong. And then, Florida, which has lagged, has really started coming on of late. Northern Florida is a little bit weaker than the rest. But all of Florida overall has made great strides over the last several quarters.
Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: And just tied to that, given your commentary about how strong the markets are doing, your occupancy levels, how far do you think the industry is from development really coming back into the picture?
Brian M. Smith: I think we are getting close. We are starting to run into competition like we haven't done before. We competed, for example -- well, I would say that the developments we're starting to see competition on are pretty limited to California, Texas, Washington D.C. But even in those markets, there's been good competition. We went after -- participated in an RFP in Northern California and there were 12 respondents to it. Now a lot of those were small and I think we fare really well on those types of things, but we've lost some properties, some opportunities lately. So we're starting to see developers again for the really good assets take-on risks that they hadn't been willing to do before. We're seeing a lot of hard money put up on day 1 of the contract execution. We're seeing returns, in some cases, spread over what people perceive the exit cap rate to be, so it would -- could be sub 7%. And you're seeing, particularly in Texas, in the really hot market like Houston, people not only saw them for low returns but being willing to close on 30 days without entitlements and anchors. So you're starting to see it. Overall, I know the construction industry is forecasting 10% increase in starts. I don't know if that's true or not, but we are seeing more activity.
Martin E. Stein: A couple of follow-up comments in that regard. Number one, in spite of the additional competition both comments relayed, we still think that we can get our fair share. We're well positioned to do that at -- in the range of 8% returns that we're projecting. Not all are going to be -- achieve that, but we think we can get pretty close to that. Secondly, from a supply standpoint, which I think is equally as important, even though we would expect supply to -- supply right now is less than 1% of the historic stock -- of the stock. That's about 1/3 of historic standards. And even though supply may increase, and development may increase, I think it will still continue to be well, well below historic standards.
Lisa Palmer: And I'll -- I'd add, I think one of the things that's governing that -- and we recently met with one of our banks, this is a very large lender in the real estate industry, and they're still requiring quite a bit of equity from developers. Regency obviously is very well positioned and has competitive advantage versus some of the private, smaller guys. They're looking -- they're loaning to cost, not to value, and requiring 25% to 50% of equity, depending on that developer's balance sheet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jay Carlington from Green Street Advisors.
Jay Carlington: Great. So just -- you mentioned your occupancy is kind of trending at -- towards the top end of where you're comfortable with, and I guess, there's going to be an increased focus on rent growth. So can you kind of talk about the releasing spreads going forward and -- the blended releasing spreads and how we should be thinking about that type of growth? Are we looking at mid single digits or is it more upside there?
Brian M. Smith: If you look at it on a quarter-by-quarter basis, it can be fairly choppy. But it shows the continual increasing trend over the last many quarters. So we think the environment is very positive, to continue that positive trend. And as I said, there may be some choppy quarters both above and below the trend line really based on anchor tenants. And -- but I think it's driven by strong fundamentals. Not only are we greater than 95% leased with a lot stronger portfolio than we used to have, but Hap pointed out that supply growth remains almost nonexistent and the retailers are getting more aggressive. So it's broad-based. We're seeing it in almost all of our leases, the rent growth. Just -- I think we've only got one target market that experienced negative growth this past year, and it was less than 1%. And the weaker market, as I mentioned also, Florida is starting to pick up. So we believe we can get to our historic level of double digits and continue this positive trend.
Jay Carlington: Okay, great. And maybe just quick follow-up. Can you give us a quick update on what's going on in Chicago with Dominick's? It looks like Whole Foods picked up one of your spots. So what's the outlook look for the rest of the remaining locations you have?
Brian M. Smith: It turned out to be really good for us. We've got -- as you know, there's 6 operating Dominick's that we have up there. Four of the leases were purchased and 1 is very, very close to being finalized. So 5 and 6 will have replacement grocers. Whole Foods, as you mentioned, bought 1, and then Mariano's bought 3. The other one, we are pretty certain to it, but I'd rather not say until we know for sure. And what we will do is -- Whole Foods and one of the Mariano's will be redevelopment. And the Mariano's that's taken the Dominick's will be about 90,000 square feet and will take that rent up significantly. And the other one, the Whole Foods redevelopment, Whole Foods rent will stay flat for the remaining of term that was -- still in that lease, the Dominick's lease, which is about 12 years or so, and then it'll jump up probably 2x. But in the meantime, as part of the redevelopment, Whole Foods will use all of its money, demise the existing store, build themselves brand new, and do a facade renovation and create a 12,000-square foot junior anchor next door to them,which we should be able to re-lease that at significantly higher rent than the underlying Dominick's lease.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Pong from Robert W. Baird.
Jonathan Pong - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: I know this is looking a little further out, but can you shed light as to how you're thinking about the non core dispositions spigot beyond 2014? I guess, what I'm trying to get at is how we should think about the sources of long-term funding for the bulk of your redevelopment and redevelopment activity?
Lisa Palmer: We will always plan to sell properties to fund our developments. I don't think -- it's not prudent to have a business model that depends on issuance of equity. So our business model is our dispositions. It'll be lower-growth properties, which are the non core. And as the quality of those lower-growth non core properties improves, the spread between what we're selling and what we're developing will actually widen. So instead of selling properties at a 7% cap rate and developing at an 8%, we should get closer to selling to a 6% and developing at it -- or at least a 200 basis point spread even if cap rates move one way or the other. So that's how you should think about it beyond 2014 as a source of funding for our developments. And then to the extent that we have opportunity for great acquisitions, again, we would look first to our pool of properties that we could sell at a comparable cap rate but at a lower growth, so that we're, in essence, enhancing our future growth rate of the portfolio.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christy McElroy from Citi.
Katy McConnell: This is Katy McConnell on for Christy. Could you talk a little bit about how you see the food component in your centers trending over time? And to what extent you're leasing to more restaurant users, both national, regional as well as local operators?
Brian M. Smith: Sure. We're seeing a lot of leasing with the grocers and a lot of that's going on with your specialty grocers. If you look at just our development and redevelopment work that we're doing right now plus some re-tenanting, we're working with 37 new grocers. So we're seeing a lot of that. The food or -- the restaurants, yes, the restaurants we've got it looks like 113,000 square feet net add this past quarter from the restaurants. And what's going on there is just the restaurants, in many ways, are becoming the new anchors, which you'll hear. And they're not all doing well, but fast casual is white-hot right now. And the reason for that really is just the time becomes such a precious commodity, and so those restaurants are doing well. On the other hand, kind of the traditional family dining, the Macaroni Grill, the Ruby Tuesday and all of those, they are not faring very well. And I think you're going to see some closures in that sector. Anything that has healthy living associated with it in the food group is also hot. So overall, I think you're going to see continued amount of restaurant strength, particularly among the fast casual and the healthy lines. And then the strength in the grocery sector remains, especially grocers.
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig Schmidt from Bank of America.
Juan C. Sanabria - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: This is actually Juan Sanabria here with Craig. Just wanted to ask on the acquisition that seemed like it's slipped, I guess, from the fourth quarter into early this year. Can you tell us a little bit about that asset and kind of the valuation of cap rate you're targeting? You kind of made a comment that going forward the acquisitions and disposition cap rates would be closer in terms of spreads. And if I look at your guidance, you're kind of targeting disposition cap rates of 7% to 7.5%. Should we think that the acquisitions going forward would be at that sort of level or am I -- did I misunderstand?
Lisa Palmer: I'll let Brian talk about the assets. I'll answer the latter part of your question first. My response to Jay is similar, is that you have to think about our dispositions, our funding, our developments. So the disposition cap rate of 7% and 7.5% is funding developments of approximately 8%. To the extent that we -- and Fairfield was really in our guidance of 2013 acquisitions, so that was already prefunded. We have cash sitting on the balance sheet ready to deploy -- to buy that asset. For 2014, any acquisition that we identify, we will then increase the dispositions guidance. And again, as we've said in our prepared remarks, in this case, we identified an asset in Austin, Texas for approximately $25 million, so we increased our acquisitions guidance by $25 million on top of Fairfield, and then our dispositions guidance by $25 million. The assets we will identify for that additional $25 million will have a cap rate comparable to what we will pay for the asset in Austin. So -- and that acquisition guidance is in the 5% range.
Martin E. Stein: So it would either in effect be the same cap rate maybe 50 to 100 basis points higher, but that's...
Lisa Palmer: Comparable.
Martin E. Stein: Very comparable.
Juan C. Sanabria - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: [indiscernible]
Martin E. Stein: Zero.
Lisa Palmer: Zero. Yes. We're going to -- the goal is to identify assets with lower growth than our comparable cap rates. We will not have dilution from acquiring assets. It should be accretive. It should be neutral to the current year and accretive to future years because of the higher growth rate.
Brian M. Smith: [indiscernible] I'm sorry. Do you want me to follow up and tell you about the portfolio or did you just want to do another...
Juan C. Sanabria - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Yes, please, please.
Brian M. Smith: Okay, all right. So we kind of talked about 315,000 square feet, it's just with 3 properties in Fairfield. Two of the properties are on the main drag, right in the middle of the city. And it truly is kind of a "live, work, play" environment where the entire town congregates around those properties. The portfolio is almost 100% leased. It's 99.6%. Great market, extraordinary trade barriers, high occupancy rate. And what we like about this is, is it lines up with exactly the kind of properties we want to buy, dominant infill retail that has unique competitive advantages and the ability to merchandise to best-in-class retailers and restaurants. And this one has some truly great restaurants and retailers where people just -- it connects very strongly with the community. The one thing I think that makes this particularly special here is that even though it's downtown urban retail, it has plenty of self-contained parking. Actually, if you look at the downtown properties, it's 5.2 spaces per thousand, which is better than a lot of retail that you get even in the suburbs. So a lot to like about it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Yasmine Kamaruddin from JPMorgan.
Yasmine Kamaruddin - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: So you guys had a really nice small-shop occupancy gain from the third quarter and also year-over-year. Where do you think you'll end up in 2014 on this metric?
Lisa Palmer: If you look at our same-property percent leased guidance of 94.5% to 95.5%, we did lose some of the junior anchor space. So some of that pickup from occupancy from here will come from there. But I would say that for the most part, it's going to be about 75% of the -- occupancy pickup is going to be coming from the small-shop space.
Martin E. Stein: So 90% to 92%.
Yasmine Kamaruddin - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay, great. And also, for your budget, what are you assuming happens to bad debt?
Brian M. Smith: What was the question?
Martin E. Stein: Bad debt assumption.
Lisa Palmer: We finished this year at, call, approximately 40 bps of our revenues and the health of the portfolio is really strong that we would expect it to be consistent.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Moore from RBC Capital.
Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: You've always -- just following up on that last question. You've always been good at getting the mom-and-pops sort of tenant in the small shops. And I'm curious, is that changing? Are you heading more toward the national and maybe the regional-type tenant as the most likely one to take up small shop space? And also, are you seeing -- I've seen some of these urgent care centers and dental offices, medical offices, that kind of stuff. Does that play a role at all as well in the small-shop leasing?
Brian M. Smith: It does, Rich. We -- I'm not sure our data is perfect on this. But if you look at the statistics, what it would tell you is since 2007 the amount of nationals and regionals is -- in the portfolio is a lot higher. And that today, we're doing probably 20%, 25%, it would say, local tenants. But the problem with the local tenants designation is you could have a restaurant like we have here in Jacksonville, Mellow Mushroom, which may have 3 very successful locations and it's considered local. If you talk to the field, what you would hear is that almost never will we, and it may not have an almost in that, we just do not take flyers on start-up businesses where somebody doesn't have experience. So any local is going to have at least one other store and likely a whole lot more. What was the second part, Rich? I'm sorry about that.
Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: No. The urgent care and the dental offices, the medical office, that kind of stuff, Brian.
Brian M. Smith: That's been a trend for the last few years as you are seeing more and more that I think a demographic shift in the country is demanding it. And the dentists, the chiropractors, all those things, they want the same things that you have in the shopping centers, the good visibility, the convenient parking, have traffic at your front door as you go into the grocery store. They are representing a good amount of leasing in our portfolio today.
Martin E. Stein: And they're merchandising their space much better than they had in the past, more sophisticated operators.
Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: So what do you think, just to follow up on that, guys, what do you think are the credit qualities of that group, that medical sort of group? Is it easy to get comfortable, I guess, with -- how good one is over the other?
Brian M. Smith: I think it's harder to -- and think it's harder to differentiate which one is a better operator, one dentist versus another, whereas, I think in the retail and restaurant world we have a real good idea on that. But what we do like about those users is they put a lot of money into those spaces, which we think is going to result in minor leases or reduced downtime and turnover.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jeremy Metz from UBS.
Jeremy Metz - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I was just looking at your same-store NOI growth trend in the back half of '13 was trending towards the low end of your 2.5% to 3.5% guidance in '14. And with occupancy gains likely limited, just wondering what do you think will drive a re-acceleration of that growth back to the mid or even high point? Is that just the expected leasing spread or is there some development baked into that?
Brian M. Smith: Well, first of all, I think if you look at 2013, you have to be careful in concluding that there was a deceleration in the second half of the year. I think unlike most prior years, you have to look at the full year number as opposed to the discrete quarters. And the reason for that is, there were some timing differences in the first 2 quarters, which elevated those numbers at the expense of the second half of the year. So 4% is really, I think, how you have to look at it. But going forward, we said all along that our goal is 3% same-property NOI growth, and we still feel very comfortable with the components. The rent growth we've talked about, we think we can take that from the high single digits into the double digits. And the rent steps, we're getting the embedded steps of about 1.3% or so. So the 2 of those combined get us to about 2.5% of the 3% we're looking for. In terms of occupancy, I think we've mentioned in the initial remarks, maybe less lift, but we still have all the pre-leasing that has to move into occupancy. And right now, we're doing a lot more leasing of the space that has been vacant for more than 12 months, so we're going to get some lift from that. And then after that, there's miscellaneous income, other ways we can grow it. But we feel pretty good that we should be able to get to the same 3% that we've strived -- that's been our target and there's not a deceleration going on.
Jeremy Metz - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Just the space that's been vacant grand in 12 months, I mean, you've been talking about the rent spread getting back to double digit, unless -- it seems like outside of a few abnormalities, that's been closer to cash spreads around 3% to 5%. So I'm just wondering where the double digit is? Does just have to do with some of function of what you have coming due and some of those vacant spaces during the 12 months that you feel confident on that you can get to a higher bump up to that double-digit level?
Brian M. Smith: I don't think the rent growth is going to be high from the things that have been vacant for a long time. But we're going from 0 rent to rent. So that's what's going to drive a lot of the same-property NOI growth there. In terms of the spread, it's all a function of what comes vacant. I mean, I can tell you right now, we've got 36 RadioShacks, and I think you've heard that there's going to be 500 store closings and we've looked at every one of those 36 and we see only 1 rolling back And we've got rent growth in there as high as 70%, 75% on some of them. Overall, probably 15% higher. But then Mariano's, as I told you about, I mean, talking about taking rents on a very large space from mid single digits well, well into double digits. So those kind of things provide plenty of rent growth and really the benefit lease stuff has been baking for 12 months is more same-property NOI growth.
Jeremy Metz - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And just to be clear, the double digit is a cash-basis spread, right?
Brian M. Smith: Right.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Lucas from Capital One Securities.
Christopher R. Lucas - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division: Lisa, you had mentioned that there's a risk to first quarter profit occupancy. I guess, Brian, I was wondering if you could provide just a quick assessment of what tenant fallout looks like so far this quarter compared to the year ago period at this point?
Brian M. Smith: When we look at historical change in occupancy quarter-by-quarter, and the first quarter is always the worst, right? It averages about 25 basis points drop in occupancy whereas the other 3 quarters were all positive. So I think as we get our budget at the end of last year and our guidance, we have taken into consideration that seasonal factor. So what I would say is that, last year, that negative 25 basis points never materialized. We're actually positive 10 basis points, and what we've seen so far this quarter, and it doesn't mean it will continue, but we've seen so far this quarter is that a lot of the move-outs are not materializing and we're tracking much better than expected.
Operator: And at this time, we have no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Hap Stein for closing comments.
Martin E. Stein: We thank you for your interest, your participation and hope you guys that are in snow-affected areas be safe, and take care. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

Executives: Michael Mas Martin E. Stein - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of Executive Committee and Member of Investment Committee Lisa Palmer - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Brian M. Smith - President, Chief Operating Officer and Director
Analysts: Katy McConnell Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Richard C.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Regency Centers Corporation Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Michael Mas. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Mas: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thank everyone for joining us today. On today's call, you will hear from our Chairman and CEO, Hap Stein; our President and COO, Brian Smith; our CFO, Lisa Palmer; and Senior Vice President and Treasurer, Chris Leavitt. Before we start, I'd like to address forward-looking statements that may be discussed on the call. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainty. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Hap?
Martin E. Stein: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the earnings call. This morning, I'd like to briefly share my assessment on how well Regency's portfolio, balance sheet and development program are now situated and how we have positioned them to grow future shareholder value. To begin with, there's a number -- as you're all aware, there have been a number of recently published research reports, and many of those reports have compared the portfolios in the shopping center sector. And pretty much every one of them have described Regency's portfolio as clearly one of the highest quality portfolios in the shopping center sector. In my view, 4 key attributes of the portfolio stand out. First on average, our grocery anchors generate more than $27.5 million in sales, and this represents a 9% increase in just the last 2 years and equates to more than $530 per square foot. Second, the average household income within 3 miles of our centers is $100,000, which is substantially higher than the peer average. Third, our average base rents in the portfolio are also meaningfully above the peer average. And finally, the percentage leased for small shops, and being able to attract terrific small shops as a good indicator of quality, remains one of the highest in the sector. Continuing on this topic of portfolio quality, since 2010, we've enhanced what was already a darn good portfolio through the sale of more than $800 million of nonstrategic assets and the acquisition of $475 million of first-rate centers with excellent NOI growth prospects. These newly acquired centers are 97% leased, with grocer sales that average more than $800 per square foot. And the demographics are much better with a total purchasing power that is 25% higher than those that were sold. As a result, and as Brian will cover in detail, operating fundamentals remain strong as reflected by achieving nearly 95% occupancy and year-to-date same-property NOI growth of 4.5%. This positive momentum from robust demand for space and our high-quality assets, the limited amount of new supply and the beneficial impact of redevelopments should continue to drive occupancy and accelerate rent growth. Not only has the recycling enhanced the portfolio, but together with other cost effective capital markets activity, it has also augmented a balance sheet that was already rock solid. Trailing debt to EBITDA is 5.9:1. And as of today, we have $100 million of cash and no outstanding balance on Regency's $800 million line of credit. Development is an important core competency for Regency, and it's creating value in great new and redeveloped centers. The almost $300 million of developments that are in process, some of which haven't even yet broken ground, are 90% leased and expected to generate an incremental return on invested capital of approximately 9%. Brian's going to spend some time describing our recently announced starts, and I know you will be equally impressed by the quality of these projects and the substantial value that's being created. Furthermore, the pipelines for compelling new developments, redevelopments and acquisitions are encouraging. As you can tell, I'm gratified by the important portfolio development and balance sheet milestones that have been reached. As a result of high quality of the portfolio and the strength of the balance sheet, we are now in a position to pivot and place more emphasis on disciplined growth. Organic earnings growth, new investments, particularly developments, and the related conservative and opportunistic financing, will be the path forward for future portfolio and balance sheet enhancements. By 2015, growth in per share core funds from operations will no longer be constrained by the impact from the elevated priorities that were placed on deleveraging and the sale of nonstrategic assets and will more fully benefit from the higher level of development starts. Lisa?
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Hap. Good morning, everyone. Core FFO per share for the third quarter was $0.65. This was $0.03 above the midpoint of our stated guidance range, primarily as a result of higher-than-expected net operating income from our 2012 acquisitions and in-process developments and also, lower G&A expense. Our 2012 acquisitions are outpacing underwriting, and in-process developments are leasing up faster and rent is commencing sooner. As Hap noted, the year-to-date same-property NOI growth was 4.5%. We now expect full year same-property NOI growth, excluding termination fees, in the range of 3.8% to 4%. With respect to transactions, dispositions continue to be an important source of capital to fund our development program. During the quarter, we closed on the sale of all the assets owned by our closed-end funds. And just after quarter and, we settled our preferred equity interest in the portfolio that we sold to Blackstone in 2012. We have slightly increased the high end of our guidance range for dispositions. And because of the tremendous success we've had converting our development and redevelopment pipeline into real starts, we've tightened the range for development guidance. Also as you will hear from Brian later, due to the increased likelihood that we could close on a few more acquisitions by year end, we've raised the high end of our guidance for acquisitions to $215 million. Because of these results and updated expectations, core FFO is now projected to fall in the range of $2.60 to $2.63 per share. The actions taken that have accelerated the enhancement of the portfolio and strengthening of the balance sheet, as Hap mentioned, will moderate our 2014 earnings growth rate. Early projections indicate that '14 will be a year similar to this year. But I also am proud that what we have accomplished has positioned us to enjoy better and stronger earnings growth in 2015 and beyond. We will discuss this in more detail on our upcoming guidance call on December 17. Brian?
Brian M. Smith: Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. We're 3 quarters now into what is turning out to be a really strong 2013. Let me start by highlighting some of our operating results. On a same-property basis, the operating portfolio is nearly 95% leased at the close of the quarter, and shop space occupancy stands at roughly 89%, the highest it's been since 2008 and a 130-basis-point improvement over 2012. With this increase in occupancy, aided by strong tenant demand and limited new supply, we continue to gain pricing power. Rent growth returned to double digits this quarter. Average rents for side-shop tenants continue to trend upward and are now 34% above the trough. And not only are the starting rents improving, but we're also seeing more favorable lease terms as a whole, including better rent steps and more aggressive commencement dates. Retailers are acting on this positive sentiment. Many are making significant investments in their current spaces, as well as in new ones. Given the underlying strength of tenant demand, we see no slowdown in the positive momentum in all of the key operating metrics. This heightened activity is evident, not only in the operating portfolio, but also in the strength of our development and redevelopment pipelines. Take our newest projects: Glen Gate, a development slated for start in October, will be 103,000-square-foot infill shopping center, built on the site of a former Avon cosmetics office building in an upscale neighborhood in Chicago. Some of you may remember touring this site at our Investor Day 2 years ago. The 3-mile trade area benefits from a population of 150,000 people, with average household incomes of $100,000. Glen Gate will be anchored by Mariano's, a very successful grocery operator in the market, averaging sales of more than $50 million per store. The center is already nearly 90% leased and committed before vertical construction has begun. We also just purchased a 4.5-acre site on which we plan to develop Shoppes on Riverside, a 50,000-square-foot center, anchored by the Fresh Market, that will serve the affluent waterfront communities located in close proximity to downtown Jacksonville. Due to its location adjacent to the downtown core, the center will benefit from a daytime population of 110,000 people, which is fueled with strong demand from shop tenants, particularly restaurants. Additionally, we started the redevelopment of Woodway Collection this quarter. Located in Houston, Woodway enjoys real strong purchasing power. Within 3 miles, there's a population of nearly 180,000 people, with average household incomes exceeding $100,000. The center has an excellent lineup of shop and pad tenants, including the country's second ever Carrabba's Italian Grill, which, to this day, is still owned and managed by the Carrabba family. We recently completed a face lift on the side shops and demolished the former grocery-anchor space and will relocate a nearby Whole Foods to the center. This is a perfect example of what happens when you have superior real estate. Bad news, in this case, the loss of an anchor, becomes great news. We've also seen remarkable leasing velocity in our in-process development portfolio. The 7 projects underway and soon to go under construction as of quarter end are nearly 90% leased, with a combined projected incremental return approaching 9%. Grand Ridge Plaza in Seattle, which is a dynamic retail center of an upscale planned residential and commercial community, will actually be 99% leased when it opens. This is almost unheard of for a project of its size at 325,000 square feet. And the development starts since 2009 that are now complete and part of the operating portfolio are 97% leased. Development is not easy, but the results are gratifying and the benefits are significant. This kind of performance is the result of the dogged determination and persistence of an experienced development team committed to its mission. Turning to acquisitions. I am pleased that we continue to acquire premium shopping centers with outstanding NOI growth prospects. Our most recent acquisition, Fellsway Plaza, closed earlier this month and is no exception. Fellsway represents a very unique opportunity to acquire institutional quality assets located in a densely populated and extremely supply-constrained close-in suburb of Boston. The property boasts purchasing power demographics with income-plus population of 435,000 in a trade area that enjoys 99% retail occupancy. Fellsway is 154,000-square-foot center, with the leading market share grocer generating $53 million in annual sales. The center is projected to deliver compounded annual NOI growth in excess of 6% over the next 10 years, driven by a redevelopment opportunity that we intend to start immediately. We expect the redeveloped center to demand base rents that are, on average, nearly 35% higher than current in-place rents. This combination of long-term stability and value-add potential is certainly an attractive acquisition in today's competitive marketplace. The team is working hard to find more opportunities with substantial growth and upside characteristics that mirror those of our more recent acquisitions. And as Lisa discussed, because of 2 transactions that we have under contract, one in Raleigh and the other in the Northeast, we've increased our guidance for full year acquisitions. Lastly, I'd like to touch on Safeway's recent announcement regarding their Dominick's chain and the decision to exit the Chicago market. We have 7 leases with Dominick's, one of which was previously subleased, with 6 properties that could be impacted. 4 of those properties are in joint ventures. The true impact of this is going to play out over the next quarter or 2, but we have been in proactive dialogue with other grocers about some of these centers for a while. With the pro rata weighted average base rent in single digits, we believe we should be able to attract desirable replacement tenants if we get these spaces back. Hap?
Martin E. Stein: Thank you, Brian, and thank you, Lisa. This progress in placing the portfolio, balance sheet and development program on very high ground is a testament not only to our focused strategy, but also to the dedicated efforts of our talented team. Most important of all, we are committed to profit from our advantageous position by meaningfully growing NAV, shareholder value and future earnings. We thank you for your time and welcome your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Bilerman at Citi.
Katy McConnell: This is Katy McConnell on for Michael. Given occupancy almost reached the high end of guidance in third quarter, do you think the revised range is likely conservative for year end? And how much more upside do you think there could be in the next couple of years?
Lisa Palmer: I'll take the guidance part of the question, and then let Hap or Brian take the upside going forward. We do have a couple of strategic anchor move-outs that we're working on, which if they happen, could impact our occupancy by as much -- up to as much as 40 basis points, which would take us down to the low end of the range. Again, it may or may not happen. Obviously, that -- the impact on NOI is minimal because it's towards the latter part of the year, but the occupancy guidance is a point in time. So that's the range on the downside.
Brian M. Smith: In terms of outperforming, we have been outperforming so far this year. And with the beat raising [ph], I think the same kind of things could happen. One of the things that's going on that continues to be a favorable trend is the lower level of move-outs that we've been experiencing. And those move-outs that we are doing, many of those are done on a strategic basis where we have something better to replace them. Our shop move-outs for this quarter -- well, year-to-date, our shop move-outs are the lowest they've ever been, so I think that's probably one of the areas where you could see some improvement.
Martin E. Stein: Yes. During the next couple of years, as far as that part of your question, we do not see 90% occupancy on the shop space side, and 95% overall occupancy as being a glass or any other kind of ceiling and just would hope to see the next couple of years moving our occupancy above those levels.
Operator: We'll take our next question.
Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I guess, going to the acquisition guidance, and thinking about that, how do you weigh the probability of coming in toward the bottom end versus the upper end of the guidance? And it sounds like if you don't come in at the upper end, is it transactions probably going to slip to 2014? Or it just kind of falls out and doesn't happen?
Brian M. Smith: At this stage, the project -- as Lisa mentioned, the projects are under contract, and we haven't seen anything in due diligence that would scare us, that would prevent a closing. They haven't happened, so there's always a chance. But for right now, we're feeling awfully optimistic that both of those will happen by year end.
Martin E. Stein: I think a bigger risk might be that one might get pushed into 2014. But...
Lisa Palmer: There is that assumption on -- so that could potentially push it, but I think we feel pretty good about it.
Martin E. Stein: We are really excited about both of them, so hopefully, we'll be able to share our thoughts on these with you in the not-too-distant future. [indiscernible]
Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And we get a second question, right?
Martin E. Stein: Absolutely.
Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Looking at sequential leasing in the category, not the small shop, but 10,000 to 19,000 square feet. There is almost a 200 basis point sequential pickup. I was wondering if you can just kind of add a little color on what's going on there.
Brian M. Smith: Yes. We had a lot of leasing in that category. In fact, I think it's one of the strongest quarters we've ever had in terms of anchor leasing, maybe the second strongest quarter ever. So we're 99% leased in that category, and whenever we get an opportunity, they fill up pretty quickly. A couple of those were major redevelopments. An example will be the Woodway Collection that we talked about in the prepared remarks where we replaced an anchor tenant that moved out last quarter with one this year, pulled through to this quarter.
Operator: We'll take our next question.
Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: It's Rich Moore at RBC. On the franchise front, the tenants occupy a lot of the small shops, or could, I guess, theoretically occupy some more small shop space. What are you seeing from these national franchise guys? Is that -- and maybe not even franchise, just national small shop tenants. Is that picking up? Is that sort of leveling off? I mean, can you give us a feel for that?
Brian M. Smith: Rich, I have not seen any leveling off whatsoever. It's been strong, the quality of the franchisees has been very strong. Overall, I think small shops there -- I think there's no differentiation between franchisees and the others we're putting in there. They're healthy, very healthy, optimistic. I mentioned they're putting a lot of money back into the space. They're benefiting from the lack of new supply, and our pipelines right now are as full as they've ever been. They're the fullest they've been in 4 quarters. And if anything, we're experiencing more sense of urgency to get the stores open. So I think on all accounts, the small shops are looking good going forward.
Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay, good. And it seems like you guys are always finding another development to do. The talk is always or has been recently for the past, I'd say, 3 or 4 years that there isn't that much development to do and yet you guys seem to add one maybe every quarter. I mean, how would you characterize, I guess, the broader outlook for development at this point?
Brian M. Smith: I think-- I mean, obviously, numbers nationally would support that there's not much development going on, and we hear that same thing. Mostly what you see around the country would be retail and ground-floor residential, mixed use projects. We see a lot of redevelopment, but there hasn't been a lot of true shopping center development going on. We're seeing -- where we are seeing it would be places like Southern California, Houston, Washington, D.C. and North Carolina. But not a lot. And, I guess, I have to say I find this surprising, but at the same time not surprising. Surprising in the sense that we are finding that there's a lot of demand, as I mentioned the leasing is strong. Pipelines, I just mentioned are the fullest they've been in 4 quarters. The anchors, particularly the grocers, are expanding, and there's no supply. And if you're 99% leased in your large anchor spaces, they've got to find new locations. And that would be true of the other portfolios out there too. And development works, as we've mentioned in the prepared remarks, if you look at the past success of the ones that -- we started since 2009, it's almost $400 million, they're almost 93% leased and several of the projects haven't even gone vertical yet. So in that regard, I'm surprised. But I guess, where I'm not surprised is, as we've said all along, it's really difficult, especially if you're focused on the infill nature of the projects. The ones we've started since 2009 have combined purchasing power well over 200,000. And when you're playing in those infill markets, they're hard to find. They're fraught with all kinds of roadblocks, whether it be environmental -- challenges to the entitlements and so forth -- and so the only way really to get through that is not only to have a great team with a lot of experience, but to have them working on them for years. I think what's happening, or elsewhere around the country, is people are just starting up development programs, and it just takes years and years to get those things through the process. And as you know from some of the ones we've started recently, some of those -- most of those have been in the works for years.
Operator: We'll take our next question.
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Haendel St. Juste, Morgan Stanley. I have a question. I think Lisa, you said earlier that there's 2 assets under contract within that guidance of $150 million of acquisitions between now and year end. Curious if you could give some color on the size or any parameters around yield, IRR, around those contracts.
Martin E. Stein: One small portfolio and one's a single asset. As we indicated, one's in Raleigh, one's in the Northeast, both have exceptional growth, and the returns meet our parameters. And they're consistent with what the guidance we gave, and plus they got great NOI growth and one of them, we think, has even more upside even beyond that.
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Fair enough. And one more if I may. You made a couple of acquisitions recently with a JV partner. Just curious, were those assets that made sense to bring in a local partner? And how should we think about JV that's part of your acquisition strategy going forward?
Brian M. Smith: Well, the one that we closed in the fourth quarter, Fellsway, I think that's probably the poster child for the kind of property we want to do. We don't have a presence up there. It's obviously -- well, we don't have a development presence up there. It's extremely high barrier. It's a tough market to develop in. We know -- and this particular partner is very, very experienced. We've worked with him before. He has personally acquired or developed or redeveloped over 25 million square feet. One of the largest leasing companies in the Northeast, where they own, lease or manage over 70 centers and are the exclusive leasing agent for more than 11 million square feet on nearly 60 centers. And they also have a tenant representation arm, where they represent some of the largest, best retailers in New England. So we think, in this case, where we've got a redevelopment we're going to start right out of the ground, somebody who's from there, who went to school within almost a stone's throw is -- and with all the connections they've got on both development and leasing sides made great sense.
Martin E. Stein: And in that case, and probably in future cases, it's going to be access to the opportunity. And I think that's what the joint charter provided in this case. And any future opportunities like this where we have a joint venture partner is probably going to be involved.
Brian M. Smith: I mean, yes. To echo what Hap's talking about, in this particular case, there were several people competing for the project. And this guy, it looked like we were not going to get it. And he had been working with his broker friend on this for years and called him up and basically, I think, shook it free for us. So, yes, it really provided value there.
Operator: We'll take our next question.
Unknown Analyst: It's Jay [indiscernible] with Green Street. Just a follow-up on Rich Moore's question on development. I guess, you're obviously going -- being very thoughtful about the process. They're well-funded and preleasing is very good. So maybe from a company-specific standpoint, how do you think about critical mass in your development pipeline? And at what point are there too many balls in the air?
Martin E. Stein: I think the -- I think what we've said is we are very comfortable with the -- remember this year, 20 -- almost 30% of our development starts will be redevelopment starts. So somewhere in the neighborhood of 20% to 30% will be redevelopments. The development and redevelopment starts in the neighborhood of $150 million to $200 million-plus a year is something that we're very comfortable with. We think that's rightsized. We also think that the infill focus and/or being in a planned community is -- and not being a merchant developer, developing that which we want to own long-term, that's a very focused strategy. And we're very -- and as Brian said, it has been extremely successful in the last 4 to 5 years. And that's where your focus is. And I think somewhere in that 200 - maybe a little bit higher, but averaging $200 million a year, is from a new development starts standpoint is -- would kind of be our goal.
Brian M. Smith: Let me just add to that. I mean, the focus here is not so much on size, but on quality. And -- what we have done in the past, where - we are not going to continue to staff up just because a new opportunity comes up. What we've done in the past and we'll continue to do is if there are more opportunities than a given team can handle, we'll either augment it from somewhere else where there's capacity, or we will just take the best opportunity of the ones available.
Unknown Analyst: Okay, great. And then just to follow up on your kind of land bank, there hasn't been any movement there in the last couple of quarters. Should we be expecting an update there? Or where do those stand right now in the process?
Brian M. Smith: Yes. There has actually been a fair amount of movement on that one. We're down to a combination of land held for development and land held for sale. We're down to $61 million. A couple of years ago, we were at $150 million. And in the third quarter, you probably didn't see a lot of movement because we did sell a parcel out in Southern California, about $3.2 million. But that was offset by we moved a parcel of land that was going to be ground leased to Cinco Ranch into the land held for sale. So it reduced the net impact of the sales for the quarter, but that thing will be sold imminently.
Martin E. Stein: That's a significant focus, and as Brian indicated, we've made significant progress and expect that progress to continue into the fourth quarter.
Operator: We will move on to our next question.
Unknown Analyst: Luther Kreitz [ph] from Deutsche Bank here. Can you just give a little bit more color on the upside to acquisition guidance? That will be helpful. And I guess, as -- was there a particular circumstance that kind of accelerate the timeline there? And then just from a broader perspective on the acquisition front, given that some of the others are telling us, it's tough out there for buyers in certain pockets. Can you talk about the sourcing environment and the competition that you guys are seeing more longer-term in your acquisition prospects?
Brian M. Smith: Yes. In terms of, I guess, why the guidance went up is particularly the portfolio that Hap was talking about, it's been 3 months since we issued guidance, and a lot happened in that period. And this one is very recent, and it happened faster than the typical acquisition does. Normally, there's a long, drawn out process. In this particular case, we got in a plane, flew up there, and literally, the deal was closed that day. I'm sorry, the agreement was reached that day. So it is very competitive. Everybody's going after the same pool of great properties. And -- but fortunately, I know as of last quarter when we were counting this up, I think we looked back a couple of years. Of the 16 acquisitions we had done, 12 of them were done off-market. So that's what we try to do. We try to find things before they get competitive and really bid up. And we're having a fair amount of success at it, but it is very competitive. And there's a limited pool of the really good high-quality assets with good growth.
Martin E. Stein: And Lisa, you might just review briefly what our philosophy -- our policy is as related to acquisition guidelines going into the year.
Lisa Palmer: Yes. As you think about our -- just our business model, funding for our developments is coming from our dispositions. And to the extent that we either have access to cost-effective assets to the equity markets or are able to accelerate some of our disposition sales, and we can recycle those funds into great acquisition opportunities. So acquisitions are not part of our base model, if you will. And going into the year, the guidance was 0 to $50 million as we had really prefunded. And our dispositions were estimated at that time to be on the high end of $200 million, with development starts of $150 million. So, and as Brian said, we just didn't have any visibility to these 2 transactions the last time we reported.
Unknown Analyst: Okay. Fair enough. And then just relative to the acquisitions that are kind of closing near- to intermediate term. I guess, should we think about those as more of a core property plug-and-play types? Or ones that might need a little additional attention capital-wise?
Martin E. Stein: They're going to be more core -- but I want to say that our -- we're not just investing capital. Unless it's in our view, it's got exceptional NOI and/or upside. And I think all the acquisitions that we've done have those characteristics. It's consistent with our strategy. It's got a sustainable competitive advantage. It's going to be able to generate very nice NOI growth, in a lot of cases have additional upside. And otherwise, it doesn't make -- it's not a good use of capital.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go ahead and take our next question.
Brian M. Smith: While we're waiting, I was asked to clarify something -- Mike Mueller asked about -- asked a question, and I apparently misunderstood it. Mike, you were asking about the increase in the 10,000 to 20,000 square foot bucket and I was talking about the greater than 20,000 square foot bucket, so let me just modify that. Within the 10,000 to 20,000 where we saw such a big increase, it's a really small category that we've got, only 9% of our GLA, fits within the 10,000 to 20,000 square feet. And therefore, basically any leasing is going to move the needle. And we did 3 leases within that category and that's why we got the big jump. So sorry for misunderstanding that.
Operator: Caller, please go ahead.
Jonathan Pong - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Jonathan Pong at Baird. Just wanted to dig in a little bit on the disposition outlook. And I guess, you guys have made really great progress in terms of upping the disposition outlook so far this year. Can you talk maybe directionally as to where you see that volume trending for 2014? And how much more runway you actually have there in terms of just looking at your overall portfolio?
Martin E. Stein: As we indicated in our remarks, given the acceleration of our dispositions, the progress that we've made, we think that the portfolio is very well-situated right now. The balance sheet is very well-situated. And we're going to be -- it will be a funding source for developments going forward. And for -- potentially for other investments. And that's the way we're looking at it. And so we'll give you more guidance, but I think that, I guess, it's safe to say that our plans for dispositions in 2014 will be much -- and in the future will be at a much lower level, unless our investment activity is also larger than it's been the last several years.
Jonathan Pong - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Got it. And maybe on the small shop leasing trends, it does sound like there's a bit of an upside just there in terms of the overall industry, 10,000 square feet and below. Is there an opportunity to maybe be a little offensive and create some available space through downsizing or proactive lease terminations?
Brian M. Smith: Yes. First of all, I think there is a lot of upside just in leasing up what we've got. We are at 88.8% and see no reason why we can't get up to 92% or whatever. We are doing -- what you're really asking for is the kind of growth that's going to come from just aggressive asset management. And we're doing all the normal things whether -- the focus on rent growth, a focus on rent steps and occupancy. But some of the other things that fall in the category we talked about would be creating paths, creating additional GLA. And that does fall within our redevelopments. We've got example, this past quarter, how up at Speedway in Boston, we added a Chick-fil-A pad. We're adding a Panera pad at Culpepper. We're adding a Dick's at Culpepper and we're expanding some of our earlier development starts. We're taking and leasing creative space, which the market is allowing us to do now. For example, up at Speedway, we had a 100,000-square-foot store that we have Burlington Coat Factory in. They took the front 65,000 square feet. We leased the back 30,000 square feet, roughly, and that rent will actually triple in 3 years. So we're getting a good -- that's a good example of the rent increases we're getting. We are consolidating space or expanding it. We're upgrading the quality, different uses for space. For example, out of Plaza Hermosa in Southern California, there's a building that's not really part of the shopping center. It's located on a different tier. It's got plenty of parking. It will replace a nightclub with $1 billion hospital, 90-year-old company, and they're paying us almost 3% annual bumps. So -- and we talked about the strategic move-outs, much of our move-out activity now is the result of being able to replace tenants that are -- that we want to get out of there and replace with better people, better economics. And just kind of a couple of proactive things we're doing. Just to give you some examples, there's a national footwear chain that is in our Corvallis Center, and they had a right to terminate the lease, so they went ahead and they exercised it. And we instantly replaced them with a better tenant, another national tenant at much higher rent. And they came back and said, "We were just negotiating." And so I think you're starting to see that kind of leverage showing up on the landlord side that we are going to fully take advantage of.
Martin E. Stein: And just to piggyback on that comment is, although we are doing a lot of creative things and proactive -- taking proactive actions to grow NOI and create value, at the same time, the kind -- and you always want to have less drop space than there is demand. But the kind of centers that we want to own are centers where there is substantial demand from the side-shop space, not only the anchor space. And where we're not afraid, but we're excited about the opportunities that the side-shop space presents.
Brian M. Smith: I think one of the other things that's going to fuel our growth going forward is not all of the markets out there have participated in this run-up and they're starting to show some good activity. I think perfect case in point is Florida, which has lagged, and all of a sudden the leasing activity is very strong there, and we're seeing real good rent growth numbers this past quarter.
Operator: It appears there are no further questions at this time. And I apologize, we do have somebody else queue up.
Tamara J. Fique - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: This is Tammy Fique, Wells Fargo. I just wanted to follow up, Lisa, on the lower G&A that you recorded during the quarter. I'm just wondering kind of what contributed to that and if that's the run rate going forward?
Lisa Palmer: Yes. It's a good run rate, and we were just able to realize some savings.
Tamara J. Fique - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then I think you may have touched on this, and maybe it's related to the move-outs, the strategic move-outs. But the occupancy at the end of the third quarter was 94.9%, and the 2013 guidance is 94.5% to 95%. You're already pretty close to the top end of that. Is there anything that we should be thinking about that wouldn't -- that would cause it to drop to the lower end of that range?
Lisa Palmer: I mean, it's really what I've already answered in terms of -- I mean, that takes up, that really accounts for the whole thing. And it's a matter of whether we actually accomplish what we're trying to accomplish before the year end. So again, they're proactive.
Brian M. Smith: They start at the low end of the occupancy -- yes, I mean, the only thing that could happen there, I think about halfway down to the bottom of the low end are a couple of large tenants we know are going to move out. So really, you're talking about, I mean, about 70,000 square feet, could something happen, if 1 anchor surprised us and moved out, that would get you there.
Tamara J. Fique - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then with regard to the Blackstone preferred interest, was that an early termination? Or was that the amount that you expected?
Lisa Palmer: No. It was early. We had expected it to go through the end of the year, but we did receive the undistributed income for the remainder of the year. And I mean, I think they just basically wanted to settle prior to [indiscernible] IPO because some of those properties were included.
Martin E. Stein: We appreciate your interest, and we hope that you have a wonderful Halloween. Thank you very much.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Regency Centers Corporation Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Michael Mas. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Mas: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, you will hear from our Chairman and CEO, Hap Stein; our President and COO, Brian Smith; our Chief Financial Officer, Lisa Palmer; and Senior Vice President and Treasurer, Chris Leavitt. Before we start, I'd like to address forward-looking statements that may be discussed on the call. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Hap?
Martin E. Stein: Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call. Through the second quarter, Regency's team continued to take advantage of robust tenant demand and favorable conditions in the capital and sales markets to execute on all aspects of our strategy and make meaningful progress towards our key objectives. Starting with our high-quality portfolio, the 5% NOI growth achieved in the first half of the year should result in annual growth in excess of 3.5%. With respect to our development program, our roster of high-quality in-process developments are approaching 90% leased in creating substantial value on our $240 million investment, and I continue to be excited about the prospects of our pipeline for new developments. I'm also encouraged by the growing pipeline for value-added redevelopments, expansions and renovations. The team has currently identified future projects that represent over $100 million of opportunities. And just as critical, we are cost-effectively strengthening what is already a rock-solid balance sheet while funding our new investments through our ATM and property sales. We're gratified by these advances, but in order to carry this positive momentum through the rest of the year and beyond, our management team will continue to focus on the key drivers for growing net asset value for our shareholders: intense leasing and asset management, together with the addition of high-quality shopping centers and the disposition of those that have been prioritized for sale, which will be critical to sustaining long-term growth in NOI of 2.5% or more; creating value and great shopping centers through developments and redevelopments; astutely and opportunistically preserving and enhancing an already strong balance sheet; and a capital markets environment that, as we experienced during the last 60 days, can quickly become volatile and more expensive; and utilizing Regency's special culture to maintain the team's high level of engagement and focus. Lisa?
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Hap, and good morning to some of you, good afternoon to most of you. Core FFO per share for the second quarter was $0.67. This is $0.03 ahead of the high end of guidance, primarily as a result of higher net operating income. Year-to-date same-property NOI growth, excluding termination fees, was 5.1%, with a majority of this outperformance coming from base rental income. The balance of our growth was due to the timing of prior year recoveries, percentage rent and other income. With respect to capital markets activity, during the quarter, we raised just over $36 million through our ATM at a weighted average share price of nearly $55. As Hap stated, this, together with dispositions, is consistent with our strategy to cost-effectively fund investments while improving our already healthy balance sheet metrics towards our long-term targets. And to that end, we raised guidance for dispositions -- the high end of guidance for dispositions by $50 million due to the heightened visibility of selling 2 additional centers. Hap also mentioned the recent fluctuations in the capital markets. I think it's worth reminding everyone that more than half of the $500 million of unsecured debt maturing in 2014 and 2015 has been locked at 2.1% and 2.5%, respectively. This represents 10-year treasury rates, plus swap spreads. We continue to monitor future commitments in order to maintain significant uncommitted capacity on our $800 million line, which, as of today, has an outstanding balance of only $5 million. Looking ahead, I'd like to walk through the revisions to our full year guidance for 2013. As a result of the second quarter outperformance, we now expect same-property NOI growth, excluding termination fees, to be in the range of 3.5% to 4%. The impact of base rental income is expected to moderate as we face higher comps from the strong occupancy gains we experienced over the second half of 2012. This results in an increase of $0.04 at the midpoint of the range for core FFO per share Brian?
Brian M. Smith: Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon. Our focused leasing efforts, the success of our redevelopment and ground-up developments and our portfolio enhancement strategies produced yet another quarter of strong results. The operating portfolio made a full recovery from its seasonal first quarter occupancy dip and closed the second quarter at 94.6% leased. The biggest improvement came in spaces less than 10,000 square feet, which gained 90 basis points quarter-over-quarter and now stand at 88.5% leased. Also, we are experiencing broader leasing demand. Prospective retailers and restaurants are being less picky about the spaces they will lease and are now more focused simply on securing a space. Increasingly, national tenants are seeking to lock in early renewals at today's rents, and negotiating leverage is clearly improving for landlords. For example, it's now typical to get firm outside rent commencement dates, something that was common before the downturn, but not since. This is drastically improving our downtime, which is 45% shorter today than at the end of the first quarter of 2011. In fact, the average downtime is now a mere 3 months for spaces vacant for less than a year. The shift in pricing power also affords us the leverage to drive rents as evidenced by rent growth of 15% on new leases. As a matter of fact, this is the ninth consecutive quarter of positive rent growth. And just as notable, these consistent occupancy gains and strong rent growth figures have led us to NOI growth in excess of 3% for the sixth quarter in a row. Looking forward, we should continue to deliver same-property NOI growth on a long-term basis in excess of 2.5%, supported by embedded growth from a meaningful amount of contractual rent increases, continued interest from retailers and restaurants looking to expand, particularly in the better shopping centers, the leverage gained as we achieve and even surpass our objective of 95% rent-paying occupancy and the addition of new retail supply remaining at a rate that is significantly below historic levels. I'm also pleased to announce that our value-added redevelopment program continues to produce exceptional results. By removing underperforming operators and replacing them with proven high-quality retailers, not only have we been able to generate high rents, more traffic and better merchandising, but we've also substantially upgraded the growth potential of our income stream. For example, at Greenway Town Center, a new redevelopment start this quarter in Portland, Oregon, we terminated a lease with an underperforming regional grocery store and replaced it with Whole Foods at nearly 2x the rent. This game-changing new anchor, along with planned upgrades of the center's facade, parking lot, landscaping and other common area features, will create substantial value. Speaking of Whole Foods, their operating success and plans for expansion are no secret to anyone. With very strong average store sales, healthy margins and a top-notch shopping experience, Whole Foods is an ideal anchor for shopping centers in our target demographic to attract the best-in-class secondary anchors, shop retailers and restaurants. To that end, we are excited to be working closely with Whole Foods on a dozen exceptional development and redevelopment opportunities that are in our pipeline. Moving to ground-up developments, we started 2 projects during the second quarter and announced a third just last week. The first, Shops On Main, was covered in detail on our prior call. Construction is progressing nicely, and the project is converting $15 million of land into what will be a quality shopping center that is expected to generate 12% incremental return on newly invested capital. The second, Juanita Tate Marketplace, is located in a high-barrier, in-fill market near downturn Los Angeles, with approximately 450,000 people living within a 3-mile radius. It will be anchored by a leading Hispanic grocer called Northgate Market and CVS. We are projecting a return of 9.2% on invested capital. After the close of the quarter, we purchased 23 acres of land in Miami, Florida, on which we will develop a 320,000-square-foot center that will be anchored by Target, Publix, Ross and T.J. Maxx. Before even breaking ground, the center is nearly 90% leased and committed, with interest for every space. Land is scarce in Miami, and infill development is the only kind of development. This center is no exception. This is a dense trade area, with more than 180,000 people living within 3 miles. It also benefits from a daytime population of 250,000, due in part to its location near the second largest university in Florida. Perhaps more importantly, this will be Regency's first ground-up development in Miami. This gives us a foothold from which we should be able to expand our development presence in this highly desirable market. Turning to acquisitions, the environment remains very competitive for a limited supply of A-quality product on the market. And the recent increase in interest rates has not moved cap rates for institutional quality centers in primary markets. Those buyers use low leverage and are challenged to find satisfactory places to deploy their huge amounts of capital. This makes our recent purchase of Preston Oaks even more rewarding. Preston Oaks is located in the prestigious Preston Hollow neighborhood of Dallas, Texas, with average household incomes in excess of $140,000. The center is anchored by H.E.B. Central Market and in its first year-generated sales of nearly $900 per square foot and also features national retailers, including Gap, Pier 1 Imports and White House Black Market. With a growth profile of 3% annually, this is a great addition to our portfolio. We look forward to adding more centers like Preston Oaks that meet Regency's strategic NOI growth and total return guidelines. Because the buyers of B properties, especially in secondary markets, are more opportunistic and rely more heavily on leverage, there could be a backup in cap rates for B centers. However, we haven't seen it yet. To that end, we sold 5 properties this quarter for combined net proceeds of nearly $90 million at a weighted average cap rate of 6.7%. And as Lisa discussed, we raised guidance to a new range of $250 million to $300 million due to recent leasing progress on 2 centers that have been targeted for sale. In closing, with what we've accomplished over the past 4 quarters, we've raised the bar. Regency's formula for growing NAV is the right one, and the team is highly engaged and motivated to help build on our positive momentum during the second half of the year. Hap?
Martin E. Stein: Thanks, Brian. Thanks, Lisa. To wrap it up, I continue to be gratified by the dedicated effort that our team brings to the table each and every day to execute our strategy. I really like how Regency is poised to continue to grow shareholder value. We thank you for your time, and we welcome your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We do have our first question from Christy McElroy from UBS.
Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Lisa, just wanted to ask a couple of questions on expenses. It seemed like your same-store operating expenses in Q2 saw a pretty big jump. Just wondering what the biggest contributors were to that rise and sort of what you're expecting for the balance of the year. And then on recoveries, you talked about timing of recoveries contributing to the quarter. I'm wondering if you could expand on that a bit.
Lisa Palmer: Sure. And I'll let Brian add some color if he'd like. But we did -- there were some late snowstorms. I think we had a couple of April snowstorms in a few regions of the country. That contributed to the higher expenses spike sequentially and also year-over-year.
Brian M. Smith: Yes. In terms of the operating expenses, they are really only about 2% higher on controllable expenses. What we had was snow, as Lisa was talking about, last year, that was late in the year. And what we used to do is time our building improvements, painting, parking lot resurfacing and things like that. We do that when there's no snow. So usually, those happen later in the year. And last year, just because of the weather, they happened earlier. So that will all level out for the end of the year. And then the other expenses, there were some property taxes that were higher, and -- but the control of expenses are only 2%.
Lisa Palmer: And then with regards to timing, we finished our reconciliations earlier this year. So we completed all of our prior year recs in the second -- by the end of the second quarter. Last year, that was in the third quarter. And it's contributing to current year income approximately $0.02. However, we'll see that reverse because we're going to be up against the higher comp in the third quarter.
Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And then just what was physical occupancy at the end of Q2?
Lisa Palmer: You mean physical or you mean rent?
Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: For commenced occupancy as opposed to the leased rate. What was the commenced occupancy rate of the portfolio?
Brian M. Smith: 92.9%.
Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: 92.9%?
Brian M. Smith: It's 92.9%. Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeffrey Donnelly with Wells Fargo.
Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I'm not sure if you agree with the approach, but if I look at the sequential change in the dollar rents you're signing on new and renewal leases, they haven't really moved a great deal over the past year. Does that imply that market rents maybe snapped back after 2008 and 2009 but ultimately have kind of flattened back out in the last year?
Brian M. Smith: Well, Jeff, I'm not sure I do agree with that. I know at least on our shop space rents, those rents increased for 8 -- I mean, it was 8 straight quarters before this quarter taking a dip down. That's all shop spaces, excluding ground leases. Sometimes ground lease has thrown [ph] a little bit of noise. But they are now at levels that -- well, last quarter, they were the highest they had ever been, and this quarter, they backed down a little bit. I think they fell about 11%. But they're still, I think, where they were about second quarter 2008. Now the anchors, that definitely distorts things because we had a 34% drop in the average rents signed this quarter with anchors. And that's because 12 of them were at single-digit rents, and all but 2 of those were renewals with fixed increases from leases signed long ago. For example, we had a DBS [ph] with $1.85. And so I think the average anchors signed this quarter was $10.26, but we signed 3 or 4 anchor leases either in the quarter or subsequent to it that average about $20 a foot. So I just think the average rents, especially on the anchors, distorts the picture a bit.
Martin E. Stein: And that obviously is not a same space reported number.
Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Understood. And just to clarify, I wasn't necessarily looking at spreads per se, it's just that 12 months ago, you guys were doing leases -- new leases at $22.50 a foot, and today, they are around $23.50. But they haven't moved tremendously. But maybe as a follow-up, it looks like TI dollars on small shop tenants has been rising across almost all the REITs out there. Is that a function of maybe companies cutting deeper into tougher-to-lease space as we mature in the cycle or just really kind of a coincidence because of tenant mix?
Brian M. Smith: Jeff, you look at the supplemental, for sure, it shows 3 quarters in a row of increasing rents. And -- but the reality is, if you go back to 4 quarters ago, that was the lowest amount of TI that we had given. It was the bottom literally of any amount that we have on record for how much we've given. So yes, it's been 3 quarters increasing, but it's coming off a very low base. In fact, except for this quarter, the last 10 quarters have all been below our historic average. So this is the first quarter where it's ticked up just a little bit above the long-term average. And the other thing I would say about those TIs is we are giving it significantly less often than we have in the past. I think there's like 42% or something like that this quarter.
Lisa Palmer: And there was one transaction that was a bit of an anomaly, a very difficult to lease -- in California.
Brian M. Smith: Yes, we have a space that's only suitable for a daycare center. So as part of our redevelopment, we combined a couple of spaces to bring in another daycare operator, and that had very high TIs. We did a PetSmart lease. The PetSmart leases always require a lot of TIs for their electrical and plumbing. And then we had a Corner Bakery that took a lot. So we had fewer leases. We had a few that were higher, so it kind of distorts it. But overall, like I said...
Martin E. Stein: We're close to historical average.
Brian M. Smith: We're close to historical averages.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nathan Isbee with Stifel.
Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: As you look at the 5% same-store growth that you generated in the second quarter, can you perhaps break it down a little bit between the occupancy? What exactly was driving that growth? Occupancy is up, but it wouldn't signify a 5% plus same-store growth combined with the 5% leasing spreads.
Lisa Palmer: Yes. Nate, as I mentioned on the call, there's a significant amount that is related to timing, so the timing of percentage rent and the timing of prior year recoveries and also timing of other income. And if you -- we do expect those to literally reverse, so not just normalize, but reverse for the second half of the year. And if you were to level that, we would be closer to the high 3% range.
Martin E. Stein: And a good portion of that comes from contractual.
Lisa Palmer: Yes. A good portion of that, call it 3.8%, is from base rental income, and we've been through that math with you. If you get 1.25% to 1.5% from contractual rent steps, then occupancy is driving, really, the rest of that with -- our rent growth has been kind of low single digits. So it's not contributing as much.
Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. So when you look at the guidance increase for the full year, would you say most of that is driven by the outperformance in the first half? Or would you say that you've allowed for any, what I would call, core fundamental acceleration in the second half?
Lisa Palmer: It is driven by the outperformance in the first half. Basically to get -- with a range of 3.5% to 4% from where we are today, growth in the second half would be 2% to 3%. And I, again, would point you to the same formula. If we're getting 1.25% to 1.5% on contractual rent steps, the rest is going to become -- is going to be coming from occupancy, with a limited contribution to -- from rent growth. And yes. And the range is -- we're sitting at 94.6% leased, and our full -- our range for the year is down 30 bps to up 40 bps. And that also contributes to the range of same-property NOI growth.
Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Did I ask my follow-up yet? All right, I'll just jump in. So Brian, just following up on that, when you talk about tenants being less picky and being willing to trade down in terms of space, at what point would you say that's going to start translating to higher leasing leverage in terms of your rent growth?
Brian M. Smith: Well, I think our rent growth is already showing the leverage that we're looking for. We had 90% of our markets generating positive rent growth. And I think we've shown you before that in terms of the number of leases, it's about 3/4 are positive and 2 years ago, it was 1/4. So we've just got still some markets more than anything -- I'd say still Sacramento, Central Valley and Arizona are the ones that are causing the drag. But I think until those markets start improving a lot more than they have, we're still going to see a little bit of the drag. In terms of the spaces, I think we did what can -- if you look at our rent growth for spaces less than 12 months vacant and compare it to the old method of doing it, there's a pretty big difference. And I think what you see there is, there's about 10 properties that had negative rent growth and the average being down for 40 months, in some cases, as long as 80 months. So the fact is that we're starting to see those spaces turning over and leasing that haven't leased in years. So I don't know when that specifically translates into a higher number, but it's obviously moving in the right direction.
Lisa Palmer: And that actually contributes a little bit to the point that Jeff was getting to. So we believe some much more difficult to lease space, a little bit less desirable, so obviously, those rents are going to be lower than our average rents in our portfolio.
Operator: Next, from Jefferies, we have Tayo Okusanya.
Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: First question, the potential merger between Kroger and Harris Teeter, I mean, I know it's still kind of early in the process, but do you expect that to involve any consolidation and if that could potentially have any impact to your portfolio?
Brian M. Smith: I think the impact is going to be -- none of us really knows what's going to happen, but if you take Kroger at their word that they're going to let Harris Teeter operate the way they've been operating, I think it's a win for everybody. Harris Teeter has a great brand in the Carolinas, in particular, and the only problem is they have fairly low margins. And I think when -- if Kroger allows them to keep their brand, keep operating as Harris Teeter where they have a loyal following in the Carolinas and then they bring their purchasing power and more savvy systems -- operating systems, I think it's going to be really good for our centers, it's going to be good for Harris Teeter and for Kroger. Up in D.C., I think it's less clear what's going to happen, but I think that's where they view their engine -- their growth engine being. And I'd only be speculating if I said what I thought was going to happen there, but if they would go into the market being #4, Shoppers Food Warehouse is #3. You could see that there might be a potential for something to happen there. And if that were the case, I think that also benefits our portfolio.
Lisa Palmer: And I would add that Kroger has a pretty good track record of assimilating acquired companies.
Martin E. Stein: In our conversations with them, they are very excited about the Harris Teeter brand and their ability, as Brian indicated, to improve efficiencies without adversely impacting the brand. So I think it's a win-win. Also, in the Carolinas, we have one store where there's significant amount of overlap, and that store is a Kroger store that is a bigger size than the Harris Teeter across the street, plus had a gas pad which is important to Kroger. So we feel pretty good about what the impact is going to be to us both in general and on a specific basis.
William I. Acheson - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. And then just one quick follow-up call. Lisa, I mean, in this quarter, did we kind of see the same trend of just move-outs you were expecting basically not happening? Was that also part of the occupancy gain this quarter?
Lisa Palmer: Yes. And I think Brian would love to share actually how we did perform move-outs. So I'm going to let Brian answer that.
Brian M. Smith: If you look at our move-outs, they are about average for a typical quarter. But if you break it down a little bit more, I think you'll see some very positive underlying strength. 170,000 of those -- square feet of those move-outs were for anchor tenants who are temporarily -- have temporarily moved out while we do redevelopments or they've moved out entirely while we bring in a new one. For example, in Texas, we terminated the Randall's lease on our Woodway Center. We'll be bringing in Whole Foods. That's showing up as a move-out. So if you strip those out, we only have 230,000 square feet of move-outs, which is, by far, the lowest amount of move-outs we've ever registered in a quarter. And then if you focus just on the small shops, it was the second lowest amount of move-outs we've ever had for shop tenants. So overall, that average number doesn't tell the whole picture. I think the whole picture is really positive.
Lisa Palmer: And as I've answered on the last question, that is what is driving the outperformance for the half -- first half of the year, which has been causing the raise for the second half.
Operator: Our next question comes from Cedrik Lachance with Green Street Advisors.
Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: I just wanted to go back to the same-store discussion. I'm sorry to beat that one. But just want to tie the numbers. You talked about 1.25%, 1.5% coming from rent steps. I guess, about -- from what I understand from your comments, about 150 basis points from timing on recoveries. And then...
Lisa Palmer: Recoveries, percentage rent and other income, all of them together.
Brian M. Smith: About 120.
Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: So it leaves us with about 200 basis points, which is likely -- primarily from occupancy. What's the increase in occupancy that's taken place? So not in the leased occupancy report but in the command store rent-paying occupancy, what's the increase that's taken place there over the last year?
Brian M. Smith: Bear with us one second, Cedrik. Okay. We're about 130 basis points of effective rent-paying occupancy growth.
Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And so does that contribute to the whole 200 basis points? Or is there a little more that came from, say, redevelopment as well?
Lisa Palmer: Redevelopment was just a small contribution for the first half of the year. Same-property NOI growth without redevelopment is 5%. So most of it is just coming from -- the amount -- the contribution to same property growth from occupancy change really does depend on the mix and on the average rents. But call it 130 basis points, if you take kind of our -- if you take a midpoint of $25 kind of average rent, that does contribute to full 200 basis points.
Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then just in regards to the rent negotiating process right now, where are you able to push most? Is it on the base rent? Is it on your ability to reduce tenant inducements and CapEx? Or is it on the amount of reimbursements that you can charge your tenants?
Brian M. Smith: Cedrik, really, it's all those. We're obviously pushing rents, as you can see, from our new rent growth numbers. Where we still -- remember, we're renewing or re-leasing 2008 spaces now. So where we do have renewals that were above market, what we're seeing is we're getting lower growth -- rent growth, but we are getting much better steps going forward. We're also getting -- able to negotiate percentage rent better than we used to from the anchors at artificial growth breakpoints lower than would normally be the case. Concessions for the most part are just not even an issue. The only place where the tenants right now are really pushing back would be on control of the space. The anchors want to make sure that they protect their sales through exclusives and things like that. But other than that, pretty much, the negotiations have turned totally in our favor.
Martin E. Stein: Yes, the prior year recovery is an indication of higher reimbursements that we're achieving from the tenants.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan.
Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Looking, I guess, at the guidance for Q3 FFO, it looks like it's expected to be, I think, it's $0.61 to $0.63. Can you reconcile the $0.67 and what causes the drop in Q2?
Lisa Palmer: Yes. Again, I'd start with the fact that we completed our reconciliations in the second quarter, and that's about $0.02. And then the rest is really timing of dispositions.
Operator: Our next question comes from Quentin Velleley from Citi.
Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Can you just speak broadly on the development pipeline? If you include the Miami project, you're getting close to $300 million. Your starts are up to $125 million to about $200 million this year. How should we think about the level of development you are comfortable with? And where ultimately could the pipeline move to?
Brian M. Smith: Sure. With Fontainebleau, we're at $128 million of starts for developments and redevelopments, which is where the low end of the range is. We feel really good that this year, we've got -- we'll get up somewhere near the high end. We've got $49 million worth of high probability ground-up developments, which we rate, in part, high probability because we're confident they're going to happen. We control the land, we have anchor tenant leases signed, but you never know. Something, I suppose, could happen. And we've got another $13 million of high probability redevelopments. So that's about $190 million. And then we've got another development that we think we're going to get, which -- that's not as certain. So that would take us up to -- slightly above $200 million high end of the guidance range. I think going forward, you can expect that we would do somewhere in the neighborhood of $100 million to $200 million of ground-up development, depending on the size of the projects. If we have a bunch of Grand Ridge Plazas or Fontainebleaus, that number is going to be large. Redevelopments and expansions, renovations, I would think that would be in the $50 million to $100 million range. So I think somewhere in the $150 million to $300 million range.
Martin E. Stein: With a good portion of that being redevelopments and expansions.
Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. Just going back to Jeff's question on the new leases into -- in the second quarter. The TI CapEx was up about $10, and it sounded like there was 1 lease that drove that increase. Can you give us a sense of what TIs would have been on the new leases if you excluded that 1 lease?
Brian M. Smith: There were actually about 4 leases that stand out, Quentin. I mentioned the daycare center. That was, I think, about $78 a foot. It was a big number. And then we had PetSmart leases. I mentioned that use -- whether it's PETCO, any of the pet supply guys, because they have fish tanks, they have a lot of electrical in there, they're going to have big TIs. And then we had Corner Bakery and a -- what was the other one? I think it was a salon, wasn't it? Yes. The salon. So I don't -- we could probably get back to you as to what the number would be. I don't have it.
Lisa Palmer: Yes. I mean, I guess it would be very much in line with historical averages.
Brian M. Smith: Yes. Because we're only slightly above the historical averages this quarter. I think it would probably take you right down to it, maybe slightly below.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Just a question on the leasing activity sort of broadening out and seeing better activity across the board there. I mean, can you just share what the percentage of leases this quarter had roll-ups and how that compares to recent quarters?
Martin E. Stein: You mean increased rents?
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Yes.
Martin E. Stein: The percentage of it was like 75%.
Brian M. Smith: Well, yes. It was like -- in terms of positive rent growth, it was about 75%.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And how does that compare to sort of recent trends?
Brian M. Smith: On the long-term trend compared to -- starting 2 years ago, it's much better. It was about 25% of our leases had positive rent growth. Now it's about 75%. So quarter-to-quarter may bounce around a little bit, but I think it's slightly lower than it was last quarter. But, again, long-term trend, we're seeing more and more and more leases with positive rent growth.
Lisa Palmer: And, again, attributing some of that to some of the space that has been vacant for quite a long time.
Brian M. Smith: Actually, the 73% is wrong. It was 60% last quarter, 48% the quarter before. So over the last 3 quarters for the spaces vacant less than 12 months, it's been getting stronger.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then just a question, just going back to the commentary about the cap rate environment. And you haven't seen it yet in the B assets in terms of cap rates going up but could -- reasonably could go up. Does that cause you to want to pull forward any other dispositions? I know you raised the guidance for some visibility on some deals. But any desire to pull forward some deals?
Martin E. Stein: We'll continue to be opportunistic and continue to look at our portfolio. And we've made significant progress on those assets that we prioritize for sale, and we're about to start that process right now. And, I guess, Brian indicated, there were 2 assets where we had meaningful leasing progress, one of which we replaced the anchor and we pulled those forward. So that's the kind of decisions that we'll make. I mean, the team had already targeted these for sale for a while, and we -- but they want -- we wanted to wait until we had resolved an anchor issue. And we did in the past quarter. And it looks like we're either under contract or about to go on a contract on 2 centers that we targeted for sale.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets.
Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: You guys are kind of leading the pack in terms of number of new developments you're doing, and usually, what we hear is -- from the others, from your competitors in the public world is that the rents just don't make sense at this point. What are you guys seeing, I guess, that is leading to -- it looks like a pretty good acceleration in development?
Brian M. Smith: I think -- we had, what? $150 million of ground-up starts last year, Rich. It's not meaningfully more. I just don't agree with that. I think what you've seen is, and we continue to see, is the place where it does pencil is in the better demographic areas where there's much more purchasing power, a combination of average household income and population density. That's where the retailers can generate the sales, and therefore, they're willing to pay the kind of rents that we need. So in terms of why I think we're getting more than our share, some of it is market demand, but like I said, it really is in those better areas. Some of it is financial strength because in those areas, you've got to -- you've got to have some real staying power. I think if you look at our Juanita Tate development, that thing has been -- we've been working on entitlements for 19 years. And Dublin, which is coming down the pike for next year, you're facing lawsuits, lots of money. I think one of the things is that we kept good people during the downturn because it takes years to get these projects through the pipeline to find them, to entitle them. I think some of it is just success breeds success. It gives you credibility with sellers, particularly joint venture partners when they can see how much you've done. We're working on, I mentioned, 12 Whole Foods developments or redevelopments. Yesterday, we were talking to a landowner in a great area who wants to do a development with Whole Foods, and he knows that we've done probably more than anybody. And then I think a lot of it is a skill set. Avon is a property that we're going to close on later this year and start in Chicago, and I think that one -- if you'd ask me about a year ago, I wouldn't have put any money on that we'd actually persevere in getting our entitlements. But the team did an unbelievable job on that one. And I think, finally, it's relationships. We've got a property that we're going to be starting next year in an area that is a true work, live, play environment, again, a Whole Foods development. And that one, there are relationships with the owners of that company and Regency that go way back. One of them is Hap's fraternity brother. So I think the combination of those things, really, is what's helping us succeed.
Martin E. Stein: And I will say, even though we are seeing a pickup in the amount of new developments occurring, it's still well below historic averages. So there's a limited amount of opportunity there. But we -- our focus is extremely sharpened. We, so to speak, have learned our lessons. We're developing those centers that makes sense for the long term, with great anchors in great locations, primarily in-fill or in planned unit developments when it's suburban. And secondly, I think -- and we've been talking about kind of $100 million to $200 million or in the $150 million range. The pickup that we're seeing is more on the development and redevelopment side. And hopefully, I think we've taken that from, say, $10 million to $15 million in renovations a year to hopefully will be in the $25 million to $50 million and maybe even more than that on a go-forward basis or on an annual start basis.
Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay, great. Great Answer. Then on the acquisition side of things, is there any interest from your partners, your co-investment partners in selling their shares or in you approaching them to buy their shares?
Martin E. Stein: I think the opportunities there from our standpoint are pretty limited from what we understand. For the most part, our partners have -- other than the fund, which we -- which is under contract for sale, I think the opportunities there from Oregon and CalSTRS, and First Washington and CalPERS are pretty limited. You never know.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust.
Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Could you talk a little bit about -- if you've seen -- you guys have mentioned the strong retail demand, and it's reflected in your occupancy. Has that translated into your secondary assets or markets at all?
Brian M. Smith: Yes. One of the things that we are seeing this quarter, we mentioned a little bit on the call, is just how broad the demand is getting. I mean, some of our weaker markets like Michigan, some of our best leasing activity this quarter happened up there. We did about 12 -- I think we signed 8,000 square feet of leases in Fenton, our project in Fenton, and 4,000, I think, have been signed since then. Our State Street project up there, the inline space is 100% leased. In the housing-dependent markets, we've got, for the first time, about 6 properties that have hit 100% leased that struggled during the downturn. So I think we're seeing it in weaker spaces within the center. I'll just give you another example there. We have a BJ's up in Massachusetts. And they went out, and we found a replacement tenant to take about 2/3 of the space, leaving about 30,000 square feet in the back. We actually got somebody to take that backspace. So there's lots of examples of improvement in housing-dependent markets. Weaker markets, Arizona is seeing a lot more activity. The rents are still soft, but you're seeing much more activity than we ever did before.
Martin E. Stein: Let me just remind you, we have 3 centers in Arizona. Now we sold one and down 2 in Michigan. So it's a very limited amount of our space and even becoming more so.
Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: But still, your occupancy growth that you've been reporting, is that still predominantly your better markets, better assets? Or has that actually, from a financial standpoint, shifted?
Brian M. Smith: That's what the majority of our space is, so yes, that's where it's all coming from.
Martin E. Stein: But it's across the board. And as Brian mentioned, we're seeing it in all markets.
Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And second question. I understand that class A, B+ assets haven't changed much in terms of cap rate. But given your, I guess, significant development or redevelopment pipeline, have you guys internally changed the way you view IRRs or, I guess, more specifically, exit cap rates? And have those changed to reflect in some way the change in treasury rates?
Martin E. Stein: We're still -- from a development standpoint, depending on where the development is located, where the market is, et cetera, we're looking for returns in the 7.5% to 8.5% range. And from an acquisition standpoint, we're looking for total returns. That's growth, plus going in return in excess of 8%, and at least having growth that's going to be in excess of 2.5% so that the properties we're buying is going to be accretive to our long-term NOI growth rate.
Lisa Palmer: And both of those scenarios that Hap described would have IRRs at or slightly above our weighted average cost of capital.
Martin E. Stein: Particularly developments.
Lisa Palmer: Yes, the developments would be much above, acquisitions at or slightly above.
Operator: Our last question comes from Jonathan Pong with Robert W. Baird.
Jonathan Pong - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Just a quick question on the dispositions. I see Anthem Marketplace, you guys got pretty good price on that, 5 9. Is there some upside that you might be leaving on the table there? Or what's the disposition thesis, I guess, on that asset?
Brian M. Smith: I saw the press release that the buyer thinks there's upside. We wouldn't have sold it if we thought there was. We had an anchor tenant, The Grocer [ph]. The sales were weak, they were not trending right and we thought that was -- represents some significant risk for us. That particular property is, I think, at the outer reach of the market, if you will. And frankly, I think it's not really that well-positioned compared to some properties in the market. So beauty is in the eye of the beholder and, for us, it represented risk and no upside, but...
Martin E. Stein: We hope the buyer does well, like we always have, but we have no regrets about the sale. And as indicated on the 2 properties that we're now bringing to market, we waited until we were able to do a substantial amount of leasing before we sold. We're always making those evaluations. But look, we've sold a lot of property, and we hope every one of our buyers does extremely well with their investments.
Jonathan Pong - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Got it. And then following up on Juanita Tate. I think you guys mentioned it earlier, but can you talk a little bit about how that development sort of plays out in terms of the sweet spot of what you guys like to develop and own? And I think the household income number there is much lower than what you guys typically do. Is this just sort of a vestige of what you guys have been working on for the last 19 years like you mentioned? Or is this something that we could see more of in the future?
Martin E. Stein: Yes. I mean, the key thing there is when you look at the purchasing power there, I mean, what we shoot for is an excess of $200,000. That's average household income, plus population density. And there are, I think, 450,000 people, Brian?
Brian M. Smith: Yes.
Martin E. Stein: And even though the household income is typically below our $100,000 average, the purchasing power there is substantial. We've got a great grocer who's going to do very, very good. It is -- it does happen to be a presale because that's part of the deal, but we would be happy to own that asset long-term. It's got a Starbucks Coffee in there. I mean, the lineup of side shop retailers is excellent.
Brian M. Smith: Yes, I mean, you got CVS there, Panda, Starbucks, Little Caesars, Chase Bank, yogurt, dental. It is lower income, but I'll tell you what, not only does it have the population Hap talked about, but if you look at the Hispanic grocers in the area, there has not been a center built in there in 15 years because of the obvious high barriers. They all do about $800 a square foot, and not one of them that you can point to has good real estate fundamentals. Usually, they're not on the main street. They don't have good access. They don't have good visibility. They've got really bad physical property. And the other thing is, in those Hispanic areas, we have not changed our strategy, but I don't think you can ignore the demographics. It's not only the fastest-growing part of the population, but they spend so much more on groceries. The average Hispanic household spends 46% more on groceries than the general population per week, and they visit the grocery store 3x as often. So I think that is more where the priority is to spend money. And with the anchors we got there attracting the best retailers, that's also true in Fontainebleau.
Martin E. Stein: Getting back to a prior question because I indicated 19 years, I think it was Richard's question, I mean, having the team, the capabilities and the persistence and the dedication, this is a key part of our business. And if and when we do it right, we create substantial value. A lot of hard work.
Operator: That does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to our speakers for any closing remarks.
Lisa Palmer: Prior to turning it back over to Hap, I'd like to close the loop on the TI question, excluding the 2 anomalies. So if you exclude the daycare center that Brian talked about, as well as the PetSmart, the TI for new deals would be $5.31.
Brian M. Smith: Yes, I think $6.75 is about where it usually averages.
Martin E. Stein: Thank you. We appreciate your participation in the call. Everyone, have a great day. I know it's a busy day, and we thank you for your attention.
Operator: That does conclude today's call. We appreciate your participation.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Regency Centers Corporation First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Mas. Please go ahead, sir.
Mike Mas: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me this morning are Hap Stein, Brian Smith, Lisa Palmer, and Chris Leavitt. Before we start, I'd like to address forward-looking statements that may be discussed on the call. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. I'll now turn the call over to Hap Stein.
Martin E. Stein: Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. As you'll hear from Lisa and Brian, we continue to make good progress in all aspects of our business. Our operating fundamentals remain strong and our portfolio is realizing the benefits from its inherent high quality, particularly the infiltrate areas that enjoy supply constraints and substantial buying power from average household incomes and population densities that totaled $200,000, as well as highly-productive grocers with sales that averaged $27 million and over $500 per square foot; robust tenant demand from retailers, from restaurants and from service providers, combined with a limited amount of new supply; replacement of weaker tenants that were weeded out by either the recession or our operations team and we're replacing them with stronger and better operators; enhancements to the portfolio in developments, acquisitions and sales during the last 3 years; a significant amount of leasing and net absorption accomplished last year, specifically in our smaller-sized spaces; and the positive impact from distinguishing the appearance in merchandising our centers to hands-on maintenance and well-conceived redevelopments and renovations. The result was 5.1% growth in NOI in the first quarter of this year. Our in-process developments were nearly 90% leased at quarter-end, which is especially satisfying given that construction, while on schedule, is only 50% complete. Furthermore, the pipeline of high-quality infill developments is encouraging and the potential for value-added redevelopments is growing. Regarding our ongoing portfolio and NOI enhancement efforts, we are seeing an increase in demand for noninstitutional quality centers. And although there are very few A-quality shopping centers in the market, our team is working diligently behind the scenes to source acquisitions. And I expect their efforts in our 2 dozen attractive target markets to produce some gems that will meet our stringent criteria for quality and growth. Our balance sheet is rock solid and the markets for raising capital and selling shopping centers are favorable by any historic standard. As these conditions won't remain in effect forever, we will continue to take advantage of opportunities to cost-effectively fund our developments, redevelopments and acquisitions. Brian, Lisa and I recognize that a positive single quarter or even a year does not meet Regency's standard for success. Much still needs to be accomplished, particularly meeting our near-term objective of 95% leased. We remain confident that the portfolio will soon return to the milestone -- that milestone and repeat our 1999 to 2008 track record of consistent annual NOI growth that was never below 2.5%. To sum it up, Regency is well-positioned to sustain growth and shareholder value. Lisa?
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Hap. Good morning, everyone. As Hap stated, we are pleased with our first quarter results which outpaced projections. The continued strength in operating fundamentals, coupled with higher recoveries and percentage rent, lifted net operating income by 5.1%. This level of NOI was the primary driver of the $0.02 beat on the high-end of our first quarter guidance. With respect to capital markets activity, we issued 1.2 million shares during the quarter through our ATM program. This resulted in net proceeds of just over $62 million, which is pre-funding the $350 million of forecasted new investment activity, which includes the cost to complete our in-process developments and redevelopments, and development starts and acquisitions. This issuance is consistent with our strategy to cost-effectively fund new investment activity. The additional benefit is the further improvement of our healthy balance sheet metrics, bringing us closer to our targets. Subsequent to quarter-end, we entered into an agreement to sell all the assets owned by our closed-end fund in which Regency owns a 20% interest. We expect that the sale will close in the third quarter, but the timing is contingent on the lender consent process of 6 of the 9 assets encumbered by secured mortgages. Once closed, the partnership will dissolve. Lastly, I'd like to walk through the revisions to our full-year guidance for 2013. In response to the continued strength in operating fundamentals, we now expect same-property NOI growth, excluding termination fees, to be in the range of 2.5% to 3.2%. It is important to note that approximately 2/3 of the same-property NOI growth in the first quarter did come from base rent. The other drivers, other income, recoveries and percentage rent are expected to normalize over the remainder of the year. Additionally, although the impact of redevelopments added 30 basis points in the first quarter, we expect that ramp up and redevelopments later in the year will take some NOI off-line and will moderate 2013 growth from this point forward. I'm really looking forward to realizing the benefits of this activity in future earnings. Additionally, we increased guidance for dispositions by $50 million at the midpoint. This was somewhat impacted by the agreement to sell the fund's assets as our initial guidance included only a probability that the properties would sell by the end of the year. As you'll hear from Brian in just a little bit, it was a mostly a result of the increased visibility of our development and redevelopment pipeline, as well as the improvement in demand and pricing for shopping centers. Based on these market conditions, we believe there's an opportunity to dispose of lower growth assets as part of our funding strategy, and remain consistent with our goal to enhance our ability to deliver same-property growth on a long-term basis in excess of 2.5%. Combined, all these factors result in a raise of $0.02 to the bottom end and $0.01 to the top end of the raises for both core FFO and FFO per share. Brian?
Brian M. Smith: Thank you, Lisa. Good morning, everyone. In the last 5 quarters, our portfolio has performed at a level consistent with Regency's high standards. I believe this is a testament to its inherent quality, robust tenant demand, coupled with a limited amount of new supply and the significant strides that our talented team is making, enhancing the quality of the portfolio at the property and tenant levels. We leased nearly 1 million square feet of space this quarter, roughly 1/4 of which were new leases. While the volumes were down compared to last year, remember that 2012 was a record year for leasing. It would be difficult to sustain those levels, especially as we approach 95% leased. That said, tenant demand in the leasing pipeline remains strong, so there's still room to run. As a matter of fact, leasing velocity has consistently increased every month this year, including April, with a vast majority being small-shop space. While we did experience a seasonal decline in occupancy, it was not historically significant. And a good deal of our move-outs were the result of the operations team taking a much more proactive approach to evicting weaker tenants in order to upgrade them in terms of credit and merchandising. What's more, pricing power is returning in nearly every market as can be seen in our rent growth, which is positive 5.4% for the first quarter including almost 15% on new leases. Our team is working hard to push rents and is now benefiting from the leverage to do so. As a matter of fact, over 80% of the new leases showed increases in the average small-shops rent signed during the quarter of $28 per square foot, was above pre-recession levels. Turning now to developments, the $190 million of total in-process developments are already approaching 90% leased, with projected returns on deployed capital of approximately 88%. This is despite the lower returns and higher costs at Grand Ridge. Returns for the superior centers are vastly higher than if acquired and will represent value creation in excess of $70 million. The pipeline for new development bodes well for our ability to start close to $150 million both this year and in 2014. In addition, we would expect to annually add another $25 million to $40 million worth of developments and expansions. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we began construction on the first phase of Shops on Main located along the main retail quarter of a Chicago suburb. 148,000 square foot community center has a solid lineup with 4 anchors and letters of interest or viable interest for much of the side shop and out-parcel space. With this start, we'll be putting nearly 1/3 of our remaining land held for development into production. On the acquisition front, the number of high-quality shopping centers on the market is down substantially. For those that do come to market, there is intense competition with multiple offers being made. As a result, our team continues focus on off-market transactions. We have a modest pipeline of opportunities in our 2 dozen target markets where the teams had a good deal of success in prior periods. As of today, we are under contract on $30 million of acquisitions. At the same time, there is an increase in demand for noninstitutional properties which is narrowing the price gap between higher and lesser quality shopping centers. If this holds true, it should certainly help us on the disposition side and we got a taste of that better pricing after quarter-end with the sale of Deer Springs, marking our official exit from the Las Vegas market. We received multiple offers and ultimately accepted pricing in a 6.75% cap rate. In closing, the positive start to the year gives me confidence that we can accomplish our key objectives for 2013. Hap?
Martin E. Stein: Thanks, Brian, and thank you, Lisa. In closing, I feel that the first quarter was a real good way to start the year. I continue to be gratified by the dedicated efforts and creativity that our team brings to the table each and every day to execute our strategy. Much heavy lifting needs to be done, but we are poised to grow net asset value per share and shareholder value. We thank you for your time, and welcome your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Christy McElroy with UBS.
Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Lisa, if I think about your Q1 FFO of $0.64 and your Q2 guidance of $0.62 to $0.64, what are some of the factors that are built into that range that could cause your FFO to be down sequentially, whether it's timing of move-outs or something else? And what impact is assumed for captive insurance profits on other income? I think, that's a Q2 thing, right?
Lisa Palmer: I'll start with the -- actually, the run rate. With $0.64 and then the range of $0.62 to $0.64, there isn't that much of a sequential decline. But again, I'll come back to the fact that were 5.1% same-property growth for this quarter, and we're expecting our range for the remainder of the year is 2.5% to 3.2%, so we are expecting some of it to moderate. That would be -- that would have a negative impact. At the same time, we would expect to have lower G&A for the quarter because, as you'll note, year-over-year we're about $2 million higher, and that's almost directly related to a lower amount of development overhead capitalization. And as Brian mentioned, the Schererville start as well as some other potential expected starts, we would expect capitalization to normalize and so the north -- the run rate to hit the G&A of $60 million to $63 million for the year, will occur in the second quarter. With regards to other income, yes, you're correct. I mean, we used to recognize the captive insurance income in one quarter. We're now recognizing that on a monthly basis, so it's going to be more even throughout the year. In 2012, our other income was north of $10 million. The first quarter of this year was, I think, I believe, was like about $2.2 million. So it's -- that's a pretty good run rate. So we would expect that to be flat. The difference being the first quarter of last year, we were less than $1 million. So we just had an easier comp for the first quarter.
Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And then Brian, with regard to ground-up development starts, can you talk a little bit about the markets that you're targeting, the anchors that are driving some of those starts and what kind of yields are you looking at? And sort of what's changed over the last year or 2 with regard to your confidence in leasing up the small-shop space?
Brian M. Smith: Sure. Well, if you talk about -- I'm sorry, what?
Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: This leasing of small-shop space on development.
Brian M. Smith: Okay. We'll start with the anchors. You talked about the anchors. In terms of what we're working on right now, that are at least, I would say, in the high probability category, we have 6 or 7 Whole Foods projects we're working on, actually, about 3 of those are redevelopments. So on ground-up, it'd be 3 or 4 Whole Foods, 3 Publix, we've got a Mariano's that we hope to start this year in Chicago, Northgate, a Hispanic grocery in urban L.A. and then possibly a King Sooper and a Fresh Market. In terms of pipeline, we feel really confident in our ability to hit within the guidance and returns right now look like they will be about 8% for the year. And if you look at that on an incremental basis, because Schererville is coming out of land held, it would be about 9%. And then in terms of what's giving us confidence, we're building in infill markets, we're building in Washington, D.C., Miami, coastal California, Seattle. So large high barrier markets where there's limited new supply coming on anywhere. But in those particular markets, it's very tight, there's strong retailer demand and we're rightsizing the amount of shop space we build. So I think we mentioned on the call that we are approaching 90% on our in-process developments, even though it's only about 50% funded. And really, that's consistent with what we've done since the downturn. It's just the rightsizing and building in the right areas.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Nate Isbee with Stifel.
Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Just 2 quick questions. You had mentioned that the redevelopment in the rest of the year is negatively impacting same-store NOI. Can you quantify like how much that is impacting, let's say, the normalized base without the redevelopment where your same-store NOI would come in?
Lisa Palmer: Sure. The first quarter was the 4.8%. As I mentioned, it was a 30 basis points impact, without redevelopments. And for the full year forecast, we're expecting it basically to have 0 impact. So it's going to go from the 30 basis point positive down to flat.
Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: So there's no negative impact there where you've taken...
Lisa Palmer: Not negative. It's just that we're going to lose the positive impact in the 5.1%.
Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then just finally, on the development, you talked about renewed opportunities here with the Whole Foods, et cetera. How many of these deals, would you say, are old deals that you're taking out of storage versus new opportunities that are arising at this point?
Brian M. Smith: So Nate, I'd look at our total pipeline for 2013 and 2014, and there's only 1 or maybe 2, there'll be 1 next year. So they're almost all new opportunities, except for on the redevelopment front.
Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. So these are deals that you have newly-sourced. It's not even like you were monitoring them, working on them without taking the land down prior to the crash?
Brian M. Smith: Well, not entirely. We'll start one here this year in urban L.A. that I mentioned with the Northgate. And that one, I started working on 20 years ago before coming to Regency. So it's been something we've been working on a long, long, long time. But I would say, you're right. The vast majority of these are all newly-sourced. But renting newly, we've probably been working on all of them for at least a minimum of 2 years, maybe 1 is new this year.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets.
Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: It seemed like there was a lot of interest from big-box retailers, grocers, et cetera, to expand and open stores, wasn't enough good space. And so looking again at developments. I mean, are these guys willing to pay the rent now, is that what's changing? Or are you seeing something interesting, I guess, from a more macro development standpoint about what's going on out there?
Brian M. Smith: Rich, as I look at kind of what the reasons are for the lack of development, there's several things. First of all, the anchors had many options, I think, is what -- where you're headed. And that second-generation space was -- it was plentiful and it was far cheaper. The new developments didn't pencil in most areas because the retailers were really being really careful about their sales projections. The lack at housing growths obviously prevented people from expanding out in the suburbs. But even if there was housing growth, the retailers aren't opening stores out there. They are opting for the infill, and of course, capital was tough. And I'd say what's been changing lately is the second-generation space is clearly not an option. The retailers are getting more aggressive on rents. Although they're still focused on infill and in the areas where we want to develop, the cities are still very, very tough in terms of the fees and the other costs. Though housing is improving, again, that's not what's driving the new development. So I think going forward, what is happening, is the retailers do want deals. They are much more aggressive both in terms of the number of stores they want to open and the rents they'll pay, but it has to be the right areas. And in those -- I think that's what driving it mostly. I think in the areas, again, where we want to develop though, you better have a lot of capital because, as I mentioned, the cities are tough, the approvals take a long time, there's no lay-ups there and you better be prepared for the long-haul on the redevelopment expenses.
Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay, so you're saying, Brian, that more previously, the key retailers probably wouldn't pay the rents or didn't want to bump up their rental expectations. Now, maybe they are willing to do that so we could see maybe a beginning of a boom in development again?
Brian M. Smith: No. I think what I was trying to say, Rich, is they are getting more aggressive on their rents, but still in the areas where they can summon a lot of purchasing power. So again, it remains the infill more affluent areas. And the ability to get those is not great because, again, a small developer, one, doesn't have the capability to pursue all the predevelopment costs and risks that you have to do, and capital is still tight. So what you're seeing, in terms of development out there -- we just had a meeting with about 3 of the leading retailers, anchors who would drive developments, and talked to them about them about what they're seeing across the board. And what they were saying is the opportunities for the grocers are often in the mixed-use projects as part of multifamily. One of the leading anchors is doing a lot of self-development and they see a lot of standalone. So where there's opportunities to -- there's just not that many opportunities for them to get new stores, so when they have the right kind of opportunity, they will step-up and pay the rents. So I think you will see more development, but until the banks loosen up and the retailers start going in less difficult places to develop, it'll still be pretty muted, I think.
Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay, good. I got you. And then on redevelopment, I wasn't sure I understood exactly. Were you saying that there would be an additional $40 million, you thought, of redevelopment-type activity on top of the basic development starts you think you'll do?
Martin E. Stein: $25 million to $40 million of redevelopments. So ground up is what we've been talking about. On top of that, redevelopments $25 million to $40 million.
Lisa Palmer: I'll just add from a more technical standpoint, we've modified our guidance on, I think it's the third page from the end on the supplemental where we give our starts for the year, to now include redevelopments. We didn't restate the past years, if you will. So the $125 million to $175 million of new expected starts in 2013 includes redevelopments.
Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And what does that look like, I guess, going forward? Do you guys have a lot of redevelopment opportunities? Is that something you see getting bigger? Or I guess how do you look at that?
Brian M. Smith: We do have a lot of opportunities. They aren't that big in any individual one. And what they are, they're everything from, like you're seeing in -- like we did at Heritage in Southern California last year, which is a major renovation of the entire center, to other situations where we're doing a second phase on a development that maybe we started several years ago, to doing just some creative things, like we're doing at Carriage Gate in Tallahassee where we got control of the Winn-Dixie box that had been subleased to T.J. Maxx. We got -- that unleashed a whole new redevelopment that allowed us to move out a tax collection agency and move in at Trader Joe's. And so a lot of that kind of stuff, each one is different. Sometimes it's adding GLA, sometimes it's just creating value in other manners.
Lisa Palmer: And the $25 million to $40 million is a significant increase from what we have been doing in the past years.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan.
Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: A couple of questions. I guess on Deer Springs, the cap rate, was 6.75% below the 7% to 8% range you have in for guidance. When you're thinking about the, I guess the Regency retail partners sale, other stuff that may be in the queue, does it feel like you could be at the bottom end of that range in terms of the cap rates?
Brian M. Smith: Michael, I think we absolutely could. It's possible.
Lisa Palmer: But there is a range for a reason, as I kick Brian under the table.
Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then maybe sticking with something on the JV topic. I mean, you have a JV unwind sale in the process, and is that just kind of a coincidence or why now? Is there something, maybe a little bit bigger picture, going on where you're trying to unwind some of this, shrink that business and bring more on balance sheet? Or is it just pure coincidence?
Lisa Palmer: It really is a pure coincidence. The Charter Hall that they've been attempting to exit the U.S. this, we're in the third year or fourth year of their strategy, and it's taken that long to do it. And I think you'll recall the fund was originally an open-end fund that was put in place to be the takeout for our community center developments. And unfortunately, we know what happened with developments and how much the leasing slowed down even with what we had in process. So with the partners in that fund, we converted it to a closed-end fund and have really been working on an exit strategy ever since.
Martin E. Stein: Although it is a coincidence, we do think that reducing the number of partnerships is a good outcome. We loved our partners, but I think that reducing the number makes more sense.
Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. I mean, so there could be visibility to seeing a few more announcements like this over the next couple of years?
Lisa Palmer: No. There's no business -- no, we're...
Martin E. Stein: We wouldn't expect any changes to what we -- with the partnerships...
Lisa Palmer: Hap's referring to these specific 2.
Martin E. Stein: These 2, which should take us down to 4 in size.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Paul Morgan with Morgan Stanley.
Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Just on the -- you mentioned like 13 or 14 grocery-anchored projects. Are those -- I mean, is that what constitutes the -- I mean, if I'm trying to reconcile that with kind of the $150 million number in '13 and '14. I mean, are those -- if you did all of those, would the number be higher? Are there any projects that are kind of not sort of neighborhood grocery-anchored, but maybe more larger format, kind of power centers? I think those are all questions I need.
Brian M. Smith: We didn't have what I would call a power center. The one we started in first quarter is a little atypical. Again, that's Schererville, Shops on Main, that's coming out of land held, and that, right now, does not have a grocery. And it's got Gordmans Department Store, TJX's HomeGoods concept, Ross and DSW Shoes. There is a possibility that a high-end grocer will go there. The question is, what's the kind of value and whether we want to do it. But to get to the numbers we're talking about, there are a couple of larger projects, Schererville would be one of them. And we have another one coming in South Florida, that will be a -- it'll have some community anchored-type centers or community anchors, but it will also have a neighborhood component with the leading grocer. So every one of the developments has a grocer right now planned for it, except for the one that just started. And as I said, we may put one in, in the later phase.
Martin E. Stein: And from a size and scope related to new developments, I think that, that was all included as far as the pipeline for '13 and '14.
Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: All those projects are basically kind of in those numbers when you get to $150 million per year.
Martin E. Stein: Yes.
Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. Great. And then I think you talked about this a little bit, maybe just get a little bit more clarity. Kind of what really drove the boost in same-store NOI sequentially from last quarter to this quarter, as you look in the year? What did you see that came in differently or stronger?
Lisa Palmer: Again, approximately 2/3 of it did come from base rent. That's a result of the leasing that we did last year. Our percent rent-paying tenants was up pretty significantly.
Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Wouldn't you have already known that, though?
Lisa Palmer: I'm sorry, Paul?
Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Wouldn't you have already known that last quarter? I'm trying to see kind of what is the delta and why you raised guidance?
Lisa Palmer: Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were asking to explain how we go from 5.1% to 2.5% to 3.2%. It's just a matter of we're 4 months into the year. We have more clarity. Move-outs are always the things that are the most uncertain. And we had a lower-than-expected number in the first quarter. It's as simple as that.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Samit Parikh with ISI Group.
Samit Parikh - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Lisa, just a question. How does the bond market play into your funding plans for this year comparatively to using the ATM? Are you thinking about sort of something similar to what some of your peers did in terms of raising a larger -- raising a $250 million type bond issuance to pay off or call a later bond but since the rates are lower today, it's sort of a neutral on FFO when you raise cash?
Lisa Palmer: You may recall from our last -- the last quarter call and also the K that we did put into place a couple of forward-starting slots to mitigate and to lock in the interest rates of today. So we would have no need to do it early. And so the...
Martin E. Stein: That's for '14 and '15 maturities.
Lisa Palmer: For '14 and '15 maturities. So we -- unless something changes in terms of other opportunity -- investment opportunities, we wouldn't expect to hit the bond market until April 2014.
Samit Parikh - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. That make sense. And then I guess thinking about sort of strategically, how you envision the size of the company going forward, and kind of continuous deleveraging that you're doing here by using your ATM, et cetera. Are you positioning the company, in a way, to make sure you're always flexible for maybe a very large scale acquisition that may come to the market? Or are you -- do you not envision that for Regency? Are you happy with sort of the asset size of the company today?
Martin E. Stein: Well, just kind of in general, our view on size is that bigger isn't necessarily better, and bigger isn't necessarily bad. So the key thing is growing intrinsic value per share. I think that our funding strategies, to me, is basically how do we cost-effectively fund our current and potential and visible future investment activity. And I think today, we got 2 attractive alternatives and that being some low growth assets and last quarter, we tapped the ATM program. So there's 2 levers that we've used in the past, and I think an outgrowth of that cost-effective funding strategy is that it has improved our financial ratios, and as a result, the balance sheet has gotten stronger. And we do want to have a balance sheet that can take advantage of those opportunities when they appear, where there continue growth of development program, or attractive, high-growth acquisitions. And if there's another financial crisis, we want to be able to not only survive that, but also thrive in a period like that.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Sorry to kill the same-store NOI question, but I just want to recap here. So the 5.1%, 2/3 of that is from better AVR which sounds like it was lower move-outs than expected, and then the other 1/3 of the growth was sort of CAM-related and percentage rent-related. But then, I guess, since the occupancy guidance is the same, are we to assume that you're just taking the move-outs that didn't happen in the first quarter and you're moving them into the balance of the year? Is that -- and I guess, are the expectations for the balance of the year different from what they were previously?
Lisa Palmer: First of all, we -- I said 2/3 of it was from AVR, which isn't just necessarily from lower move-outs, it's from the leasing that we completed. So we have a higher percent rent-paying. The difference from the last question is, that was expected. What was better than we expected was the lower number of move-outs which caused us to raise our guidance. And I mean, that's -- so that's the only change. And the other things are some of the things that were in the first quarter only, that will normalize during the year, which is moderating growth. It was the timing of percentage rent and recovery rate and the lower comp and other income. So as those moderate, that brings us back down to the 2.5%...
Martin E. Stein: And it is hard to predict timing on move-outs. And that's gotten -- I mean, and our team is being much more proactive as far as, as Brian mentioned, as far as evicting weaker tenants or even signing leases and assuming that we are able to move out those tenants.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. And then just going to the [indiscernible], the noninstitutional is seeing some increased demand. That's something we've heard from a number of folks over the course of the quarter here. Can you just comment, what is the spread you're seeing right now between institutional and noninstitutional from a cap rate perspective?
Brian M. Smith: I'd say about 175 basis points.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Spread. About -- so like, if you compare that to a year ago, that'll be more like 200, 250, something like that?
Brian M. Smith: I think more like about 200.
Martin E. Stein: 250, yes.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: So -- okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then I think you had also commented that just in terms of the development demand, it's really still in the infill area and you're seeing some willingness on the retailers' part to pay higher rents for the right locations in the infill markets. But we've also heard from others that they're also starting to -- some of the increased demand in the noninstitutional seems to be that there's more leasing activity in that area, and maybe some of these guys that are not as willing to pay up are taking more the noninstitutional space as opposed to paying for developments. I mean, is that consistent with what you're seeing? It seemed like your comments were maybe a little different from that.
Brian M. Smith: Well, again, it's going to depend where. We are working on a property in one of the -- is in one of the better markets in the San Francisco Bay area. And we've got restaurants and shops lining up to pay $60 a square foot, and we have probably 2x the amount of demand as we have supply. So in that one, clearly, stepping forward and rather be at that center than they would in the other noninstitutional ones.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And just maybe some final, or just clean-up kind of questions. One, did you guys kind of see what the commence rate was this period? I don’t know if I missed it or not.
Martin E. Stein: Vincent, that's -- this is now #4. If you like to get back in the queue, we'd love to have you back in there.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Tom Lesnick with Robert Baird.
Thomas J. Lesnick - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: I'm just standing in for Paula. Honing in on percentage rents for a minute, what percentage of your small-shop tenants are currently paying percentage rent and how many more are close to hitting their breakpoints?
Brian M. Smith: I don't have that number for you, but I would say on the small shops, it would be a very small amount. What happens is we set those, the natural breakpoint, which would just be the rent divided by the percentage factor. So if it's $20 rent and that's a 2%, you divide the $20 by the 2% and that becomes your breakpoint. Most retailers cannot hit that for several years. There is an exception. We have an anchor in a redevelopment we did last year that hit it big time, first year. Typically, it's your anchors' going to hit it because they will have much longer term leases, whereas the small shops have short terms.
Thomas J. Lesnick - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Great. And then I know you previously mentioned the timing of percentage rents was contributing to the NOI guidance for the rest of the year. How should we think about that cadence over the quarter?
Lisa Palmer: Well, we do provide guidance for percentage rents, and we've received almost half of it, at least on the low end. As you think about the rest of the year, you could assume that we had another, call it, 1/3 to potentially a little bit more in the fourth quarter with a little bit in between.
Thomas J. Lesnick - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: All right. And then just kind of a big picture question. Looking out 3 years, which of your markets do you expect to be strongest and weakest, and why?
Martin E. Stein: I would say we've got 2 dozen very attractive target markets. And our Coastal markets are performing well, our Texas markets, our Houston, Austin and Dallas are performing well, including Denver. Atlanta is on the way back. Our markets in North Carolina are doing extremely well. Our Florida markets are starting to exercise a comeback. So we feel really, really good about the canvas under which we're investing and operating.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Tammi Fique, Wells Fargo Securities.
Tamara J. Fique - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I just wanted to follow up again on the move-outs. Just kind of curious, the same property leased rates fell from the fourth quarter to the first quarter for spaces under 20,000 square feet. I guess is that reflective of move-outs that maybe occurred toward end of the quarter? Maybe just trying to get some color around that.
Lisa Palmer: I'll go first, then Brian can add color. Again, it's -- I'm talking about guidance and how we performed versus our guidance. We expected more, so they were lower. We still have some, as Brian talked about, but not at all significant on a historical basis. And the percent, the drop-in percent leased on the small-shop space, I'll let Brian talk about that because that had to do with spaces that were more in the 5,000 to 10,000 square foot range.
Brian M. Smith: Right. Yes, in terms of the comment about historical reference, we generally add occupancy -- we always add occupancy in the second, third and fourth quarters, and we lose occupancy in the first. That losses average typically about 30 basis points. In this quarter, we were about 20 basis points. So it was actually better than historical for us. And in terms of this -- the loss in the small shops, that was really driven by the larger small shops, if you will, the ones from 5,000 to 10,000 as opposed to less than 5,000. And we had 130 basis point decrease there. And a lot of that was as a result of chain-wide bankruptcies like Fashion Bug. They averaged about 7,000 square feet. We lost 3 of those. Large restaurants and the like. Whereas the small shops, less than 5,000 square feet, it was just 40 basis points.
Tamara J. Fique - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then just sticking with the move-outs, are the trends for the second quarter better than you perhaps was expected at this point?
Brian M. Smith: Was it -- I'm sorry, is that for development?
Lisa Palmer: K We're only -- I mean, we're only 1 month in, so it's a little too early to comment on that yet.
Tamara J. Fique - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then turning to the Grand Ridge development, the yield on that project is down about 100 basis points in the last 6 months. I know you talked briefly about it in your opening remarks. But I think last quarter you talked about the city demanding some upgrades that maybe weren't originally budgeted. Is that what drove the construction costs up another $7 million this quarter, or is there something else going on there?
Brian M. Smith: Well, actually, last -- yes, I was basically telling things were happening after the quarter-end. Last quarter, we had some cost increases related to changing some ground leases to build to suits which were NOI and return neutral. But in terms of this year, yes, we had -- or this quarter, we had, I think, $7.3 million cost increases. And really, what was happening there, it was just a perfect storm of several things coming together, much of which were outside of our control. I'd put those into 3 categories. The first one was unusually severe weather, even by Seattle standards where it not only rained a lot, but it just didn't stop. So the soil never got a chance to dry out and it just became saturated. And ultimately, that led to the on-site stormwater management pond overflowing and it flooded the entire site. And so we had to bring heavy equipment on that would not only pump the water off site, but first, has to treat it, and -- that means you're not pumping dirty water off site. We had to haul off other soils, dry soils, cement treat the pads, redo the erosion control. So a lot of it was that severe weather. And the second area of cost increases that were outside of our control were those city-imposed costs. And there were a couple categories of that. One were the fees. There's a schedule of fees that's published by the city and it just -- they didn't adhere to it. They just went beyond that for traffic mitigation and for other fees. And then they not only upgraded the design standards, so a lot of things that we have designed, like demanding canopies on all sides of buildings, but in landscaping, hardscaping, but actually added scope. So they added, for example, a tiered plaza area that we didn't even have in our proposed development. And then the final thing was just the construction cost increases, which we are seeing around the country. They're a little more severe up there because it is such an anti-growth environment that you don't have many subs, so there wasn't very much depth to the bidding. But at the end of the day, I think the development program is under control. We did 12 -- we've done 12 projects since 2009 and if you strip this one out, we're actually over a couple of million dollars under budget, including East Washington Place which is also on the West Coast. And at the end of the day, Grand Ridge Plaza is still going to have about 200 basis points spread over the exit cap rates and that thing is 96% leased and committed, and we're working on LOIs for another 2%. So it should be a great project. I don't mean to diminish the importance of the cost, but as I said, a lot of those were outside our control.
Operator: And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call over to our host for any closing or additional remarks.
Martin E. Stein: We appreciate your participation in the call, and wish that you have a great rest of the week. Thank you very much.
Operator: And that does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Regency Centers Corporation Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. And at this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Mas. Please go ahead, sir.
Mike Mas: Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call this morning are Hap Stein, Brian Smith, Lisa Palmer, and Chris Leavitt. Before we start, I'd like to address forward-looking statements that may be discussed on the call. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Hap?
Martin E. Stein: Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. We believe the steps we've taken over the last several years to enhance our portfolio, our development program and balance sheet are positioning us to consistently perform up to Regency standards. 2012, the hard work and focus of our dedicated team were clearly evident in the operating and financial results. You will hear from Lisa and Brian in detail, but I want to highlight the many notable accomplishments. The performance of the leasing team was exceptional, pushing same property operating portfolio to 94.5% leased. We started to exhibit pricing power as evidenced by rent growth of 5.5% including nearly 20% on new leases. These factors, which were aided by robust demand, health of our tenants and lessening supply of available space produce same property NOI growth of 4%. Development team started 4 and completed 9 irreplaceable shopping centers, and transformed another 5 centers through redevelopment, adding an estimated $75 million of value. Transaction team continued to enhance the quality of the overall portfolio. They sold more than $450 million of shopping centers that no longer met Regency's risk, strategic or NOI growth objectives. We also acquired high-quality shopping centers with compelling, future growth profiles. The capital markets' team further fortified Regency's solid balance sheet and access to capital. These efforts combined to produce core FFO per share of nearly 7%, most important of all, an increase in total shareholder return of more than 30%. To be sure, we recognize that a single year's positive results do not define Regency's standard for success. This is particularly the case in light of our view that economic growth, while positive, will likely be slow for the foreseeable future, and our tenants will continue to operate in an increasingly competitive environment. That said, it is worth noting that 2013 will be Regency's 50th year in business. Our experience over the last 5 decades have molded and enhanced, what I am convinced, is a tried and true formula that will sustain growth and shareholder value. Regency's strategy starts with an intense focus on producing reliable growth and NOI, which is the cornerstone to generating consistent increasing -- increases in earnings and net asset value. We will continue to pursue acquisitions and developments that meet our strict standards, our comparable quality to our most recent investments and will fortify the reliability of the portfolio's NOI. At the same time, we are playing offense. We're extremely vigilant and proactive about identifying and continuing to sell the ever declining share of centers that may no longer be consistent with our strategy. Our ability to create meaningful value through disciplined development and redevelopment of irreplaceable shopping centers is one of our core competencies, which we will continue to profit from and is the second key generator of growth in NAV. A solid balance sheet, which we remained committed to, managing in the conservative and prudent fashion. Finally, we'll keep our most fundamental asset, our people, engaged and focused on the achievement of these key objectives. Lisa?
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Hap. Good morning, everyone. As Hap stated, our results for the fourth quarter and for the full year were very good. With core FFO of $0.63 per share for the quarter and $2.56 per share for the year. Being $0.03 above the high end of our most guidance was a result of exceeding expectations in November and December. Primarily, first, federal leasing; second, lower move-outs; third, lower real estate tax expense. And all those combined produced higher recovery rates. Same property NOI growth, excluding termination fees, was 4% for the year. Almost of all this growth was attributable to base rent, which was largely the result of occupancy gains primarily from non-anchor spaces combined with built-in contractual rent steps. In the fourth quarter, we recognized an impairment charge of $50 million triggered by the decision to sell Deer Springs Town Center and exit the Las Vegas market. Given the difficulty of efficiently leasing and managing this large single asset in a state where we have no plans to grow, we believe it makes sense to exit the market at this time. I'd also like to briefly explain the fourth quarter income tax expense. We employed tax planning strategies in our taxable REIT subsidiary at year end to maximize the benefits of a net operating loss. These strategies generated taxable gains and a related noncash income tax expense. As Hap mentioned and as we've previously communicated, we made significant progress in 2012 executing our portfolio enhancement strategy. This is positioning Regency for better long-term sustainable growth. However, in the short-term, being a net seller in 2012 will have a dilutive impact on '13. But even with that being said, the strong leasing and better-than-expected moveouts in December will result in higher-than-expected average occupancy in 2013. As such, we've increased our '13 full year earnings guidance. We now expect core FFO per share in the range of $2.48 to $2.56, an increase of $0.03 to both ends of our range of the initial guidance. Our guidance for same property NOI remains unchanged to 2% to 3%. Lastly, although I recently moved into his office, my predecessor, who is also my mentor and very dear friend, Bruce Johnson, left a legacy of conservative and astute balance sheet management that I'm committed to carrying on. This means we will continue to monitor our maturities and commitments, while maintaining significant capacity on our line of credit. To that end, in 2012, we increased the capacity in our lines to $800 million, of which $730 million is currently available. And although we don't have any significant maturities in 2013, we took advantage of historically low interest rates by hedging the base treasury rate and swap rate on 60% of our 2014 and 2015 maturities. We remain comfortable with our current leverage levels though we'll always look to opportunistically enhance our balance sheet strength by focusing on long-term targets of net debt to EBITDA of less than 5.5x and a fixed charge coverage ratio of greater than 2.75x. Brian?
Brian M. Smith: Thank you, Lisa, and good morning. The fourth quarter was a near-perfect way to cap off what was a very good year in all aspects of our portfolio. Strong leasing momentum continued to drive the business. We signed more new leases in the operating portfolio than any year on record, taking the same property portfolio to 94.5% leased. Moveouts in 2012 were the lowest they've been since 2007, and a significant portion of this occupancy gain came from small shop space. In fact, our percent leased for spaces less than 10,000 square feet increased 170 basis points in 2012 and currently stands greater than 88% leased. In addition, the average rent assigned for small shops increased for the seventh consecutive quarter. Given the strength of our leasing pipeline, we continued lack of new supply coming online in the slow but steady upward trajectory of the macroeconomy and remain optimistic that our goal of 95% leased is well within our sites and there's certainly no reason we should stop there. What makes this even more satisfying is the fact that we increased occupancy, while simultaneously improving both the tenant caliber and merchandising mix in our shopping centers. We did this not only by leveraging our considerable relationships with strong national tenants, but also with well-capitalized, innovative and exciting local and regional concepts that are considered fixtures in their local communities. As we all know, the grocery business is very competitive and a dynamic one. With that in mind, I'd like to provide a quick update on SUPERVALU. After recently meeting with them, we are more comfortable in our belief that our exposure to store closures remains limited and our initial impression of the recently announced transaction is that it reduces uncertainty and may even improve their long-term operating prospects. Continuing on this topic of portfolio enhancement, the fourth quarter was important for us. We closed on the purchase of 4 exceptional assets, all of which were secured on off-market basis. Uptown Shopping Center is located in a dense urban area of San Diego. This asset combines street front retail with 2 top-notch grocery anchors, Trader Joe's and Ralphs. It's the only center in the trade area with convenient surface parking, which gives it a real and unique competitive advantage. The combined grocery sales are more than $70 million per year; it also has structured parking. The center draws from a 3-mile population of 223,000 with strong household incomes and offers incredible remerchandising potential. On the other side of the country, Phillips Place is located in the highly desirable South Park submarket of Charlotte, North Carolina across from one of the most successful regional malls in the Southeast. Phillips Place has average incomes of $128,000 and benefits from a very strong daytime population. Phillips' roster reflects the prestige of the local market with tenants like Dean & DeLuca, Brooks Brothers, Restoration Hardware and The Palm. Village Plaza is anchored by a high-volume Whole Foods that serves the local market of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and benefits from its proximity to the University. This asset represents exemplary neighborhood retail real estate and comes from the redevelopment opportunity to further improve its already strong, long-term growth prospects. And last but not certainly not least, Sandy Springs is a generational asset in an affluent infill neighborhood of Atlanta anchored by a highly successful Trader Joe's. We also see an opportunity to harvest additional growth by remerchandising the center to better serve the needs of the trade area. These centers along with those acquired in the first 3 quarters of the year are excellent additions to our portfolio, with average 3-mile populations and household incomes that when combined, exceed our $200,000 target and grocery sales of more than $1,000 per square foot which is double our goal. And perhaps most importantly, they enjoy the long-term, sustainable competitive advantages that will make them accretive to our NOI growth profile for years to come. During the quarter, we also closed on the sale of 3 assets providing further enhancement to our portfolio. To a certain extent, all 3 were inconsistent with our strategy and had reached peak value. Specifically, one was a standalone Whole Foods in Santa Barbara, California, that we sold at a 5% cap rate. With no side shops to provide growth, we believe this asset was fully valued at a price representing a $1,000 per square foot. With these dispositions and the planned sale of Deer Springs, our remaining pool of nonstrategic properties currently targeted for sale represents approximately 3% of our portfolio. If sold, some of the properties could generate gains, while others could be at loss. But if there are losses, the aggregate amount would be dwarfed by the magnitude of the Deer Springs impairment. Our in-processing completed developments are performing very well and saw a huge demand during 2012 as evidenced by 860,000 square feet of new development leasing. The 9 development completions leased up quickly and are currently more than 97% leased. As a matter fact, our fourth quarter completions on average stabilized just 80 days after anchor opening and have an incremental return on invested capital of more than 10%. Our in-process projects, the majority of which were 2012 starts, are already 86% leased and we expect them to be around 95% leased by the end of 2013. In closing, I, like Hap and Lisa, am proud of the progress that has been made over the past 2 years and we look forward to seeing just how far we can go. Hap?
Martin E. Stein: Thank you, Brian and Lisa. Like I said, one good year doesn't automatically translate into many. It doesn't define Regency's standard for success. But I'm extremely gratified with what we've accomplished and feel very good about where we're headed. Our team of talented people has worked extremely hard and is poised to have continued success in building shareholder value in 2013. We now welcome your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll go to Michael Mueller first, from JPMorgan.
Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I guess, first, on the Blackstone-preferred investment. And what's embedded in guidance in terms of the timing of either having calling that or having it redeemed?
Lisa Palmer: We're currently assuming that we go the full term basically which would be December 31 of '13.
Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay, okay. And then, I guess, second question. Brian, to your comments about you still have about 3% of the portfolio targeted for sale. About how long of a time period do you think that covers to go through that 3%?
Brian M. Smith: It all depends. Those are the hardest assets to sell, so it all depends on the demand for them and all. But I would think that we would be out of that in a couple of years.
Lisa Palmer: But we're -- and also...
Brian M. Smith: And then it will be ongoing. There'll always be some assets that will be at the bottom of the portfolio that will be part of the annual recycling process.
Lisa Palmer: I think, I know, Mike, you've been covering this for a long time. For many years, our strategy has been portfolio enhancement or capital recycling, and to sell what we always said was the bottom 3% of the portfolio every year.
Operator: And we'll go next to Christy McElroy, UBS.
Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Brian, I just wanted to follow up on the Q4 acquisitions you talked about. What percentage of the deals that you looked at were ones in which sellers were motivated to sell before year end for tax reasons? I know you mentioned they were off-market. And how would you characterize the current environment for acquisition opportunities?
Brian M. Smith: A lot of activity, I think, in the last probably 4, 5 months of the year, it was related to people who wanted to sell it before they saw the tax rates go up. And I think that was a definite factor in the increased activity. I'd say, in current environment right now, Christy, it's probably too early to tell. There's been some speculation that people now are not willing to sell because of the higher taxes. But I just -- I don't think there's enough data out there yet to know. So we kind of view it right now as status quo and we are seeing some pretty good opportunities.
Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And then, Lisa, I guess this is a question for you. Did Paseo del Sol drive the entire developmental gain in the quarter? And how much of that gain flowed through to FFO and core FFO?
Lisa Palmer: It was most of it. The gains -- on our guidance page anyway, we have one line that we've netted of other transaction costs as well. All of the gains flowed through FFO, but none through core FFO.
Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And why did that gain, why did that center, why did that qualify as a development gain instead of a gain on operating property? It looks like it was built in 2004.
Lisa Palmer: We just completed it last year.
Operator: And we'll go next to Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo.
Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Actually, the first question on in-process development. Can you just talk about what's happening with the, I guess, rents and construction cost because I was noticing that on Grand Ridge, the yield pulled back a little bit sequentially from Q3 into Q4 with costs up and it -- Erwin Mill, similarly the yield dropped despite the anchor opening, moving up a little bit. Is there something that's specific to just -- for those projects? Or is there something else going on that maybe has a broader implication?
Brian M. Smith: I'd say, Jeff, it's specific to Grand Ridge. In fact, this morning I was looking at -- if you look at the 12 ground-up construction projects excluding the redevelopments but including phases on the projects, so that's 12, and the total costs are up across that whole portfolio about 2%, which is $3.4 million and $3.9 million of that is Grand Ridge. So the other 11 properties actually came in $500,000 lower. So what's going on with Grand Ridge -- and Grand Ridge may not end up being $3.9 million because we still have $2 million of the contingency that we didn't tap, we just increased the cost. What's going on in Grand Ridge is that, that's in one of those very, very difficult to entitle markets. I've said this before, but the last property that's developed up there, was developed 20 years ago, that took 12 years to entitle. And what happened is the city just demanded a lot of upgrades that weren't in the original budget. Everything from enhanced lighting, landscaping, expanded plaza, areas and the like. There was a little bit of probably a miss on our part. We originally had the big boxes price -- I think it was $120 a square foot and then our pricing down in northern California for the same tenants came in lower, so we reduced the price when we did the original budget. And in fact, they came in where they were originally targeted at $120. So long answer to a short conclusion, which is it's all related to Grand Ridge.
Martin E. Stein: There's a little bit of pressure though on construction cost right now.
Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: And then, I guess, Brian, and how are you sourcing new development? Is it from land on the books, in new purchases? And if I could just toss one in for Lisa. I might have missed it. Can you just repeat the reason why the write-down on Deer Springs?
Lisa Palmer: Who do want to answer first?
Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Yes. I'll let you decide.
Brian M. Smith: That was a clever bifurcate. Okay. The -- I'll start the developments. The developments are sourced the way we will always have. And we've got people out in the markets that in some cases have been working on properties for years, trying to get them. And then we do have 400 or 200 acres of land held for development, some of that we'll be tapping. So if you look at what we expect to do in 2013, one of those, and the large one will come out of land held, and all the other ones -- and the one that we've actually been pursuing, working on for 19 years. Other than that, they're all recently sourced opportunities.
Lisa Palmer: And for Deer Springs, as Brian talked about, we do have another 3% of the portfolio that we've identified that we'd like to sell. But as he said, the sale of those is really uncertain. What's different about Deer Springs is that we're -- we think it's more likely than not that we will sell it at some time in the next -- call it next several years, specifically because we want to exit the market and we have accepted that we will take a price at which we've written it down to. And because it's very difficult to manage and lease such a large asset, when we don't have a local office.
Operator: Then we'll go next to Andrew Rosivach with Goldman Sachs.
Andrew Leonard Rosivach - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I just had a question on CapEx. If I take your disclosure on Page 13 and I back it away from FFO and I take away the straight line, it's actually coming up with a number that's lower than your dividend. But that's also not fair because obviously you're upping occupancy and that takes a lot of CapEx as well. So do you have any idea of the sense of what are your kind of true run rate CapEx would be? And if you put that in, will you be covering your dividend?
Lisa Palmer: I'll let Brian address the CapEx run rate. But first, let me -- we had a lot of noncash expenses this year with preferred issuance cost write-offs. We also redid our term loan and our line and that also was from noncash expenses. So we did cover our dividend this year. I would expect that we're going to be covering it in the future as well. But I'll let Brian answer the CapEx run rate question.
Brian M. Smith: Yes. Our white box, which are really driving it, as you said, is related to a lot of things. One, which is the highest volumes of leasing. In 2012, it was $0.60 a square foot and we think in 2013, we'll reduce that by about 1/3, get it down to $0.40 a foot and it will be even lower in 2014. What's going on there is not only have we done a lot of leasing in 2011 and '12 but a lot of leasing was to restaurants which required some upgrades and building renovation, but also a lot of anchor activity, releasing of anchor space, where we had to, in some cases, replace and fix buildings where we you had an anchor in there for 20 years. In some cases, we had to combine small shop spaces to create a much larger space which is very expensive. And then we had several examples of larger spaces being subdivided where you got to do all kinds of work to the building so that's what's really driving it.
Martin E. Stein: And said in another way, our routine building improvements should run about $0.55 a square foot. Brian indicated our white boxing in 2012 was $0.60. We expect it to be closer to $0.40 a foot and then we would expect in '14 it would be at an even be lower level.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Paula Poskon with Robert W. Baird.
Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Just a question for Lisa on guidance. How much redevelopment investment is embedded in guidance, if any? And where do you guys see the most opportunity for redevelopment in your portfolio?
Lisa Palmer: I'll let Brian address the opportunities. We expect that we should be able to do up to about $15 million of redevelopments per year. We'd love to do more but all the stars have to align for that to happen, and so really difficult to get done. But I'll still let Brian talk about what we have coming this year.
Brian M. Smith: This year, we may -- in 2013, we've already got the one going for $8 million, and that's just an example of an older center. This is typical where we're actually going to get over $700,000 of increased revenue from the redevelopment of 2 anchors. We turned down a Walgreens, we turned a Publix in rebuilding. We've also got the Balboa Mesa redevelopment coming, which we acquired last year. And then, I guess, the source going forward as Lisa said, you probably figured there's maybe $15 million that would come from the existing portfolio. But we also have the additional phases of a lot of the developments that when we went in the -- since 2009, we rightsized them. For example, later this year, we would hope to expand the Lee Airport Park in Annapolis, which is 100% leased or close to it. And then we've got the expansion of the Golden Hills property in California. So, and then one other one we'd likely to do at the end of this year would be Woodway Collection where the anchor is at the end of its term and we'll replace the anchor and do a full redevelopment.
Martin E. Stein: And also, I want to amplify that a little bit and connect the dots back to Andrew's question about CapEx. The anticipated amount of starts from a redevelopment where we have visible, attractive returns on invested capital is in the neighborhood of $15 million. And that absolutely is a top priority, to the extent we can expand that, that would be great. But we've also, and I think we break that out separately, but we anticipate spending about another $15 million a year over and above routine building improvements where we think that we can enhance the look of the shopping center, do a facade redo and that we think that although the returns aren't immediately visible, that we would expect we're going to get at an even higher lift from our growth and net operating income.
Lisa Palmer: And to clarify from a disclosure standpoint, the expansions and redevelopments that Brian was speaking about, we do disclose in our developments status page and we have it down at the bottom. So any expansions that we would do of existing centers would show there, would not be part of the CapEx disclosure. The major renovation CapEx disclosure is on a separate page, but we also -- but we do disclose both in detail.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We go next to Cedrik Lachance with Green Street Advisors.
Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: Lisa, I just want to go back to your answer on the Whole Foods being included in -- as the development profit at the Whole Foods sale. My understanding is that the Whole Foods itself opened in '09, so how does it end up qualifying as a merchant building gain at the end '12?
Lisa Palmer: We've -- it was -- some -- it was completed and moved into the operating portfolio in 4Q of 2011. And so basically, our internal policy -- is if it's sold within 1 year of completion, it would be included in the gain. Remember, Cedrik, we do exclude it from core FFO.
Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: So, so it was built [ph]. So I guess I misread that somewhere. So it was open in 2011.
Lisa Palmer: I was -- we completed it at...
Brian M. Smith: We said that one of the other things is although right now, it's just the Whole Foods, the original intent of that, there was an office building on the corner and we were planning on redeveloping that. Either tearing it down, converting it to a drugstore or something like putting out another pad out there. And the entitlement process in Santa Barbara is an incredibly burdensome and lengthy one. And finally, what we ended up doing is selling off the property. So all we were left with, was the Whole Foods, which then went into the operating portfolio.
Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: Okay, that works. And then in regards to the redevelopment discussion from earlier. How much of that redevelopment spend contributes to same-store NOI growth, let's say, in 2013? Does it account for 50 basis points of the 2% to 3%? Can you try to give me a range in there?
Lisa Palmer: I don't -- I'm not sure -- I'll have to get back to you on '13. In '12, it was -- I think, I believe it was about 20 basis points. Because just as -- remember, Brian talked about it, he gave Woodway as an example. That's one, where we're going to have the anchor down for a period of time. So at the same time that your getting the benefit of those that you're completing, you're being -- you're having the dilution from those that you're taking off-line. We're happy to give you that number. I'll follow-up.
Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: Okay. No problem. And I guess final question. Have you been using the ATM in the fourth quarter?
Lisa Palmer: We did not use it in the fourth quarter.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We have a follow-up from Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo.
Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I was just curious to get your updated thoughts on SUPERVALU and Fresh & Easy. And kind of how you are you guys thinking about those situations?
Brian M. Smith: Well, Fresh & Easy, we assume they're gone. So we're actively in discussions with people, with replacement tenants for those spaces. Unfortunately, we've only got 2 operating and they're both in Northern California and they should be -- there's a lot of demand for those spaces. SUPERVALU, as I kind of indicated in the remarks, really no change. I think we said last quarter that having looked at all the properties, looked at what we could do with them if we got all the spaces back. We felt there are only a handful of ones that might take some time to release. Since then we met with the representatives who share with us their -- the profitability and the sales for all the stores and they were literally just a few that were either at breakeven or at a loss. And one of those is the term expires in 2015 and the rent to $2.60 a foot, so we're more than happy to get that one back. Another one is adjacent to a large retailer who would want to expand in that space. So honestly, there's just a couple, I think, that could be -- we just feel as comfortable as we can be that we're not going to be impacted that much.
Martin E. Stein: And just in general, I think, as Brian indicated earlier, we're not involved based upon that kind of secondhand knowledge which we are following very closely. The operators of Albertsons have done a good job with that chain, the SUPERVALU people and investors are pretty optimistic about what they can do with the chain. It obviously still is a very competitive industry, it remains to be seen. But I do think that there's a better chance for a turnaround. And there's a lot more clarity there.
Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: That's helpful. And actually, just to circle back on Deer Springs. I guess, my question before is -- I was maybe more surprised by the magnitude of the write-down, just I was surprised that it wouldn't have been tripped before because it's a pretty substantial write-down when you think of it, particularly on a per square foot value relative to the size of the asset. Has that something to do with where you guys think Las Vegas retail is currently valued?
Lisa Palmer: I could go into a much longer discussion on an accounting education, but I don't -- I think it would bore you. But you're adding [ph] impairment, there has to be a trigger basically in this to evaluate, to reevaluate for an impairment and the trigger here was the fact that we believe it's going to be more likely than not that we're going to sell it. That was what changed.
Brian M. Smith: The other thing, Jeff, about it, what's interesting is when this was originally underwritten, it was underwritten to be a 700,000 square-foot property. And when the market turned, we built only what was under construction, and that was only 330,000 square feet. So there's 370,000 square feet that didn't even get built for about 37 acres worth of coverage, and I think that's one of the reasons why you're seeing such a big impairment.
Martin E. Stein: And just to reiterate, it is not consistent with our in-fill disciplined future development strategy.
Operator: We'll go next to Nathan Isbee with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Brian, can you give a little more detail on the expected 4Q moveouts that didn't occur? Were those tenants close to maturity just re-upped? Or were those the tenants that decided to hang on?
Brian M. Smith: They were tenants that appear to have decided to hang on. That's just -- the moveouts are always the hardest thing for us to plan on. We go through space by space and we take a look at what the property managers are saying based on the feedback from talking to the retailers. We look at what we want to do, we look at their sales. At the end of the day, in the fourth quarter, they just did not move out. Now, we wonder does that mean they're going to move out first quarter, and first quarter is not done so I don't have answer for you. But you would think that if they're going to go, they would limp through the holidays, extract as much sales as they could and then move out. But I would tell you right now that the January numbers indicate that they have not moved out and we are way ahead of plan in terms of moveouts for January.
Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. But you are assuming in your '13 guidance that they do move out at some point?
Brian M. Smith: Yes.
Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then just -- can you remind...
Lisa Palmer: I mean that's in the range we are, right? I mean, if that's what the same property growth of 2% to 3% would assume that -- I mean, that has a range of moveout but as well as our percent lease.
Brian M. Smith: We didn't change that.
Lisa Palmer: Right. And since I have the floor, and I have a really good team that e-mailed me the impact on redevelopment growth in '13. To answer Cedrik's question, it is approximately 20 basis points.
Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then can you just update us on the same space rent growth assumptions in your guidance? I noticed you took it out of the supplemental.
Lisa Palmer: Yes. We didn't provide exact guidance even at our investor meeting in December. It's one of the most difficult things to forecast, but if you'll recall, at that time, Brian did indicate that we would expect that we would be in the mid- to high-single digits for 2013. There's more pricing power, so that would put us at slightly better than 2012.
Operator: We go next to Samit Parikh with ISI.
Samit Parikh - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Just 2 questions, really, on funding. One, I know, I think, someone asked did you use the ATM in 4Q, can you tell us if you use any of the ATM in 1Q so far?
Lisa Palmer: It would be a blackout period.
Samit Parikh - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Oh yes, that's true. Okay, fair. Also, you sold the Whole Foods, right, that you the opened in 2009 and given sort of where cap rates are right now for this type of grocer, either single tenant or small grocery anchored centers and Publix buying everything they can. Do you think sort of selling maybe some of these assets that you developed, call it between 2006 and 2008, you have several of these smaller grocer anchor assets that may have some limited near-term growth, is a better funding strategy near-term than maybe using the ATM to fund your development?
Lisa Palmer: Possibly, yes. And in fact, that clearly -- the sale of Paseo del Sol was an opportunistic sale because of -- that it was a cheaper cost of capital than selling our equity at the time, and that's why it's not a coincidence that we didn't tap the equity market in the fourth quarter.
Samit Parikh - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Are you current -- are you in discussions right now? I mean, is there a discussion going on maybe with Publix or some of the other centers of Whole Foods? And are you seeing some sort of an updig [ph] increase in the appetite of maybe net lease investors to pay lower than your current cost -- lower than your current and pi [ph] cap rate type of cap rates for some of these assets that you'd be willing to part with?
Lisa Palmer: No, not necessarily. And -- but I'll also remind you, too, that we do have this 3% that Brian talked about, which at this time, is a higher priority than some of the limited growth assets. But to the extent that we can sell the limited growth assets in lieu of tapping the equity markets, that's something that we will consider.
Martin E. Stein: But we would not, just to be clear, we wouldn't sell the primary anchor in the shopping center because we think that's important to the long-term value even though that primary anchor obviously has less growth potential than the side shop and/or some of the secondary anchors.
Operator: With no additional questions in queue, I'd like to turn the call back to management for any additional or closing comments.
Martin E. Stein: We appreciate your time and interest in Regency and wish everybody have a great day and a great Super Bowl weekend. Thank you very much.
Operator: And again, that does conclude today's call. Again, thank you for your participation. Have a good day.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Regency Centers Corporation Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. This conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to your moderator, Senior Vice President, Capital Markets, Lisa Palmer. You may begin.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Anna. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. On the call this morning are Hap Stein, Brian Smith, Bruce Johnson and Chris Leavitt. Before we start, I'd like to address forward-looking statements that may be discussed on the call. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in these statements. Please refer to the documents filed -- excuse me, filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in these forward-looking statements. Hap?
Martin E. Stein: Thank you, Lisa. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. Let me start by saying that while our properties in the northeast experienced relatively minor damage from Sandy, we know the losses to many have been great. Our thoughts and prayers are with those who were caught in the storm's path. Turning now to Regency's results. I continue to be encouraged by the impressive progress the team has made so far this year in all aspects of the business. With the risk of stealing the thunder from Bruce and Brian, let me provide a quick recap. Fundamentals in the operating portfolio and demand from retailers remain strong. As evidenced by our results this quarter, we enhanced the portfolio's NOI growth, strategic and risk profiles through the sale of lower quality assets, using the proceeds to reduce leverage, as well as acquire dominant A-quality shopping centers with superior growth prospects. The large amount of sales so far this year has substantially reduced the remaining asset centers that we have prioritized for sale. This means that in the future, we expect dispositions will be more modest in scale. Our 7 in-process developments continue to perform extremely well, featuring significant leasing progress and attractive returns. I feel that our ability to create value through development and redevelopment of dominant centers is an important core competency. And while progress continues to be made, fortifying our solid balance sheet and access to capital, we will continue to take advantage of cost-effective opportunities for enhancement. In summary, I'm extremely proud of our team's accomplishments and gratified by our results. And in no way do I underestimate the challenges and risks presented by today's fragile economy and financial markets. You should know that despite the uncertainties we face, I feel that Regency Centers is well positioned to sustain growth and shareholder value through the following strategic assets. Number one, our portfolio of dominant in-fill shopping centers that will produce reliable growth and net operating income. Number two, the strength of our balance sheet and cost-effective access to capital. Number three, disciplined value-add development capabilities. And last but definitely not least, our engaged and talented team. Bruce?
Bruce M. Johnson: Thank you, Hap, and good morning, everyone. As Hap stated, our third quarter results were very good. Core FFO was $0.62 per share, $0.03 above the high end of our guidance range. Year-to-date, same-property NOI has grown 4% and continues to exceed projections. Roughly 80% of NOI growth came from increased base rent. In response of these positive results, as well as our forecast for the final 3 months of the year, we are raising guidance for 2012. Core FFO is being raised by $0.05 at the midpoint to a new range of $2.48 to $2.52. And same-property NOI growth, excluding termination fees, is now 3.6% to 4.1%. Before sharing our initial 2013 guidance with you, I'd like to remind you that we expect a significant -- to be a significant net seller this year, enabling us to reduce our total debt by approximately $170 million. Assuming a 6% spread between the cost of interest and the cap rate on dispositions, we have estimated full year impact to 2013 is roughly $0.11 of dilution. To that end, 2013 core FFO guidance is $2.45 to $2.53. In the future, we don't expect to be a net seller. Therefore, we would expect growth in 2014 and beyond to be in the 5% range. Turning to capital markets. We are committed to maintaining an already-sound balance sheet and opportunistically strengthening it even further. Let me recap the transactions we completed during the third quarter, all of which were in line with that goal. In August, we raised $75 million of Series 7 Preferred Stock at an annual dividend rate of 6%. We used those proceeds to redeem all outstanding shares of our Series 5 issuance, providing a permanent dividend savings of approximately $525,000 every year. In September, we expanded our revolving credit facility to a capacity of $800 million and extended its maturity date by 1 year to September 2017, including the extension option. In addition to our revolving credit facility, we also retain the right to draw the remaining $100 million on our term loan, which expires in mid-January 2013. Together, these bank facilities provide $900 million of capacity. We are monitoring our net commitments as it relates to these facilities to ensure significant capacity remains to provide Regency with sleep-at-night security. And finally, during the quarter, we sold nearly $22 million of stock through our ATM program, at an average price of $49.70. Now, Brian will provide more color behind our operating results and development successes.
Brian M. Smith: Thank you, Bruce, and good morning. This quarter, we saw a continuation of the improved fundamentals that we discussed in prior quarters. We leased 1.5 millions square feet of space in the operating portfolio, nearly 1/3 of which was new leases. Net absorption was positive, and we ended the quarter at 94.3% leased and 87.4% leased for spaces under 10,000 square feet. Likewise, the pipeline of leasing activity remains strong and above our historical average, maintaining solid interest in our vacant spaces. This robust leasing performance has been the primary source of our same-property NOI growth this year, with base shrink contributing roughly 80% of the increase. The growth in NOI was broad-based across the portfolio. Looking forward, as we approach and exceed 95% leased, core NOI growth will have to come from rent growth than from occupancy gains. This quarter, we continue to see evidence of pricing power beginning to gain traction, as rent growth is positive 13.7% for the quarter and positive 6.1% year-to-date. Much of the rent growth this quarter was due to a handful of leases for large boxes. Even without these, rent growth was over 4% for the quarter and 3% year-to-date, with 80% of our leases showing positive rent growth. Turning to our developments. Our $240 million of in-process projects are performing extremely well, registering an average incremental return of more than 9% or nearly 80% leased, creating $75 million of value at today's implied cap rate. The interest in these projects has been remarkable. For example, take Grand Ridge Plaza in Metro Seattle. Today the project is 79% leased. With an additional -- with additional leasing activity that is signed, would take it to 95% leased, well ahead of the estimated June 2013 completion date. Also, I want to briefly comment on our capital recycling progress. In addition to the portfolio sale, we sold 3 operating properties during the third quarter. First State Plaza, shop rate anchorage [ph] center in Stanton, Delaware and Brentwood Commons in Baker Hill Center, both dominant anchored [ph] centers outside of Chicago. As with the portfolio sale, these properties were deemed inconsistent with our investment strategy and expectations for NOI growth. We acquired one truly outstanding shopping center this quarter, Balboa Mesa, located in San Diego, California. Anchored by Vons, CVS and Kohl's, Balboa Mesa is exceptional in-fill real estate located at one of the busiest intersections in San Diego. With embedded contractual rent growth and very compelling immediate redevelopment opportunity, not only will the stabilized return be around 6%, but we also expect to see very good growth from that point forward. In summary, the third quarter was very much a continuation of the progress that was made during the first half of the year. All aspects of our plan are coming together nicely and producing desirable results. Hap?
Martin E. Stein: Thank you, Brian. As you know, Bruce will be retiring as Regency's Chief Financial Officer at the end of the year, and this will be his last participation on a Regency earnings call. So before we turn the call over to questions, I'd like to take a moment to say a few words about Bruce. He is Regency's consummate Chief Financial Officer. He's been an extraordinary leader, by word and deed. He's been my life's partner and a wonderful friend. He's played a vital role in Regency's success, and especially epitomized our culture and everything that is good and great about Regency. As many of you who are on this call know from investor dinners, Bruce has a great sense of humor, to say the least. He's always unpredictable and keeps things light. More importantly, he's Mr. Perspective. He knows what is important in work and in life. Bruce, to say that we will miss you is an unbelievable understatement. However, we are comforted that your legacy will continue to guide us and that you are only a phone call away. We thank you and know that you'll enjoy and fare well in your retirement. And Bruce, your 34 years, at a minimum, entitles you the last word today.
Bruce M. Johnson: Thank you, Hap. I'm humbled by your comments. However, when you offer the last word in this group, you need to take advantage of it. This December marks 34 wonderful years that I've worked with my good friend and partner, Hap. He's been a wise leader and an incredible role model, and a personality that everyone loves. Our relationship has been very special, and I can't imagine a better 34 years. Brian and I started working together following the Pacific Retail Trust merger in 1999. But it wasn't until they moved to Jacksonville 5 years ago that I've really gotten to know him. Like Hap, he has also been a good friend and partner. His vast knowledge of and experience with shopping centers, his work ethic and his inspirational leadership set him apart in our industry. And 16 years ago, hired Lisa Palmer and we are fortunate with that decision. During her many roles at Regency, she has continued to perform like a star. Most recently, as you know, in Investor Relations and Capital Markets. I admit to feeling like a proud father as she assumes my role. As many of you know, Regency has a great culture, with an upbeat and fun family atmosphere. And in my view, it also has the best associates in the business. They are smart, professional, and important in sustaining our culture. It goes without saying that I will miss the daily interaction with the Regency family. Over the last 19 years, I've been privileged to know and work with a very talented and sharp group of investors, analysts and investment bankers. Many of you are on the call this morning. A lot of you were young when I first met you, some very, very young. I have enjoyed watching you grow, develop and progress in your roles as you have assumed more responsibility, moved to other firms and maybe back again, gained the respect of the industry, and yes, I even enjoyed your asking Regency and other REITs those difficult analyst investor questions. I will also miss the interplay with you. In 2013 and beyond, I look forward to watching Hap, Brian and Lisa take Regency to the next level. Hap alluded to my propensity to ask table questions. I won't have a question this morning, but as I turn the call over for your questions, I will leave you with a favorite 3-letter acronym. Q-T-R. Or, as Lisa prefers, QT. For those who know what that means, it's something to think about. And with that, we'll take questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Samit Parikh.
Samit Parikh - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: I wanted to just circle back to, Bruce, your comment on the 5% long-term earnings growth 2015 and beyond. Can you quickly just go through the drivers on that? I know part of it is being net acquires, but one thing I'm wondering is your funding plans on both developments, redevelopments, the size of that every year, and what you're thinking long-term and the funding plans in terms of how to fund the acquisitions going forward.
Bruce M. Johnson: It's actually 3 questions. I'm going to actually turn that over to Lisa, because that will all be on Lisa's watch.
Lisa Palmer: I think he enjoyed doing that. Yes, if you think about our business model, we've communicated in the past and we'll continue to be committed to development. We'd like to average approximately $150 million in new starts every year. And in terms of funding that, as you know, we've been an active capital recycler. We would also like to continue to do that, also in the $150 million range for acquisitions and dispositions. To the extent that -- and also, as you know, we did implement an ATM. We filed it in August. To the extent that we're able to access the equity market at an attractive price to match fund our developments, we will do that. If that's not available to us, then our disposition proceeds would fund our development commitments first, and acquisitions would follow, only to the extent that we have the available capital. So if you think about the 5% growth, if you average 2.5% same-property growth, average that, and then get the incremental growth from the developments that are coming online, because we're developing them on a very accretive basis, that will get you into the 5% range.
Samit Parikh - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: And how do you think about G&A growth on top of all that annually as you're expanding the asset base?
Lisa Palmer: I think that we plan to monitor G&A very closely, and we would expect that G&A shouldn't increase more than 3% a year.
Bruce M. Johnson: As a matter of fact, we'd be growing our earnings -- our top line and bottom line at higher rates than our G&A is growing.
Operator: And we'll now take our next question from Michael Bilerman with Citi.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And Bruce, certainly wish you all the best and it's been great having you in 34 years. I have a question about guidance, both as we look into the fourth quarter and also into next year. Can you help to sort of walk through, if you did $0.62 in the third quarter, you're looking at $0.55 to $0.59 in the fourth. And I guess I was surprised by that sort of drop-off. I recognized you sold the assets in I think it was late July, so there's a little bit of drag from that. But typically your percentage rents will come up a little bit, your rents are doing well, your occupancy is high, your recovery rate is within -- in the average. So I guess the decline is a lot more than I would have thought sequentially, and so maybe you can just walk through how you get from today down to the midpoint. And then as we move into next year, especially with no sort of sales, I'm not sure how you get to the low end, or what's driving that sort of low end of guidance. It would seem that you should be able to be in excess, and Lisa, I know you want to beat in your first year as a CFO, but maybe you can just sort of help us reconcile those things?
Lisa Palmer: Sure. The first part, from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, we talked on the call about being a net seller and reducing leverage by -- in the prepared remarks rather, for about $170 million. But if you look at our guidance for the remainder of the year, you'll see that we're still expecting some acquisitions to come through. So the amount that we're a net seller at this point in time is actually much greater than that. So that has more of a drag on the earnings, and that we're expecting the acquisitions to happen later in the fourth quarter. So that will get you to the difference in third quarter to fourth quarter, and then also helps for the run rate for next year. To the extent that we're able to execute on those acquisitions, that NOI will come online. In addition to that, 3% NOI growth is about $12 million a year. And so that will also -- we're going to begin to see leases commence rent paying, and we're going to see that growth take hold in 2013.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: So in terms of we're sitting here in the first week of November, how much -- you have $145 million, I guess, at the higher end, $150 million of additional sales baked into the fourth quarter, and upwards of $150 million of acquisitions. I mean, when did that $150 million get sold for it to be such -- we're talking about a $0.07 -- a $0.05 sequential drag, 3Q to 4Q? It seems like a pretty big drop.
Lisa Palmer: Yes. I mean you just take the -- I mean, if you just assume that it happens in the middle of the quarter, which should be in the middle of this month, now that we're already in November.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Right so do you have $150 million that are sort of ready to be closed in a week?
Lisa Palmer: We have, actually, about $120 million that are expected on the market. Whether they actually close, I cannot predict that.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: So it wouldn't seem that the guidance is conservative, then? At least into the fourth quarter?
Lisa Palmer: If it happens, then it would not be conservative. It would be within the range. And unfortunately, I'm not able to predict at this time, if it all will happen. So we have to give a range of expectations. And that's, therefore, why we have a low end and a high end. Now, to the extent that we don't execute on the dispositions, then we would be towards the higher end of the range. And if we do, then we would be more towards the middle to the -- potentially the lower end.
Operator: And we'll now take our next question from Joseph Dazio with JPMorgan.
Joseph C. Dazio - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Wondering if you could talk specifically about what drove the $0.03 upside to the top end of the range in the third quarter?
Lisa Palmer: It's basically all -- 80% of it was NOI, even in the same-property growth. Same-property growth was above our guidance for the quarter and also above our expectations.
Joseph C. Dazio - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And was that a function of I guess the rents being up fairly notably on some of the new leases that hit in the quarter? Or was it something else that caused that?
Lisa Palmer: No, I mean when you think about rent spreads, the impact of those don't happen immediately. What -- you may want to check how other companies do it, I think there's a mixed bag. We report spreads at execution of the lease, not necessarily at rent commencement. I think -- I do believe that's what the majority of our peers do. There's some that may report it at rent commencement. The primary driver of the upside was better leasing than expected and fewer move-outs.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question from Cedrik Lachance with Green Street Advisors.
Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: Just to stay on the theme of NOI. Can you give me a sense of what is the gap between lease space and occupied space this quarter versus what it was last quarter?
Bruce M. Johnson: Cedrik, leased space and rent-paying? It was -- is 200 basis points, and that's 50 basis points better than it was last quarter.
Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: So you were 250 last quarter, and now you're 200 this quarter?
Bruce M. Johnson: That's right.
Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: Okay, and just completely different track here, next question. In regards to land values, as you think about development, as you go out there and try to acquire land, what do you think has happened to land values over the past year?
Bruce M. Johnson: I don't -- it depends on the market. In California, coastal California, I don't think land values have really fallen that much at all. And other markets, if you're in secondary markets, tertiary markets, I think they clearly have fallen. So in the places where we're looking, we still see land values fairly high.
Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And if you were to compare it versus the past 12 months, have land values changed or they've just been stable for an extended period of time?
Bruce M. Johnson: I think they've been pretty stable. What's happening is you are seeing some cost increases on the -- construction costs, both materials and labor, by about 10% in the last 18 months or so. And then what you're also seeing on developments is yields compressing. There aren't that many good opportunities out there, and those that are ready to go, I think you're -- we're seeing some pretty intense competition.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets.
Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: First thing, I'd like to, Bruce, add my congratulations. And my first question is actually for you. If I wanted a good bottle of red wine, what would you recommend?
Bruce M. Johnson: I would never suggest a good bottle of red wine without you buying wine away at the same time, Rich.
Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: And I don't know Lisa if you're going to be give me 2 more questions on top of that or just one, so I'll ask this one first. On the small subleasing front, you guys are obviously making some pretty good progress. Is that coming, you think, more from actual leasing? Or is it the sale of assets that have more small shop vacancy? And then going forward, do you think you'll be selling some small shop vacancy as well?
Bruce M. Johnson: Well, this year, our gain -- this quarter our gain in occupancy was from the capital recycling. But we're 200 basis points up quarter-to-quarter in the small shop -- I'm sorry year-to-year. And last quarter if you'd measure, I think we were 280 basis points higher. So it's coming from real leasing. As you know, the first 3 quarters of this year is the best leasing we've ever done. Last year was a record at the time as well. So it's real strong demand. The tenant sales are very good, their optimism is back. The lack of new supply is certainly helping us, so it's genuine demand, Rich.
Martin E. Stein: And then a follow up on that. We've studied what have been the ingredients of successful shopping centers and the amount of side shop space to up-and-down markets has not been an issue for the better shopping centers, the A centers that have performed better. So we want to own shopping centers where we're not afraid of the shop space and we think we can merchandise it, and where we think we're going to have merchandising and pricing power on a go-forward basis.
Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay so going forward, Hap and Brian, I would assume you're saying that you think the small shop leasing will actually continue to be -- should steady?
Brian M. Smith: Yes.
Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay, and then the second question I have is on the grocery store business. I mean you guys have any thoughts, maybe broader thoughts on what you're seeing with grocers, and how you view the grocery business right now?
Bruce M. Johnson: I think that the grocery business is extremely competitive. The traditional supermarkets that aren't dominant in their market are not doing well and they're losing share, obviously, to Wal-Mart, to Costco, to the higher end supermarket, et cetera. So our focus is threefold. Number one, it's the dominant kind of traditional supermarket, it's got a dominant share like a Publix in Florida, even Safeway in California. So we look at that, Kroger in a lot of markets. Then secondly, the upper-end supermarkets, grocery stores, especially supermarkets like Whole Foods, like Trader Joe's. In both cases that are generating -- very productive in generating a significant amount of sales. And then thirdly, the locations, and most important of all locations it is, as Brian says, if something bad happens, we're the going to get the space back and be able to release it to a better operator.
Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: So overall, you feel pretty good about your grocery exposure at this point?
Bruce M. Johnson: Yes, but it is something that we watch very rigorously and monitor all the time. It's a changing landscape, but we feel in general very good about our real estate and/or our operators.
Operator: And we'll now take our next question from Paula Poskon with Robert W. Baird.
Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Apologies if I missed this in your earlier comments. Could you explain why the 2013 projected development completions, the amount was revised downward a little bit?
Lisa Palmer: I mean -- I don't know the exact project that may have fallen out. But I'm happy, Paula, to get back to you on that. I mean the only thing I can think is if we pulled something forward, if this 2012 came up because our developments are performing well in-line with expectations. In fact they're also exceeding expectations, so we'll -- I'll get back to you on that.
Bruce M. Johnson: And that very well could have happened.
Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: And then just a follow-up on the first question about G&A, maybe just to ask it a little bit differently. How scalable do you think the existing platform is? How much in -- how much could you grow the asset base without a substantial investment in -- at the corporate level?
Bruce M. Johnson: We can meaningfully grow the asset base without a meaningful growth in P&A.
Lisa Palmer: I'm sorry let me just come back to you. I do have the guidance page in front of me, and that's exactly what happened. We actually increased completions for 2012, so we brought 1 forward.
Bruce M. Johnson: And as Lisa said our developments are performing extremely well.
Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And can you just kind of quantify what meaningful means? Is it -- could you double the portfolio or 50% or...
Bruce M. Johnson: Well, I think that it's a very scalable business, and I think we could easily grow it by 20%, 25% with de minimis increases in G&A. And we're not looking although if we can grow smartly and in a way that's going to grow NAV, it's something we'd like to do. But as far as growth for growth sake, it's not an important objective here, but I would say that we feel that we have the capacity to grow very efficiently. Especially -- and you can look at our footprint and the fact that we have 17 offices throughout the country, we're well postured throughout the country to build on that platform. If the right opportunities, both on the investment side and on the finance side, present themselves.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Jim Sullivan with Cowen.
James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: First, I wanted to make comment to Bruce. Bruce, we've worked together for a long time. You've always been an absolutely great guy to work with. I think you're a class act and we're certainly going to miss harassing you every 90 days or so, so make sure you stay in touch. And I have a couple of questions I guess for Brian and Lisa. First of all, Brian, when you talked about the leasing business in the quarter, you cited a couple of transactions that were a little unusual but helped to drive that rent spread. I'm just curious, and I think when you've commented about that, you talk about large boxes and I'm just curious whether -- where we are in terms of coming off the bottom. I mean, back a year or 2 ago, there was obviously a lot of large box vacancies you had to fill and a lot of that has been done and there's been some commentary that some of the weakness in development starts was the result of large box availability that was out there. I'm just curious if you feel pretty confident that given the increases in occupancy rates across your portfolio and the industry as a whole, that we're going to see perhaps, I don't want to say material, but maybe a meaningful increase in development starts as you work -- as you look out over the next year and what the implications are for yields on [indiscernible].
Brian M. Smith: I must the last part, Jim, could you -- the outlook for what?
James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: The outlook for the yields on development. Obviously, you've had -- a number of the big boxes we've been hearing at ICSC conferences and otherwise, have been reluctant to step up and pay the kind of rents that you guys need in order to get acceptable yields on development. And that was especially the case given that there was a lot of vacancy to be had in the first case. So now that, that vacancy has pretty much been eliminated or has back down to more historical levels, are the tenants feeling confident enough about their business to step up to the kind of rents you need to get acceptable yields and ramp-up your development?
Brian M. Smith: Well, let me start with our portfolio. We only have 10 boxes left, and it totals about 300,000 square feet. So when you look at ours and you look at in the bigger picture, I think what you're seeing here is a microcosm of what's happening in the -- across the country is that the top space is gone and what we have left is -- we're going to have to -- is going to take a little bit longer to get through that. Because of that, you are seeing the boxes looking for external growth that they -- because they haven't been able to get the same kind of growth as they had from taking second generation space. I think a good example of that is Dick's. Dick's has always been one of those operators that took second generation space and we're doing several deals with them in first generation space. The issue is where will they do and what will they pay and they really go hand-in-hand. The only place they're going to pay the rents that can support new development are where they can generate the sales and that's more in the urban areas. So I think that's really the governor right now, is keeping development down. There's just -- I mean not only are developers having trouble with financing the equity requirements, but new development requires, to your point, the kind of rents, and those rents can only be generated not in the secondary and tertiary markets. So I don't think you're going to see a big explosion of development at all, at least that in the next 12 to 18 months.
James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: To what extent also -- kind of a follow-up on the same question, the ability to do Greenfield developments in new housing communities, to what extent as we've began to see a ramp in single-family permitting, does that lead you to maybe be a little more confident, as well that on that side of the development opportunity spectrum you'll have more opportunities over the next year or 2?
Brian M. Smith: I think what you'll see in emerging residential markets is we'll only probably do it the way we're doing it at Grand Ridge and Cinco Ranch, where those are master-planned communities with high barriers to entry, extremely high at Grand Ridge, and they've already got enough homes to support the retail, which I think is a different approach than happened at the peak of the market when people started tying up the retail land and building on the anticipation of those homes coming. And Jim the question I didn't answer that you asked earlier was the outlook on returns and I would say for the kind of places we're looking to build, the -- I would say the norm is probably in the 8.5% range, which is still probably about 60% profit margin given exit cap rates.
Bruce M. Johnson: [indiscernible] it's obviously, a little lower than that.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Tammi Fique with Wells Fargo Securities.
Tamara J. Fique - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I just want to come back to the rental rate growth guidance given. Obviously, there was a big swing in part due to the big increase in the third quarter of 13.7%. But has something changed in the last 90 days to give you and your team more confidence in pushing rents? Have you reached an inflection point in occupancy?
Brian M. Smith: We have in some markets I think 60% of our markets we're now 95% leased or more. And I think things are trending the right way for us with that 95% occupancy in those markets, we're gaining more pricing power as supply demand tightens. We've now got 6 quarters in a row of positive rent growth and as Hap mentioned 80% of our markets -- in 80% of our leases had positive rent growth. This quarter was unusually strong. It's unusual that we would find that many anchor leases with the kind of growth that we had. Those were all really in anticipation of redevelopments, but even without those, we were positive, as I said, low-to-mid 4% range and our shop space was positive. So I don't think there's a massive change. I think it continues to be an improvement in the fundamentals and going forward, I think you would expect to see rent growth in the next 12 months, probably in the mid-single-digit range.
Bruce M. Johnson: Yes. I think we're kind of halfway there, mid single-digit growth on our way to 10% rent growth hopefully maybe not next year, but hopefully the following year in 2014.
Tamara J. Fique - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay, and then last quarter you talked about strategic move out, does that continue to be a part of your strategy?
Brian M. Smith: It's definitely a part of the strategy and we're exercising it far more often than we have in the past. As occupancy tightens up, and as the demand continues to be strong, wherever we've got those placeholders, as we call them, that we've put in there -- when we gave them rent concessions, we are moving them out when we have a tenant that we view as a significant upgrade in quality and/or quality. Lots of examples of that this quarter. Quiznos has been a struggling chain and we got rid of several of them in the portfolio this quarter. An example, with Hollymead we replaced them with a better operator and the sales are 5x higher. We did it in many other locations where we not only got better operators, but we've got a nice double-digit rent growth.
Tamara J. Fique - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. Are -- just looking over to dispositions. Of the $120 million that seem to be on the cuff [ph] for sale or being marketed, what -- are those being sold individually or is that a portfolio?
Brian M. Smith: Those are being sold individually.
Tamara J. Fique - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then your recovery rate has been ticking up each quarter and now sits above the guidance range for the year. What should we expect going forward?
Lisa Palmer: Remember, I think we've told you all in the past that as occupancy increases, we basically see a like increase in recovery rates. And also credit to our team, we've done some things that haven't allowed us to increase our recovery rate and hopefully our tenants are not listening. So I think that you would see we're from an up -- from a same-property recovery rate, we're in the high -- we're close to 78% and we would expect to maintain that.
Tamara J. Fique - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: So you will be above the guidance range that's in your supplement?
Lisa Palmer: Again, if you will consider there's been an improvement each quarter and the range is 76% to 78%. I'm talking same-property only. And we would expect to continue to see that strong recovery rate. Within the range.
Operator: We'll now take our next question from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Just a follow-up on the disposition question. Just sounds like you're selling -- the rest of what you're selling this year is individual assets. Just wondering what you're seeing as far as the sweet spots for demand for sort of non-core assets. In terms of geography as well sort of the size of the assets, and that kind of thing.
Brian M. Smith: Did you say for non-core assets?
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Right.
Brian M. Smith: Really what people want is in the BS is they're looking for returns. So what they're hoping to do is to be able to buy them at, say, 7% on existing income, 8% on existing income and then if they can get that up to 9% through releasing, then they're real happy. So I think the pricing is typically -- depends on the quality, but anywhere from the higher end of the B spectrum, maybe 7% and at the lower end, maybe 8%. And then in terms of markets, we're -- I don't really see that much of a difference. We don't have anything in places like Arkansas and stuff like that, so I think there's pretty much -- people are looking for opportunities in any markets.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay, and then in terms of the total size of the deal value, I mean is it like a $50 million is a sweet spot, a little bit less than that?
Brian M. Smith: I'd say it's less than that, although when you look at who we've been selling to, we've been selling to private buyers, private REITs, pension fund advisors, investment advisors and other retailers. You've got 2 properties we've sold now to grocers. So it all depends. Obviously, the pension funds would probably look to put out more money, the private buyers would be looking at more in the probably $20 million, $25 million range.
Bruce M. Johnson: And one of the key things, what's financeable, and I would say that so-called commodity product of what's available for financing from a CMBS standpoint has expanded meaningfully, maybe not dramatically.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. That's very helpful and just one last question on the quarter. I know we've talked about it a lot and most the upside, sounds like it's coming from better operating performance, but I just wanted to confirm. Were there any expense items in the quarter that might not be recurring going forward, true-ups that kind of thing?
Lisa Palmer: No, nothing out of the ordinary.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll now move to Steve Sakwa with ISI Group.
Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Bruce, congratulations and I'm sure you'll enjoy the Q-T-R as you move into the next phase of your life. I guess I had a question -- you guys talked a lot about the leasing spreads so I'll kind of turn my attention maybe more to just kind of the acquisitions and really the institutional kind of partner market. You guys have a lot of different institutional ventures and we've seen other companies be able to take advantage of those as kind of built-in acquisitions opportunities. And I'm just wondering what kind of discussions you might be having with the existing partners, as to their kind of exit plans and if you thought some of those might materialize sooner rather than later?
Lisa Palmer: I'll take that. When you think about our partners, we really have a few really major partners. We've got GRI, which is First Washington, and CalPERS. And we have CalSTRS state of Oregon, they're our really -- they're our most significant partners and every single one of them have the same objective of holding real estate long-term as we do. They may be in a recycling mode, for example, Oregon, has, again, similar to the Regency strategy. The other 2 would like to grow rather than be a source of acquisitions for Regency. We do have the [indiscernible] properties and we had talked earlier about potentially selling those even this year and it's been decided that we're going to hold those for at least, call it the medium-term. So there are no opportunities at this time, for us to grow through acquiring properties through any of our partnerships. And if anything we may incrementally grow those that have the demand. If you'll recall from a couple of quarters ago, CalSTRS recently committed an additional $100 million of equity to us, which is a vote of confidence in our partnership.
Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Well I guess that kind of leads to maybe the second question. Just what -- kind of what is their appetite, Lisa? And have their return hurdles changed? What kind of product and what kind of returns are they asking you to kind of look for? What's in their wheelhouse today?
Lisa Palmer: Exactly what Regency would be looking for and as we've had conversations in the past, we are -- we have a rotation basis, if you will, for acquisition opportunities and we are obligated to show our acquisition opportunities to CalSTRS and to the state of Oregon, and then Regency would be the third in that rotation. And to the extent that, for example, we bought Lake Grove earlier this year, to the extent that maybe it's a larger asset or a new market, we may look to one of our other partners to co-invest with us, but that's at our option. And we did do that with GRI for that asset. But to the extent of what they're looking for, their objectives are aligned with ours. So our acquisitions team is out there in the market and they have the same mandate and it's blind to who will be the actual applier of that.
Bruce M. Johnson: And having consistency of that purpose we think makes it a lot easier on our acquisition team and our management and leasing teams.
Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: So, Lisa, if I can just ask you to be a little more specific financially, like kind of range of cap rates or IRR hurdles would be what for those kind of institutional partners?
Lisa Palmer: Steve, if you can call them and ask them and get them to give you a number, we'd love it. They're actually -- I mean they're never that specific, right? Real estate is going to depend on each and every asset, but if you think about what we've talked about, we're looking at -- well, look at our -- the asset we just bought in Southern California in San Diego. It was going in approximately a 5%, but with the potential redevelopment, well, the actual redevelopment, we're going to be able to grow that, stabilize yields close to 6%, an incremental return on capital north of 8%. That gets you to, call it, an IRR unlevered in the 7% range, and I think that, that's -- that would meet a hurdle today.
Operator: We'll now take a follow-up from Michael Bilerman.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Brian, just on the leasing in the quarter, just Page 23 of the sub. Can you just peel back the onion a little bit on the 220,000 square feet of new leases? I think you talked about how big box and clearly, just by the term of 16 years. Can you just sort of give a little bit more color on that 33% rent growth? It doesn't seem like PIs were anything big at all to get those leases and sort of what it represented?
Brian M. Smith: Sure. Well, with regard to the rent growth, that was all -- we've got about 5 redevelopments coming up, Michael, and there's 7 anchor tenants that are part of this redevelopments. And it's just taking those from very old -- for example, down in South Florida, we have a Publix anchorage center and a Walgreens, and those are just very, very old leases and we're writing new leases and actually giving them new spaces and just taking them up to market. So there was like a 170,000 square feet of those and the weighted average rent growth was about 180%.
Lisa Palmer: And I would -- and I'll just add color that despite that, rent growth is -- even when you strip those out, rent growth was still positive 3 -- 4% for the quarter, 3% for the year and over 80% of our leases had positive rent growth.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Right, and we can see that in the renewals you've been marching up, right? Was there anything particular in the renewals for those to be up 5% or that's continuing the same trend? And your TIs are down also, only at $0.18.
Brian M. Smith: That's right. I mean there's nothing unusual there.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And then just one quick question, just on bad debt. It's still extraordinarily the provisions for doubtful accounts. It was up over last year, it's still year-to-date lower than where you were. Is there anything in this quarter's number that we should be mindful of, or was it really just 3Q '11 being awfully low.
Lisa Palmer: Yes. It was more of '11 being low. There's nothing unusual. I mean generally speaking, our tenants are much healthier. There aren't any surprises.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take another follow-up from Samit Parikh.
Samit Parikh - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Just following up on the question about the recovery rate previously. Back in 2006, 2005, just asking a different way, your NOI margins were still materially higher than they are today. And I understand that as occupancy increases you should see that coming back. Do you think that your margins as you increase closer to 95 plus percent occupancy can go back to where they were 5 years ago? And is that part of your long-term NOI growth model?
Lisa Palmer: We're not seeing any significant changes in terms of actually recovering operating expenses. And to the point about margins, and we've talked about this internally, ground leases actually are in the expenses line items. So it actually negatively impacts your recovery rate and we recently have acquired a couple of properties that are on ground leases and that unfortunately is a permanent change for as long as we own those properties. So maybe we can do a better job of disclosing that to help you get to a more sustainable recovery rate and it's something we'll talk about internally. Because there's no significant change in terms of actual margin on operating expenses. If anything from -- if we were to get back to 95%, I would say we've improved that.
Operator: And it appears there are no further questions. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Hap Stein for any additional or closing remarks.
Martin E. Stein: We thank you for participating on the call. Have a great weekend, and we thank you, Bruce.
Operator: And that does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

Operator: Please standby. Ladies and gentlemen, good day. Welcome to the Regency Centers Corporation Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Please note, today’s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your moderator, Senior Vice President, Capital Markets, Lisa Palmer. Please go ahead.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon everyone. Good morning to those of who are on the West Coast. Thank you for joining us. On the call this afternoon are Hap Stein, Chairman and CEO; Brian Smith, President and COO; Bruce Johnson, CFO; and Chris Leavitt, Senior Vice President and Treasurer. As always before we start, I’d like to address forward-looking statements that may be discussed on the call. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in these forward-looking statements. Hap?
Martin Stein: Thank you Lisa and good afternoon and good morning to those, not on the East Coast. I’m extremely encouraged by the continued and significant progress that is been made towards the key objectives in all aspects of our business. We realized another quarter of improving operating fundamentals. It is gratifying that these results are meeting Regency’s higher performance standards. While Brian will spend more time in this area, I want to highlight a few key accomplishments that are evidenced of the quality of the portfolio and the focus of Regency’s management team. Leasing volumes remain robust. We continue to strengthening of our smaller shop spaces. Percent leased reached 94% for the first time since 2008. Bad debt expense is still trending towards pre-recession levels. And pricing power well uneven is steadily moving in our favor. These improved underlined fundamentals translated in the same property NOI growth on a year-to-date basis of 3.8%. In addition to the positive operating results of our portfolio, the $300 million of developments started since the beginning of 2009, continue to register impressive performance. Currently they are more than 90% leased with projected average returns on the incremental basis of 9.3%. I really like the four developments started this year, which will ultimately represent an investment of close to $150 million and create meaningful value for our shareholders. These new developments reflect latencies narrowed focus on building and redeveloping dominant in field shopping centers with demonstrated demand from best-in-class retailers. Substantial progress was made on executing our clearly articulated capital recycling strategy; it has also enabled us to further strengthen the balance sheet. Last week, we closed on the $321 million portfolio sale. Bruce and Brian will describe this in more detail as well as how this and other recent impending recycling transactions are enhancing what was already a higher quality portfolio and its future NOI growth. Together with acquisitions to date and those in our pipeline, we will have meaningfully increase the allocation of capital to dominant centers with good prospects in core markets while lowering our exposure to nonstrategic assets and markets, and reducing debt. We think caution with the balance sheet to lower leverage makes sense given the uncertainty that we are all experiencing and seeing in today’s world. Most important of all, despite the dilutive impact from the portfolio sale being a significant net seller and operating at a lower level of leverage we will be even better positioned the compound per share Core FFO including moderate growth in 2013 by sustaining growth 2.5% to 3.5% from our portfolio of dominant centers with annual gross or anchor sales averaging more in $26 million and $500 per square foot and Trade area household incomes of approximately $100,000 in average population densities of 100,000 people and those aren’t future targets that’s the existing portfolio and a key metrics of full network portfolio. Bi-annually developing a $150 million to $200 million of dominant shopping centers at compelling returns on invested capital brings a unique combination of in house capabilities, presence in key markets, anchoring retailer relationships, an impressive track record. And opportunistically enhancing and already solid balance sheet in excess to capital and lastly by continuing the focus energy from our dedicated and talented team towards achieving these critical goals and objectives. I also want to note that since the portfolio sale was at a minimum NAV neutral in the short term the growth we are generating NOI and the value being created from developments should translate into 5% plus growth in per share NAV this year and into the future. Bruce.
Bruce Johnson: Thank you Hap good afternoon everyone. From our financial results perspective we had a really good second quarter. Core FFO per share was $0.69 which was higher than our stated guidance range. Continued improvement in operating fundamentals was a principal driver with same property NOI growing by 3.6% this quarter – 85% of the same property growth came from increased space rent and the remainder was mostly lower bad debt expense. As we mentioned in last quarter’s call, we changed the fiscal year of our captive insurance company to end in April. As a result, we recognized the revenue in the second quarter of this year rather than in the third quarter as we’ve done in prior years. This was incorporated in our second quarter guidance and made up the majority of the current quarter increase and other income. Going forward, the revenue will be recognized quarterly in an estimated run rate of between 600 and $1 million and as always will not be included in the same property NOI. On the capital market side, we extended our option to draw the remaining balance of the term loans of January 2013. After quarter end we used the proceeds from the portfolio to pay down the $120 million of our revolving credit facility and to pay off the $150 million balance in our term loan, but still retain the right to draw the remaining commitment of $100 million. The net result is accessing nearly $700 million of available capacity. Our balance sheet is now in even better shape with no significant near-term maturities. And given today’s uncertain, the uncertainty of today’s world, we intend to preserve a substantial portion of the increased availability in our bank facilities to opportunistic capital market activity. Turning to the portfolio sale, this was an important transaction that will provide us with long-term benefits. To summarize a few key details of the sale; we sold 15 properties to an affiliate of Blackstone, representing 2.1 million square feet for $321 million. The properties were wholly-owned, unencumbered and 90.5% leased. And as part of the transaction we’ve retained a $47.5 million preferred equity investment in the portfolio that earns a 10.5% annual return. The investment is callable by Regency after 12 months and by either party after 18 months. With this sale, we took advantage of an opportunity to efficiently accelerate the disposition of non-strategic assets, and reduce leverage. The dilutive impact of this accelerated capital recycling, and lower leverage is partially offset by improved NOI overgrowth, allowing us to maintain a lower end of the range of core FFO per share guidance. We also increased guidance for percent leased, which is now 93.5% to 94.5%. While we expect same property NOI growth to moderate in the third and fourth quarters from our year-to-date rate of 3.8%,we have increased our full-year guidance to 2.8% to 3.8%. Brian?
Brian Smith: Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon. While we are certainly aware of the weakened economy, and are closely monitoring our portfolio, we’ve yet to see any signs of deteriorating tenant health or shrinking retailer demand for space. The leasing volumes remain very strong including the developments we leased more than 2.1 million square feet of space on a gross basis including almost 1 million square feet of new leases. To put that in context, that’s nearly 60% more than the quarterly average of total new leasing since 2006. We have substantial net absorption in the operating portfolio picking up a 160,000 square feet of leased space in the quarter and building on the momentum of the previous three quarters. In fact, when compared to the second quarter of last year, same-property percent leased increased to 170 basis points, which represents a half million square feet of net absorption. What’s even more notable are the gains we’ve made and are continuing to make in small shop leasing. Spaces less than 10,000 square feet gained 280 basis points year-over-year and are now 87% leased. All signs point to a continuation of this progress. Our pipeline and leasing activity remains robust and as a percentage of vacant space, it is even stronger than it was at this time last year. Rent growth increased and average base rents for shop space were positive, both for the fifth consecutive quarter. And accounts receivable balances over 90 days continue to fall and are now less than three-tenths of a percent of revenues. I say this really just to give you a further indication of the health of our tenants. Lisa, Bruce, Hap and I have the good fortune to work with a team of experience and diligent asset managers, who are proactively monitoring our tenant’s health. So the well publicized Supervalu issues have certainly not caught us by surprise. What we’ve learnt from prior tenant failures is that the underlying real estate can provide insulation to the poor performance or bankruptcy of individual operators. With respect to the Supervalu exposure in our portfolio, we believe that significant majority of their stores are in high quality properties, where we anticipate readily finding good replacements. And in most cases, we would expect the rent spreads to be positive since our current Supervalu leases are on average more than 20 years old. Turning to developments, I would like to take a moment to reiterate our development strategy. Development is a core competency and a competitive advantage sets us apart in a way to create value for our shareholders. Our right-sized and more disciplined strategy is focused on creating dominant shopping centers intended to be held long term and located in target markets with instilled characteristics. The performance is more than $300 billion of development, redevelopment, and expansion starts in the last few years underscores the success of the strategy. Developments and value add redevelopments started since 2009 are currently over 90% leased and committed and have generated an average return on invested capital of 9.3% and that’s with three quarters of these projects still under construction. As you know these returns from high-quality centers would be impossible to replicate through acquisitions. Further the properties that were in process at the end of 2011 have gone from 58% to 85% leased in the first two quarters of this year. That’s a lot of leasing in the short period of time, and reflective of the quality of developments. And looking at this quarter’s two new development starts, the first Erwin Square in Durham, North Carolina is a (inaudible) center. This is an excellent infill opportunity and established business district adjacent to Duke University. Already nearly 75% of the centers either leased or committed with Harris Peter as the anchor, and many best-in-class retailers taking shop space. The second Grand Ridge Plaza located in one of the most desirable areas of Seattle, Washington is a much anticipated infill town center positioned next door to a planned Microsoft campus, and part of a high-end master plan community. With average household incomes in excess of $130,000 and extreme development barriers, this is a prime example of the type of community center development that we would undertake. Anchor tenants include Safeway, Regal Cinemas Dick’s Sporting Goods, Alter and Marshall’s Home Goods combination store. Despite having just broken ground, we have leases in various stages of negotiation for over 90% of the leasable area including executive with top notch local and national operators. Now I’d like to share some color on the portfolio sale, in essence the portfolio was comprised of properties that are not consistent with our current investment strategy and don’t enjoy the long term NOI growth potential of the vast majority of our existing portfolio or of the shopping centers that we are buying and developing. Population densities and average household incomes for these assets are 55,000 people and $80,000 respectively compared to roughly a 100,000 people in incomes of $100,000 for our portfolio as a whole. Grocery sales for the portfolio assets averaged $21 million compared to $26 million for our total portfolio. Several of the centers located in non-core markets like California Central Valley and Inland Empire and Akron, Ohio. In some instances we had concerns regarding the amount of shop space, rents in relation to market, the suitability or productivity of the anchor tenant and co-tenancy and kick-out issues. On the acquisition front, we’re negotiating the purchase of four dominant shopping centers, if we are successful; Regency’s total investment for the centers will be in the $200 million range. Each is an exceptional property with superior growth prospects that together are expected to compound NOI in excess of 3%. The average household incomes in three mile populations of these centers are well above those of the properties we’ve sold and most importantly, grocery sales for the four centers average $1,000 per square foot. Given these attributes we expect the dominant shopping centers that we’re buying to generate substantially higher NOI growth and those being still being sold. In time the compounding higher NOI growth rate will overcome the initial earnings dilution and ultimately outperform. In summary, I’m proud of the results that the team has produced so far this year, by continuing to fill our vacancies with proven operators, acquiring and developing dominant shopping centers and disposing non-core centers, I believe the portfolio is in great shape and should be more resilient in the next downturn. Hap?
Martin Stein: Thank you, Brian, and thank you, Bruce. In closing, while one cannot ignore the uncertainty in the macro-environment, I’m extremely encouraged about the continued and significant progress that is being made to our key objectives of growing NOI, of creating value, and dominant centers to disciplined development, of enhancing the quality of the portfolio and its NOI growth with focused recycling and of strengthening the solid balance sheet with reliable access to capital, which when we combined will translate into growth in per share core funds from operations and NAV. It is gratifying that these results are meeting Regency’s high performance standards and positioning us well for the future whether it would be prospering in a growing economy even if the growth is sluggish or weathering another recession. We thank you for joining us on the call and now welcome your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We will take our first caller from Paul Morgan, Morgan Stanley.
Paul Morgan – Morgan Stanley: Hi. Good afternoon. On the dispositions, I’ve just a couple of questions. First in terms of the Blackstone deal, why did you put the lifestyle centers there in Texas and did that with those at below the cap rate of the average, I mean and if so. If not is there a pinch of roll down there and maybe the cap rate looks higher than it otherwise would be for certain newly developed centers. And then second why the sale of the San Pedro asset?
Martin Stein: The San Pedro asset, I’ll start with that I mean that was in a partnership and partner center was timed to sell and we had major capital improvements to in effect maintain and continue to the NOI growth rate on that asset. We put together this portfolio and we felt it was – bottom line, we’re pleased with the sale that occurred and not because we feel that we sold Blackstone a bill of goods but because it really – the sale met our objectives. It was an efficient transaction, with certainty of closed and the assets as Brian mentioned is not – is not up to the standards as far as 100,000 householder income, the supermarket sales in our portfolio and density. And as Brian said that – they don’t have the growth potential. And there is some risks which obviously Blackstone is very aware of including the anchor co-tenancy in shops placing for example, I’ll talk about the one – one of the Lifestyle centers there the shops that have in village, as you may and may not be aware, Blackstone is added or signed a lease with Whole Foods to go in there and we’re obviously aware Whole Foods interest we communicated their interest to Blackstone. But still given the rents, the risk associated with co-tenancies in (inaudible), although there is not higher probability those risks are going to manifest themselves into occurrence, we just were not comfortable with the amount of management time, or the consequences if something went wrong by – by continuing to hold the assets.
Paul Morgan – Morgan Stanley: Okay. Thanks. My other question just on core, I mean, you’re seeing kind of great results in terms of occupancy, and same-store NOI, the rent growth on new leases has been kind of stubborn and I’m wondering if you’re seeing any potential for movement there, obviously they seem to be dragged down by some of the older vacancies, but given your leasing velocity in the commentary, do you think that we could see that turning positive over the next several quarters?
Martin Stein: We definitely think that’s possible. As you indicate, we have – we aren’t yet seeing the levels we want to see, but – but we’re really talking about your pricing power and there’s no question that – that power is improving that the trend is in the right direction and we have had five consecutive quarters of positive rent growth, and 80% of the transactions this – this past quarter were positive rent growth. So, what’s still holding us back a little bit would be as with anybody, some large deals they always – they always move the needle. For example, we had to put in a new we had to renew medical user at Martin Downs 40,000 square feet and in order to get that property sold as we look a hit there and we’ve got – that we’ve got some significant negative spreads on leasing activity in Arizona. But, rent growth is all about leverage and we are hearing from across the country the return on leverage, multiple tenants competing for spaces. You can see the demand for the shopping centers, more and more, the properties are getting to 95% level where we do have pricing power. And we’re starting to exercise lot termination rights that’s allowing us put in better tenants, strategic move outs, and that also can give us better options in the future. So, we aren’t there yet, but I do think the trend is heading more (inaudible).
Paul Morgan – Morgan Stanley: Great, thanks.
Martin Stein: Thank you.
Operator: Okay. Now, let’s go to JP Morgan, Michael Mueller.
Michael Mueller – JP Morgan: Hi. First question, it seems like you’re gaining good traction on Gradn Ridge leasing further developments, but when you’re looking at new starts today what are you underwriting for a period to ultimately stabilize the project, and how does that compared to which you’re underwriting for the downturn?
Martin Stein: Again, it depends on the property on the ones where we have 10,000, 14,000 and 15,000 square feet, we’re obviously going to underwrite it a little bit to happen faster than if we have more square footage. But in all cases, we’re looking to put the amount of shop space in there that would allow us to lease that up, and get to 95% within no more than two years from the first anchor opening.
Bruce Johnson: And we’d like to see good visibility, and a good probability of making that within a year.
Martin Stein: Yeah.
Michael Mueller – JP Morgan: Okay, great. And then the second question – oh, sorry go ahead.
Martin Stein: You go ahead.
Michael Mueller – JP Morgan: Yeah, I was going to say in the second question the $200 million in acquisitions that you referenced the four properties, are they individual transactions, or is that a portfolio?
Martin Stein: Those are individual transactions.
Michael Mueller – JP Morgan: Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator: Let’s go to Quentin Velleley with Citi.
Quentin Velleley – Citi: Hi, good afternoon. Just speaking to Blackstone transaction, in terms of the (inaudible) and you sort of commented that they were lower gross assets, could you maybe quantify that a little bit more with a sort of – were you expecting sort of flat NOI or even negative NOI over the next five to seven years versus 2.5% to 3% growth in your portfolio, is that how you are thinking about it?
Martin Stein: I think looking at is flat NOI, may be some upside, but there is also after that – but as also I indicated there is some risk to that and once again Blackstone is a very astute buyer and from their perspective I’m sure they feel like they made a good profit of the transaction, achieved our objectives and from our point of view it was a win-win transaction and, but I think the best way to look at that from our perspective is flat in (inaudible).
Quentin Velleley – Citi: Did you offer Blackstone substantially more assets, or where they easy on the assets that they’ve got?
Martin Stein: This was the portfolio and there were actually thinking.
Quentin Velleley – Citi: Okay and then just lastly on dispositions given the ramp this year, how should we be thinking about 2013 and beyond, you sort of going to get back to a more normalized $100 million or $200 million of dispositions or given where capital markets are at the moment and given where risk is in some of the super market retailers should we expect to see this kind of volume of dispositions next year and beyond?
Martin Stein: I think we feel real good about what we accomplished and that was one of the reasons why we wanted to do an efficient transaction like this and large transaction and I think it’s – in our view as you just said I think we feel comfortable with where we are and that we are going to be able get back to a more normalized rate of dispositions in $150 million to $200 million range.
Quentin Velleley – Citi: That’s it. Thank you.
Operator: Let’s go now to Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.
Tayo Okusanya – Jefferies: Hi. Yes. Good afternoon, two quick questions. First of all the $200 million of upcoming acquisitions, could you let us know what cap rate that is, at what cap rates those transactions are being done at?
Martin Stein: Well, they are not finalized yet, but they are – I think you may have seen we slightly reduced our guidance on more acquisitions with these. So you can mention they are lower than what we’ve done so far. And so let me just dwell in that a moment, the whole reason that we are doing this – the key objective is to maintain sustainable NOI growth of 2.5% to 3.5%, and the capital recycling including the acquisitions there are a key component of that. We want to buy a kind of shopping centers that are highest quality because our experience is they generate the most growth. So what we’re doing we price those as we look at total return from the asset, so we look at the initial return, plus the average compounded growth rate over the 10-year period. So the only way we can get to those to forward lower cap rate deals would be if these properties are going to generate higher growth rate, so that’s – and the properties that we’re buying just then, and we are not done with them while we do control them all, but we are going through due diligence, you just don’t know what may happen there. They are all A plus locations, one is the generational kind of product that just does not come on the market, but every 30 years or so, and one has redevelopment component, so those are the kind of ways that were getting to the growth and much of these is either through redevelopment contractual anchors.
Bruce Johnson: And our growth expectation is on the higher end of the 2.5% to 3.5% range sometimes above that especially the one property that has the redevelopment opportunity.
Tayo Okusanya – Jefferies: Got it, that’s helpful. And then on the small shop space like – could you just talk little bit about opportunities, (inaudible) consolidate small shop space for tenants kind of looking for more kind of 15,000 to 20,000 square feet of space whether you’re kind of seeing a lot of that kind of demand.
Martin Stein: We always look for that. We have several examples of that this past quarter. We have three different centers where we had small shops – three small shops in each case where we consolidate them, some were just tenants that we had given a rent release too, and had termination rights, we triggered them. In three of those situations, we all put in larger pet stores line Petco. And we had a situation in Maryland where we had three small spaces, and we terminated a couple, relocated one to make room for Michael’s. So, we look for that as often as we can do it, but I think more than just to be clear about that, more often than not, we’re playing offence with that as it relates to merchandising, and as it relates to rent growth, not it relates to because we scared in this space.
Tayo Okusanya – Jefferies: Got it. Okay, thank you very much.
Martin Stein: Thank you.
Operator: Let’s go on to Cowen & Company, Jim Sullivan.
Jim Sullivan – Cowen & Company: Hi. Good morning. First of all, may question for Brian, kind of a follow-up to the comment you just made about the 2.5% to 3.5% same-store NOI growth rate, when we look back at the prior cycle from the – I think 2005 to 2007 or so, the same property NOI growth rate was averaging pretty close to 3.5%, and I know every cycle is different, and it maybe that the uncertainties today are causing the people to be a little more conservative, but given how your occupancy is ramping, and you’ve mentioned that I think in your prepared comments pricing flexibility, are you pretty optimistic that we’re going to have a period here where we should see multiyear same property NOI growth in excess of 3%?
Brian Smith: Yes, yes. We – for the reason we talked about, I mean occupancy can drive right now. We do have contractual rent steps that have helped us throughout the period, good times and bad. And then we are seeing the pricing power for the rent growth so that plus we’ve significantly upgraded the quality of the portfolio. We’ll continue to do that. I think we have better retailers. We’re going to be able to drive sales better. We got more productive grocers so, but I think, yes.
Martin Stein: I think we’ve given a range of 2.5 to 3.5, but I think the expectation of being on the upper hand of that as long as the economy holds together is realistic.
Jim Sullivan – Cowen & Company: Okay. And second question, obviously Supervalu has been in the news recently and there’s always one or other supermarket chain that seems to be losing market share and suffering and – and I’m just curious given what we’ve been through and obviously you guys maintained a very substantial development pipeline for many years when – when the cycle was strong. I just wonder as you think through formats and as formats change and the industry buffer grocers as well is total center size, what can we expect or should we expect going forward in terms of your appetite for either the larger supermarket formats or the larger format centers altogether? I’m talking about in terms of what do you want to commit to in terms of your development pipeline?
Martin Stein: I think when we started this quarter is indicative of an infill grocery-anchored neighborhood shopping center in Duke – University of Duke Medical Center and a larger format grocery-anchored, multi-anchored center in one of the better areas of Seattle.
Bruce Johnson: Yeah. Jim, we want to make sure that where we can, we want to focus on – on the grocery-anchored shopping centers. Now it so happens, that would typically be a neighborhood center and we wanted to do in infill locations or those areas with strong infill characteristics. But if you look at this acquirer, the centers in Seattle, that one is a community center, but it does have the leading grocery store up there in Safeway and it is such a high barrier to market, the last shopping center was built in that area was 20 years ago. It’s a 100% lease now. This will take you years and years, so we’re really comfortable to develop a larger center in that kind of space, but the focus is on grocery anchor centers.
Jim Sullivan – Cowen & Company: And, in general if you’re – if the focus is infill presumably it’s difficult to find these sites, I know you have to work on them for a long time and getting approvals can take a long time, and as you think about what kind of level of development starts you can ramp up to as the market strengthens, I’m assuming you’re still thinking it’s going to be well below what it was in the peak previously?
Bruce Johnson: Yes. Because, we were $500 million a year, we’re staff for that, we were capable of doing that, but you know that’s a very difficult problem or program to manage. We plan to be $150 million to $200 million a year to the extent we see opportunities greater than that, then we’re just going to start picking, which ones we like the best of those, and we do not plan to grow larger net, but we think, we’re there now, and the outlook for it starts down the road, it’s pretty promising.
Jim Sullivan – Cowen & Company: Okay. Then final question from me also on development, the level of quarterly development cost being capitalized is running about $2.5 million, I’m assuming we should assume that the path to the run rate that you will be at if you may maintain this level of development?
Bruce Johnson: That’s correct.
Jim Sullivan – Cowen & Company: Okay, thanks.
Operator: A question now from Samit Parikh, International Strategy & Investment Group.
Samit Parikh – International Strategy & Investment Group: Hey. Good morning. Wanted to see personally so if you could help me get to your guidance range with 3Q, I know that the cap to insurance will go down call it $0.04 to $0.05 of FFO sequentially, and then there is the Blackstone sale as well, but you know having difficulty getting from call it 69 core to sort of the mid-to-high point of your 55 to 59 range next quarter.
Martin Stein: I think it probably is related to disposition activity, primarily I think that that always going to be the difference when analysts can’t get to our numbers, our assumptions versus whatever you have been assuming.
Samit Parikh – International Strategy & Investment Group: Okay.
Bruce Johnson: Yeah, just really quickly because it’s have to – it is buried in the other income line. It was a little bit larger this year than it has been in typical years on a combination basis. It was north of $4 million, when I say combination; I mean what’s coming through equity income, pickup as well as on the consolidated income statement. So, a little bit larger than normal.
Samit Parikh – International Strategy & Investment Group: Okay. That’s helpful. And then I guess also could you comment maybe on Safeway and their plans on developing their own shopping centers. It seems like clearly they are developing in markets that you compete. How much of a sort of competitor are they for you guys to sort of gain these sites that going to develop on?
Martin Stein: Well, we know that the Safeway Development Team well. We like them. We respect them. In fact, a former employee or ours is part of that team. They are not new to development and we’ve been competing with them for some time probably 10 years ago, we competed with them on our Folsom and Tracy projects and we prevailed on those. They do obviously have a new focus and emphasis on it, but the reality is we don’t run into them very much and I think it’s just because we’re different. We’re focused on new round of dominant centers, anchored by however is the best grocer in the given market and Safeway focuses on Safeway Stores. So, that means where they have a store presence, they may not be very active. And from what we have seen in the market is that most of what they are doing and it just may not be (inaudible) access to whole pipeline, but most of our capital going to redevelopments or single tenant buildings or Safeway store maybe a fuel center, and so we don’t run it might the only two projects that I know of that we have competed with them recently with the Grand Ridge project in Seattle where they are going to be an anchor of it, and then we both went after the project in San Jose, and neither one of us got it. So I don’t think it’s like we just don’t run into them that much we could, and when that happens sellers make their own decisions as to what it is that they are looking for. I think personal relationships don’t matter solving seller’s problems or matters and then in the case of master planned community like Grand Ridge, I think the seller felt that having multiple relationships with different kinds of retailers was advanced in terms of creating an amenity for that community.
Samit Parikh – International Strategy & Investment Group: Okay. That’s all. Thank you.
Operator: RBC Capital Markets, Rich Moore please go ahead.
Rich Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Yeah. Hi. Good afternoon, guys. The two new development projects and once I guess you are looking at going forward. Are those primarily on land that you are identifying as new parcels of land that you want develop or do you have any legacy land in your portfolio that may also make its way to the development start status?
Bruce Johnson: Well. We certainly have legacy lands that we want to move into development, and I think we have about $60 million worth of that land with cost to date in land like that we plan to develop, but in terms of the ones that, that we are talking about this year or next year the vast majority of those would be new properties, in fact for 2012 they are all, they are all new except for the South Bay Village.
Martin Stein: Last year, we started the project in Petaluma, Southern Sonoma County, which was on land held, and we’re actively working on several other sites.
Rich Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Okay, fine, good. Thank you, guys. And then on the – on the Blackstone transaction, why the preferred position I mean what’s the rationale behind hanging onto that?
Martin Stein: Well, that was a transaction – that was a structure of the – they’ve all forgotten the – if you may or may not be real estate, using other transactions, where they bought properties and we negotiated that down to a short period of time of 12 to 18 months, and higher returns.
Rich Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Okay, and so they, yeah I was aware of it, I think it happened – and so they, just basically insist on the strategy like that?
Martin Stein: I wouldn’t go there, but that was part of – that was part of their offer.
Rich Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Okay, that’s it. Thank you.
Martin Stein: And that’s it – (inaudible) that’s the question where we ended up.
Rich Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Okay, I got it, thanks very much.
Martin Stein: Thank you.
Operator: Let’s move on to Cedrik Lachance with Green Street Advisors.
Cedrik Lachance – Green Street Advisors: Thanks. You acquired a small CVS property this quarter, I know it’s not a lot of money, but where is the strategy behind it?
Martin Stein: Yes Cedrik that was one that was brought to us by a joint venture partner we’ve done multiple developments with, and it was just – frankly just a no greater opportunity to get development returns with zero risk. I mean, it’s tight this quarter, it’s ground zero, in terms of Washington DC real estate, and that was the situation where the partner identified a building that because of very quick damage had been emptied out, three story office building, and we went ahead and bought that, we had the grocer take the center, I’m sorry, the grocer take the center as is, complete bondable lease, we don’t put nickel into it. We get a development return, we literally can do anything and we’ve got 9% return project with great credit.
Cedrik Lachance – Green Street Advisors: Okay so there is nothing else what we done there over time it’s a simple long term lease with quality credit tenant.
Martin Stein: Quality credit tenant like I said total bondable lease, we are not responsible for anything. So we have no operating dollars going forth, we have no construction dollars going forth, and really it’s just the – the ancillary benefit to that is you get your name in that market as continuing to be active in development or redevelopment opportunities of that magnitude and nature.
Cedrik Lachance – Green Street Advisors: Okay and then what is the current gap between your lease space and the physically occupied space in your portfolio?
Martin Stein: Oh, 240 basis points, total which is that 230 pre-lease, and 24 slow pay
Cedrik Lachance – Green Street Advisors: Okay
Martin Stein: This isn’t much different than what’s it’s been for a while now
Cedrik Lachance – Green Street Advisors: Okay I mean you’ve been anticipating I guess the shrinking of that GAAP when you think you go back to more normalized 100, 150 basis points?
Martin Stein: Well I think the risk is so high as we continue to keep doing this volume on leasing. I mean this is a huge quarter of new leasing for us. So that’s what’s keeping that line up there, the pre-leasing line, and that will have to start to fall as we get, as there is less space to lease, if you look at the effective rent paying occupancy, all that preleasing has been translating into rent paying occupancy it’s just continue to do lot of leasing.
Cedrik Lachance – Green Street Advisors: Okay thank you.
Martin Stein: Thank you Cedrik.
Operator: (Operator Instructions))Moving on let’s go to Deutsche Bank, Vincent Chao.
Vincent Chao – Deutsche Bank: Hi, everyone. Just going beyond the Blackstone transaction, just I wonder if you could provide some commentary about the general interest in B Class or secondary market properties today?
Martin Stein: Sure. I think what’s happened probably this quarter versus last quarter or the quarter before is with all the uncertainty out there what’s happening at the end of the year that buyers are less, I mean are more averse and they are not going to go out on the – their risk spectrum without getting compensated with yield, but I think what you are seeing is that buyers will pay up for high quality properties that have strong grocers that are generating strong sales, but you start to lose any of those things, then the pricing falls out pretty fast.
Bruce Johnson: And leverage can also be an impediment to price.
Vincent Chao – Deutsche Bank: Okay. This – but you are not seeing any sort of improvement in the secondary markets, which is something we heard on some other calls.
Bruce Johnson: Well, there is improvement in leasing markets, but in terms of specific to dispositions and acquisitions of the properties or in second tier markets, I think if anything has softened...
Martin Stein: There is a modest because of the huge amount of demand for core institutional quality real estate, there is a modest expansion of the definition of core, but beyond that it’s people are interested in, there is a lot of buyers for core and Brian indicated a lot of buyers for value-add, but the commodity secondary to tertiary markets, it’s a – it’s not a (inaudible).
Vincent Chao – Deutsche Bank: Okay. And just going back to the acquisitions quickly, on the cap rates, they’ve been coming – in terms of your guidance, they have been coming down over the last couple of quarters and I think – I think you’ve commented earlier that to pay that huge mix season of additional growth in those properties and I’m just wondering you know at this point is – you’re changing growth assumptions, is that coming more from your expectations of market rent or are you looking more and more at sort of very under market leases, properties and or lease up type of properties?
Martin Stein: It’s not just was just structure of each individual asset that as I mentioned one of the properties we’re looking at has redevelopment component, we would be adding some GLA, and other properties you have significant contractual rent steps, very little of it, we focus on (inaudible) what is contractual and what is speculative, and the vast majority would be contractual, and you know there is a another A quality property that’s out there, it is an A plus trophy, everybody wants it, but it did not have this kind of growth profile that we’re looking for so, in that case we walk away. So, we’re not changing our underwriting assumptions at all.
Vincent Chao – Deutsche Bank: Okay. And, I mean is that pooled in, I mean I’m assuming that’s a shrinking pool, so at some point I mean do you stop the acquiring?
Martin Stein: If we can’t meet our total return hurdles and especially as I think as Brian indicated, number one focus is, if we can get, we’ve said a range of 2.5% to 3.5%, but if we can take with the incremental help, the meaningful margin of what we’re buying and what we’re recycling out of, that we can get that sustainable NOI growth rate to 2.5% to 3.5% range, that’s our primary area – primary focus there, so if we can’t find it, we won’t.
Lisa Palmer: And, I will just add as Brian mentioned earlier, capital recycling is really a key part of our strategy, an important part to be sure that we can sustain that 2.5% to 3.5% same property NOI growth, but we monitor very closely our ability to invest those proceeds and we tried to be certain that our dispositions don’t get way ahead of our acquisitions. This year is unique, but it’s clearly we are contemplating this portfolio sale if we go back to the guidance that we provided back in December, and so we are well aware that’s how we did the term loan, so we had the flexibility to have debt to repay and we had to use for the proceeds. So it’s something that we watch very closely.
Martin Stein: One of the assets we are looking at is a fantastic center, grocery center as it is, but there is some small space kind of a mini mall area, and we would look to convert that into an anchor, which would be accretive, and then just some adjacent land right next to it, so there’s many ways to get to that growth profile.
Vincent Chao – Deutsche Bank: Okay thank you.
Martin Stein: Thank you.
Operator: Next question from Tom Lesnick with Robert W Baird.
Tom Lesnick – Robert W Baird: Good afternoon. I am standing in for Paula Poskon. What line items in operating expenses drove such a huge sequential improvement in the operating margin, are those true savings, or just timing related that might reverse in the second half.
Martin Stein: I would say to you from a trend standpoint, we typically see a reduction expenses in our second quarter just to give last year, you saw from the first quarter primarily in our operating expenses, cost related to winter’s decline, we start paying and turn up to our true real estate taxes that we’re paying and so those for the most part drive those increments in the second quarter..
Bruce Johnson: And occupancy – the increased occupancy clearly helps that as well......
Tom Lesnick – Robert W Baird: Okay, and then relatively what trends are you seeing in real estate property taxes, are you seeing this coming down?
Bruce Johnson: It’s continued to come down, I’d say at this point, we would expect to see that to moderate, I don’t think you continue to see the – the declines that we saw through last year and what we’ve seen since the first quarter, so I think that the second quarter would be relatively typical what we see in the future with exception of if we start to significantly ramping up acquisitions, we’ve get those adjustments for values. But I don’t think you’re going to see significant declines from here at all now.
Tom Lesnick – Robert W Baird: All right and then likewise what drove the G&A savings, this quarter?
Bruce Johnson: When you say G&A savings this quarter versus the prior year or?
Tom Lesnick – Robert W Baird: Sequentially.
Bruce Johnson: Our net G&A for the quarter, there was reported 14.4, its down from 14.6, I would tell you that in general...
Martin Stein: Yeah and that was pretty flat quarter over quarter.
Bruce Johnson: Yeah.
Martin Stein: Some slightly higher capitalization as we increased our development activity, but – but not what I call significant maybe, it’s a 200,000 order impact quarter-over-quarter.
Tom Lesnick – Robert W Baird: Okay. And then separately, how much do you think land prices and construction costs will rise and say in the next couple of years?
Martin Stein: Construction pricing has been fairly flat.)We’re just looking at a week or so ago and probably over the last three years we’ve seen a total increase of maybe 10% to 15%. It’s not in labor. It’s all depends on which commodity prices, a few years back it was oil, it was cement and now it’s metals, so I don’t see anything right now that’s going to drive certainly the labor component of it, land prices in total development program across the country. For other people it starts dramatically ramping up I don’t think you’re going to see it there. Prices are high for, have held steady well located infill properties, but if it’s anything other than that, frankly we are not interested in.
Tom Lesnick – Robert W Baird: All right. Great Tom. Thank you.
Operator: Moving onto Andrew Rosivach with Goldman Sachs.
Andrew Rosivach – Goldman Sachs: Hey, team. Really fast one I pulled out the, the same store NOI groups and for the first and second quarter is in the pool dropped about 8 million. Is that because Blackstone was in the same store poll and now it’s not?
Martin Stein: That’s correct.
Bruce Johnson: Correct.
Andrew Rosivach – Goldman Sachs: And how much just the change of mix contributed to the increase in your same-store guidance. I just kind of took a, an envelope. Sorry?
Martin Stein: Absolutely none.
Bruce Johnson: Down in the first six months that our expectation is we are more comfortable and probably have some modest positive impact on a go forward basis.
Martin Stein: Year-to-date it was literally it was neutral, and that said from a guidance perspective that that portfolio sale gave us more comfort of increasing lower end of our guidance by more than increase our upper-end. There is just a little bit wider range of outcomes from the portfolio sale, from the properties that were in the portfolio.
Andrew Rosivach – Goldman Sachs: So what you sold to Blackstone on a year-to-date basis have been running at about 3.5% NOI growth rate?
Martin Stein: That’s correct. We increased occupancy.
Bruce Johnson: 87% to 90% within the last 18 months.
Martin Stein: Right.
Bruce Johnson: And some of that has occurred recently, so a lot of that is baked into the numbers.
Andrew Rosivach – Goldman Sachs: Terrific. Thanks a lot.
Martin Stein: Thank you Andrew.
Operator: And a question next Citi, from Quentin Velleley. Please go ahead again.
Michael Bilerman – Citi: Yes. Michael Bilerman speaking. You think back to over the years you’ve always been a pretty active capital recycler and have been pretty disciplined at calling out the bottom tier of the portfolio and to try to keep on enhancing the rest. And I’m curious with the amount that you sold this year if you take your, let’s call $4.7 billion of wholly-owned assets, how much more it sort of fits into this eight cap rate range, in terms of quality, in terms of something that you want to get rid off?
Martin Stein: I don’t want to get specific in that regard, but what I will say is as a result of the sales that have occurred this year and that are pending, we intend to move back to the – what I call moderate levels of annual recycling of $150 million to $200 million a year. Another way of looking at that is that over 95% of our properties and now located in core markets. So, I think we’ve made significant progress, but we’re going to continue to be a capital recycler, Brian talked about the issues related to Supervalu and there was going to be another Supervalu down the road and for the most part, we want to own good real estate, we are seeing some bad news as good news, but I think that – I think the best way to put that within context is you can expect and we’re expecting return not to say that we might not be opportunistic but $150 million to $200 million of annual recycling a year.
Michael Bilerman – Citi: Well, I guess how would you satisfy the portfolio if you are buying core assets today in the low fives and you’re selling these weaker assets in the eights? You’re talking 250 basis points to 300 basis points spread in value, which is pretty substantial, so if you were to take your portfolio, where would you buck it in terms of value today and how much is in that five category, how much is squarely middle of the fairway, 61/2%, 7% and how what percentages is sort of in that A?
Bruce Johnson: That’s really, you’re basically asking us to tell what we believe we believe our cap rate to be, I mean, I’ll defer to Brian for in terms of the percentages that we believe are As but I think as a whole you would say that our A properties would be in the 5.5% to 6% cap rate range, our B properties would be more in this cost 6.5% to 7.5% and then – that seems to be 7.5% plus. And for a percentage stand point.
Martin Stein: I mean to 60 to two third percent – two-thirds in the AA plus category and the vast majority of the balance are going to be in solid B category.
Michael Bilerman – Citi: And then just last question, comes from the portfolios you sold to Blackstone when you go back to the historical cost of those assets – those assets were developed for about $413 million and obviously a big chunk of the cost is in the lifestyle centers in Dallas between shops higher end at 100 and custom target 60. So, from $413 a current yield about the stock or cost of it six and a quarter for the entire portfolio that you sold. And Hap I think in the press release you talked about a $20 million net impairment and how should we think about sort of this gross, where there’s a $90 million drop from what you’ve built or pop these assets for to what selling them for today?
Martin Stein: You said it. I mean we think in – the current values are what current values are – and we will make decisions where do we go from here and where we go from here is maximizing our growth and our operating income.
Michael Bilerman – Citi: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: With no further questions at this time, I would like to turn the presentation back over to Hap Stein for any additional or closing remarks.
Martin Stein: We appreciate your time, and we wish – we hope you have a great rest of the week, and great rest of the summer. Have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentleman, once again we’ll conclude our presentation for today. Thank you so much for joining us. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Regency Centers Corporation First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your moderator, Senior Vice President, Capital Markets, Lisa Palmer. Please go ahead.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Kim. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. On the call this morning are Hap Stein, Chairman and CEO; Brian Smith, President and COO; Bruce Johnson, CFO; and Chris Leavitt, Senior Vice President and Treasurer. Before we start, I'd like to address forward-looking statements that may be discussed on the call. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in these forward-looking statements. Bruce? Sorry, Hap?
Martin E. Stein: Thank you, Lisa, and good morning. As Brian and Bruce will discuss in more detail, we made significant progress during the first quarter toward achieving our key objectives in all aspects of the business. Operating fundamentals are definitely trending positively. We ended the quarter at 93.6% leased. Same property net operating income was up by more than 4%. Move-outs and bad debts are at prerecession levels. Leasing demand remains robust, including small shop space, and we're starting to experience some pricing power. While we're gratified by these results, it is still early in the year. We are keenly focused on building on this positive momentum, especially growing base rent and doing the heavy lifting needed to firmly re-establish Regency's long-term NOI growth rate at 3% or more. We're gaining traction on the sale of targeted nonstrategic assets and the potential progress is encouraging. Regarding recycling that capital into acquisitions, we're seeing some opportunities to buy dominant centers with excellent growth prospects in Regency's 2 dozen target markets. Given the intense amount of competition, buying great assets is one of the most challenging aspects of our plan. In any event, as we've shared with you, we intend to be a net seller in 2012 in order to modestly reduce leverage and increase financial flexibility. Our post-recession developments, redevelopments and expansions are performing well. As a matter of fact, in excess of our underwriting. We're on track to achieve returns in excess of 9.5% on the $200 million of incremental capital for the projects started after January 2009. As supported by our preferred stock transactions, almost $600 million of capacity on the line of credit and term loan and mortgage refinancings in our co-investment partnerships, we have the capability to take advantage of all facets of the capital markets spectrum. And we will continue to opportunistically improve upon a balance sheet that is already in solid shape. Now I'll turn it over to you, Bruce.
Bruce M. Johnson: Thanks, Hap, and good morning to everyone. I think I speak for all of us here when I say that this quarter's results are encouraging. To recap, recurring FFO per share was $0.62. When you include the onetime charges associated with the preferred stock offering, offset slightly by gains on out parcel sales, total FFO per share is $0.55. Same property NOI growth, excluding termination fees, was positive 4.2%. There were 2 primary drivers. First, increased base rent from occupancy gains and contractual rent steps, contributed approximately 200 basis points; and second, increased net recoveries resulting from better occupancy and lower expenses contributed approximately 150 basis points. It should be noted that a portion of the expense recovery was caused by timing differences, which could reverse in the second quarter when we complete our tenant reconciliation process, bringing the second quarter growth rate closer to 2%. That being said, we are in fact raising guidance for the total year end results. We expect NOI growth to stabilize during the last half of the year, putting us in a 2% to 3.25% for the year. Additionally, our new percent lease guidance is 93.25% to 94.25% and recurring FFO per share guidance is $2.42 to $2.54. It is also worth mentioning that we changed the fiscal year of our captive insurance company to end in April. As a result, this year we expect to recognize income from our captive in the second quarter rather than in the third quarter. As you may recall, this income is not included in same property NOI. We expect the income to be approximately $0.03 to $0.04 per share and have incorporated this into our second quarter FFO guidance. From a capital markets perspective, there are a couple transactions that I would like to highlight. In January, we drew $150 million of our available $250 million term loan. Proceeds were used to retire maturing unsecured bonds. The remaining $100 million is available at our option into July of this year. Then in February, as previously mentioned, we completed a preferred stock offering that resulted in gross proceeds of $250 million at an attractive 6 5/8%. Proceeds from the offering were used to redeem an equal amount of outstanding preferred issuances. This redemption and new issuance will save nearly $2 million of preferred dividend payments per year. Please note that we have increased the high end of the 2012 dispositions guidance. In part, this is due to a recent decision by our fund investors to commence marketing the entire portfolio for sale. You may recall that the fund was converted to a closed end vehicle in early 2011. And given current investment sales conditions, combined with the overall stability of the assets, now it appears to be a favorable time to exit. With these transactions, we further strengthened our balance sheet evidenced by a well-laddered maturity profile and recent affirmations of our BBB credit rating. Looking ahead, we will continue to opportunistically improve our balance sheet in a way that also enhances our financial ratios, which includes being a net seller of $50 million to $150 million, as indicated by our capital recycling guidance. Brian?
Brian M. Smith: Thank you, Bruce. Good morning. As Bruce pointed out, the steady improvements in operating fundamentals are finally translating into positive headline results. Our teams have been grinding it out since the recession began, and are working tirelessly to lease space and upgrade tenancy and it's starting to pay off, resulting in the kind of NOI growth that we expect. Let me highlight some key operating results. In total, we signed almost 1.3 million square feet this quarter, of which roughly 1/3 was new leases. Move-outs, which usually peak in the first quarter of the year, remained lower than expected. Further, nearly half of these move-outs were planned or strategic. For example, in a center in the D.C. market, we terminated Blockbuster and replaced them with PETCO Unleashed and Starbucks. This is the kind of upgrade in tenancy that we're after. In terms of absorption, this is one of the best first quarters we've had, as the first quarter traditionally has a high level of move-outs following the holiday season. In fact, first quarter absorption for spaces less than 5,000 square feet was positive for the first time going back as far as we can calculate. Operating percent leased increased for the fourth consecutive quarter to 93.6% and gains continued in almost all size ranges. Using the same pool of properties, same-store percent leased increased 10 basis points over the fourth quarter. In spaces less than 5,000 square feet, that gained nearly 300 basis points to 85.6% since first quarter 2011. The strong leasing demand and better occupancy are paying dividends in 2 critical ways. The first is rent growth. As our centers and the markets around them lease up, we gain purchasing power. This is evident in both our rent growth, which was improved at positive 3%, and in our average shop rents, which have been increasing slowly since the end of 2009. This rent growth is even more notable when we consider the fact that nearly half of the renewals were of leases signed at the peak of the market. The second way that leasing demand and occupancy benefit us is by enabling the leasing teams to increase their focus on merchandising. Our strong pipeline is comprised of successful national, regional and unique local operators who enjoy strong followings and bring a special dynamic to our shopping centers. Working with these best-in-class retailers and restaurants is a mutually beneficial relationship in which their loyal customer bases further invigorate our centers, while our productive grocery anchors help drive additional traffic to their businesses. This reinforces our viewpoint that side-shop space when appropriately sized to fit demand, is an asset rather than a liability, and represents an opportunity to create real value in base rent growth. And the local operators we are working with are well capitalized with access to capital for expansion. The health of our existing tenants also continues to improve. Perhaps the best indicator of this is our AR balance, which is below pre-recession levels. Another telling indicator is tenant sales. Anecdotally, the feedback we're receiving from our property managers is that strong holiday sales have carried over into the first quarter, even in spite of high gas prices. This is true for anchors, as well as local retailers and restaurants. Many of the grocery stores in our portfolio continue to experience positive sales growth. This top line growth has infused a palpable sense of optimism on the part of our tenants, who are now more confident about expanding into multiple locations. Furthermore, as you know, a few big-box operators have recently announced store closings. None of these have affected our portfolio. We rigorously analyze our big-box space on an ongoing basis, and we feel really good about our exposure. Let me now turn to development. We started 2 projects this quarter. The first, South Bay Village, in essence was income-producing land held we purchased 7 years ago. South Bay Village is located on true infill real estate in the Los Angeles area, with more than 240,000 people, earning average household incomes above $90,000 within 3 miles. We are replacing a dark Kmart with Orchard Supply Hardware, a Wal-Mart neighborhood market and HomeGoods. It is adjacent to a highly traffic center anchored by Ross, Marshalls and Trader Joe's. This project is 100% leasing committed with an incremental return north of 13%. We also started Cinco Ranch, which is located in Houston, Texas, within one of the country's most active, master-planned communities that has barriers-to-entry and an average household income of $120,000. The shopping center will be anchored by Kroger and Academy Sports. We have signed leases or LOI activity on nearly 80% of the shop square footage at rents averaging $2 a foot, above our underwriting. The projected ROI is approaching 9% with additional land available for future development. Finally, I'd like to provide an update on capital recycling. During the quarter, we closed on the acquisition of Lake Grove Commons, which is located on Long Island. We discussed this entry into New York on the prior call. We also sold 2 wholly-owned properties for $23 million at a combined cap rate of 7.4%. Subsequent to quarter and, we sold 2 co-investment properties at a pro rata weighted average cap rate of 5.9%, generating $20 million of proceeds to Regency. As we've stated in the past, we continue to pursue an expansion of our recycling program above and beyond our revised guidance. This could happen in the near future, but until there's more certainty, the modest impact to our FFO will not be included in guidance. In summary, while a quarter certainly doesn't make a year, I am pleased with the first quarter results. We look forward to seeing what our team can do during the remainder of 2012. Hap?
Martin E. Stein: Thank you, Brian, and thank you, Bruce. Before I close, I'd like to take a moment and comment on Regency Centers' new brand. You may have noticed the new logo and brand identity when you opened the press release and supplemental. When I boil it down, the new brand is centered around Regency Centers' core beliefs that have been part of our DNA for 50 years, particularly 2 of Regency's key advantages. First and foremost, our people. A talented team of professionals that is endeavoring to create value for our customers and investors. And secondly, and second, the portfolio of dominant shopping centers that are merchandised to our customers. High-performing grocery anchors and best-in-class local, regional and national retailers. I believe it is these advantages, along with our other core values, that will enable Regency to be a preeminent company and industry leader for the next 50 years. In closing, while it is still early in the year and much still needs to be accomplished, it certainly feels like we are on track to meet our objective for 2012, and as important, position Regency to sustain profitable future growth. We appreciate your time, and we'll now take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Quentin Velleley from Citi.
Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just in terms of the same-store NOI number of 4.2% for the first quarter. Bruce, in your remarks, I think you said there was some timing differences on billings. Could you maybe just comment, if you stripped those out, what the same-store NOI number would have been?
Bruce M. Johnson: It's really hard to know until we know what happens in the second quarter. Maybe 10 to 15 basis points max, I think at this point. But until we see the full numbers, I'm not share we know exactly what would have -- the number would have been.
Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. But it's only a small amount?
Bruce M. Johnson: Yes, a small amount.
Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And then just secondly...
Lisa Palmer: I'm sorry, Quentin, very quickly, let me add. The timing difference in terms of why the growth then may be much less or lower in the second quarter is the fact that more of our reconciliations had been completed. And so it's just the reconciliation timing difference is what's going from 4% to the 2%. It's over the comps of last year.
Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And then just the, last quarter, you moved almost $450 million of development completions into the operating pool. I think that was at about a 5% yield, stabilized yield of 6.6%, so there's some NOI upside there. How should we be thinking about that NOI upside? How have you been progressing with some of the leasing on those assets? And when do you expect the timing of that additional NOI to start coming through?
Brian M. Smith: I can talk to the progress, Quentin. If you look at the same properties that were in process of last quarter and compare them to this quarter, we gained 220 basis points. If you look at the same properties that were in process a year ago to now, it's up 570 basis points. So I think we are making really good progress. We expect that the ones for this year that are currently in process will get to 91% by the end of the year. So generally, by the time we sign leases on the development properties that have moved into the operating portfolio, you're talking really 3 to 6 months before that NOI starts coming in.
Lisa Palmer: And I think also if you'll recall back in December at our Investor Day, we did get that question, and we moved several to the same property pool that, to your point, Quentin, had a bit of upside left in it. And we estimate that it contributes approximately 25 basis points to same property NOI growth. And as Brian said, everything is on track.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan.
Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: A couple of questions. First of all, what's driving the decision to increase the capital recycling? And assuming it does happen, should we expect more of a -- just a pickup in dispositions? Or a pickup in dispositions and in acquisitions, as well?
Martin E. Stein: Our plan, in answer to your second question, our plan would be a net seller in the $50 million to $150 million range, so to the extent that we pick up or sell more dispositions than is in current guidance, we would try to increase the amount of properties that we're buying. So we're actively out there looking to find opportunities that meet our criteria, and in our 2 dozen markets and our great shopping centers with excellent growth prospects. I think we've mentioned in the past to the extent that we can effectively and efficiently accelerate and expand our disposition program in a way that makes sense, we would do that. And I think there's reasonable prospects that might occur.
Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. But it sounds like it's going to be -- the plan would be to offset that with a complementary amount of acquisitions?
Martin E. Stein: Yes.
Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And the second question, I'm not sure if you touched on this. If you did, I apologize. But I think, Brian, you mentioned small shop leasing was about 83% in the quarter. How did that compare to year end? And then what's your expectation for the balance of 2012?
Brian M. Smith: The small shop leasing was up across the board. I think I mentioned in the comments that it was up 50 basis points for the quarter and almost 300 basis points for the year. We had occupancy gains in all of the sectors. But the small shops, I think outperformed. I think the small shops in general, no matter what metric you look at, they're strong and they are better than last year. The tenants are experiencing sales increases across the board. As a result, we're hearing from our leasing people and property managers that they're more confident. They're expressing long-term optimism, which we hadn't heard before, and that there's now a sense of urgency. The move-outs are abating. We mentioned that in the comments that they're largely strategic, about 50% of the move-outs we're doing now is because we've got multiple retailers in line for spaces. We can terminate the weaker tenants and start moving them in. Rent growth is positive for small shop. So all in all, it's looking good.
Martin E. Stein: And I just want to clarify. I thought I heard that you might have said, maybe I misunderstood, that 83%, but we're over 85% in spaces under 5,000 feet.
Operator: Our next question today is from Samit Parikh from ISI Group.
Samit Parikh - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: I know that you said subsequent to quarter end, you had a couple of assets that you sold, cap rates in the 5s. And one of them was an asset, I believe, in San Pedro, which is a pretty good asset. I know it's in a JV. I'm just curious about your disposition strategy for this year, you're increasing it. Are you going to have a mix of sort of stronger quality assets along with some of your weaker ones to capitalize on maybe pricing today?
Martin E. Stein: Our primary focus is on selling nonstrategic assets. There were partnership reasons that made it make sense to sell the San Pedro asset. But it will be across the board, centers that we don't feel are strategic -- the -- or that are consistent with our strategy long-term, we're going to be trying to sell.
Samit Parikh - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: And you took down your cap rate assumptions for the dispositions. What does that tell us about sort of the demand for second-tier, the players coming into the market and sort of what IRRs they're looking for right now?
Brian M. Smith: I think I mentioned that we, subsequent to quarter end, we closed on the sale of 2 properties, sub-6 or about 5.8%, 5.9% cap. So that was part of the reason. But I think there is a strengthening market. It has been strong and remains very strong for the institutional quality A properties. And there's always been demand for the Cs where there's lot of outside. Where we are seeing a change in this quarter is in the mid-tier, the kind of B-level properties, there's much more demand than there was in the past there. I think in those kind of properties, our buyers are looking for about 150-basis-point lift. So if they buy it at 9% cap, they want to get that down to 7.5% or so. But there is increased demand, and we did have those 2 sales which lowered the cap rates.
Lisa Palmer: And also, by adding the fund assets to the disposition plan, although they're not on the market yet, our hope would be that they would trade even below the range that we've disclosed. So that had a little bit of influence in bringing it down as well. They're pretty high-quality assets.
Operator: And moving on, we'll hear from Jeffrey Donnelly from Wells Fargo.
Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: The first question actually is about general market trends. Maybe you can just talk about some of your top cities, because I'm interested in knowing which are showing accelerating growth and absorption, or just beginning to maybe see some firming in concession and rents? And conversely, which ones maybe are proving stubborn or even going the other way on you?
Brian M. Smith: Hap mentioned our top 24 markets. And of those 24 markets, we had 15 of them that experienced same-store NOI growth greater than 4.5%, and we experienced 11 that had same-store NOI growth greater than 7%. And those would include markets like Chicago, Miami, Los Angeles, Orange County, D.C., Atlanta, Dallas, Denver. So pretty much most of our top markets, we're experiencing that kind of growth. We had a couple markets in our top 24 that were -- did not perform that well. For example, Palm Beach, Portland and Raleigh. But in those cases, there was something going on. In the case of Palm Beach, we have a redevelopment where we took our Winn-Dixie anchored center, we terminated the lease with Winn-Dixie. So we've lost all the NOI, but we did that because we're moving Publix from across the street into a brand-new store. So that's going to be long-term very good news. And then in Portland, it was really driven by one large vacancy of Sports Authority, which we subsequently released to Best Buy.
Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Again, just as maybe a follow-up question, if I look at your lease expirations for 2012, '13 and '14, the rent that's expiring obviously has been above what you've been signing of late. But the year-over-year growth in that expiring rent seems like it's rising faster than the market rents have been rising. I guess I'm just wondering, do you think that the current rent spreads that you've been posting are going to be sustainable the next few quarters? I guess ultimately what I'm asking is what do you think about market rent growth going forward?
Brian M. Smith: Yes, the average rents that we got there, of course, include anchors, which may have long-term and you don't know if they're going to be actually rolling. When I looked at the average leases signed in the quarter, the shop space was about $25 and the anchor was about $11. If you take our historic 70-30 blend on that, that's about $21 a foot. And if you compare that to the expiring leases for this year, 2012, they're in the mid-$19 range. So I think overall, we're in pretty good shape. And again, if you look at, which I mentioned in the earlier comments, if you look at our rent growth, a significant amount of the leasing came from the 2007, late 2006, early 2008 era. And those rents were all positive. So the fact that we're getting through this period with positive rent growth and the fact that our average rents have been increasing and are now on a blended basis higher than our expiring, feel pretty good. You never know what's going to happen on an individual deal, which as we saw with the Kimco results, one deal can move the needle. But overall, feel pretty good.
Operator: We'll go next to Paul Morgan from Morgan Stanley.
Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: On development, that's one element of your guidance that really didn't change, and yet you have started a couple of projects and you're getting good yields relative to kind of the sub-6 cap rates on acquisitions. And given the tightness that you're starting to see in more markets and open to buys that are out there. I mean is there a reason not to think you could kind of do at least the high end of your guidance? Or I mean, what's the development landscape that you're seeing right now?
Brian M. Smith: Well, 2 questions. Regarding the guidance, something can always knock these projects off, but I think we will be at the high end of the guidance for the developments. One of the large ones that we're working on just received its entitlement approval yesterday. So I think we will be there. Just in terms of the environment, there is more development starting to surface, more opportunities. I would say it's limited to the stronger markets, kind of the gateway markets and where there are legitimate projects with the kind of anchors and everything that we're looking for and the kind of markets, we are seeing increased competition from well-established private companies. It really comes down to the demand from the small shops and the rents that they can project. If you look at our property Northgate up in Oregon, our second phase that we have tremendous demand for more anchors than we can possibly accommodate. The problem is, we are not comfortable adding anymore, not very much more shop space there. And therefore, we're having trouble making it pencil. But in your gateway markets, we're definitely seeing more opportunities.
Martin E. Stein: And those markets are typically infill, and the time to get entitlements can be lengthy.
Operator: Next, we'll take a question from Nathan Isbee from Stifel, Nicolaus.
Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Brian, you pointed out again that move-outs were below budget. Can you just mention what your expectation was for the full year in '12? How much did you budget in 1Q and gross [ph] is where it ended up?
Brian M. Smith: We were about -- first quarter, I think we ended up about 110,000 square feet, fewer move-outs than what we had budgeted. Frankly, in going into the second quarter, in the first month, we're seeing about the same amount of reduced move-outs. So we go through this on a re-forecast process and go tenant by tenant. And whereas we think these things are going to have to move out, we're getting some positive surprises. So I don't know if that's just a delay or if in fact we are going to see fewer move-outs at the end of the year.
Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: And your same-store NOI guidance change, was that included? Did you change your assumptions on move-outs?
Lisa Palmer: No, the range...
Martin E. Stein: Just the timing.
Lisa Palmer: Yes, just the timing. The range for move-outs that basically coincide with the 2% to 3.25%, is 1.4 million to 1.6 million square feet, and that's on 100% basis.
Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: So to the extent you'd actually end up below that range, there would be further upside to NOI?
Martin E. Stein: But just as Brian has pointed out, the good and the bad, a meaningful portion of those projected move-outs are planned and strategic. I mean we're talking 50% to 60%. So they're known. So I'd be surprised if there was much...
Lisa Palmer: To the extent that we do better than that and to the extent that we hit our leasing objectives, yes. We need both.
Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: All right. I'm sorry?
Lisa Palmer: We need both.
Martin E. Stein: Especially as it relates to the future.
Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: And then I guess then just focusing on the leasing volumes, they have been trending down the last few quarters. Is that a function of just taking a harder line on rents?
Brian M. Smith: Well, I might take a little exception there. If you look at the last few quarters, 2011, the last 3 quarters of leasing were the 3 highest we've ever had. So even though the fourth quarter was lower than second and third, it was still in the top 3 of anything we've ever signed. And then this quarter, it would look -- it is lower. It looks kind of like an average quarter when you go back historically. But again, the first quarter is the weakest quarter we always have in terms of move-outs, absorption and new -- or total leasing. And if you look at this quarter compared to prior first quarters, we're ahead in all those categories. We're way ahead in move-outs. We're way ahead in absorption and we're ahead in total leasing.
Operator: Craig Schmidt from Bank of America Merrill Lynch has our next question.
Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: My understanding was heading into the quarter, I think the anchors were 99% leased and the small shop under 10,000 about 86%. If those are right, where do you think you can take the small shop space to by the end of the year? And what's the highest that small shop occupancy number has been in the company?
Martin E. Stein: 91% is where the -- 91%, 92% is where it's been. And I think we've been pretty straightforward that our objective is 90% in order to get to 95%. And I think that we're going to make progress -- we're making progress -- I would -- it might -- I don't think we'll get there by the end of this year.
Operator: Our next question is from Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies.
Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Just a quick question on the acquisition side. I know class A shopping centers, you're now kind of seeing these kind of sub-6 cap rates. But I'm just curious, what exactly you have to underwrite in order to kind of make those deals pencil out? And specifically, what kind of IRRs you're also expecting on those type of deals?
Martin E. Stein: For something to have -- pay less than a 6% cap rate, it better have a very nice growth profile. And that's the key thing, it's what's the total return of going into it plus growth.
Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: And the growth profile you are underwriting is what, 4%, 5%?
Martin E. Stein: It's hard to find, unless you got a redevelopment, a lot of shopping centers with that kind of growth profile. We're looking for growth rates that are going to average in the 2.5% to 3% range, under very vigorous underwriting.
Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Great. And then just in regards to the asset sales, and you guys bumping up your projections. Are you still kind of looking roughly at about the same type of cap rates for those deals? Or have they even come in better now as evidenced by some of the deals you did this quarter?
Martin E. Stein: I think we revised the range for the cap rates on what we expect to sell downward.
Operator: We'll go next to James Sullivan from Cowen and Company.
James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Given the strength and demand and pricing in the leasing that you've shown here in the first quarter and that's really been underway for a couple of quarters, and given the -- I think the word urgency was used in some of the negotiations with some of the prospective tenants. Just trying to get a handle on how soon and how strong a recovery in development starts can be. And I know, Brian, I think you touched on this earlier when you talked about, obviously, the yields on some of the most recent starts and some of the problems with other projects that may not pencil out. And I guess the question I'm trying to get to is that we've been hearing now for a while that retailers have open to buy, they need locations and yet there's not a lot of development taking place. And they've been unwilling to commit to the rental levels that will make the developments work. But your comments earlier suggested that it's really kind of a small shop issue that's holding back and preventing projects from penciling out. So I guess my question is -- it's really 2-part. Number one, when you think about your kind of 3- to 5-year plan, what kind of an annual development starts number would you -- do you have in mind? Number one. And number two, how close are we to the point where you can really start ramping that up and getting the small shop pricing and demand in place to have that happen?
Brian M. Smith: Yes, Jim, the example I gave was kind of unique to Medford because that's the market where we aren't comfortable putting in a lot more small shops. But I would say, as we move -- as we look for developments in more of the urban, kind of gateway markets, we don't have that same kind of problem with the small shops. I think when you start developing -- as we do developments in those markets, you're probably going to see a lot more competition, and you're going to see returns are a little bit lower. But in terms a of 3- to 5-year plan, we are looking for -- we're staffed to do anywhere between $150 million to $200 million a year. And if I look at our pipeline, you know what the guidance is right now. I think we're going to get the high end of that. And we have projects in the works for next year that would take us potentially a lot higher than that. In terms of how close we are to really seeing it ramp up, I think we are starting to see it. As I mentioned, we're starting to see more competition. We're not seeing it from your new, small, undercapitalized developers. You are seeing it from the guys who've been, who are private, who've been around a long time. On the East Coast, it's Eton, it's JBG. On the West Coast, it's the Irvine Company. Those kind of companies. And they're aggressively competing with us right now for the best projects.
James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: And is it your feeling that the anchor retailers have accepted the numbers that you guys need in order to have these projects pencil out now?
Brian M. Smith: I think the anchors are, especially for the kind of locations we're talking about. For example, Dick's. Dick's has historically been a second-generation space user and we're doing multiple projects with them with brand-new developments. So I think that's an example of where, to your point, Jim, they can't get the stores, they got the open to buys and they are going with new developments and paying the rent they need to.
Operator: And next, we'll go to Cedrik Lachance from Green Street Advisors.
Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: Brian, you were talking about regaining a little bit of pricing power in the market, in the small shop market as well. When you look out over the next 2 years and you think about further increase in pricing power, do you think you're going to primarily see it in the headline rents? Or do you think you'll be able to also reduce some of the CapEx packages you provide to tenants?
Brian M. Smith: I think it's in the headline rents. I don't think that our cap -- our white boxes and our TIs are out of whack. We look at that every quarter. And while our total TIs are up, although I think they're down this quarter, it's because of the increase in leasing. But if you look at it on a per square foot basis for just the tenants that we're giving TI packages to, it's very consistent. In fact, we've been in a several quarter downtrend on it to the point where I was wondering if we were being a little bit stingy. But historically, we're right in line. So I don't think you're going to see packages coming down materially.
Martin E. Stein: And rates are moving, it's just they aren't back to where they were at the peak.
Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: Sure. And in terms of the gap between lease space and occupied space, what's that gap as of the end of the first quarter?
Brian M. Smith: It's 220 basis points. So we've got -- I think it was -- yes, it was 220 basis points. So I think 170 of that is tenants that haven't moved in this space and 50 of it is tenants who have moved in and are waiting to pay rent. They're doing their build-out and everything and it will soon start.
Operator: Moving on, we'll hear from Rich Moore from RBC Capital Markets.
Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: On the development front again is -- are you seeing more opportunities for land you already have, which is, I guess, basically what South Bay Village is, versus brand-new opportunities where you're going out and tying up the land and then I guess having to compete more with other developers?
Brian M. Smith: A little bit of both. We are making good progress in our land held. I think since first quarter of 2011, we've gotten rid of 128, put it either sold or put in production, 120 acres. As I look at our pipeline for the rest of this year and even for next year, it is mostly new properties.
Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And Brian, where is that, South Bay Village, just out of curiosity, exactly?
Brian M. Smith: It's in Torrance.
Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: It's in Torrance, so...
Brian M. Smith: Yes. So it's south of the airport, west of the 405 freeway.
Operator: And Vince Chao from Deutsche Bank has our next question.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Sorry to kill the development questions here. But just in terms of the competitive landscape, the well-capitalized guys are the ones you're competing against. But just wondering if you're seeing any change at all in the financing for maybe some other guys in the market? Is there any increase in financing for construction?
Brian M. Smith: We are hearing that there is. I don't know the terms. But I definitely know that a lot of the smaller developers who have been out the game for the last few years, depending on the property, depending on what's behind their guarantees and all, can get financing.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And is that something that's just kind of happened over the last, say, 3, 4 months? Or has it been in progress for longer?
Brian M. Smith: I'd say there's been a noticeable pickup in the last 6 months.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then just -- sorry, if I missed this from earlier. But on the term loan, is there anything that would cause you not to draw down the remaining amount or is it tied to sort of your investment activities in any way?
Bruce M. Johnson: You're exactly right. It would be tied to our investment activities.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. But if the opportunities don't materialize by the time you have to draw it down, you would take the money though? Or...
Bruce M. Johnson: No, we would not.
Lisa Palmer: Yes. We potentially, for our banks that are on the line, we have already discussed this with them. We could potentially extend the delayed draw feature.
Bruce M. Johnson: In case there were some timing differences, we expect it.
Lisa Palmer: Yes. As we have more visibility to -- for the rest of the year for the execution of the capital recycling as, I believe, Brian or Hap mentioned, we would expect, given our guidance, to be a net seller of somewhere between $50 million to $150 million. If we're in that range, then it's likely that we would draw down the term loan at some point before the end of the year. If dispositions gets much further ahead of acquisitions, then we would not.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Paula Poskon from Robert W. Baird.
Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Just a question on -- back to the small shop tenants and your comment that they're looking better. What do you think is driving that? Are they getting better access to credit? Or are they feeling more confident and thus are more willing to dip into their own cash reserves? And also, how would their health vary across your markets?
Brian M. Smith: Well, a couple of things there. So we're talking how are they doing and how are they feeling versus financing. I'll start with the financing. We said for some time, and it remains true, that our leasing is not to anybody that is putting financing contingencies on there. They are well capitalized. We're hearing there's plenty of private equity out there for them. So all these tenants that we're dealing with are well capitalized. In terms of why they're doing better, why they're more optimistic, it really comes down, I think, to several things. First of all, we have been, over a 3-year period, consistently moving out our weaker players and putting in strong operators. So I think you have a higher-quality tenant across the board. Second of all, there's less competition out there. Third, you are seeing much better sales. And I think it's the sales, more than anything, and the margins, that are making these guys bullish. They've been able to -- we heard over the last 6 months, they're actually able to start raising prices now. So it's really the fundamentals of their business, the fact that these are the tested operators and that there's just not that much competition. And finally, there's not any -- there's very little new growth out there. So it's not like they're having new competitors pop up all around them.
Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: And then just to characterize their health across your markets, is it pretty consistent? Or is there a big variance, is one market weaker than another?
Brian M. Smith: The way we look at it is, on a portfolio basis, we measure not only AR is greater than 90 days as a percent of revenue, and that has really fallen, continues to fall. It's now below 0.4%, whereas before it was up around 0.5% -- I mean, it was about 1.5% at one point, wasn't it? So we're seeing it across the board. We also measure just people who are delinquent in various different categories, those have all been declining. Certainly, if you go to different markets, you're going to find that not to be the case. We're going to find more stress in markets like Arizona and Phoenix. Whereas if you go to Houston, we had 0 move-outs last year -- I mean, sorry, last quarter. So I think we can generalize that they're healthy all the way across the board. But it's going to depend on individual tenants and in individual markets.
Operator: And that's all the time we have for questions today. Speakers, I'll turn the conference back over to you.
Martin E. Stein: We appreciate your time and wish everybody to have a great rest of the week and great weekend. Thank you very much.
Operator: And that does concludes our conference for today. Thank you all for your participation.

Operator: Good day and welcome to the Regency Centers Corporation Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time, I’d like to turn the conference over to your moderator, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets, Ms. Lisa Palmer. Please go ahead, ma’am. 
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. On the call this morning are Hap Stein, Chairman and CEO; Brian Smith, President and COO; Bruce Johnson, CFO and Chris Leavitt, Senior Vice President and Treasurer.  Before we start, I'd like to address forward-looking statements that may be discussed on the call. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in these forward-looking statements. Hap?
Hap Stein: Thank you, Lisa, and good morning. As I stated at Investor Day, Regency’s executive team is committed to regain our standing as a blue chip shopping center company by achieving four critical objectives, which I shared with you then, and I want to very briefly review with you now.  First, generating dependable NOI growth of 3%. Second, reinvigorating a disciplined development program that will add significant value to the portfolio. Third, further strengthening the balance sheet and assuring access to capital, and fourth, compounding recurring funds from operations and NAV per share by 5%.  As I reflect back on 2011, I am gratified by the progress the team has made in positioning 2012 to be a turnaround year for Regency. I’d like to now highlight those key accomplishments that will be important building blocks for both 2012 and the sustainable achievement of these four objectives in subsequent years.  We leased nearly 7 million square feet of space, including 2 million square feet of new leases, and that strong tenant demand is continuing. We increased occupancy in the operating portfolio to 93.5% and this represents the highest level in three years.  We sold on a pro rata basis more than $90 million of operating properties and recycled the capital into $110 million of dominant grocery-anchored shopping centers with much better prospects for future growth in NOI. We started over $95 million of new development and nearly $25 million of redevelopments or expansions at attractive returns of more than 9%.  In addition, we sold or converted to development almost $30 million of land held and we took further steps to improve the balance sheet. Among these was renewing our $600 million line of credit, closing on a $250 million term loan, and refinancing more than $500 million of mortgages in our co-investment partnerships.  In addition to this significant progress, there are several other important reasons and I’m confident that our focus strategy will soon start translating into performance that will manifest into the ultimate measure, total shareholder return in excess of our shopping center peers.  It all starts with our exceptional people. Many of you have had first-hand opportunities to see how good they are through our investor relations group or on property tours. Regency’s team and our enduring customer relationships are advantages that enable Regency to fully leverage our other essential assets, expertly execute our strategy, and effectively accomplish our critical goals and objectives.  It is clear to me our key customers truly recognize the value of Regency’s platform and generally respect and appreciate doing business with our people. In the mind of our retailers, brokers, our co-investment partners, and other key stakeholders, Regency is a blue chip company. In fact, the vast majority of Regency’s portfolio contains dominant grocery-anchored shopping centers that are located in attractive markets. Our experience has shown that centers with highly productive grocery anchors attract better side shop retailers, maintain and grow occupancy and produce reliable NOI.  Let me take a moment to remind you of the key attributes of the portfolio. 87% is in a top 50 market. Average household income of approximately $100,000, three mile density of over 90,000 people, and grocery sales that we’re proud to publish of $25 million and $500 per square foot.  In 2012, we’ll place even greater focus on selling the small segment of the portfolio, including legacy developments that we determine might be a drag on NOI, and buying centers that will enhance future growth. Regency’s capability to manufacture dominant grocery-anchored shopping centers in attractive markets on a basis that is accretive to NAV, and especially to the price at which we could acquire comparable properties, is an essential Regency advantage. We have incorporated the valuable lessons learned and are focusing on the construction and repositioning of core shopping centers that we want on long term.  And last, Regency has a sound balance sheet and access to multiple sources of capital. Perhaps that’s the most important lesson from the recent financial crisis that the balance sheet maturities and access to capital are critical. We are committed to maintaining and even enhancing substantial financial flexibility while we are aware we are still operating in an uncertain and fragile environment. I believe that the accomplishments of 2011, combined with these four attributes and resilient retailer demand for space in our shopping centers, have positioned Regency to make even more meaningful progress this year. Bruce?
Bruce Johnson: Thank you, Hap and good morning on this beautiful day in Jacksonville, Florida.  As Hap pointed out, as a result of the proactive steps we’ve taken, our balance sheet is in good shape. Let me recap the year highlights. We renewed our $600 million line of credit on an extremely favorable basis and we’ve closed on a $250 million unsecured term loan to repay the bonds that matured in January. This term loan is fully pre-payable without penalty providing us with the flexibility to delever when it makes sense to do so.  This means that as of the end of January we had more than $600 million of available capacity between the line and the term loan. We also secured more than $500 million of mortgage finance in our co-investment partnerships with terms that exceeded tenures and raised, at average, 4.7%. Finally, [Caster’s] committed $100 million of equity to our partnership with them.  As a result of our efforts of the last several years, we have improved our debt profile by reducing the amount of debt outstanding and meaningfully extending the average maturity date with our wholly owned and co-investment portfolios.  I’d like to turn now to capital recycling. In 2011, we disposed of 13 non-core properties. The average cap rate was 7.8% and we acquired five dominant grocery-anchored centers at an average cap rate of just over 6%.  In January we entered the New York market with a strategic acquisition of Lake Grove Commons in partnership with First Washington and [Calper’s]. Lake Grove is an A+ asset located in Long Island. The center is anchored by Whole Foods with substantial embedded NOI growth from contractual rent increases. This investment represents an opportunity to expand Regency’s presence into the New York market providing traction for potential future acquisitions.  We will continue to recycle capital to enhance future NOI growth prospects. As Hap mentioned, if the right opportunities arise, we would consider expanding the pool of properties that we determine we don’t want to own on a long-term basis. Obviously, these sales may trigger gains or losses.  Looking ahead, our guidance for 2012 is unchanged from what we presented in December. However, it’s important to point out that we expect to be approximately 93% leased at the end of the first quarter. This is for two reasons. 20 basis points is related to the movement of properties to the same property pool. The remainder is due to projected move outs, which are typically higher in the first quarter of the year, however, I am comfortable that we’ll be close to the 94% lease by year end and that 2012 same property NOI growth, excluding term fees, will be in the range of 1.5% to 3%. Brian?
Brian Smith: Thanks, Bruce, and good morning. As you heard from Hap, we’re starting to see the fruits of our efforts. By just about any metric you choose, there was good improvement in the portfolio during 2011. While that improvement hasn’t fully manifested itself, it is setting the table for higher levels of NOI growth.  Let me run through a few of those metrics. After the seasonal dip in the first quarter of 2011, we saw three straight quarters of positive absorption. Absorption for both the fourth quarter and the full year were the best we’ve ever had. What was more impressive to me was the absorption for operating spaces less than 10,000 square feet was also positive for three consecutive quarters and for the full year.  Never before have we had better quarterly or annual absorption for small shops. Better absorption comes from better move outs and leasing and we did a lot of leasing in 2011, more than any other prior year, again, for both the operating portfolio as a whole and for our small shops. The level of new leasing was nearly 40% higher than the average of the last five years. We also signed 25% more renewals than the average of that same period.  We not only leased space, we did it with great retailers that enhance the quality of our portfolio. We did a lot of repeat business signing multiple leases with national chains such as Petco, TJ Maxx, Chase, Starbucks, Great Clips, Chipotle, Five Guys and others. I mentioned move outs were better. They’ve been gradually improving since late 2009, but the improvement was really evident as we ended the year with three straight quarters of lower move outs resulting in the lowest annual level since 2007. Best of all, the level of small shop move outs was the lowest since 2006, which is really encouraging. As a result of this leasing progress and favorable impact on occupancy from dispositions, the operating portfolio was 93.5% leased. For the quarter, we had occupancy gains in all size ranges.  I draw your attention to one of those ranges—our small shops and spaces less than 10,000 square feet, which ended the year 87% leased. That is meaningfully higher than a year ago. Developments contributed as well. Occupancy in those properties increased 630 basis points to over 88% leased contributing nearly $4 million of additional NOI. This increase in development leasing, together with growing our small shop percent lease to 87% represent two very significant accomplishments.  We’ve talked in the past about how our tenants’ health metrics were all heading in the right direction, and by any measure, they are much healthier today. We discussed in the past that retail survivors have learned how to manage costs and inventory to succeed in a tough environment, but for the first time in a while, our tenants are reporting modest sales increases. We heard about top line improvement across most of the portfolio. As a result, there’s a lot more optimism and confidence out there on the part of the retailers.  Furthermore, many of our grocery anchor customers are also projecting solid 2011 annual sales growth from their stores in our portfolio. There’s another increasing trend we’ve seen in the regions. It appears that retailers are exercising their stated options more frequently instead of rejecting the option and trying to renegotiate it. If this continues, it would suggest a potential shift in pricing power.  All these things, along with our much lower AR balance and notable decrease in small shop move outs I mentioned earlier, point to a healthier tenant base. Those are all good trends and it is important progress that we’ll soon be paying dividends and same property NOI growth, and there are other metrics as well that also give me reason to be optimistic.  Total NOI growth was positive 1.7% if you include developments on the same property basis. Rent paying occupancy in the operating portfolio increased 60 basis points, over 91%. As we move closer to 95% occupancy in the next couple years, we should start benefitting from more pricing power. Most important of all, based on what we’ve seen in January, the strong leasing momentum and trend of reduced move outs appear to be continuing.  Let me now turn to development. We started two new developments in the fourth quarter. After a bruising seven-year entitlement battle, we’re ready to take the land in Sonoma County, California out of inventory and begin our East Washington Place development. It’s a strong lineup of anchors – Target, Sprouts, Dick’s Sporting Goods and TJ Maxx/HomeGoods combo store, and they are helping attract other top-notch retailers like Beverages and More and Alta.  This will be the best located retail center in the city of Petaluma and it’ll be a great addition to the portfolio. We know there will always be tight supply constraints in this market, given the city’s demonstrated no growth attitude. In northern California real estate circles, this development really is creating a buzz. We’ve received extensive interest from national retailers for the side shop space and the return on the incremental cost is approximately 9.5%. The second development, Northgate Marketplace, which is located in Medford, Oregon, will be anchored by the perfect grocer for Oregon, Trader Joe’s. Also anchoring the center will be REI, Alta and Petco. This is the best site in Medford at the intersection of the city’s three most heavily trafficked highways and directly adjacent to the super regional mall. Medford is a proven, very successful market for retailers with several national anchor tenants claiming their Medford stores are among the best in their chains.  In addition to ground up projects, our development expertise gives us the ability to harvest value from our operating properties through expansion and redevelopment. We started two such projects this quarter. The first was the addition of TJ Maxx at our Golden Hills property in Paso Robles, California, which is also anchored by Lowe’s and Bed, Bath and Beyond, and we have space to accommodate Petco and Five Below at the Target-anchored Lower Nazareth Commons that’s adjacent to Wegmans in Pennsylvania. These expansions enhance existing assets, they drive additional traffic, and they make them more desirable to potential new tenants and provide us with impressive returns of about 11%, all with relatively low levels of risk.  In summary, I know that we’ve still got plenty of work to do, but I am more confident than ever that we’re going to show the results we expect. We’re going to accomplish our goals of improving occupancy and seeing property growth in 2012 and successfully execute our development and redevelopment strategy. Hap?
Hap Stein: Thanks, Brian and thanks, Bruce. In closing, I have no doubt that Regency is not only on the path to recovery, but more importantly, is on the right road to reestablishing our preeminent standing with you.  Before I turn the call over to questions and answers, I have to take this moment and comment on the announcement a couple weeks ago of Bruce’s plans to retire at the end of the year. To say this is a bittersweet moment is a major understatement. Bruce’s leadership, his experience, his judgment and financial acumen have been instrumental in successfully building Regency into a leading national shopping center company. He’s part of our heritage and he epitomizes those attributes that make our culture and the people of Regency so really special.  At the same time, Regency is fortunate to have Lisa, another consummate professional and wonderful person in the same mold as Bruce, to succeed him in January 2013. Many of you had the privilege to work with Lisa over the years and already know of her strengths and accomplishments.  As I indicated, Bruce will not be retiring until the end of the year. Until then, we will continue to benefit from his full-throttled effort, leadership and judgment as we build on improving fundamentals in this crucial year.  We thank you for your time and welcome any questions you may have. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, the question and answer session will be conducted electronically. (Operator Instructions) We’ll take our first question from Michael Mueller with JP Morgan. 
Michael Mueller - JPMorgan: Brian, I think you said it was 87% small shop occupancy at year end. One, what was the sequential improvement, and then where do you think that number can go by year end? 
Brian Smith : The sequential improvement was 110 basis points and we’re expecting by the end of the year to have somewhere in the neighborhood of 300,000 square feet of positive absorption, and that’s pretty much all coming from the small shops, so that’s how we’re going to get to approximately 94%. 
Hap Stein: I would say that small shop would be between we are today -- We may take a dip in the first quarter, but we ought to be, by the end of the year, between where we are today and 90%. 
Michael Mueller - JPMorgan: Okay, great. Second question, I remember from the Investor Day for 2012, the GNA expectation picked up a little bit. I guess what Bruce’s retirement in ’13 and just thinking about the development pipeline being a little bit bigger by then and maybe you’re capitalizing more. Should we expect to see GNA dip in 2013?
Hap Stein: I think that the rate of growth should reduce and we are actively in an efficient basis to reduce the rate of growth. 
Lisa Palmer: Mike, I’d just like to add to make sure that everyone is clear, even though we came in slightly favorable for 2011, our guidance for ’12 remains unchanged, because a large part of what was driving the favorable variance were health insurance claims that we do not expect to recur in 2012, so the guidance for 2012 remains $58.5 million to $62.5 million. 
Michael Mueller – JPMorgan: Okay, thank you.  
Operator: We’ll take our next question from [Michael Bellarmine] with Citi.  
[Michael Bellarmine] – Citi : Good morning. It’s actually [Michael Bellarmine] with Quentin. I just wanted to follow up a little bit on the occupancy and the leased rates the end of the year in the same store pool in [93-8], that obviously was ahead of where you thought you would be in December of 93 to 93.5, so it sounds like the move outs were a lot less, but I think from Bruce’s comments, there was some talk that you head down about 60 bips in the first quarter as you expect those move outs to occur, and I just wonder if you could just put a little bit of color around -- it was, I guess, about 125,000 – 150,000 square feet. What sort of tenants, have they already moved out, or just what the expectations are and why you think they’re eventually now going to leave. 
Brian Smith: We tend to just historically, in the first quarter, have more move outs. That happened in, certainly, the last two years. It’s pretty much a seasonal thing we see every year. So, we expect that’s going to happen in first quarter. We’re planning on it, anyway. Our experience so far in January has been less than what we’ve planned for, but that’s an annual thing that happens.  
Hap Stein: In addition, as we mentioned, it isn’t all due to seasonal move outs. Some of it is due to including new properties into the pool.  
[Michael Bellarmine] – Citi : Right, which I think Bruce said was 20, and then I guess to get down to 93, 20 from the same store and 60 from move outs, but at the end of the year, you were certainly much higher than you thought you would be in December, and if those people didn’t move out in December, and it sounds like they haven’t moved out yet in January. I’m just trying to figure out what’s going on in terms of how conservative you may be in thinking about the guidance. 
Brian Smith: We may be. We just don’t know. Again, historically, for the first quarter we’re going to have negative absorption and then we’re planning in the next three quarters to be very positive from there. The question is does January represent all of the first quarter. January is the month we expect to be the worst of the three months in January, and like I said, we’re about 100,000 square feet better on the negative net absorption side than what we planned. I just don’t know whether that will maintain that improvement throughout the rest of the quarter or not. 
[Michael Bellarmine] – Citi : And then just a question on the acquisition in New York. Hap, I think you mentioned it was with First Washington. Was that the first capital outlay since buying back the portfolio a couple years ago? Because it sounded like Bill had been pretty quiet in putting new capital out, so I was just wondering if there’s been a change of strategy and getting comfortable with the yields today. 
Hap Stein: That was the first that we’ve done together. They have made other investments that, for whatever reason, we decided not to do together. They’re in the market and would like to deploy more capital. 
[Michael Bellarmine] – Citi : And comfortable with the going in yields in the fives, low sixes?
Hap Stein: If you’re going there and you can either get good dependable growth like we’ve got in Lake Grove, or even there’s maybe more upside and your total return is better, I think we’re pretty much on the same page there together as far as what we’re looking for. 
[Michael Bellarmine] – Citi : Okay, thank you.  
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  
Craig Schmidt – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Good morning. I was wondering if there was an expansion potential at Lake Grove Commons. I’m just looking at the acres and the existing FAR seems kind of low.  
Brian Smith: I don’t think so. What you’re got there, Craig, are two very high-volume anchors. You’ve got the LA Fitness and when we’ve been to that site, it is packed. The health clubs take disproportionate amount of the parking, anyway, so what we don’t want to do is impinge upon that parking and therefore potentially hurt the sales of Whole Foods, Petco or our small shops. 
Craig Schmidt – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, and I just wondered, are you looking at further acquisitions in Long Island? And, what might be your cap rate if you looked out three years given the fixed rent increases? 
Hap Stein: We should be over 6% return by then and that is a target market for us. 
Craig Schmidt – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Possibly with Blumenfeld?
Hap Stein: Possibly with Blumenfeld, yes.  
Craig Schmidt – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, thanks a lot.  
Operator: We’ll go next to Christy McElroy with UBS.  
Christy McElroy – UBS: Hi. Good morning, everyone. You’ve talked about converting a portion of your land into core development projects over the next few years and you did that in Q4 with East Washington Place. Of the $75 million to $150 million of development starts you’re forecasting in ’12, how much of that is comprised of projects where you expect to use the land already owned? Do you expect the yields on those to be similar to the East Washington in the sevens?  
Brian Smith: Let me just check. In 2012 it looks like we really only have one property that’s going to be coming up of land held and that would be similar in the sense that it would be about a seven, or in the sevens on total cost, and more like about 14% on incremental income. 
Christy McElroy – UBS: You’re thinking about those projects more on an incremental basis than on an all-in?
Brian Smith: We’re going to report both, obviously, but the costs are what they are so we’re going to have to report total costs, but they also sunk costs, so the question is how do we get out of those, and if we can deploy the additional capital returns that are that attractive, then that’s what we’re going to do. 
Christy McElroy – UBS: Given that you just transferred a pretty substantial amount of development projects into the completed bucket, are those now considered operating properties? I know you mentioned a potential impact on Q1 in transferring properties to the operating pool, but did their inclusion have any impact on the occupancy numbers in Q4? When should we start seeing these properties impacting same store growth?
Lisa Palmer: Christy, this is Lisa. I’ll answer that. Yes, as of December 31st all of those development completions are in our percent leased for operating properties, not necessarily same properties. To be considered a same property, the anchor would have had to have been open as of January 1st, 2011. So, not all of those would be considered same property. We can go offline and specifically give you a list of those that will be added to the same property pool. 
Christy McElroy – UBS: So in Q4 ’12, this same store on a wide growth number should include the impact of these properties?
Lisa Palmer: It’s got to be a full calendar year, so again, if the anchor was open January 1, 2011 and it was substantially complete, basically, so more than 90% funded, then that would become a same property pool. Some of those that weren’t open then will have to wait until 2013 before they actually hit same property. 
Christy McElroy – UBS: Okay, thank you. 
Hap Stein: Thank you, Christy. 
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Paul Morgan with Morgan Stanley.  
Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley: Good morning. On the targeted dispositions, can you just give a little bit of color? Obviously, you’re looking at accelerating it this year versus last year. Is the market for those non-core assets any better? Is it kind of potential improvements in the same market a factor or are you just going to be more aggressive this year. Is it mostly still one-offs?
Hap Stein: We’re considering all that, where I do think we may have an advantage from a sales standpoint as those assets that are unencumbered, but the key criteria we’re going to look at is is this going to be a drag on future NOI growth, and that’s the criteria that we look at, and/or what’s the visibility from here for NOI going up or going down. 
Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley: What’s the geographic composition of the pool?
Hap Stein: All over the country. And, once again, it depends. 
Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley: On demand?
Hap Stein: It depends on market/demand and it depends on our view of our future outlook for the property. 
Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley: Okay, and then on the development starts, you’ve talked a lot about being more conservative in terms of shop space and the risk that you take on with projects. Is that being reflected in the starts that you’re commencing this year? Have you scaled back from your original plan in the amount of shop space, and by what percentage?
Hap Stein: The key issue is what’s the individual demand for the specific project. In certain instances, no shop space may make sense, and in certain other instances, 45,000 – 50,000 square feet may make sense, so what Brian and the team are doing is calibrating what’s the visible demand for side shop space and when it’s appropriate, we’re also phasing it. 
Brian Smith: It’s exactly right. If you look at what’s been started this year and in the last couple years, as Hap said, some of those had very little. I think we’ve averaged about 15,000 square feet over what we’ve put in place, but some of them had none and some of them had a lot. Not a lot, but they’ve had more.  If you look at the two we’re announcing this quarter, in Medford, Oregon we’re doing limited amounts, maybe 15,000 square feet, whereas the one in northern California, there’s tremendous demand, so we’re going to build much more there. 
Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley: Great, thanks. 
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Jay Habermann with Goldman Sachs.  
Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs: Good morning, everyone. Brian, given the encouraging signs that you’re seeing in terms of occupancy, and I’m just focusing here on the inline space, could you give us some sense of the market on rents, and I guess the question here is if you’re starting to see this pickup in occupancy, are you going to start to focus a bit more, maybe, on pushing rate throughout the year? 
Brian Smith: Yeah, we’re certainly focused on it. What we’re dealing with, I think, are a couple of things. We still are dealing with some high rents. For example, if you look at northern California, we’ve got pricing power in the San Francisco Bay area, but we just did a lease for our Powell Street project at $48 a square foot, but it was coming off of a $51. So, on one hand, we’ve got markets where we’re seeing increased stability to push rents, but some of those markets we pushed real aggressively before the downturn. But overall, I think we are seeing some positive things.  The property manager’s reporting that across the country there is an increased ability to drive rents. Not all properties, not all markets, but as a general trend, yes. If you look at our numbers, if we look at all spaces including those that have been vacant for more than a year, the new was negative but it was less than half as negative as the average three quarters, and if you focus on those that are just less than 12 months, we actually had rent growth on new spaces of over 5%.  So, in the leverage system, all aspects of the leasing seems to be returning a little bit more. We are exercising those termination rights and getting rid of the weaker tenants that would be hard to grow rents. We are getting better rent bumps and what we’ve seen so far in January is stronger rent growth. 
Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs: Okay, and maybe back to Paul’s question on the sales candidates versus the core assets, is there a breakout of NOI growth between what you’re potentially selling and what remains the core assets?
Hap Stein: Typically, what we may be selling is we’re saying meaningfully higher growth than what we’re buying than what we’re selling, and let’s leave it at that. 
Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs: Okay, thank you.  
Operator: We’ll take our next question from [Tao Akesanya] with Jeffries and Company. 
[Tao Akesanya] – Jeffries and Company: Just in regards to your economic outlook. If the economy does end up being a little bit better than you’re anticipating, do you think you’ll probably see more strength in regards to pricing, or more of an ability to generate more occupancy in your small shop space, and conversely, as well. If the economy got worse, which of those two do you think could give way first?
Hap Stein: Number one, I think that we are seeing, as Brian indicated, a very resilient demand for space and as he indicated, we’re starting to feel more pricing power and I think that feeling is real, obviously to the extent that we get more of the economy behind us, that’s going to improve because there’s less supply that’s been out there, especially a better space, so I think it would take an effective downturn in the economy to swing to reduce the tenant demand for space and pricing power, in effect, swinging back and the momentum going in the other direction. 
[Tao Akesanya] – Jeffries and Company: That’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Todd Lukasic with Morningstar. 
Todd Lukasic – Morningstar: Good morning. Thanks. Just a quick housekeeping question first on a GAAP basis income statement, the other expense line, $44.9 million. Is that mainly due to write offs of predevelopment costs or is there something else in there?
Brian Smith: It would be a combination of that and our income taxes. Other amounts are related to reserves we’ve put up for environmental costs or insurance reserves on liability claims, those kind of things. 
Todd Lukasic – Morningstar: Okay, thanks, and then just with regards to the side shop space, you guys are making some nice progress renting that up, obviously. I’m just wondering what you view as sort of a normalized level of vacancy for that side shop space. 
Brian Smith : Probably where we were before the downturn, which is really up in about the 91% range. 
Todd Lukasic – Morningstar: Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions.
Hap Stein: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll go next to [Gaonton Gar] with Credit Suisse.  
[Gaonton Gar] – Credit Suisse: Hi, guys. Just another question on the small shop space. What kind of tenants are you seeing demand from, and going into 2012, are there any specific industries or tenants in your portfolio that you would be concerned about?  
Brian Smith: Again, we’ve been focusing for the last few years on mostly the national, the regionals. Very, very little leasing is being done with true mom and pop shops, so I don’t see any reason why that wouldn’t continue, although we are hearing that financing is returning to the small shops but, again, that’s not been something that’s held us back in the past, so I don’t think it’s going to affect us that much going forward.  There’s a couple of categories of small towns that we worry about. I would say that the dry cleaners are certainly one we’ve been seeing some weakness in. Tanning salons, we’ve been seeing some weakness in, and then we’ve got the ones that are well known to everybody. If there’s any remaining video or the book category, those kind of things. 
Hap Stein: We had limited exposure there. We’ve got limited exposure to Best Buy, and in the case of Sears, I think, as Brian says, bad news would be good news. 
[Gaonton Gar] – Credit Suisse: Right. Very helpful. And, you spoke about financing coming back. Are you hearing about any specific initiatives by the SBA which might be helping some of your mom and pop kind of tenants?
Brian Smith: I think I just mentioned that there is more Small Business Association financing out there but we have not been needing that in terms of increasing our occupancy. We’ve been leasing to stronger chains, national, regional and so forth, but it certainly can’t hurt us as some of the smaller players decide to get back in the market because there’s financing available, that can only help us. 
[Gaonton Gar] – Credit Suisse: Right. Thank you. 
Operator: We’ll go next to Jim Sullivan with Cowen and Company.  
Jim Sullivan – Cowen and Company: Good morning. Just a couple of quick questions, guys. As you move out of the legacy development and some of the transactions where you have some significant sum costs and look at new developments, there has been—and correct me if I’m wrong on this—but there’s been significant growth by some of the smaller footprint grocers in terms of unit growth, and I’m just curious if you’re seeing more of that, or if my impression is wrong, number one, and the 20,000 – 30,000 square foot box rather than the bigger box.  And, curious if you’re seeing more of that, number one, and number two, how you underwrite those. Do you underwrite them any differently or not in terms of projected stabilized yield?
Brian Smith: We are definitely seeing more of them, particularly in some regions. If you look at who’s really expanding, it seems to be all over the map. You’ve got the Kroger’s and the HEB’s, which are growing very large, putting very large stores into production. On the traditional size, I’d say the one that’s grown the most would be Publix.  But, what you’re seeing, particularly in California, would be almost a grocer war in northern California with all these smaller concepts. You’ve got the fresh market, you’ve got Sprouts, you’ve got Sunflower, Fresh & Easy, just a lot of that going on – Trader Joe’s, of course, and we have not done much with them. We’ve put some in our existing centers.  We are doing a little bit, and in terms of underwriting it, we factor that in with the other risk metrics, the amount of shop space, how much preleasing is done, but we tend to go with the better operators, so we’re not doing any new developments for Fresh & Easy. We kind of factor the risk in that way. We’d just rather not do it. Sprouts, we have been comfortable, and, as you saw, the one we put them in is this one we’re doing in Petaluma and they’re not the credit town of the whole deal, so we’re comfortable with that. 
Jim Sullivan – Cowen and Company: If we think in terms of incremental dollars into new developments, we don’t have sum costs in the land, where would you like your yields to be, and maybe if you could contrast that with, say, where they were at the height of the development cycle the last time around. 
Hap Stein: I think if we can generate on a good infill site returns above 8%, it’s going to be a meaningful accretion to where you’d buy that shopping center on the open market today. So, we’d like to get 9%, but as I said, if we can get returns in the 8.5% range, what we’re focusing on today, which are dominant core shopping centers, especially in infill markets or markets that are tough to develop in, I think we’ll be doing well. 
Jim Sullivan – Cowen and Company: Good, thanks. 
Operator: We’ll go next to Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.  
Wes Golladay – RBC Capital Markets: Good morning, everyone. Now that five years have passed since the market peaked, are you seeing any meaningful headwinds on the renewal front from those leases signed five years ago?
Brian Smith: No, we’re doing significant amounts of renewal leasing. It’s the most I think we’ve ever done. Obviously, there’s negotiations and the one thing I did mention in the prepared remarks is during the worst times, downturn where people had stated options in their lease instead of just renewing them, it seemed like every renewal was open for renegotiation.  Now what we’re seeing a lot more as kind of an increasing trend is that the retailers are willing to just go ahead and sign the stated option and move on because they know, as Hap mentioned, the amount of second generation spaces out there has gotten a lot smaller. 
Hap Stein: In general, if you think about it, Wes, if you’ve got a successful business in a good shopping center in a good space in that shopping center, you’re not going to want to relocate that business for a few bucks a foot. 
Wes Golladay – RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Sticking with the shop space, I’m trying to figure out when we can start pushing the rents. Would that be when you get to the 91% occupancy, so about 4% away? Is that what we’re looking at?
Brian Smith : It’s really dependent on the market and the shopping center. We’ve got it and we have significant pricing power in markets like the Pacific Northwest, in the San Francisco Bay area, Houston, Austin, and where we don’t have any would be in Las Vegas, Arizona, Inland Empire and Central Valley, California.  All the other ones, it’s improving quite a bit as we’re seeing fewer move outs, more leasing activity, and our occupancy growing and sales improving and margins improving on the retailers, we are getting better pricing power. 
Hap Stein: Unfortunately, we have limited exposure to those markets. 
Wes Golladay – RBC Capital Markets: Okay, thank you. 
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Jeffrey Donnelly with Wells Fargo. 
Jeff Donnelly - Wells Fargo: Good morning, guys. Hap, if I could follow up on the question from Jim, do you think the development yields you earned before, the 8% to 9% yields are achievable if your shop space proportion might be a bit leaner than it was in the past? I’d expect that shift in the mix of space could potentially clip your yield a little bit from what you might have earned in the past. Is that the case or do you disagree?
Brian Smith: It’s true, but on one hand, there’s not that much development going on. Where it’s going on is typically more in the urban markets where there’s better sales being generated for the retailers, so that’s allowing them to keep their rents higher than you’d expect. I mentioned the $48 rent in the Bay area. You’re not going to get that in some of the markets that are greener and don’t have -- be able to generate the top line revenue for the retailers.  The other thing that’s happening is construction costs are lower than they were at the peak. The cities are much more willing to work with you on fees because they’re looking for the tax revenue, so you aren’t getting feed out of the game. And then the land costs have come down in most markets, so while rents may have come down a little bit or you have less shop space, you also have a better top side. 
Hap Stein: The bottom line is we’d rather have a shopping center that makes a core shopping center infill market that makes set in stone long term, and if the return is eight or if it’s eight or maybe a little below that, because we’re phasing part of the side shop space, we’d rather have that than a 10% return out in a shopping center that doesn’t make sense doing long term. 
Jeff Donnelly - Wells Fargo: Would that argue that the development pipeline as you approach in the next five to ten years is probably more infill than it was in the last five to ten?
Hap Stein: Absolutely. 
Jeff Donnelly - Wells Fargo: I guess another question, just maybe building on another earlier question, who is buying BNC Assets out there and how they’re getting financed. Do you guys think lenders are loosening up on underwriting terms there or is that really not changed much?
Brian Smith: I can let Lisa and Bruce talk to the lending and the underwriting, but if you look at what we sold in this past quarter, every one of them except for one was sold to private buyers. What they are looking for and what they like, which was eluded to earlier, is the fact that most of these have no debt on them and therefore they can get very strong leveraged IRRs. 
Hap Stein: Financing must be available to stronger local regional and national private buyers. 
Bruce Johnson: My friends that are on the private side are still having difficulty arranging financing that they had been used to prior, even before the peak of the market. The underwriting requirements have changed significantly. You can get financing, but as Hap said, you’ve got to be one of the stronger players in the markets you’re dealing in. 
Jeff Donnelly - Wells Fargo: Bruce, is there any chance to—I’m not sure if this exists, but to get assumable data on some of these and actually sell them off on a highly levered fashion, or is that just not permissible in the market today? 
Bruce Johnson : That, again, would depend upon the strength of the player involved, I think. Certainly that’s something that we could do and would do, and if you’re a private guy and not a public company, I think if you’ve got the relationships as well, you could do that, but again, all of those things are more difficult today. 
Brian Smith: As I look at the lists of the people who bought these private buyers, it’s not like it’s just one person deciding they’d like to own a shopping center. Up in Washington we sold property to Merlone Geier. They’ve been around forever. They have a large portfolio. They’re private but they’ve got a lot of endowment money behind them. Cole Capital is one of the ones that bought, so they typically are private but they’re pretty well capitalized. 
Jeff Donnelly - Wells Fargo: Last question. We actually just hosted a call last week with one of your competitors who called out Florida for its weakness, particularly in the small shop leasing front. I think it bottomed lower and it’s turning, but still slowly. Can you guys talk specifically about what you’re seeing in Florida, maybe for your portfolio but more broadly in the market?  
Brian Smith: If you had to look at one trend in our portfolio, it would be the recent strength in Florida. The unemployment rate has fallen in Florida. I think it’s the second fastest improvement in the country and what we saw in the fourth quarter for the first time was real enthusiasm, real excitement.  Down in Tampa, which has been a tough market, we had 15 new leases all commence on December 15th so there’s a lot of optimism and there’s a level of activity in Florida that we just haven’t seen in a long, long time. 
Jeff Donnelly - Wells Fargo: That’s helpful. I’ll follow up with you guys.  
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.  
Vincent Chao – Deutsche Bank: Hi everyone. Just a follow up on the disposition side, the BNC question. Private buyers are the ones buying the stuff last quarter, but can you just talk broadly about the demand you’re seeing? Is that increasing of late or just holding steady? Falling? 
Hap Stein: It’s holding steady, I’d say. Executing on the sale of non-core properties, the properties that we’re selling, there is demand but it isn’t like the demand for the A centers.  
Vincent Chao – Deutsche Bank: Okay, but it hasn’t fallen off at all?
Hap Stein: No, it has not. As a matter of fact, I think the stuff we’re selling is still for the most part is pretty decent. It’s good stuff and we just think the capital could be better utilized elsewhere as far as improving our growth profile. 
Vincent Chao – Deutsche Bank: Okay, and then a cleanup question. I noticed that TI’s this quarter looked like they ticked up a little bit higher than they’ve been trending on a per year basis. Was there just a couple transactions that skewed that higher?
Brian Smith: There’s some of that. The reality is if you look at the trend in TI’s since 2009 it’s been on a downward trend. This quarter ticked up a little bit, but I think it’s a one quarter kind of deal and it doesn’t signify anything else.  We also were giving TI’s a little bit more often so it’s not -- for example, on the renewals, our per square foot TI amount actually dropped, it’s just that we gave a little bit more often than in the past. There were several retailers or users that are big high TI demand.  We had a lot of medical, whether it’s dentists or hospital urgent care kind of concepts, Petco, which has a big electrical requirement, Office Depot is the same kind of thing, so there was a lot of that. 
Vincent Chao – Deutsche Bank: Okay, thank you. 
Operator: We’ll take our next question from [Semi Farique] with ISI. 
[Semi Farique] – ISI: Hi. Good morning, guys. Could you talk about the timing and the trajectory of same store NOI growth this year based on your expectations of what the changes and lease percentage and physical occupancy is going to be? Also, just one beyond that, as well. What are the drivers that you think would get you to the lower end of your 1.5% to 3% same store growth guidance versus the upper end? 
Lisa Palmer: I’ll take the first part of the question. I’ll let Brian answer the drivers of the growth of the low end and the high end. From the trajectory standpoint, clearly it’s going to be on an incline, an upward incline with the first quarter probably being more in the range of 1% to 2%, and then you’d see improvements to that each quarter throughout the year. That would then get us to the 1.5% to 3% rate. 
Brian Smith: You have the contractual rent increases in the 1% to 1.5%. That’s going to be pretty well set and it’s going to depend on what’s continuing to happen with move outs and leasing, and if the trends continue, it’ll be as Lisa described.  
[Semi Farique] – ISI: Okay, great. And I guess just one more. DDR announced a program where they’re going to work with Score and the SBA and provide sort of favorable terms to entrepreneurs and potential small business tenants in the Atlanta area right now. Are you working on something similar? Do you think that’s a need or something as a supplement to help boost some small shop growth and small shop leasing and maybe some of those tougher areas that you’ve had? 
Hap Stein: We’ve had conversations with our banks in the past and have offered that up, but when you really get right down to it, most of the demand from tenants, they have financing available, the right tenants, and we just haven’t to date found a program like that that would make sense. Financing, I don’t think is an impediment to us getting 94%, hopefully, by the end of the year, and 95% by the end of next year. 
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Cedrik Lachance with Green Street Advisors. 
Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors: Thank you. Just going back to the small shop demand, you talked about Florida being an area of strength lately. Where else do you see outside demand and where else do you see a softening or leveling off of demand?  
Hap Stein: I think it’s more noticeable meaningful improvement from where we’ve been would be the way I would describe that as. It’s moving very encouragingly in the right direction. 
Brian Smith: Again, that’s been the area of biggest change, which is really what I was trying to address. I don’t think anything’s changed. We’ve had a great year of leasing throughout the year. It’s just been off the charts and that’s been widespread with the exception of just those few markets that we’ve always talked about and they continue to remain weak.  I think some of the other trends with regard to both the anchors and the small shop leasing would be we are starting to see an increased move toward quality as tenants’ leases expire. We had a situation in Portland where Bed, Bath and Beyond moved less than a mile to come into our shopping center. We had Beverages and More move out of Westfield power center in San Diego to be where the daily draw of the grocery-anchored center is in one of our centers.  I would say also up in the northeast, we saw 125 basis point increase in occupancy and that was despite the move outs of Borders, A&P and Blockbuster, which hit that region particularly hard. The other thing, I think, going on with them is that these move outs, as low as they were, a lot of them are done on a strategic basis. It’s either to get them out to make room for redevelopment, it’s to expand another user, so I think those are a lot of interesting positive trends that are going on with small shops throughout the country. 
Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors: Okay, and just going back to dispositions and thinking about non-core assets, what percentage of your portfolio do you think you would like to sell over the next four to five years in terms of the assets you consider to not have the kind of growth prospects that you would typically expect from your new acquisitions? 
Brian Smith: We’ll focus on 10% but I do think the capital recycling will be an ongoing part of our strategy for the foreseeable future. 
Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors: Okay, so if you look out four or five years you’d probably sell about 10% of your portfolio during that period? 
Brian Smith : Based upon the guidance that we gave on Investor Day, that 10% of the portfolio would be sold in the two- to three-year period rather than -- I think a range of $150 million to $250 million. That would occur over a three-year period. 
Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors: Okay, thank you. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We’ll go next to Chris Lucas with Robert W. Baird. 
Chris Lucas - Robert Baird: Good morning, everyone. Brian, just a question, another one, on the small shop space. It sounds to me like most of the work you’re doing there is through the PCI program or with those type tenants. Is that fair?
Brian Smith: It is, yeah. 
Chris Lucas - Robert Baird: Okay, so the question is are you seeing any change in the makeup between corporate stores and franchisee stores? 
Brian Smith: I don’t think there’s some dramatic change. The only thing that we’re seeing is you’ve got some franchise concepts where you’ve got a weak program, you’ve got weak local franchisees and we just tend to avoid those, but I don’t think on any macro level there’s much of a change there. 
Chris Lucas - Robert Baird: Okay, great. Thanks a lot, guys. 
Operator: We have a question from Philip Martin with Morningstar. 
Philip Martin – Morningstar: Good morning, everybody. I promise I won’t lead with a small shop question, but with respect to your capital recycling program, what is the average Regency holding period of these assets within your capital recycling program? How long have you held these assets?  
Hap Stein: We’d have to get back to you on that. It varies meaningfully. 
Philip Martin – Morningstar: Okay. That would be helpful. I’m just trying to gauge the average hold time of these assets. Secondly, with respect to small shop space, are you seeing an increase in new concepts or are these existing concepts, as you mentioned, maybe moving around, shifting around more strategically, et cetera, or given the unemployment issues that are out there, are you seeing more new concepts being started up and driving an incrementally higher small shop demand?
Brian Smith: We’re seeing some new concepts. We always see new concepts in the restaurant category – the yogurts, the burgers. You see things like Petco’s Unleashed, which is an expansion of a concept that they already have. We have heard of some other ones. There’s a new one out there called The Joint, which is a chiropractic place.  Again, I think in all the years I’ve been doing retail, there’s always new concepts coming out and I think that’s continuing to go on, but it’s not the new ones that are driving all the growth. 
Philip Martin – Morningstar: Okay, and you’re not seeing a disproportionate of new concepts relative to the past? It’s about the same? 
Brian Smith: Yes. 
Philip Martin – Morningstar: Okay, thank you very much. 
Operator: That is the last question we have today. At this time, I’d like to turn the call back over to Mr. Stein for any closing remarks. 
Hap Stein: We appreciate your time and interest in Regency and hope that you have a great week and a great Super Bowl weekend. Thank you very much. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s conference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time.

Operator: At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Regency Centers Corporation third quarter 2011 earnings conference. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Lisa Palmer, Senior Vice President, Capital Markets.
Lisa Palmer: Good morning, everyone. On the call this morning are Hap Stein, Chairman and CEO; Brian Smith, President and COO; Bruce Johnson, CFO; and Chris Leavitt, Senior Vice President and Treasurer. Before we start this morning, I'd like to address forward-looking statements that may be discussed on the call. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Bruce?
Bruce Johnson: Thank you, Lisa, and good morning. Since the SEC recently advised NAREIT that it now takes no position on the inclusion or exclusion of impairments in FFO. NAREIT reiterated this week that in accordance with the definition of FFO, impairment charges should be excluded. As such, we have begun excluding impairment charges from FFO this quarter. Recurring FFO for the third quarter was $0.61 per share. Total FFO was $0.62 per share for the quarter. Third quarter's same-property NOI growth was a minus-0.2%. Excluding termination fees, this growth was a positive 0.2%. Same-property percent leased increased 80 basis points to 93%. Likewise, non-rent pay in pre-leased GLA increased by about the same amount, delaying some of the benefit from leasing activity in NOI growth. Other income increased by $2.5 million over the second quarter. As we've always reported in the past, our captive insurance profits are recognized in the third quarter based upon the claims experienced from the prior year. This is not considered the same-property income, but is included in other income and impacts NOI. Account receivable continued to improve with a total on pro rata basis down nearly $5 million from the second quarter as tenants continue to pay real estate tax and CAM balances built in the prior quarter. Total AR over 90 days is now 0.7% of revenues compared to 1.1% at September 2010. Our liquidity position remained strong. In September, we closed on the refinancing of $600 million credit facility. The facility has a four-year term with a one year extension option. The interest rate is LIBOR plus 125 with the facility fee of 25 basis points. We are currently documenting a $250 million term loan to refinance December and January bond maturities. The loan will carry a five-year term at attractive pricing similar to that of our recently closed credit facility. As we execute our capital recycling plan, this term loan will provide the flexibility to buy assets or pay down debt. Loan execution is anticipated in November with funding in January. In August, we locked rate on a $193 million of mortgage debt to refinance the maturities in our GRI partnership. The refinanced debt matures in 2022 and carries an interest rate of 4.5%. With this refinancing and the term loan, we have handled essentially all of our 2012 maturities. Looking ahead for the year, we have tightened guidance range of recurring FFO to $2.34 to $2.40 and total FFO per share to $2.45 to $2.51. For the fourth quarter, we expect recurring FFO to be in a range of $0.58 to $0.64 per share. Brian?
Brian Smith: Thank you, Bruce, and good morning. We continue to experience robust leasing activity which points to future improvement in fundamentals. Total leasing for the operating portfolio was 2.1 million square feet. In context, you could look back over the past six years and not see a quarter with close to 2 million square feet of leasing. The 590,000 square feet of new leasing was the most ever registered and only the second time we've leased over 500,000 square feet with last quarter being the first time. Move-outs have been improving since mid-2009 and are still above historic norms, an encouraging sign that move-outs are trending toward pre-recession levels as small shut move-outs were meaningfully lower than recent quarters. Additionally, we released every one of the five largest anchor move-outs we experienced. The strong leasing resulted in positive absorption of 140,000 square feet. It means two consecutive quarters of positive absorption. The 1.5 million square feet of renewal leasing was more than we've even in a quarter. As a result of this leasing progress and a favorable impact on occupancy from dispositions, we're now 93% leased on a same property basis. We had occupancy gains in all size ranges. Spaces less than 5,000 square feet registered a 50 basis point increase or total of a 100 basis points over the past two quarters, and we're 85% leased in that section. And spaces larger than 20,000 square feet improved to 99% leased. Although total rent growth was negative 1.6%, when we exclude spaces vacant for more than 12 months, rent growth was slightly positive. I want to point out that it will take a few more quarters for these leasing gains to positively benefit NOI growth. The full NOI benefit is delay due to two factors. First, is taking longer per tenants to move from lease execution to rent paying due to staffing issues in local governmental offices. The delay was further impacted by the large amount of leasing volume that occurred in second and third quarters. As a result, our pre-leasing increased from a 150 basis points to 225 basis points. Second, move out from like new leases have an immediate negative impact on NOI, encouraging signs related to tenant health merit being highlighted. Retailers are renewing in the rate above historic norms. As a result of actively calling weak tenants from the portfolio and replacement with stronger operators, accounts receivable greater than 90 days are now below pre-recession levels. Rent relief requests are almost non-existing and defaults a one-third of what they were year ago. And habitually, delinquent tenants that have not yet moved out have decreased from 42 basis points to 28 basis points over the past year. These metrics along with the notable decrease in small-shot move-outs all point to a healthier tenant base. Looking forward, our current leasing pipeline remains robust with nearly 1.3 million square feet of leases or LOIs under negotiation. Leasing the development portfolio has been encouraging as well. On an apples-to-apples basis, our percent leased at 87% increased 480 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, and based on the recent activity and momentum, we believe we would finish the year 98% leased. We disposed four truly sealed quality properties that we believe had significant NOI risk. And we acquired four premier operating properties. Tech Ridge Center located in Austin, Texas, in anchored by highly predictive H-E-B with a potential to expand centers demand allows. Oakshade Town Center located in the high barrier Northern California market is anchored by the highest volume safeway in its trade area. Center is 93% leased and remaining anchor leases are below market. Calhoun Commons, the whole foods-anchored center we discussed on the prior call, is purchased with (inaudible) and is located in an upscale neighborhood near downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota. And Rockridge Center which is also Minneapolis is anchored by a market leading Cub Foods with extremely high sales volume. As we continue to execute our recycling strategy, the resulting impact on the quality of our portfolio will enhance the future sustainability of NOI growth. Since the beginning of last year, we sold nearly $140 million of at-risk properties and acquired nearly $256 million of extremely high quality centers. In terms of key indicators, the 3-mile household income of the acquired properties is nearly $100,000 and at nearly $700 per square foot, the average grocery sales are two times the average of those we disposed. This is the kind of upgrade in real estate and tenancy that we'll continue to pursue. Given the positive momentum we are experiencing with so many assets that don't meet our standards, we're accelerating the rate at which we bring dispositions to market. As our capital recycling program picks up, we look to reinvest the proceeds into premium real estate that will enhance Regency's portfolio and drive reliable NOI growth. Also our six months recent development starts are already 93% leased. We are currently projected to produce an average return on invested capital of 9.5%. And I'm encouraged by the depth and quality of the shadow pipeline for future developments and redevelopments which now exceeds $325 million. The vast majority of these opportunities represent expansions and renovations to better positions assert already owned or the development of prime shopping centers that we look forward to on in long term. We started one new value add redevelopment this quarter located in Boynton Beach, Florida. We replaced a dark Winn Dixie with a public's relocation from a near-by center and filled the vacant blockbuster space with Chase Bank. The incremental return on the new façade and redevelopment cost is 8% before taking into considerations, significant increase and high quality shop space demands since the redevelopment was announced. To conclude, in spite of the slow and fragile recovery and the uncertainty caused events in Washington and Europe, we are encouraged that many key measures are moving in the right direction and are starting to have a positive impact on NOI and recurring FFO.
Martin Stein: Thank you, Brian, and thank you, Bruce. I likewise and encouraged by the improvement we are making on key aspects of the business. Also, like Brian and Bruce, while I appreciate the groundwork that is being laid for future growth and NOI and recurring FFO, I'm ready for these improvements to start having a larger impact. This will occur sooner if leasing momentum continues especially with small tenant leasing that we're experiencing. We returned to more normal pre-leasing levels and the improving trends that Brian described in tenant health and move-outs reached pre-recession norms. I do want highlight what is being accomplished, most important of all the continued tenant demand coupled with the intense focus of leasing team and the attributes of the portfolio. We signed roughly 590,000 square feet of new leases and nearly 1.4 million square feet of renewals during the third quarter and increased occupancy at 93%. In addition to the fee and non-strategic properties that we sold in the first nine months of the year, over $150 million of assets are in the market or about to get a market. We acquired the terrific shopping centers that Brian describes that means we're consistent with our proven strategy of earning dominant grocery-anchored shopping centers and infill trade areas meaningfully above average household income and supermarkets sales in excess of $25 million. As a matter of fact, the grocery anchors in these centers have average sales of over $40 million. Our experience shows that these are the types of the centers in our portfolio that enjoy sustainable NOI growth. We're positioned to start over $100 million of new developments and redevelopments this year along with building new and improved core assets to enhance the overall quality of Regency's portfolio while achieving attractive risk-adjusted returns. In addition, we're continuing to convert our inventory of land in the sales or developments. We won the $35 million of sales contracts, LOIs and land in probably development closes. We will have effectively converted a quarter of our own land into cash or attractive new developments. As Bruce described with the new line of credit term loan and mortgage REIT financing, we've improved our maturity profile and at the same time provided significant flexibility as we executed our capital recycling. As Brian said, we all recognize that we are operating in an uncertain world with sluggish economic growth and volatile capital markets for the foreseeable future. And we pointy realize more than anyone else that Regency is not yet where we want to be in relationship in relation to our high absolute and relative standards and goals. At the same time, I am gratified with the straight progress that is being made toward achieving Regency strategic objectives. Attaining 95% occupancy and 3% NOI growth, growing the development program to $150 million of development and redevelopment starts of core shopping centers, recycling the reminder of our C assets and potentially some of our non-strategic assets and A centers, and continuing cost effectively and opportunistically enhance an already solid balance sheet. Most important of all, I appreciate the focused efforts of the team in executing our strategy to position Regency for meaningful and reliable long-term growth in recurring FFO and NAV. We thank you for your participation and welcome any questions you may have.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Nathan Isbee from Stifel Nicolaus.
Nathan Isbee - Stifel Nicolaus: I'm just focusing on the leasing done during the quarter. Clearly, occupancy has had a nice ride last two quarters, especially on the new leases still trending down about double-digits. Can you just talk about that? When could we expect to see that change? Or is that just a function in some part of above market leases? Or as your occupancy goes up, would you expect that to change near term?
Hap Stein: First of all, its really coming down to supply/demand right. So if you look at our centers, we're already 95% leased. We have about 400 basis points better rent growth in those that are less than 95% leased. And for the same reasons if you're seeing renewals, we've got positive rent growth. So how do we get the rest of it up there? I think a combination of the improving tenant health we talked about should lead to lower move-outs. We are getting rid of the worst properties in the portfolio, which should help us there. The continued the move-out lease up. I think all of those things and the lack of supply coming on to the market should benefit us. And you'll start seeing better rent growth.
Nathan Isbee - Stifel Nicolaus: You haven't issued guidance for '12 yet, but can you give any sort of color on what would you expect on that line item for next year?
Bruce Johnson: We'll give you that guidance, but I'd say it's going to be in the flat range for overall rent growth between renewals and new leases. More to come in December.
Operator: And moving on, our next question is from Quentin Velleley from Citi.
Quentin Velleley - Citi: I'm here with Michael as well. Just in terms of the disposition activity in some of the weaker assets you're trying to sell, I noticed that your guidance came down for this quarter. But it sounds like you've got $150 million assets you're trying to get ready for marketing. I'm just curious, given what sort of happened over last few months in capital markets? Whether on of this being a change in pricing of lease assets and whether the same debts of buys there?
Brian Smith: There has been a change Quentin, when the CMBS market softened we saw right after that a softening in the pricing for some of the BNC quality centers. But I'd say overall is that the A centers the demand continues to exceed the supply, so the pricing has gotten extremely aggressive. I'd say that the typical A now is five and three quarters and you're going to see well below that in California at the low fives and there's a couple of comps below five, actually 4.6 to 4.75. After that you got the Bs and Cs and what's happening there is, if you have a B market with an A tenant roster or you have a B market who doesn't have upside, there is not as much demand for that. Interestingly there is more demand for the C properties, where there is upside. And I think what we're selling would be a combinations of those. We got some 100% leased assets that we would consider Bs that were moving out the door, and then we've got the Cs that have upside are being priced on the current occupancy. So it hasn't really impacted the pricing as seen so far. And where we are, you mentioned about $150 million worth of properties get ready to go to market. The vast majority of those are actually on the market and we've already gotten about $40 million to $50 million worth of offer, so a good momentum on that.
Bruce Johnson: And we really are encouraged by the momentum. And especially, given the fact that some of the assets that we're trying to sell is easier said and done, but we really are selling those assets that we really want to sell. Not from so to speak the middle of our portfolio, but in effect from the lower part of the portfolio. And we're encouraged by the progress we are making. So knock-on we're hopeful that it continues.
Operator: Our next question today is from Craig Schmidt from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Craig Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I just wondered what you specifically saw between the second and third quarter that resulted in the adjusted same-store NOI? Whether that was geographical or type of shops or anything?
Hap Stein: It is primarily this increased act that Bruce mentioned in the amount of pre-leased that jumped up from a 150 basis points to 225 basis points, and Brian kind of amplified on it, the time it's taking to get from in effect LOI to lease to rent paying. And some of that has to do with the large amount of volume of leasing that we're doing. Some of that has to do, which is the time it's taking to get approvals and some under staffing on the tenant side.
Craig Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: So my sense is that it was actually getting worse and then that gave you pause for looking at your NOI. Is that the case?
Bruce Johnson: Yes, I mean it's taking more time. And we did not have the up tick in 225 basis points in pre-leased until this quarter.
Brian Smith: And basically all of the occupancy increase is equal to the increase in the pre-leasing.
Operator: Our next question today is from Christy McElroy from UBS.
Christy McElroy - UBS: I am just following-up on the pre-leasing question at the 225 basis points. Does that mean that your commenced occupancy rate is just above 90%? And sorry if I missed this in opening remarks, but with regard to your small-shop occupancy, what was the commenced occupancy versus the leased percentage?
Brian Smith: On less than 10,000 square feet that 250 basis points would be 375 basis points.
Christy McElroy - UBS: So what was the lease rate?
Brian Smith: Well, 81.5% essentially would be rent paying occupancy versus 85.3% leased.
Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank: And then following up on Nathan's question, just directionally market rent growth between big box versus small shop. Can you talk about what that look like in 2011 versus what you're sort of projecting for 2012?
Brian Smith: We've don't have any big box going into 2012. I don't know if it's broken down by rent growth. But if you look at the average leases, the average rent signed in the third quarter compared to the second quarter our anchors were up 12%. Does that answer Christy.
Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank: And then, sort of small shop directionally. Just looking at kind of a market rent growth, given where occupancy is?
Brian Smith: It was the same thing, the exact same numbers. So the average rent again was up 12% for both the small shops and for the anchors. And that represents two quarters in a row that they've been up. So that's different in the rent growth, because we certainly have some tenants that if they have a different space, let's say, we subdivided a space, whatever the rent growth is associated with those two spaces would be, are not counted in our rent growth, so a little bit different numbers. But using average rent signs for proxy that was going on in the market, it's been up two quarters in a row, 12% in the most recent quarter.
Hap Stein: Just space-to-space, but it is a pretty good proxy as Brian indicated for directionally what's happened.
Brian Smith: See only thing we have Christy is that we breakout the rent growth above 6,500 square feet and less than 6,500 square feet. And for less than 6,500 square feet in the third quarter, we were negative almost 6%. And for those over 6,500 square feet, we're actually positive about 5%.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Jay Habermann from Goldman Sachs.
Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs: Just a question, I guess, on the accelerating paces of assets sales. And can you give us some sense of perhaps what you're thinking as you look out to 2012. I know you mentioned obviously the disruptions in the capital markets recently, but would you plan to sort of match those proceeds with new acquisitions. And perhaps even some sense of what you think as sort of the bottom-tier I guess at this point as a percentage of total portfolio?
Brian Smith: Bottom-tier as percentage of total portfolios is in the 5% range. And I think it's a realistic objective that we can sell those within the next three years. We're not ready to sell right now. And we are being able to achieve that in our strategy. And we may accelerate that kind of more on at Investor Day. And yes it is our intent to obviously to match those sales and effectively trade those proceeds, and the shopping centers that have the attributes that we just talked about that we found in our portfolios that are continuing to generate the highest level of NOI growth, strong anchor sales and strong demographics with good purchasing power. Now as Bruce mentioned, to the extent that we sell more properties than we're able to buy, we do have the flexibility with our term loan to pay down the term loan with excess proceeds.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We'll move onto Paul Morgan from Morgan Stanley.
Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley: Just there on the acquisition strategy, you've talked about focusing more on in-sales. And maybe you could give a little color on the deal and give us the 58 cap rate, which doesn't seem kind of at first blush to be in-sales certainly. And also at a relatively low cap rate kind of below, which you've been looking for. So maybe is there a upside or is that driven more by kind of just the dominance in the market even though it's a small market?
Bruce Johnson: Well, the worse thing about in-sale is that it implies a lack of new supply coming on the market. If ever there's a market that checks that box would be Davis. I mean I personally in California tried for a good 15 years to develop something in Davis and you just can't do it. Any new development in the Davis literally has to go before the voters and the referendum to get approval. So that's why you see no new supply in that market. That's why you've also seen vacancy rates of about 1% even through the recession, so high constraints and low vacancies is what was attracted to us. Then you've got this property that has the highest volume, Safeway, in the market and for safely dominance in Northern California. And then there is potential growth, it's like I always like to say, I'd like to buy the centers where any bad news translates into good news. In this case there's two other anchors that are the weak players within their segment, you've got Rite Aid and OfficeMax. Rite Aid is the only entitled drug store in that market that has a drive-throughs and they're below markets. So if they were to leave, but we have interest from the other two players, and they would pay us a lot more rent. The same thing with OfficeMax is the only office supply store in that market. And you've got the University of California sitting on your doorstep. So we really like that property. It's one where you just don't see a way you can go wrong on it.
Operator: Our next question today is from Michael Mueller from JPMorgan.
Michael Mueller - JPMorgan: I was wondering if you could talk about some of the drivers in the Q4 range, which is kind of wide and at this point where does it look like you're going to end your occupancy guidance, I think it's 92 to 93.5?
Bruce Johnson: Well I mean that is our guidance. So however, you want to look at that. I mean right now the number is pretty much where we are right now is where kind of we expect to end up at the end of the day.
Lisa Palmer: And I think my further range of FFO per share, if you'll do the math, the driver really is equal to the same property NOI growth range. So it will depend on where we fall within that range.
Bruce Johnson: And in closing a development that we're getting real close to which impacts our capitalization rent for that project.
Operator: Jeff Donnelly from Wells Fargo has our next question.
Jeff Donnelly - Wells Fargo: First of just a follow-up to Quentin's earlier question about cap rates, can you tell us where pricing is on B and C assets that I think you referenced, Brian. And the second part of my question is this pertains also to dispositions. One of your competitors pulled the trigger on $0.5 billion portfolio sale. What's you're thinking on executing a transaction of that nature to sort of pull back the band-aid, if you will, a little bit more quickly on your non-core assets rather than holding on them for the next few years. Is that a pretty deep market in your view?
Brian Smith: I'll start with the first one, Jeff. I'd say that the B market is again depending on whether there is any upside or not. It could be 8% to 9.5%. So obvious if you got more growth and you're talking 8% is not then you're going to go higher than that. In terms of the portfolio, what I can tell you, I think you've seen two things going on out there. Where people try to sell portfolios that included properties kind of from all over, they have been pretty unsuccessful. There was one out in California, one of our peers had one. People basically want to cherry pick those. So they want to take the good properties and not take the bad one. So those have not been successful. I think what is a successful strategy is if you package a portfolio to exit a market. And within that portfolio, you have some higher quality ones and some lower quality ones.
Hap Stein: I think that portfolio that was sold was from what I understand may have been cherry picked and in pretty consistent quality, as far as strong anchor tenant, long-terms left on leases happen to be in secondary markets. But what we're selling is stuff typically from the bottom part of our portfolio or as not strategic. We would look and we'll look at, it doesn't make sense to sell a portfolio, as you said the quick in the pace, but more to come on in that regard.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Rich Moore from RBC Capital Markets.
Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets: I wondered if you could give us a little color on what's going on in the development pipeline, especially the pre-2009 are there stuff that started in the past three years or older than three years. Specifically, I see interesting things in there like Waterside for example leasing fell, but yield expectations went higher. So I'm wondering exactly how much effort is being put in here and what you guys are thinking?
Hap Stein: Let me just say, there is a focus on leasing all of our vacant space. That's where we can really, so to speak, move the needle, and whether those spaces are operating properties or properties that we developed within the last few years. So I will just assure you that there is a tremendous amount of focus in that regard.
Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets: I thought some of these interesting, there were others as well besides Waterside. It looks like there is activity or actually a thinking that some of the yields are changing, which tells me that there is activity going on there, but yet leasing doesn't change that. I'm just curious how much activity goes on in the pipeline here in the older stuff?
Brian Smith: I'm not sure what you are talking about exactly. Where you will see some kind of movement typically would be in the completion yield, because that's just a date and time. And what we will do is we'll make changes to underlying assumptions. For example, in any give quarter, it often happens that we may delay the sales and push it back to the quarter after the completion date. So that still keeps our stabilized yield where it was. That should not move very much. But the completion date will yield change, just because you had some movement of space as to when it either leases or in the case of the pad sale as that transaction takes places.
Unidentified Analyst: Just to understand, make sure I realize and understand what you guys are doing, all of these will move into the completed bucket by the end of next year pretty much, right? I mean we have four years from the start and you show that as your date. So basically this pipeline will be gone as a development pipeline, so to speak, by the end of next year?
Brian Smith: That's correct.
Operator: We move on to Chris Lucas from Robert Baird.
Chris Lucas - Robert Baird: Brian, I guess could you give us a little bit more color on the renewals, meaning how much of the 1.4 million feet that you did in the quarter was related to sort of this year versus next year renewals? And then could you give us the specific tenant retention rate and how that compares to sort of last four to eight quarter has been.
Brian Smith: The retention rate was 78%, which is exactly same rate it was last quarter when we had some higher renewals as well. The long-term rate was 68% last quarter. In fact, during last quarter, it takes up to about 69%, 69.5%. In terms of renewals, when they're taking place, if you will, the way most of our leases are structured particularly with the national tenants is they actually give us anywhere from six months to 12 months notice. So if you actually measure when the renewals take place versus when the leases expire, you'll find that for this quarter about 90% of the leases were set to expire either in the current quarter or the next three. So within the next 12 months, that's when 90% of our renewals are taking place.
Chris Lucas - Robert Baird:  I think I know the answer of this, but I'm going to ask it anyways. Any exposure to either A&P or CIMS filings??
Brian Smith: A&P, we had three A&Ps. One was already dark. And then when they went bankrupt, they rejected one and they sold the other, and we have released both of those.
Operator: Our next question is from Cedrik Lachance from Green Street Advisors.
Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors: You've sold so far this year about $17 million versus, but you required about $100 million. There is obviously a gap there in terms of you being a net investor. If we think about the next three years or so, is your goal still to be a substantial net investor or do you really want to recycle the capital fully?
Bruce Johnson: Our goal is to be a net zero investor from an acquisition standpoint. Some of this is just a matter of timing. And there is good chance, like I've indicated earlier, that we may be a net seller. And if that is the case, then the term loan fits very, very well, because if we can match our acquisitions with dispositions and affect trade-up and quality, that's obviously our objective. But to the extent that we're unable to find acquisitions that meet our standards, then we're in a position to in effect pay down the term loan or to finance our development program.
Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors: And just going back to the gap between the lease space and the occupied space, so you're about 225 basis points in present. What's the historical gap that you've maintained over time?
Bruce Johnson: It's been about 150 basis points for the last five, six quarters. This 75 base point jump again pretty much reflects the increase in occupancy.
Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors: And how long do you think it will take to go back to about 150 basis points?
Bruce Johnson: I don't know. Right now from the time a lease is signed until a tenant opens could be as short as three months, could be as long as nine months. So it's going to depend on the new volume. If we continue to keep leasing at the pace we've been doing, it's going to stay high to the extent we start filling up all these vacancies and we can get through the permitting process. That's when it's going to come down quicker.
Operator: We'll go next to R.J. Milligan from Raymond James.
R.J. Milligan - Raymond James: I was just curious if you're seeing a difference in leasing spreads for small-shop space between the more national retailers and the smaller mom and pops for those deals that you're signing with the smaller mom and pops.
Brian Smith: We've not tracked that. I don't have any good data on that.
Hap Stein: Nothing discernible.
R.J. Milligan - Raymond James: I am just wondering if maybe the national retailers, knowing that there is a lot of space out there, are squeezing the landlords more than, say, mom and pop who just wants the demand there or just want the space in the demand there in that particular market.
Brian Smith: It depends on the center, depends on the market and even then depends on the negotiation. I think we may have talked about in the past there is a good example down in (Damper) where we've got a weak market, but we've got some real experienced people, we've got some good assets.  And in that one particular center, we had two national tenants come to us with our offer in hand from a competitive landlord and with full build-out and lower rents. And we knew they are doing quite well in our center. And we know also that it's really operations that makes that decision, not real estate. And for them to give up a very successful store, there is a lot more risk in that than there is in trying to build up a new one. So in that case, we said no, and we actually released both of them and at some rent growth.
Hap Stein: That is one of the things that is talking a lot of time to convert from the leasing pipeline and design leases is national tenants and local tenants were pushing and we are pushing back.
Operator: Next question is from Ari Friedman from Cobalt Capital.
Ari Friedman - Cobalt Capital: Can you guys please provide some color on the type of tenants you're seeing for that small-shop space and what the average rent is for some of these new leases versus some of the move-outs?
Bruce Johnson: There is really nobody that's not actively seeking space. But I tell you that the highest demand is coming from all types of restaurants, the burgers, the coffee stores, the yogurt stores. We're all seeing good demand from pet stores, lots of services. And I'd say the average rents for the last quarter for the small shops is a little bit north of $25 a square foot. That's down the peak that was about $29 on average, and it got down as low as a little bit about $21. So we're kind of halfway between the peak and the trough right now in terms of last quarter.
Ari Friedman - Cobalt Capital: And is this tenant mix materially different from what you've seen over the past couple of years?
Bruce Johnson: No, it's not. It's very similar. In terms of the use, there is very little difference. But in terms of the caliber of the operator, the credit and everything, it's a much better mix.
Operator: (Operator Instructions)
Bruce Johnson: There appears to be no further questions. We appreciate your interest and time, involvement, anticipation. Everybody, have a great day and a great weekend. Thank you.
Operator: And that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you all for your participation.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Holly, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Regency Centers Corporation Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Lisa Palmer, Senior Vice President, Capital Markets. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Holly. Good morning, everyone. On the call this morning are Hap Stein, Chairman and CEO; Brian Smith, President and Chief Operating Officer; Bruce Johnson, Chief Financial Officer; and Chris Leavitt, Senior Vice President and Treasurer. Before we start, I'd like to address forward-looking statements that may be discussed on the call. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in these forward-looking statements. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce.
Bruce Johnson: Thank you, Lisa, and good morning. As we reported, recurring FFO for the second quarter was $0.56 per share. Total FFO was $0.61 per share. As Brian will discuss later, tenant health continues to improve. Rent relief requests and tenant defaults are approaching prerecession levels. That being said, our provision for doubtful accounts was higher than what was recorded in the first quarter and also higher than the second quarter of 2010. The majority of that increase was due to expense reconciliations being built in the second quarter this year versus the first quarter last year. This year, we reserve a higher amount relating to the reconciliations as we experienced abnormally high expenses in 2010, much of it related to the snow removal costs in the Northeast and the mid-Atlantic.  During the quarter, we renewed our property insurance policies early in an attempt to get in front of expected increases resulting from the recent catastrophes, including the Japan earthquake. Although we mitigated some of the impact, we still experienced higher-than-expected premium increases of 12% or approximately $2 million over the prior policy period.  As a result of the higher reconciliation billings and the recently completed renewal of our insurance, we have lowered guidance for the expense recovery rate to the range of 76% to 78%. Primarily because of the slightly higher-than-expected provision for doubtful accounts and the reduction in recovery rate related to insurance increases, we reduced the high end of our guidance for same-property NOI growth by 50 basis points to 1%.  Our liquidity position is in great shape, with almost full availability of our $600 million line of credit. We held our annual bank meeting last Thursday to discuss the recast of the line, which is set to expire in February 2012. We have an extremely positive response. We're seeing commitments in excess of our requested level prior to the meeting. We expect the new facility to carry a 4-year term with a 1-year extension option and market-leading pricing. Closing is anticipated in late August or early September.  We further improved our debt maturity profile, particularly in our core investment partnerships. During the quarter, we closed $340 million in secured financings with a weighted average term of 11 years and an interest rate of 4.87%. We also infused with our partners nearly $120 million in equity, which is part of our plan to delever the GRI partnership. This eliminate all 2011 maturing debt in our partnerships, which has allowed us to focus on 2012 maturities and take advantage of still historically low rates. We have just over $200 million in consolidated unsecured debt maturing at the end of 2011 and at the beginning of 2012.  Looking ahead for the year, we have tightened guidance range of recurring FFO per share to $2.33 to $2.43. For the third quarter, we expect recurring FFO to be in the range of $0.57 to $0.62 per share.  Brian?
Brian Smith: Thanks, Bruce, and good morning. Things aren't perfect, but the positive underlying trends we experienced last quarter continued. With spaces greater than 5,000 square feet, nearly 96% leased, small shop leasing is the key to restoring occupancy to historic levels. This category led the way during the second quarter with occupancy in spaces less than 5,000 square feet increasing 50 basis points to 84.3%.  Overall, operating occupancy increased by 10 basis points to 92.1%. This is despite a 30-basis-point negative impact from 19 Blockbuster move-outs and a 10-basis-point impact from development completions. We signed over 500,000 square feet of new leases, significantly more than prerecession times. Notably, 90% of these new leases were with retailers less than 5,000 square feet, and they represented over 60% of the GLA line.  Renewals totaled 1.2 million square feet, which is also far more than any quarter in recent memory. The renewal rate was 78% versus 64% last quarter and 68% since 2006. Move-outs improved in the second quarter even with more than 100,000 square feet of Blockbuster move-outs. 21 Blockbuster assignments to Dish have been approved by the bankruptcy court compared to a store count of 52 at the end of 2010 or a loss of 31. This will cause an 80-basis-point decline in same-property NOI growth for the year, which is more than we originally anticipated.  Rent growth, while still not nearly as good as we would like, was almost flat. Excluding spaces vacant for more than 12 months, rent growth was positive 2.8% with both new and renewal leasing registering positive spreads. In the process, we spent only $1.82 per square foot in tenant improvement dollars. And accounts receivable greater than 90 days, an indicator of existing tenant health, are down nearly 40% compared to last summer, a result of actively calling weak tenants from the portfolio.  Beyond this quarter's results, there are more reasons to be optimistic about the future. Our current leasing pipeline remains robust, with nearly 1.5 million square feet of leases, or LOIs, under negotiation, a sizable cushion of almost 2x the amount of new leasing we hope to execute in the remainder of the year.  We are getting tremendous amount of new activity from retailers looking to take advantage of opportunities to secure spaces in strong markets at favorable rates. This includes a good share of local tenants relative to last year. We have not experienced any slowdown in tenant interest even in light of the recent increases in unemployment and reduction in GDP growth.  And finally, retail construction remains at or near all-time lows in virtually every part of the country. This is serving to benefit landlords while the supply -- or while the demand side of the business improves.  While these are all good reasons to be encouraged, we are operating in an environment that continues to be choppy. Move-outs, while better, remain at levels above long-term norms. On the demand side, retailer bankruptcies and consolidations continue to have an impact on the supply of competitive space.  While the leasing activity is significant, it is taking longer than expected to translate into rent paying occupancy. New leases are taking much longer to execute due to understaffing by the retailers and more difficult and drawn out lease negotiations as both sides work hard to protect their interests.  Once signed, it then takes longer to get tenants open. Local governments have experienced significant staffing cutbacks, causing permitting time to increase dramatically which in turn delays rent commencement. Loan balance conditions in the operating portfolio are better now than they were last summer and much better than 2 years ago, and the trend is improving. But we remain cautious as the recovery is clearly still a slow and fragile one.  Leasing in the development portfolio has been encouraging as well. On an apples-to-apples basis, our percent leased at 86% increased 400 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, and based on the recent activity and momentum, we believe we could finish the year above 88% leased. Also our 6 most recent developments and 2 most recent redevelopments are averaging 9.7% return on costs, which is about 60 basis points better than underwritten. In today's environment, this translates into profit margins in excess of 60%.  This list of centers includes Seminole Shoppes, which is anchored by its highly successful 54,000 square foot Publix. Our team is able to take this project from raw land to fully built and 95% leased with a 9.9% return on cost in less than 2 years. This is a type of success we expect from our development program.  We started one new development this quarter located in Greeley, Colorado. It is a T.J. Maxx build-to-suit and is the final phase of a much larger operating property. Our return on the project should be approximately 10%, which we are very happy with considering the limited risk profile of this investment. Given the depth to the high profitability pipeline, there's a good chance that we will end the year at the high end of our guidance for development starts.  It's also important to note that significant progress is being made on reducing our land inventory. Sales contracts, letters of intent and land in higher profitability developments now total $45 million. Once closed, we will have effectively converted 30% of our owned land into cash for attractive new developments.  Furthermore, we continue to upgrade Regency's portfolio of high-quality real estate through our capital recycling program. Today's cap rate environment is coaxing a lot of once-in-a-generation properties to market, and those are the properties that Regency is aggressively targeting for acquisition.  In the second quarter, we acquired Ocala Corners, a Regency-developed center with excellent future NOI growth prospects. Ocala Corners is the main grocery-anchored center serving Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida. It's anchored by one of the best performing public stores in the chain. The center was acquired from Charter Hill through a right of first refusal at a very attractive 7.9% cap rate.  Since the end of the quarter, we also closed on Calhoun Commons, a Whole Foods-anchored property located in the uptown neighborhood of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Calhoun Commons is true infill real estate, with more than 170,000 people within 3 miles. Whole Foods sales are in the $850 per square foot range and have grown by over 40% since 2007, while shop tenant sales average approximately $450 per square foot. The tenancy is extremely stable as 94% of the tenants have been in the center since it was developed back in 1999.  In addition to this quarter's closed transactions, we are under contract on 4 new acquisitions with similar attributes to those on which we've recently closed. Real estate in high barrier markets, where there is long-term pricing power or any bad news encountered, results in good news. Of course, this type of quality is not coming without a price. The best retail real estate on the market today is trading below 6%. Prices are high, but they are commensurate with the quality of the assets.  So as our disposition program accelerates, I'm confident we will be able to reinvest the proceeds in the quality infill shopping centers with substantially more reliable prospects for future NOI growth. I'm truly excited by these infill opportunities and believe that their unique attributes will enhance Regency's portfolio and help drive our fundamental results for years to come, especially in comparison with the assets being sold.  This quarter we disposed of a noncore asset located in Alexandria, Virginia for $3 million, a 4.9% cap rate. Additionally, we have 8 properties under contract for disposition and more being prepared for market in the near future. Leases are being signed that will improve the marketability of properties to ensure that Regency receives maximum value for these assets.  To conclude, during the second quarter, the foundation was laid for more concrete improvement in key metrics. There's no doubt that the trend is pointing up, but there's no straight line to where we're headed. We continue to see bumps along the road, but we're encouraged by the momentum.  Hap?
Martin Stein: Thank you, Brian, and thank you, Bruce. As I reflect on this quarter's results, I want to share 2 sentiments with you.  First, well, for the most part and in most areas, we are where we said we would be at this time. Regency's team feels we have a long way to go before we're satisfied. At the same time, you need to know that we are encouraged by the underlying trends, which should lead to real progress in each key aspect of our business: growing occupancy and NOI, enhancing the quality of future NOI through capital recycling, manufacturing quality centers at attractive returns for development and continuing to strengthen the balance sheet.  Let me describe what real gratifying progress by the end of the year would look like for my colleagues and me. First and foremost, the tenant demand, coupled with the intense focus of the leasing team and high quality of portfolio, helped us convert more than 50% of the 1.5 million square-foot leasing pipeline that Brian described into signed leases. So the operating and development portfolios finished the year at 93% and 88% leased, respectively. And NOI growth for the total portfolio, that is operating plus developments on a comparable property basis, net of termination fees, reached 2%.  Second, that we recycled over $150 million of capital out of lower quality assets with potential erosion in value into irreplaceable infill shopping centers, along the lines of those 2 described by Brian, with market-leading anchors that will generate reliable future NOI growth.  Third, and our reenergized development program started $75 million to $90 million of new developments and redevelopments that will enhance the overall quality of Regency's portfolio while achieving attractive risk-adjusted returns. And fourth, that the team further strengthened Regency's balance sheet and access to multiple sources of capital by renewing the $600 million bank line of credit for 4 years, maintaining substantial unused capacity on that line, closing on over $400 million of mortgages in the co-investment partnerships and meaningfully expanding several of those co-investment partnerships.  While a lot of it still needs to be chopped, and there's no way to overlook the headwinds from an extremely sluggish and fragile recovery, I am confident of our dedicated team's ability to achieve these objectives. I am also hopeful that the deficit reduction agreement will remove some of the uncertainty in our economy and set the stage for the government to start addressing some of our country's long-term issues.  As long as there is some level of growth, even if it's anemic and uneven, I feel that the steps we're taking at Regency will begin to bear fruit by year end, produce results that will represent a meaningful advancement toward the standard that we set for the company and most important of all, better position Regency for the future, especially for achieving 95% occupancy and 3% NOI growth.  We recognize that Regency's vision of building a great company is an ongoing journey. We welcome the challenge and look forward to seeing the results of our efforts in the coming quarters.  Before I end my comments, I want to note how pleased and excited I am that David O'Connor has joined Regency's Board of Directors. I have long admired Dave as one of the most astute minds in the REIT industry, and for those that know him, he's also a wonderful individual. Regency is very, very fortunate to have the benefit of his perspective and insights.  We thank you for your presentation and welcome any questions you may have.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Craig Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch: I was wondering, what are you looking forward to in terms of things that might mitigate what appeared to be the smaller shops starting to come back? And I'm guessing, obviously, the continuation of trying to fill up the Blockbusters. But is there anything else in the third and fourth quarter that might mitigate what otherwise would be forward progress?
Martin Stein: I'd say the overall economy is the -- if you have a backlog in the economy, which eventually translated into a slowdown in tenant demand, that would obviously have an impact. And in the timing of -- I'm looking at Brian right now. But the real thing is we've got a 1.5 million square-foot pipeline that's real. But as Brian mentioned, it's taking longer to convert leasing activity into LOIs, and LOIs into executed leases and executed leases into rent paying tenants.
Brian Smith: Yes. Craig, I think that's the biggest issue. We've got so much momentum when it comes to the leasing. We are signing so much, but it's just -- we're just not seeing that improvement right now simply because, as mentioned on the call, the leases are taking longer to get signed. The retailers don't have the staffing, then the negotiations seem to go on and on. A lot of that's due to us. We're taking a harder line on some of the provisions that could hurt you down the road. And then the real tough part is once you turn it over, for example, in Atlanta, once a tenant applies for permits, it's good 3 to 4 weeks before they'll even touch the plan. So it's just taking a long time to get those plans reviewed, and then you've got to build out and the subsequent delay in getting rent paying.
Craig Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch: If back-to-school were to be good, reasonably good, do you think you would see some of that process through the leasing accelerate from the retailers' point of view?
Brian Smith: Yes, again, it's not that the pipeline of leasing and the volume of leasing is getting done. It's just getting them open. When we are seeing a sense of urgency in some parts, in our Indio project, for example, where we had Starbucks, they just -- they wouldn't even talk to us 3 years ago and now it's like we got to get open, we got to get open. So I do think as sales ratchet up, and sales have been good, if they continue like that, I think the retailers are going to clearly have a sense of urgency to get open before the end of the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Quentin Velleley with Citi.
Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc: Just going back to the comment that it's taking longer for leases and tenants to get opened and the process is a lot longer. If we sort of -- I'm just trying to work out how much NOI is sort of sitting there. So if you look at the lease rate versus the actual opened and occupied rate, what is that spread between the 2 numbers? And how should that sort of close out over the next 12 months?
Lisa Palmer: I'll let Brian answer from a bigger picture. But Quentin, we also do give some guidance in the supplemental on the guidance page, Page 37, where we show NOI from leases signed but aren't yet rent-paying. And for that quarter, that number was $1.7 million, and that's what the quarter number.
Brian Smith: Right. I mean, the breakdown, Quentin, is it's 190 basis points from the percent leased to the effective rent paying occupancy. The 40 basis points of that would be tenants that are not paying or not paying everything they should be, and 150 basis points would be those that, basically, the pre-leasing. 60 basis points of that 150 have not yet taken occupancy, and the other 90 are in occupancy doing their build out and waiting to pay rent.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc: It's Michael Bilerman speaking. Hap and Brian, both of you made sort of comments about not being where you want to be. And Hap, you said you have a long -- the company has a long way to be satisfied. And Brian, in the press release you talked about while we're not where we want to be. And I'm just trying to tease out how much of that is -- you guys as a company have always had -- you've always had very high expectations for yourselves. You want to be a premier company, a premier developer, a premier owner, and so you set your targets. I'm not saying that they're not realistic targets, but you demand a lot from yourselves. And so I'm just trying to reconcile some of your views versus what should be viewed as reasonably good results, right? Lease spreads are going up, your occupancy is going up. I mean, I don't want to undermine the fact of what's happening -- of what's actually happening on the ground and with your portfolio relative to, I guess, your ambition of where you want to be, and maybe you can sort of tease that out a little bit for us.
Martin Stein: Well, like I just said, I think that from an operating portfolio standpoint, if we could be -- and I think it's achievable, but as we talked about, there's risk on timing of converting leasing activity into signed leases. But if we could be at 93% leased by the end of the year, I think that would be a step on the right direction towards getting to 95%. And that's probably going to take another couple of years beyond that to get to 95% leased. I think that if we can be, we will have taken our developments from 82% today. We don't like being -- excuse, the beginning of the year. We don't like being 86% today, but 88% by the end of the year is doable, and that's a progress from the way to 95%. The development pipeline is pretty strong. We've got -- the teams got a lot of work to do to get us to the upper end of the guidance. Things can get pushed out, et cetera, but there's some real attractive properties there, and that's -- we think we can get there, and then also executing on the capital recycling side. And I think progress is being made. So I think that when you look at the environment in which we're operating today, with the slow economy, et cetera, and the amount of time it's taking to make transactions happen, things take longer than they have in the past. But we do feel, and we are encouraged by the progress, it's just not getting there as soon as you like to think. I don't have any other way to say it. I don't know, Brian, if you...
Brian Smith: Yes, Mike, I actually appreciate that. I think we are driven, and we're just not satisfied, not patting ourselves in the back for anything we may have done to date. I mean, we all have the goal in mind. We know where we've been. We know where we need to be. We know where we can be. We know where we're going to be. And until we get there, it's just going to -- we are going to be hard on ourselves.
Operator: Next, we'll hear from Christy McElroy with UBS.
Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank: Just actually staying on that same topic, with the bulk of that sort of 93% to 95% occupancy upside over the next several years being in small shop leasing. If we assume sort of a gradual increase over time, how should we think about the average rents on that space relative to the portfolio average given that not all occupancy is created equal?
Brian Smith: So basically, where do you think the rent growth is going?
Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank: Sure. Well, basically, so how in terms of the occupancy upside that you've had so far has created a certain amount of rent growth. Is the -- given that the average rents on that incremental space on the small shop leasing will probably be higher than the portfolio average, what's the incremental contribution to rent growth from that leasing?
Brian Smith: Well, I think it's not going to be -- the small shop leasing has been -- I don't know if we've got the contribution to rent growth on that. Do we? No. I think basically, our rent growth is going to be, at least through the end of the year, essentially where it's at today. I think our renewal leasing is going to be somewhere around flat to slightly positive, and I think our new leasing is going to continue to be maybe flat to minus 10%. As we start to fill up those spaces, logically, we're going to get better and better ability to drive rents. We're seeing that in our 95% lease centers. If you look, for example, in the Bay Area in the anchor space, this quarter we signed some in the $30 range. We signed a couple junior anchors in the mid-20s. So I think what will happen is you'll see this year continuing to be relatively flat. And then as we start to get that occupancy up closer to 88%, 89% on the less than 5,000 square feet, we'll start to be able to drive the rents.
Lisa Palmer: I think, Christy, I would just add, if you really roughly do the math, if you assume somewhere around $24 of revenue is coming from the small shop tenants on 100 basis points of occupancy in our small shops, that gets you to almost $7 million. So 100-basis-point increase in occupancy in small shops should translate to close to 2% same-property NOI growth on an annual basis.
Martin Stein: And then on top of that is we've said we're generating about 1% to 1-plus percent in contractual rent increases on top of that. So 3% NOI growth in the not-too-distant future for us is achievable.
Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank: Okay. That's helpful. And then just with regard to the increase in occupancy for your development leasing, was that purely a function of sort of greater demand for that space? Or have you become -- in terms of your strategy with regards to that leasing, have you become a little softer on rent requirements just to get the space leased up for the good of the center? And with regard to leasing upside the sort of the pre-2009 projects, to what extent are you doing shorter term maybe 1- to 3-year leases in hopes to occupy the center in the near term but maybe benefit in a couple of years if demand recovers more substantially?
Brian Smith: We haven't changed our strategy on that. In fact, if anything, I think we're outperforming our strategy. If I think back to some of our tougher projects like in Indio, at Indio, we had underwritten very low rents to get some of the spaces leased and in fact, free rent for a period of time and that hasn't happened. We've come in with rents better than that. So we're not letting good tenants get away on the development properties just because the rents are lower. We are, though, doing as you said in some cases more so last year than this year. We would go ahead and do a 3-year lease and offer low starting rent and then build it up pretty rapidly like maybe 30% a year or even. But I'd say what's really going on there is some anchor leasing is driving that, but I think things are just slowly improving. I think the best example again is in Indio, where we had a retailer, Party City, opened up a temporary store for their Halloween concept, took a chance. Things were so good they decided to convert it to a full long-term lease with Party City and Starbucks, which wouldn't look at it 3 years ago. Now it's eager to open. So I think it's just things are improving. People are willing to take chances because of the lack of supply out there. They don't have as many opportunities, and it's just kind of slow and steady.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets.
Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Bruce, on the Rabbi trust issue that you had last quarter, where does that stand? Is that resolved? Or what's going on there?
Bruce Johnson: Yes, we have basically converted that so that you won't see anymore negative numbers with respect to that.
Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Okay. Good. And -- I'm sorry. Were you done?
Bruce Johnson: That's it.
Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Okay. Okay. Good. And then also guys, I was curious. On the last call, it seemed that you were -- you had identified more assets both for sale and for purchase. And you mentioned some of that in your opening remarks, Brian, I think that you had found some things. But it seemed at the time that you had many more assets. I think it was 13 that you were going to sell and then maybe a dozen that you were reviewing in the pipeline. Has either of those dispositions or acquisitions slowed in your view? And maybe what are you thinking in terms of both as you look at the next couple of quarters?
Brian Smith: Our thinking hasn't changed, Rich. Of the 13 that we were talking about taking to market, we have taken the majority of those to market. And the 7, I think, that we talked about last quarter that were on the market, we have contracts. And I think in almost every case, the buyers are hard with their deposits on 6 of them. So while the numbers to date don't add up, if you take a look at what we've got for sale either closed or under contract, we're in about the $58 million range. And then as you said, we've got many more of the original 13 plus some additional ones that we're going to be taking to market. So we still hope to get up in the $140 million, $150 million range by the end of the year. And the acquisitions, there are lots of opportunities. With what we've already got under contract and closed, we're already at the $140 million range.
Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Okay. But you even have more you're taking a look at. I take it the pipeline is still deep on the acquisition front?
Brian Smith: It is. As we talked about, there's -- the good news associated with the lower cap rates is we're just seeing some just fabulous properties and the kind you just have to own. And to the extent we can recycle out of our ones with NOI risk, we would just love to get those.
Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Okay. Good. And the last thing I had was, the other income line was higher. Is there anything special in there?
Brian Smith: We did have -- I think the best majority of that were settlements. For example, there was a large tenant out in Northern California that we were in a lawsuit with. And so really, what those represent those settlements are rents owed as well as acceleration of rents.
Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Okay. So that comes down, I take it, for the next several quarters?
Brian Smith: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG: I just had a follow-up question, just in terms of leasing volume, which has been pretty solid. Just curious as to how the trends in the fallout rates have been. Have they improved, or are they kind of staying stable at this point?
Brian Smith: That's the one area that we need to break and we expect to improve. We've been saying for some time, given all the different health ratios, health metrics of the retailers we expect it to improve. It is improving slowly. Unfortunately, we have the Blockbuster we talked about. If you subtract the Blockbuster from our move-outs in the second quarter, they'd be vastly improved. On an annualized basis, it would be a pretty low number. But really, it's a slow and steady progress there. Also, if you look at the first quarter move-outs this year and compared to the first quarter move-outs last year, it's better. If you look at the second quarter this year versus second quarter last year, it's better. So we do have an improving trend line, and by the end of the year, we expect that we will probably be about 250,000 square feet better in terms of move-outs than we were a year ago.
Martin Stein: And that's one of the key to get to the 95% over the next few years.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG: Okay. And then just a follow-up. I thought I heard you say the pipeline of deals that you're sort of looking at right now is about 1.4 million square feet? Is that correct?
Martin Stein: 1.5 million.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG: 1.5 million. Okay. And did you say that, that represented only about 2x what you expect to do in the second half here?
Brian Smith: Yes. I mean, to get to the numbers that we want to be at, we've got assumptions as to how much of new leasing we're going to do and how much we're going to experience in move-outs. And so when it comes to what we still need -- we want to do about 1.8 million square feet in new leases, we've already done over 1 million. So we got about 800,000 square feet to go, and we are actively working on about 1.5 million square feet of identified tenants either in lease negotiation or LOI. So that's the 2x.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG: And it just seems like that's a pretty dramatic slowdown in terms of the quarterly volume from what you've been doing. So that's more what you hope to do to hit plan? Or do you really think that's going to slow down that much?
Brian Smith: Right. Well, the issue there is it certainly could be more. But when you look at your -- especially your LOIs but also with your lease negotiations, things can happen. I mean, we just had a situation where you're working on a lease, it's approved by all the real estate people, it's a national tenant, it goes to their committee and it gets turned down. That stuff can happen. So what we look at it as is it's a cushion. If we've got 2 leases or 2 square feet for everyone we need, we feel pretty comfortable we'll get to our numbers. But hopefully, our numbers are conservative, and hopefully, we'll do better than that. But a big thing that's preventing us from really ratcheting that number up is just that a lot of that, that 1.5 million square feet, could slip into 2011. It may happen, but they may go past the end of the calendar year.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG: Okay. And just one last one. It just seems like, obviously, the macro environment has gotten a bit softer here. And no one's really mentioned anything in terms of how it's impacting their leasing activity or they're not seeing it yet. I'm just wondering what your thoughts are there. Is the discussion at all changing even with in the last few weeks?
Martin Stein: We haven't seen any impact yet. I mean, yes, there's a -- I think retailers are pretty cautious for the most part even those that are expanding, but we just have not seen it. The leasing activity is still extremely robust, which at the same time, we all read the paper. So that's the reason why we're overlaying a good dose of caution on top of the encouraging signs that we're seeing.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies & Company.
Albert Lin - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: This is Albert Lin with Tayo on the line as well. Just a quick question. Aside from the leasing process taking a little bit longer, is there anything else that's driving your same-store NOI guidance down?
Bruce Johnson: Well, I mentioned on the call, I mentioned we lowered our recovery rate on the call and also...
Lisa Palmer: And also, that's really the bad -- the increase in the bad debt, provision for bad debt...
Bruce Johnson: The provision for bad debt effectively adds another 15 basis points to where we thought we'd end up being. As you recall, I think I've given guidance we'd be at 70 basis points for the year. That was my expectation. And I think that will be our run rate kind of going forward, that's kind of what we're expecting. But we have a little bit of a blip which will cause an average over the year probably closer to mid-85 basis points.
Lisa Palmer: And for those of you that maybe dialing a little late because that was pretty early in the call, the increase in the provision for doubtful accounts is really related to our recovery reconciliations that we completed in the second quarter of this year. In past years, we typically had that done in the first quarter. So on a year-to-date basis, you'll see that our bad debt expense is actually less than it was in 2010. Yet our revenues are pretty significantly higher. So on a run rate basis from '11 to '10, we've actually improved that.
Martin Stein: And termination fees will be down from last year.
Albert Lin - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Okay. And then also, with your development pipeline already 86% leased, how much of an impact do you think you'll generate as those projects come online and you lease the remaining of that space out?
Martin Stein: From an NOI standpoint, I think there's probably another...
Brian Smith: Well, we've got $6.2 million of additional upside in the development portfolio. Of that, $2.6 million of it is already pre-leased and $1.4 million of that pre-leasing is coming on in 2011, $1.2 million in 2012. And then there will be additional lease up beyond that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Samit Parikh.
Samit Parikh: Just one quick question. Given the sort of relatively low return environment with high-quality acquisitions right now, are you guys seriously considering repurchasing the preferred stock?
Martin Stein: We look at all financing options and uses of capital, and that's one of them. I do want to point out that while 7.4% preferred, which are our highest rate preferreds, is above where we could issue preferred today, it seems high, preferred stock is preferred and there is no maturity on it. And there was not too long ago when ten year interest rates on corporate bonds were well above that. So it's something that we look and we'll consider.
Lisa Palmer: And the issuance cost we're doing on new deals basically makes up the difference between what we can issue today and redeeming. So there's not a whole lot of savings to replace the existing preferred with new preferred.
Martin Stein: It's something that we're continuing to evaluate in the context of it is permanent capital.
Samit Parikh: Okay. Great. And just -- sorry, one more question, last question. Could you just give sort of a comment on the financing environment for sort of small businesses and what you're seeing from your tenants? You're talking about leases taking longer to sign. How much risk do you think there is in those leases potentially ultimately not being signed if banks sort of de-risk here and just aren't as willing to lend to new business creation or small business...
Martin Stein: I think the trend is going the other way. The banks seem to be loosening their credit to -- they want to make small business loans.
Brian Smith: Yes, we saw a pretty sizable -- a very sizable increase this quarter in the request for business assignments, which you're going to get when you have financing available as well as lender verification calls where people are looking to take out financing. They're calling us to verify term, rents, stuff like that. And while we are seeing a lot of that, the fact of the matter is over the last 2 years, we've had to deal with the fact there wasn't much small shop financing available. So all of our leasing efforts have really been focused on those that are well capitalized either individuals or franchisees, national and regional chains. So while we are seeing a lot more of the financing, we're really not counting on it.
Martin Stein: And I think it's also -- just to pick up on the point that Brian made, I think at least half of our small shop leasing is national tenants. I mean, JPMorgan, Starbucks, Panera Bread, these are well-capitalized companies. But I think the lending environment for local tenants has gotten better.

Operator: Thank you. And that does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2009 Q4  (2010-02-04 17:00:00) =====
Operator: My name is Lena and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Regency Centers Corporation Fourth Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Lisa Palmer, Senior Vice President, Capital Markets. Please go ahead ma’am.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you Lena and good morning everyone. On the call this morning are Hap Stein, Chairman and CEO; Brian Smith, President & COO, and Bruce Johnson, CFO; and Chris Leavitt, Senior Vice President and Treasurer. Before we start, I’d like to address forward-looking statements that maybe addressed on the call. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes, and results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically, the most recent reports on our Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors, which could cause actual results to differ from those contained in these forward-looking statements. Bruce?
Bruce Johnson: Thank you Lisa, and good morning to everyone on the call. Recurring funds from operations for the fourth quarter was $0.63 per share. This was above the high-end of our guidance due to the higher net operating income, which was driven by improved collection rates and a termination fee. Further more lease and activity was well above our fourth quarter expectations and as a result, third party leasing commission profits were $1 million higher. Recurring funds from operations was $2.68 per share for the year down $0.22 from the same period last year. The change is primarily related to decline in net operating income and increased interest expense as a result of lower capitalization. The reduction in NOI was driven by a decrease in occupancy in higher bad debt expense. The decline in occupancy also negatively impacted our recovery ratio. Although not included in recurring FFO, we incurred a $3 million hedge unaffected administered charge during the fourth quarter. Hedge ineffectiveness is a charge to earnings related to an over hedge position as a result of changing our assumptions of future debt issues. We have revised our assumptions to lane a portion of expected debt issuance in 2011 and as a result of completing the $246 million forward equity offering in December changed our assumptions. As we have previously stated, in addition to preserving and growing NOI, Regency’s key focus and priority continues to be strengthening the balance sheet. In December, we entered into a forward agreement with JP Morgan and Wells Fargo Securities to sell $8 million shares of Regency common stock at $30.75 per share. We will use the estimated $235 and net proceeds along with a $100 million in cash on our balance sheet to pay down debt. Additionally, during the quarter we exercised our options to increase our ownership and the Macquarie II co-investment partnership. While the technical transfer of the ownership has not yet occurred due to lender consents, we began realizing the economic benefits of increased ownership now 40% beginning in December. Also on December 31st, we’ve received our final distribution in kind from the Macquarie I co-investment partnership and finalize the dissolution of the entity. In total we've received six profits with a combined value of nearly $203 million which we represents both the return of our 25% interest in the partnership at a $13 million (inaudible). Looking into 2010, we are expecting recurring FFO per share to be in the range of $2.11 and $2.31, unchanged from the guidance we provide in December. Total funds from operations for 2010 are expected to be in the range of $2.12 to $2.34 per share. Brian?
Brian Smith: Thank you, Bruce. My step away from the numbers and surveyed landscape, there's no question that there is still winds in our face. High unemployment and weak housing market are but two of lingering problems faced in the industry. At the time the winds appear to be shifting in, knock on wood even moderating while we maintain a weary eye it appears to be some real meaningful improvement in the environment. Retailers are gaining momentum and confidence having enjoyed a good fourth quarter and one of the best holiday seasons in years. The surviving retailers have learned how to operate in this environment with effective inventory control and lower overhead which have translated into higher margins. Many believe they've seen the bottom and/or again undertaking store expansion. Certain markets appeared to be recovering including Texas, Coastal California, particularly the San Francisco Bay Area, the Carolina and portions of Atlanta. As a matter of fact, our properties in most markets are experiencing a significant pickup in traffic and retailer interest. Retailers who for at least a year dragged their feet in tick tires are now showing a sense of urgency at open stores as quickly as possible. As a result, there are least negotiations going on not only for spaces previously vacant but for those not yet vacant. In several occasions we are already in discussions to back fill large Blockbuster spaces with leases expiring in late 2010, as well as some we expect to go dark in 2010 and at least one case the new lease could result in double digit rent growth. We are also in final negotiations to fill up vacant lands [things] box in one of our Cincinnati centers. Although this transaction would result in a moderate reduction in rent, space could be taken as is and would restore that asset to 100% lease. While we chose to pick up the pace of expansion, they continue to be selective, focusing on healthier markets and better centers. Fortunately, this benefits Regency, as does our ability to fund tenant improvement dollars, pay brokers commissions and keep our centers looking attractive. A top grocerier recently approached us about relocating into one of our centers because they are not happy with the lack of upkeep in their current center across the street. This improvement however is not without exceptions. Those areas hardest hit by the housing bust continue to struggle with no improvement or increase in activity. These markets include Las Vegas, Phoenix and non-coastal California, particularly the inland empire and desert areas. In summary, Keller’s is still struggling. Tenant failures and move outs remain a concern and pressure on rents is expected to continue until occupancy rates return to levels previously seen. This is particularly true in green areas where densities are light. Regency’s performance in many ways merits this tale of two markets. Our operating portfolio occupancy level remains essentially unchanged from the third quarter. Recent premier was strong especially considering the environment we’ve been in. for the year we entered into 1600 leased transactions representing approximately 5.3 million square feet, that’s 1.4 million square feet in new leases and 3.9 million square feet of renewals. Our renewal rate held strong at 75%. In fact the fourth quarter was the best quarter for leasing since the first quarter of 2008 with renewals being the highest since the fourth quarter of 2007. This leasing momentum continued through the month of January. Rent growth for the fourth quarter was virtually flat with similar results in January. The spread on new leases was negative 18.5% while renewals, which represent approximately 80% of lease transactions, the growth was nearly plus 7%, which is the positive number we've seen in four quarters. Renewals have been a relative bright spot and should continue to be and let me explain one reason why. If you assume market rents are $22 per square foot, and current rents in the center are $26 per square foot, a new lease would most likely be signed at the lower rent for $22. However, chances are that the renewal will be executed at the higher number of $26. Successful retailers are understandably reluctant to walkway from sizable investment in their stores or to disrupt established shopping patterns. One of our key strategies is to create value by reducing our land inventory preferably through developing the properties where it's appropriate, and acceptable returns on incremental invested capital, or by selling the land if development is not warranted. In the fourth quarter we successfully executed this strategy on two parcels of land. In Raleigh, North Carolina, we started the development of the Market at Colonnade on land that we purchased in 2007. The underwritten return including the land cost is 8.4%, while the incremental return on the new cost is almost 11%. This is a project that is clearly worth developing. Colonnade is a fabulous of real estate that we pursued on behalf of Whole Foods with extremely with high barriers to entry, strong demographics and significant pent-up demand for the limited amount of shop space that will be built. Both this project and Publix anchor Seminole shops in Jacksonville that we started earlier in the year are classic infield grocery anchor centers that are virtually impossible to replicate in their given markets. In 2007, we also purchased 27 acres of land in Ceres, California in order to develop a Wal-Mart Anchor Center. Ceres is located in the central valley of Northern California where today unemployment hovers around 20%. Unlike Colonnade this is not a project that should be developed today, in early last year we began negotiations with Wal-Mart to sell the undeveloped land. In November we closed on the sale of the entire property for nearly $14 million or $12 per square foot, recording a small gain in the process. We continue to pursue advantageous ways to further reduce the land inventory. I'm really pleased to note that we began three internal redevelopments during the fourth quarter that are creating value in multiple ways. At Wilson Center II in Virginia, we are expanding an undersize safe way, restructuring their ground lease, extending the term, and nearly tripling the rent. At Eastport Plaza in South Florida, we are relocating the inline Walgreen's to a corner out parcel also gaining meaningful rent growth there. The third redevelopment is an expansion of publics at Millhopper Shopping Center in Central Florida that will result in 20 years of extended lease term and significant rent growth. As for future opportunities we are finally seeing some seller, lowering expectation to the point that economics make sense assuming specific channel demand and strong market need. For example in the Seattle market, we have long been aware of a build suit opportunity for a large national retailer. Two years ago we offered to buy the property for 25% of the asking pricing but the seller refused to budge. Today we are very close to finalizing a deal to buy that property at a price close to our original offer. At the same time the areas biggest concern is our large community center developments, chiefly those dependant on residential growth. Retailers remain risk averse when it comes to expanding into green and immature markets resulting in additional leasing delays and compression of yields. The stabilized returns for all 42 developments, many of which will take much longer than three years to achieve the 95% target fell 47 basis point to 7.1%. This decrease was entirely due to three things, first the erosion of budgeted rents in five of the 42 projects with all five being limited to specific region. Second a portfolio wide underwriting change to increase estimated collection losses, which was charged against every development project and third the phasing of one California project. I should mention that we clarified the written description on the in-process developments page of the supplemental was now entitled stabilized returns as previously called NOI yield after partner participation. This calculation methodology was all that changed. While caution apprehension are still appropriate, with the market feedback and recent activity I certainly feel more positive than anything was experienced for a long time. I’m looking forward to 2010 to building on these positives and capitalizing on opportunities to grow NOI, lease up our centers and create value for our shareholders. Our teams are energized and focused, I have full confidence in their abilities and I know that we have all the necessary tools in place to be successful and to reap the full benefits for the economic recovery that’s on the horizon. Hap?
Martin Stein Jr.: As I reflect on Regency’s 2009 results, while they were clearly not up to our standards, I feel really good about the crucial steps we made to position Regency for the future. We strengthened our balance sheet by raising over a billion dollars of capital through a combination of common stock, mortgage financing, property sales and contributions to co-investment partnerships. As a result, at the end of 2009 we have approximately $100 million in cash, over $700 million of untapped lines of credit and $235 million of additional equity capital that would be funded during the year. To facilitate the purchase of Macquarie CountryWide’s interest largest co-investment partnership gaining a new partner in GRR and eliminating the refinance risk associated with maturing (inaudible) debt in our portfolio. This also enabled us to negotiate and exercise an option purchase through remainder of MCWs interest, an investment and irreplaceable assets that we know well at extremely favorable pricing. We established a new co-investor partnership with USAA. These two partnerships further expanded and solidified Regency’s access to reliable sources of capital and the company’s profitable operating platform. Since the fourth quarter of 2008, we’ve reduced the size of our workforce by more than 30% resulting in over $20 million in G&A savings before capitalization and other offsets. And as Brian mentioned in one of the toughest leasing environments 4 million square feet of new leases and almost 4 million square feet renewals. Looking forward, we will undertake a plan comprised of five strategies, to sustain long-term growth in recurring earnings in NAB of 5% or more and generate total shareholder return in excess of 10% and above our shopping center peers, while securing Regency’s position at the forefront of the industry. Our central goal is to obtain an occupancy level of 95% in both operating and development portfolios. While we acknowledge that this will take several years to achieve, doing so should generate additional NOI in the neighborhood of $35 million to $40 million of which approximately 25% is from leases that are already signed, $40 million capped at 8% will result in additional shareholder value of roughly $5.50 per share. We'll utilize our capital recycling program, selling properties and I might note that we sold over a billion dollars of properties during the last five years and deploy that capital into better quality acquisitions in developments and target markets with sustainable competitive advantages. We will leverage our core competencies, development, market presence and anchor relationships to create value added opportunities. This may repurchases from distressed owners, re-developments within our existing portfolios, selling or developing the 480 acres of land that we already owned or well conceive new developments. Regardless of the form, new investments will be vigorously underwritten, have strong anchor sponsorship, demonstrated demand for limited side-shops and out-parcels and offer attractive risk adjustive returns and margins. Although, we're comfortable with Regency's sound financial condition, during the next five years, we will cost effectively further strengthen our balance sheet and maintain access to reliable sources of capital. By opportunistically improving our key financial rations, we'll ensure that Regency will be positioned to find profitable new investments and better withstand another market downturn even when it occurs. Growing in a way in a resulting free cash flow, asset sales, co-investment partnerships and patiently executing in a way that is consistent with building intrinsic value will remain essential elements at Regency's capital market strategy. Finally, we will ensure that the Regency team that I believe is (inaudible) is energized and focused on our strategic goals. It is encouraging to see some real signs of improvements in the economy and I'm hopeful that this momentum will continue. At the same time I recognize the tremendous challenge we will face. With national unemployment and the store we have levels, there is a long fragile and gradual journey ahead before we can obtain the results that we achieved at a peak. I am confident that the challenges we faced in 2009 had made us stronger and we’ve learnt from those challenges. We have fortified our foundation and are executing our strategy to elaborately grow recurring earnings, net asset value and total shareholder return, so that Regency will cement our position in the premier shopping center company. We appreciate your time; we will now answer any questions you may have.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from David Wigginton - Macquarie.
David Wigginton: Brian you highlighted the pickup and lease momentum in the quarter, maybe can you talk about in a little more detail like the leases you signed, the types of tenants and for what spaces, is the pickup in the small shop space that you saw or was it more on the larger store front space?
Brian Smith: The leasing we did was about one-third anchors and two-thirds small shops, so it is kind of across the board, all property types, there is just a general pickup in activity. One thing we heard from several people out in the field is as I mentioned in the comment is that retailers have just kind of, all of a sudden there’s more of a sense of urgency, they just want to get deals done, whereas they have been looking in the past. So just lot of activity, you’re hearing about property tours being scheduled for the first time in well over a year, probably 18 months where a retailer may come into a market and want to look at multiple locations. So if you look at the actual numbers for the quarter, whether it was new or renewal, we did about 20% more leasing on a GLA basis than the average of the three quarters prior. So it was pretty wide spread.
David Wigginton: And so I mean the types of tenants are these local tenants, are these regional, national credits, what types of tenants are you seeing the most demand from right now?
Brian Smith: We're seeing it for mall, we’re seeing regional, we’re actually seeing an interesting improvement when it comes to the franchisees, there’s always been the trouble about getting financing and what we’re seeing are two things. First of all the franchisee owners themselves are stepping up to help in many way the franchisees. They’re in some cases offering financing, soft financing; they’re putting free package deals together for them. So that’s helping. The other thing we’re seeing which is kind of an interesting surprise is a result of all the corporate lay offs, you have people who have been with companies a long time, highly paid, getting some parachutes, and these guys are going in and opening up their own businesses, and they don't require any financing. Now for example in the mid-Atlantic region, we had 24 new non-anchor leases signed during the quarter, and none of those required any financing.
David Wigginton: And the second question, it has been pretty widely publicized and Macquarie continues to stick to divest itself of its U.S. holdings, can you maybe talk about your main JVs with Macquarie and your expectations for those JVs in 2010?
Brian Smith: In regard to Macquarie interest in their JVs, I don’t think there are any immediate plan for them to other than selling out of this, their large co-investment partnership. As a matter of fact, the one remaining JV that they have is the (inaudible) portfolio and I might note that our ownership interest in that one is well less than 20%.
David Wigginton: Obviously those are attractive assets, if the opportunity presented itself would Regency be a better on those and take those onto the balance sheet or will you look for another JV partner in that case?
Brian Smith: Yes and when the opportunity present well, we'll figure out what makes the most sense to do, whether bring another partner or to increase our ownership like we did. And the largest partnership where we increased our ownership at a cap rate, well in excess of 9%.
Operator: Your next question comes from Christy McElroy - UBS.
Christy McElroy: Just a follow up to the prior question Brian. Are these retailers that are looking to open stores, are they closing stores as well, are they being more selective about choosing space and how does that translate into the outlook for overall square footage growth.
Brian Smith: There are some, I don’t think it was lot. There is some of that going on where you see at the large chains, they will look at the impact on sister stores and if they've got a weak performing store, they will certainly look to close that maybe open up a better relocated one. But most of these were new stores that didn’t have the cannibalization impact. So I think the impact going - the outlook going forward is, if January is in the indication we see this pick up continuing, we’ve had three straight quarters of increased renewals, increased new leasing and January appears to be very strong.
Christie McElroy: Okay and then Hap you mentioned patience execution. In your strategy of leasing up vacant space, how do you think about the balance between waiting for the right tenant and waiting for the right rent?
Martin Stein Jr.: I think today the focus is on waiting - getting the right tenant in there sooner rather than later and to the extent that we feel like the space is being leased at a rate that is below where we expect rents to be in several years like it was indicated in the past. We are either starting rents at the lower level or signing short-term leases.
Operator: Your next question comes from R.J. Milligan - Raymond James & Associates.
R.J. Milligan: As a follow-up, the leasing trends for the renewals, is the shift from a negative spread to a positive spread a function of just a lower prior rent per square foot or have you guys seen retailers becoming I guess less aggressive and re-negotiate renewals?
Martin Stein Jr.: I think there is a few things going on, one of the, there is definitely increased optimism on the part of the retailers. One of the things that we heard from the field pretty consistently is in the past whenever we giving concessions the retailers, we always got termination rights and we held those concessions to very short terms. The retailers appear to be not willing to enter into those kind of lease modifications now because they don’t want the risk of loosing the store and they are looking more long-term. So the renewals have to do with, little bit of what I talked about on the call in my prepared remarks which are that, they got, they’ve survived this long, which means they’ve got a customer following, they got a loyal base, they don’t want to risk that. And frankly we are seeing a lot of people talking about how other centers, they are not able to get any TIs, the lenders aren't keeping up the centers. So there is not only reluctance not to leave and therefore to renew, but we’re getting a fair share of people wanting to move into our centers because they know we take care of them.
Operator: Your next question comes from Quentin Velleley - Citigroup.
Quentin Velleley: I’m here with Michael. Just in terms of the adjustment to your expectations on the development pipeline, I’m wondering if you can give a few more specifics in relation to a couple of assets, your large development that had more substantial decreases in their expected yield being Golden Hills Promenade and Deer Springs Town Center?
Brian Smith: What I mentioned Quentin, the impact on, starting with the full portfolio 42 we all got hit by 15 basis points on average because of the change to the reserve that we added. The 26 basis points, that was due to just those five projects and two of the fives are the ones you mentioned. In all cases, we are just not seeing a pick up in the deserts, which would include Indio, which include Las Vegas and some of the other larger ones in California. So those five accounted for all of the real erosion in the rent that dragged down the yield. What we did is basically we took their underwriting way down on those properties and in fact one of the things we didn’t talked about on the prepared remarks is that in some markets we are hearing for the first time discussion about free rent. We have not had to give that in any of our markets, any of our projects. We have actually underwritten some of the -- you're taking the rents down and some of these desert projects to allow for like a year's free rent and then very, very low rent. So we've really hit those budgets hard in those projects, and the other thing I would just as a general rule, the delay in leasing we continue to show that what we maybe too conservative. In 2008, we did over millions square feet of leasing in the development portfolio, this year we really did about 300,000 square feet and I think in 2010 we're budgeting just about 100,000 square feet, so that the land leasing is also part of the issue.
Quentin Velleley: And just in terms of the yield now obviously we've sent it (inaudible) down over the last few quarters. We had a point now where you're much more comfortable but its low as it's going to get unless there's some kind of economic shock or something that could cause it to come down again?
Martin Stein Jr.: It's depend on what's going to happen in the future but I think when I say we could pitch late I think that's what we're saying Quentin is that the markets have clearly stabilized the ARs has improved. We've had tenants that we budgeted to move that that have come current on their ARs. So the overall landscape is clearly improving, the ones that where its not improving I think are underwriting what we've done to those budgets is so bad I just - frankly I don't know how they could getting worse.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Mueller - JP Morgan.
Michael Mueller: Brian, I mean your comments on leasing about the activity picking up across the board seem pretty bullish, just wondering if you could tie that to the guidance page where occupancy looks like it's going to be I'm pointing the PDF up now but like 90 to 92 somewhere in that neighborhood and is it - considering the end of the year at 93% as a function of that some of that 93% is not real and there is not real rent paying tenants in there or you expecting a downdraft to come from some place else?
Bruce Johnson: Michael I think it is more related to your comment that we built in some of the non-rent players, the collection lost issues. I think that if things continue to go like they are, we would expect that obviously would be at the upper end of that guidance, occupancy guidance and part of this, that’s a point in time guidance by the way as well, not a average, so one of the issues we are dealing with is what the average is going to be throughout the year and obviously is just leasing going to be on a straight line or is it going to be weighted at the end and so forth.
Martin Stein Jr.: Absolutely right. It is looking good right now, but we’re not - at this point in time we are not comfortable changing the guidance when we did in December, so we are exactly at the same.
Bruce Johnson: Martin we have already had that discussed around here because that very thought occurred to us but I think it’s just until we see a few more months of this, we are going to be leaving it at where it is.
Michael Mueller: Okay but just to clarify is the 93% at 93% lets say you hit the midpoint you are talking about losing occupancy or is it 93% real a number that’s lower because you have tenancy you think are non-rent paying in there?
Martin Stein Jr.: We have both tenants that are non-rent paying that we expect to be evicted, but you also have in that number, you have a little over 50 basis points of tenants that have signed leases but haven’t moved in yet.
Michael Mueller: Second question, just kind of looking at the U.S.A. joint venture, is that something that you see expanding more of one shot deal, I guess more generically putting aside the Macquarie transaction, if you are looking at new investment activity, is it going to be pretty much geared towards being on balance sheet as opposed to end funds do you think?
Martin Stein Jr.: I think based upon the guidance that we've given specifically, and then in general I'd say we expect to be a combination of own balance sheet and the partnerships and I think it just kind of depends on what makes sensitive from a balance sheet standpoint.
Operator: Your next question comes from Nathan Isbee - Stifel Nicolaus.
Nathan Isbee: Just looking at your renewal statistics from 2009, it went up about 1.1%, the rents you signed were on average about 19 bucks, how would that break up between small shop and large shop? I'm just looking ahead to 2010 and your small shop rents are expiring at about 20 to 23, and just trying to get a sense of why? I understand what you're saying that they like the space, they’re feeling good but it is on average probably more expensive than most of the neighboring centers?
Martin Stein Jr.: Let us get back and touch with you Nath.
Bruce Johnson: We have done as breakdown rate (inaudible) can easily get to it.
Operator: Your next question comes from Nick Vedder - Green Street Advisors.
Nick Vedder: You mentioned a lot about the leasing environment starting to pick up and I was just curious in terms of your post end performance, have you seen any change in the phase of shop, today's fallout?
Martin Stein Jr.: You're talking about the move out mix?
Nick Vedder: Yeah. I'm talking about move out post year end.
Martin Stein Jr.: I would say that the move outs, they are higher than they were in January of 2008 and they are higher than the average for all of 2009 but they're also about 50% less than what our plan, our internal plan. So we are actually encouraged by and as I said there were lot of tenants that we had budget to move out that had AR issues and making current on their ARs and renew it. So we expected after the fourth quarter that there will be fall out, it just nothing anywhere near as there, as what we thought will be.
Bruce Johnson: Just to add a little color on that, I think at the end of the Nick, what we are going to be looking at very carefully is what happens in February because that (inaudible) in January.
Nick Vedder: With respect to market rent, you feel that the market rent deterioration is bottomed out or is that ticking down.
Martin Stein Jr.: I think that in most markets, it is bottomed and obviously there is going to reset, lot of the rents that are out there have to resent to the new market but it has bottom. Obviously there is exceptions for that, the projects we talked about, we have some, still some development projects for example up in Indiana where, I don’t think you've seen the bottom and I don’t think we’ve seen it in the deserts. But I think pretty much every where else people will talk about that we feel that we set bottom and that the retailers would tell you that they’ve hit bottom. So there are exceptions at overall, yes.
Bruce Johnson: And I would that as you indicated earlier we believe that we’ve incorporated our projections going forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets.
Rich Moore: Looking at the new lease spreads they were pretty weak this quarter, is that a more a function of the particular pool of boxes that you guys fill this quarter or do you think that that continues that kind -- depth of negative spread continues for the rest of the year?
Brian Smith: That’s always a hard one to answer because it depends on two pretty critical things, what the percent of small shops that we actually sign leases on versus anchors and what markets to do the leasing and one of the things we talked about last quarter is how San Francisco, the Bay Area is one of our best markets, we are getting much, much higher rents from national anchors there. But considering where they were, there is still big roll-downs and they moved the kneel just because of their size. So, again I can point to January and January looks like across the board it’s flat. But I think going forward you got to say that things are improving and the anchors I think we see that there is a lot of opportunity to see some positive rent growth on the small shops. I think overall we see that there is still probably negative 5%, negative 10% in most cases. So, you put it off together and you get to our guidance, which is slightly negative, I think we got minus 2% to minus 8%.
Rich Moore: Is that measured on the last rent that was paid in the space versus the new initial rent in the space?
Brian Smith: Yes, correct.
Rich Moore: On the acquisition front, I mean where are you guys exactly I mean I heard you talk about the possibilities that are out there, but I mean are you looking at anything actively, I mean are we close to doing acquisitions or is that still further down in the future thing?
Brian Smith: We are definitely actively looking. We do have a project that’s under contract that we would expect to close this quarter hopefully, we’re looking at lot of things, I just don’t think anything has changed from the last several quarters which is first of all very little as trading of the quality that we want. And I think in this environment and going forward this can be a much -- we do not want to be playing in the C markets for sure and the pricing is very aggressive I think the pricing, some of the recent trade to the properties that have gone. So we are trying.
Operator: Your next question comes from Sarah Lewis - Credit Suisse.
Sarah Lewis: I was wondering if you could elaborate a bit more in the incremental 30 to $40 million to the NOI you were talking about from meeting the 95% occupancy level. I was wondering specifically if can you breakout what portion will come from stabilizing the pipeline versus leasing up current space. And also maybe if you can elaborate more on the timing of this occurring, are we talking of 2011, 12 event or we’re talking somewhere further down the line in the map, thanks?
Brian Smith: I think we’ll start break up realizing that in 2010 some of that in 2010 but the majority of it is going to occur probably beyond 2011. So it’s going to be a slow process during the next three to four years that will occur over but we’ll start seeing some of benefits now. Of that number about 25% comes from spaces that we’ve already leased. Secondly of the reminder about two thirds of that is from the operating portfolio and the third is from (inaudible).
Operator: Your next question comes from Craig Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Craig Schmidt: I noticed that you maintain your 210 NOI same store guidance of minus one to minus four percent and that's pretty considerable improvement on your fourth quarter number. Is it easier comps or something else that's giving you the confidence to make those numbers move in that positive direction?
Brian Smith: It's a combination of two things number one, it is the net operating income that we're comparing against first of all and then second of all we're seeing, it doesn't appear like we're bottoming and even though as we've indicated, we're not ready to clear victory, the trends we feel pretty good about.
Craig Schmidt: Do you see that is gradually progressing to stronger numbers or is it - you must have see it in the first and second quarter as well?
Brian Smith: I think, if you look at the economy our view of the economy is -- hopefully this is correct because I think that we're involved in a gradual and gradual recovery. And I would say that's going to -- we're going to see that impact on our operating fundamentals.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs.
Jay Habermann: Hap if think about the capital recycling plan and the potential for disposition, can you give us some sense of the difference cap rates between where you think you'd be able to sell assets versus where you look to buy some of the better quality properties and I guess just to quantify the dollar amount you're thinking over the next couple of years?
Martin Stein Jr.: I think that better quality properties right now are trading in the 8% range maybe below that, but for the best properties and after we recently sold a property and that property we considered to be a little faulty property that we sold at a cap rate of just below 9% on an end place income and our budgeted income was below 8%. So, to the extent that we can find buyers like that it will buy, the amount of properties will take advantage of that.
Jay Habermann: And do you anticipate the pace of dispositions increasing in 2011 beyond what your guidance for the current year?
Martin Stein Jr.: 2011 yes I think we would anticipate some pickup in dispositions in 2011.
Jay Habermann: Okay and I guess just looking at the debt and preferred to assets at 52%, is that metric roughly where you want it to be or what do you think that will trend after the sequence of disposition?
Martin Stein Jr.: Well number one let me say that when you - a couple of things to keep in mind the way we look at it. Number one, we got the cash of our balance sheets on any debt. The way we look at debt, we are going to look at on a net basis as far as the cash that is coming in and the forward equity sale and the cash that is currently on the balance sheet and secondly, given in our view the importance of maturity risks has been elevated during the last 12 to 24 months, we look at preferred equity as equity. So from that standpoint, we anticipate being in the lower to mid 40s by the end of the year, just in effect executing the modest plan that is already in place and secondly as I think as we indicated in over the next 3 to 5 years, we like to get that debt back to debt asset ratio down to below 40%. We are comfortable with where we are, but to the extent that the opportunities present themselves to reduce that level, we'll act on that appropriately.
Jay Habermann: Can you characterize the institutional interest? I guess your core partners for the higher quality real estate today at those 7.5% and 8% cap rates, is there interest there?
Martin Stein Jr.: Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Bilerman - Citigroup.
Michael Bilerman: Bruce, maybe if you can just clarify listening on the in-process developments and we’re thinking about the potential income and FFO growth going forward. Right now you’re not capping a lot of interest, your capitalized interest is very low, but you have this big ramp on the development side from a competition yield than the eventuality of the stabilized deal, so more of it should drop to the bottom line. When I look at the numbers you disclose in your supplemental on page 40 on the guidance page about $9.7 million of income from CIP, which is under $40 million NOI annualized. And then if we look at the development page your completion yield was about 5.3% that would translate to probably $42 million or $43 million. So is it fair to say that you're effectively earning the completion yield today? Or is the income picking up some of the stabilized developments that are listed page 17, the $425 million? I just wanted to triangulate between them.
Bruce Johnson: I think I understand the question I'm going to ask Lisa to correct me, but I think the answer to your question is related specifically to your thought of the answer being it's properties of ours being moving to the stabilized area.
Michael Bilerman: So right now this $40 million of income that’s being earned that you list on CIP is both a billion dollars of assets that are in the process and the $420 million that is listed on the stabilized development schedule.
Lisa Palmer: We provide NOI from CIP properties and the supplemental for the fourth quarter only and that is about $9.7 million. The term fee that we talked about, that we received in the fourth quarter actually came from an in-process development. So that’s inflated by - I mean if you will from a run rate standpoint by a little over $2 million. So you would have bring the run rate down just to closer to $7.5 million or $7.4 million. Is that what you were trying to get?
Michael Bilerman: So that’s $30 million, that’s helpful, it seems too narrow of a gap and so the $30 million and that $30 million of income.
Lisa Palmer: I'm sorry, before you keep asking, let me also, and this is still up on our website. In December at our investor day presentation we actually gave development NOI guidance. Ad that would remain unchanged because we haven’t changed our guidance and that was we expected NOI from our developments that are in process as of today to the $32.1 million to $34.1 million for the year 2010.
Michael Bilerman: And that relates to the billion 07, for this on page 16.
Martin Stein: That is correct.
Michael Bilerman: And then the eventualities that you'll get to a 5.2% yield from a 3% yield today and then at some point down the road when they stabilize it will get to a 7% yield.
Lisa Palmer: Correct.
Martin Stein Jr.: That’s right.
Michael Bilerman: And affectively, you are not capitalizing interest on the majority of the platform and so that you should get all of this effectively drops to the bottom line.
Lisa Palmer: Correct and also one thing and I apologize as we said we are going to add it to space supportive in the supplementals, we talked about that also investor day. The capitalized interest on the properties that will flow into our development completions in 2010 for the year is less than a million dollar. So we are, I mean because these properties have been in process for quite some time, we stop capitalizing interest on most of them.
Michael Bilerman: So, I think you are probably earning the most NOI the ones that are part of stabilization?
Lisa Palmer: Correct.
Michael Bilerman: Just to clarify, just to bring it all together, the difference between the completion and the stabilized yield. Are you effectively marketing, you are accepting leases today, is the difference just an occupancy pick up or you are saying, the rent I am signing today are really not what I wanted, and so the stabilized yield I am hoping that in five years time when the lease rolls, I’ll be able to get a higher rent or is it just purely an occupancy pick up going from completion yield to stabilized yield?
Lisa Palmer: We actually added two foot notes and this change that Brian mentioned in prepared remarks the actual labels or names of this column and then we have foot notes that describe it and folks have finally making this much more clear for everybody. But, so to answer your question, it’s just an occupancy pick-up. Stabilized yield is simply when a project has 90% of the cost funded and it’s 95% leased. And then the development comes to completion yield is the earlier to occur of three years from the last anchor opening or four years from start site work.
Brian Smith: But most of the pick up is from occupancy.
Michael Bilerman: At some point down the road?
Lisa Palmer: Yes.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Chris Summers - Green Light Capital.
Chris Summers: Just following up on that last question; it looks like a lot of the properties in process come on line in late 2011 and 2012. So the cost to complete the rest of these properties to bring that NOI on, it looks like it’s a $100 million. So even though lot of these are 18 to 36 months off, they’re already 90% complete and funded. Is that right?
Martin Stein Jr.: Right.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ryan Levinson - PSM.
Ryan Levinson: Five weeks into 2010, I’m just wondering how much of the expiring lease space for 2010 has been negotiated?
Martin Stein Jr.: Well, we don't really look at that way. I would say that again we’re planning on doing -- if we do 4 million square feet for the whole year, for January we’ve done close to 500,000, shy off 500,000, but that’s pretty good amount.
Bruce Johnson: Ryan, we do pre-leasing, which is really kind of your question. The metric that you are referring to is a metric that’s more frequently used in the mall business, and we would not as an example have all of our leasing done for the rest of this year on our renewals, that would not be how we do that.
Martin Stein Jr.: But I just re-indicated January we’re head off projections, but that’s still real early in the year.
Ryan Levinson: Okay, I mean that’s what I’m kind of looking for is a little bit of color surrounding the guidance for rental rate contraction and how much of the expiring space throughout the rest of this year have you been in discussions on already? I mean obviously something that's coming up in November talking about now, but something that's coming up in June, you're not going to sign for a while but you might be talking about now.
Martin Stein Jr.: But we're talking about those that are coming up in November, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks and limited just a box but it's true all the way around. For anything that's renewing in 2010. And frankly anything that maybe renewing in early 2011 we already - we're in discussions with all those people. The activity is strong; we would expect renewals to remain strong also for the reasons I gave early in the call but beyond that I don’t know, Bruce if you want to add anything to it.
Bruce Johnson: I think well, all indications are - I mean the indications are that there's a positive trend going on both in the terms of the amount of leasing we're doing, the renewal percentage is higher and in addition it appears that our rental rate growth is also on a positive track but early in the year for us to make a call for the rest of the year as we indicated in the early comments.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ian Wiseman - ISI Group.
Ian Wiseman: We certainly heard your comments about improvement in retail fundamentals and demand certainly picking up but over the last 12 or 18 months I guess for you guys and lot of your peers the bigger issue has been the small shop local tenants. And I was wondering if you could just give a little bit of granularity on just how well they're doing today, are they're still facing credit issues, and are they sort of the drag on fundamentals in '10?
Martin Stein Jr.: Yes, like I mentioned little bit earlier, it's not just our perception that things are improving, the feedback that they're getting is that everybody was nervous, everybody was nervous about Christmas is that the retailers in our portfolio feel that Christmas was better than expected. They feel they hit bottom. The strongest survived. We moved out a lot of the VKR our tenants. Those that remained with us were the ones who learned to operate in an environment with reduced top line sales. Everybody has become more efficient in the way they run their business, the overhead. The larger retailers are reducing their footprints in a lot of places. So that’s all good. I mentioned the concession requests are also way down as our ARs and the financing does remain an issue, but the retailers we have been leasing to haven’t required it as much. I gave the example in the mid Atlantic, you have also got the franchises are helping out their franchises. But it would certainly help if financing became more available. I think one of the things we worry about I mean move outside is those retailers who have been great tenants who are standup people, they are paying, they are going to the end of the term, but at the end of that there may not be any financing for them to continue. So that is probably the biggest issues out there.
Ian Wiseman: I guess my question is if you were to separate the improvements with well capitalized national tenants versus local tenants, is there - have they sort of improved in tandem or is there still - is there now a widening spread between local tenants versus nationals?
Bruce Johnson: Just some color here. Just take the restaurant segment which is the largest portion of our smaller tenants that really - we have had a higher proportional move out south, those were definitely corrective issues, but what's interesting to note is we are replacing those tenants with restaurants perhaps frequently. And we’re upgrading the credit when we do that. They maybe franchises, they maybe corporate stores or whatever, but that’s really what’s going on. So, we are upgrading, just because those are the ones that are willing to go forward and do business in this environment.
Operator: Your next question comes from Chris Summers - Green Light Capital.
Chris Summers: Hey guys looking at the fourth quarter, it looks like your recovery percentage was just under 70% if I did the math right here and then your guidance is kind of, for 2010 is that recovery similar to ’09, because 4Q09 kind of an anomaly recoveries and you think they’ll go back to kind of a normal level or what’s there?
Lisa Palmer: I think Chris you are probably, it’s not that much different and it’s been a sturdy year of developing and development if you take our operating portfolio only. The recovery rate in the fourth quarter excluding development was over 75% because of the -- real estate taxes are build in the fourth quarter. So, we obviously recover those from our operating properties, but we are not recovering those from as much from our development. So, that’s why it would fall more in the fourth quarter overall.
Chris Summers: Like year-over-year, the fourth quarter this year versus fourth last year it’s down like 10% and historically the fourth quarter recovery rates been much higher than -- than it was this quarter. Was the development dynamic unique this fourth quarter?
Lisa Palmer: It’s certainly more pronounced in 2009, than it was in 2008.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And it appears there are no further questions. At this time, I would like to turn it back over to Hap Stein for any additional or closing remarks.
Martin Stein Jr.: We thank you for your interest and participation in this call and interest in the company and we wish that you have a great day, thank you.
Operator: That concludes today’s conference thank you for your participation.

Presentation: 
Operator: Good afternoon. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Regency Centers Corporation third quarter 2009 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Lisa Palmer, Senior Vice President Capital Markets. 
Lisa Palmer: Good afternoon. On the call this afternoon are Martin Stein, Chairman and CEO; Mary Lou Fiala, Vice Chairman and COO; Bruce Johnson, CFO; Brian Smith, President and Chief Investment Officer; Chris Leavitt, Senior Vice President and Treasurer; and Jamie Shelton, Vice President of Real Estate Accounting. Before we start, I first want to be sure that everybody on the phone know that even though I have a dog named [Jeeter], I am a true blue or red Phillies fan. Seriously, before we start, I'd like to address forward-looking statements that maybe addressed on the call. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes, and results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements.  Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC. Specifically, the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. 
Bruce Johnson : Thank you Lisa, recurring FFO per share for the third quarter was $0.70 which was within the guidance that we provided last quarter. We’ve begun reporting recurring FFO to provide more clarity and to aid in future projections.  Obviously our attempt at clarity created some confusion. However hopefully this additional disclosure will prove helpful in the future. During the quarter Regency recognized an impairment charge of $103 million related to land and operating properties held for sale.  After these impairment charges and other non-recurring items FFO per share for the third quarter was negative $0.58 per share. I would like to comment on the company’s impairment policy. In accordance with GAAP assets held for long-term investment are carried at depreciated costs unless a triggering event or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  Such events include but are not limited to, decisions to sell properties, the probability of future development or sale of land held, as well as material changes to leasing assumptions in our in-process portfolio.  Of the 11 land investments that we impaired this past quarter the most significant occurred on the Murrieta Marketplace and Petaluma projects. Last quarter we postponed the construction of Murrieta Marketplace when Target announced that although it had closed on the purchase of its pad and we had commenced site work, this location was under review.  In the last 30 days Target notified us that they are postponing this location until 2014 putting Lowe’s lease at risk of cancellation and delaying the time and the future cash flows. The result was a $36 million impairment.  During the third quarter the uncertainty of entitlements and Target’s approval altered the probability and timing of development at Petaluma resulting in a $27 million impairment. After the write-down Regency’s new basis in the 504 acres is $123 million or an average of $5.60 per square foot. Earlier this week Regency finalized the formation of a new co-investment partnership with USAA and simultaneously sold seven Regency shopping centers to the partnership with an eight center that will close within 30 days.  The net proceeds to Regency will be $104 million. Regency’s ownership in the USAA partnership will be 20% and the company will maintain property and asset management responsibilities. Prior to closing the USAA partnership locked rein on a seven-year interest only mortgage at 6.8%.  The transaction was sized to balance the dilutive impact of the dispositions while creating a partnership with enough critical mass to enable Regency to have an additional reliable source of external capital to fund potential opportunities.  Let me give you our view on the status of our receivables and reserves, we are comfortable with our policy and the adequacy of reserves. The reserves have been increased by more than $2.2 million and more then cover 100% of all accounts receivable greater then 60 days.  Fourth quarter FFO per share is expected to be in the range of $0.63 to $0.68. This includes nearly $5 million of severance charges not previously included in full year guidance. Recurring FFO per share for the quarter is expected to be $0.54 to $0.59.  For the full year of 2009 recurring FFO per share is projected to be in the range of $2.63 to $2.68. Because we did not provide recurring FFO guidance last quarter we placed a reconciliation on our website for your review.  Looking forward to 2010 based on preliminary projections and operating environment that remains uncertain while we expect to experience a more modest decline in same property NOI as we feel the full year impacts of lower occupancy and pressures on rents it will be nearly offset by increases in non same store NOI. We will continue to incur a higher interest expense and G&A as the result of lower capitalization combined with the dilutive impact from the April equity offering. 
Mary Lou Fiala : Thank you Bruce, we’re nearing the closing of one of the most challenging years for retailers in memory. The recession of 2009 shocked the consumer and the retailer into a state of paralysis and self preservation.  Retailers closed stores, reduced inventories, and cut staff, while consumers stopped spending and increased savings. And although results may hover along the bottom for a while there are signs of recovery on the horizon.  Consumer confidence has risen from its floor, retailers are emerging as smaller, healthier companies that are better equipped for the current economic environment. And a number of Regency’s [PCI] tenants are continuing to expand and some are planning to open more then 50 and in some cases more then 100 stores next year, including Panera Bread, Great Clips, Chick-fil-A, Panda Express, Massage Envy, TJX, and Petco.  And even Subway which is in kind of a league of its own right now looks like they’re going to open 1,200 locations next year. And grocers, specifically Kroger and Publix are continuing to expand at a healthy clip.  On the flip side, small shop mom and pops are still having difficulty obtaining financing and many are struggling to survive. Although allocating some of the TARP money to local business banks if it occurs should help.  The stronger operators are surviving and we’re capitalizing on the opportunity to relocate these retailers into our centers by mapping out our needs and increasing our marketing efforts to attract the best local retailers.  So we joined the National Franchise Association and we’re using media outlets like Twitter to communicate to our retailers and we’re cold calling the top local tenants especially in weaker competitive centers.  These operators recognize the benefits of being in centers with stronger anchors. Over 80% of our centers are anchored by market-leading grocers producing annual sales of $25 million or $490 per square foot. And so far this strategy has proven successful.  For example, Bikeline, a regional bike store with 14 locations in the Philadelphia area upgraded to our Gateway Shopping Center anchored by a Trader Joe’s and expanded their space to 3,200 square feet. And another local operator located a 3,500 square foot business to the Shoppes at Fairhope Village have recently completed development anchored by Publix from an unanchored center just a few miles north.  And in summary I’m encouraged by some of the positive signs that we’re beginning to see especially the signing of 1.4 million square feet of new leases and renewals in the third quarter. The change in activity beginning in June, since June is rather dramatic and since then we’ve averaged 46 new leases per month which is comparable to last year and represents an increase of nearly 60% from the level earlier this year. 
Brian Smith : Thank you Mary Lou, our operating portfolio was 93.2% leased at the end of the third quarter, up 20 basis points from the second quarter. This was mainly due to the disposition of Kingsdale, a property that was 43% leased.  The sale of this asset increased the percentage of lease space by 50 basis points and offset the net decrease in occupancy. We continue to experience pressure on rents particularly in Virginia, California, and Florida.  It does feel like in most markets rents are at or approaching the bottom. When we compare today’s rents with rents on the leases that expire during the next few years, it appears there is minimal if any, downside in the overall portfolio.  I do want to point out that we are managing our rental rate declines such that the most significant negative spreads are found in the 160 leases signed year to date with terms of 12 months or less. Keeping the lease terms short allows us to work with good tenants in difficult times without locking us into long-term rents based on current economic flows which is the right way to run the business.  Conversely longer term leases, those with terms greater then three years are being signed with the stronger retailers. These longer term leases represent 60% of all the leasing activity year to date and the rent spreads associated with these leases are essentially flat.  Simply stated, we are keep our big rent declines to very short-term leases. As Mary Lou mentioned the pick up in leasing activity needs to be highlighted. In fact for the operating portfolio the third quarter was the best quarter of leasing that we’ve enjoyed since the first quarter of 2008.  We leased or renewed 1.4 million square feet of space in the third quarter and 3.8 million square feet of space year to date. Similar to last quarter, the majority of these deals are small shops averaging 3,400 square feet.  By category, food and restaurants make up the majority of these new leases. I also want to mention the continued success of our PCI program. The renewal rate of our PCI tenants is 88% compared to 69% for non-PCI and we’re actually seeing positive rent growth from the PCI tenants.  As we move out troubled tenants, we are backfilling those spaces with strong operators who have survived and even thrived in spite of the economy. For example a mattress store on a pad recently requested rent relief but we had little confidence in the tenant’s outlook.  We refused that request, moved out the tenant, and replaced it with Sonic, a big upgrade in quality. Furthermore as Mary Lou stated we continue to receive interest from tenants currently located in inferior competitive locations looking to upgrade to a center with thriving anchor sales.  I’d like to turn now to an important step we are taking to right size the organization and enable the company to more effectively achieve its key objectives. We are reorganizing by moving from a functional structure with separate operations and investment groups, to one that is more regionally focused and market oriented.  The managing directors Jim Thompson, John Delatour, and Mac Chandler are responsible for all aspects of the business. Each is extremely experienced in all aspects of real estate operations. Reporting to these managing directors will be market officers who will have hands on responsibility for the asset management and leasing functions.  This move creates the structure and the incentives for our very best and most experienced people to work more closely in partnership, utilizing their combined talent, judgment, experience, and relationships to meet the needs of the operating and in-process portfolios.  We believe there are many other benefits to this structure. More experienced professionals will be involved in less management and more direct negotiations as a result of a flatter organization. We will operate in the field as one team, bringing together the best talent within the operations and investment groups.  The people with development expertise will no longer focus exclusively on external developments but will look within our own portfolio for opportunities to grow same store NOI. It creates a leaner and meaner organization without taking away needed muscle in the critical parts of the business especially leasing.  It allows us to right size our development teams while retaining a core competency that will be vital to responding to the myriad opportunities likely to present themselves whether they be internal or external value add candidates.  The move to our greater efficiency without compromising effectiveness translates into long-term cost savings as we significantly cut back on staffing retaining only the best talent. Upon completion of this reorganization, we will have reduced the size of the organization by approximately 30% with the development group having been reduced by more then 75%.  The overall reduction in staffing is already translated to a $43 million cost savings in direct salaries and benefits over the two year period beginning 2008. As a result of lower capitalization and severance charges however net G&A in 2009 is expected to be $4.5 to $5 million higher then in 2008. As you are aware delayed anchor openings slow progress on leasing, lower rents, and prices on out parcel sales have significantly impacted development returns and values. At the same time we made some notable achievements in the in-process portfolio during the third quarter.  The grocers in our newly opened projects are doing extremely well. The sales at Whole Foods in Santa Barbara have been so high that they have asked us not to proceed on a planned out parcel building and instead allow them to lease the ground related to this building for much needed additional parking.  The Publix at Shoppes at Fairhope had the second strongest store opening in company history. Similar success stories were reported by [inaudible] and by [King Super]. We began construction on Seminole Shoppes, a relocation of an existing Publix store that is generating sales of over $920 per square foot in a [dense and fill] market with average annual household incomes of over $80,000.  Construction bids came in 25% below budget and rents appear stronger then anticipated suggesting that we could potentially outperform projected returns. This will be a typical prototype of our ground up development in the future.  Strong grocery anchor with limited shop space in dense markets with strong demographics. In closing while its been a quarter of mixed results and continuing challenges, I am excited about the future particularly the reorganization which should allow us to better respond to the demands of the industry. 
Martin Stein : Thank you Brian, 12 months ago we all knew that given the capital market’s crisis and the deteriorating economy we were in for an extremely arduous journey. Today a year into that journey it has become evident that the economy has fallen farther and the related adverse impacts on the fundamentals of the shopping center business have been more severe then we anticipated.  In spite of the unfavorable conditions Regency has achieved several noteworthy accomplishments. The strength in our balance sheet and its obvious that the capital markets have thawed, one of the pleasant surprises and several linings more then been anticipated, by successfully tapping the institutional investor, common equity, sale and mortgage markets to raise nearly $640 million of capital.  We are projecting that we will have over $250 million of cash and not a penny outstanding on our line of credit at the end of 2009. CalPERS purchase of a 65% interest in our co-investment partnership eliminated the refinance risk associated with the maturing CMBS debt in that portfolio. \ Furthermore an option to increase our ownership in that portfolio is one of the best opportunities that I’ve seen in my career. As Bruce said the average basis on approximately 500 acres of land held for development is now $5.60 per square foot and most of the parcels have real anchor interest, are entitled, and offer good prospects for development in the future.  And as Mary Lou and Brian have said in one of the toughest leasing environments in memory we signed nearly 1.1 million square feet of new leases and 2.7 million square of renewals. Finally I believe that there will be substantial benefits from the new organizational plan beyond the significant savings in gross G&A cost. The new organizational structure will enable the team to more effectively and efficiently achieve our strategic goals and operational objectives, increase accountability and allow for more personal management of our portfolio.  While there are many indications that the economy has either hit or is close to the bottom, I and the management team have no allusions that due to lower levels of consumer spending and a likelihood of future job losses, when we do start to experience a recovery and we will, it will most likely be a fragile, fragile, and gradual one in which we are going to be operating in for several years.  Not unmindful of the obvious challenges that we are facing, I am confident that during the next several years Regency will successfully execute the following key strategies. First and foremost we will preserve and grow net operating income by increasing rent paying occupancy in our operating and development portfolios minimizing any further rent roll downs and there’s a huge amount of imbedded growth to be harvested from increasing occupancy to 95%.  While we have $250 million of cash on hand, no outstanding balance on the line, a strong balance sheet, manageable debt maturities, and access to external sources of capital, we would like to further enhance the key ratios when it makes sense to do so.  The bank lines will continue to be managed as a short-term source of capital. We will utilize our market presence and lender relationship to take advantage of investment opportunities when they arise at attractive pricings that are accretive to earnings and to NAV.  In that regard as soon as we have completed the review of the final 2010 budgets and we’re comfortable with the expected future performance of the portfolio we will exercise our option to purchase MCW’s interest.  In spite of recent setbacks in our development program, development remains an important differentiating core competency that will enable Regency to create future value albeit on a more selective and modest scale and with more focus on [end fill], internal redevelopments, and distressed opportunities.  Most important of all we will preserve our special culture and engage and motivate our newly organized team which in my view is second to none in the industry. In closing the reset button has been pushed and values, rents, and NOI have returned to where they were several years ago.  The management team and I are undaunted by the challenge of building on what will hopefully be the bottoming of the economy next year. I sincerely believe that Regency has all the critical ingredients to begin to grow earnings and intrinsic value again taking Regency back to a high performance level.  Before the call is turned over for Q&A, I want to vary from the script a bit. As everyone knows Mary Lou will be retiring as Regency’s COO at the end of the year and this will be her last participation on Regency’s investor calls.  So Mary Lou on behalf of Regency’s customers, shareholders and 400 employees, I would like to take a moment to express our sincere gratitude and appreciation for the fabulous contribution you have made to Regency’s success. You are the shopping center industry’s leading expert on the retail business. As evidenced by Regency’s PCI program you’re an innovator. You’re and intensely focused, [inaudible] leader. People manager extraordinaire. Mentor to many. Wonderful Chief Operating Officer. Value added partner. Inspiration to all who know you. And how you’ve balanced a successful career with your love and devotion to family and you’re a special friend.  The last 10 years you’ve [blessed] Regency in your role as a top executive and we now look forward to continuing to receive your insights as one of Regency’s Directors and especially through our ongoing friendship. We thank you. 
Mary Lou Fiala : Thank you Martin, I’d like to take a moment to thank all of you for the last 10 years, over 10 years that we’ve had. I can’t tell you how great I feel about leaving this team and the operating portfolios in the hands of Brian Smith.  And I continue to have overwhelming confidence in Martin’s strong leadership and vision for the future direction of our company. Bruce has been a valuable partner to me and I know that he’ll continue to be with Brian as well. And Martin, Brian, and Bruce have been not only wonderful colleagues, but dear friends over the year.  I believe that Lisa Palmer’s capital markets expertise is the strongest in the industry and her experience and leadership skills make her a valuable mentor and role model to both men and women in our company as well as the industry.  And the entire team has just done a wonderful job to help all of us. The operations groups has been tested this year and the challenges have made them stronger and better equipped to manage our portfolio. And I can tell you I am generally excited about the company’s new organization, allowing for increased focus and attention to our portfolio, more accountability and more importantly, utilizing our development expertise to redevelop and revitalize our older centers.  This is an untapped resource for us that’s already proven to have great value. And I’m also looking forward to my new role on the Board that I’ll be able to maintain the relationships that have been built over the years and continue to be a useful resource for Martin, Brian, and Bruce and the entire team.  I want to thank you for the faith you’ve had in Regency, the partnerships that we formed, and I’m confident that the changes that Brian outlined today will produce future earnings growth. Bruce I think you have a few things that you want to add. Thank you all. 
Bruce Johnson : Thank you Mary Lou, I’d like to make a correction with respect to some of my comments regarding recurring FFO. Unfortunately I misstated the numbers. So for recurring FFO per share for the fourth quarter is expected to be $0.53 to $0.58, and for the full year of 2009, recurring FFO per share is projected to be in the range of $2.59 to $2.64.  These ranges tie to the guidance in our supplemental. At this time we’ll entertain questions. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Christie McElroy – UBS
Christie McElroy – UBS: Just following up on that comment about your recurring FFO guidance, you’ve got it going from $0.69 in Q3 to let’s call it $0.56 at the mid point in Q4. I know $0.06 of that are the severance charges, but can you just help me reconcile that difference as it relates to which transaction profits you’re considering recurring versus non-recurring and is some of that downside in core given that your occupancy guidance suggests that you see a potential for declines in the quarter. 
Bruce Johnson :  First of all, no transaction profits would be in recurring, or severance charges. 
Christie McElroy – UBS: No transaction profits at all. 
Bruce Johnson : Or severance charges. 
Christie McElroy – UBS: Okay so how, its going from $0.69 down to call it $0.56, can you just reconcile that difference.
Bruce Johnson : Just roughly I think NOI is going to be about $6 million, $3.5 million of that relates to one-time related to our insurance cap that we recognized in the third quarter. And then you’ve got primarily term fees that we’re getting that amount to almost another $2 million, from term fees in the development as well as the same store portfolio, which accounts for the majority of that $6 million.  Much of its in a seasonality basis and then if you look at the asset management fees and from our JV’s that amounts to another $2 million effectively. 
Christie McElroy – UBS: So none of that is core, kind of your occupancy—
Bruce Johnson : Its all core, it’s the difference between the two in terms of reduced fees that relate to our asset management fee reductions as well as, Chris was there a [promote] in there as well.
Chris Leavitt: No promote. What we had was we’ve experienced a decline in the over portfolio values that are the basis of the asset management fee calculations. In the third quarter there was a recalculation in the asset management fee through a negotiation with Macquarie that it caught up the fee based on the values prior to the GRI acquisition and revaluation of that portfolio.  And that added about $900,000 of asset management fees to the third quarter that don’t reoccur in the fourth quarter. On top of that we have significantly higher leasing commissions that are recurring on a quarter to quarter basis and we’ve reduced those expectedly some commissions by about $700,000 in the fourth quarter.  So that makes up the combined lower fee income that we consider to be recurring fee income for the fourth quarter roughly $1.8 million. 
Bruce Johnson : Recurring basically we had no development profits, no major transaction fees, no severance costs, and no impairments. Those are the major components of-- 
Chris Leavitt: And one thing I’ll add on the NOI comments Bruce made is although we’re lower as it relates to our insurance profits in the fourth quarter we collect those profits routinely in the third quarter of every year and if you look back historically you’ll see the same spike in that line item in the third quarter by about the same amount. 
Christie McElroy – UBS: On the development schedule, I noticed the new disclosure this three year yield, I’m just wondering if you can say what exactly that means and how it compares to the NOI yield that’s your partner participation, because you’ve got at 5.4 versus 7.6.
Lisa Palmer : Actually I think we’re going to try to clarify that a little further, the three year yield is basically its our definition of when we move properties from in process into the operating portfolio. So what, footnoted on that schedule that it is the earlier of three years from the last anchor opening or four years from site work and so what we’re trying to show is that when we do move these properties into our operating portfolio that’s the return we’ll be achieving at that time.  And then the final, the NOI yield after partners participation is when we lease it up. And its just that in the environment with the delayed leasing, typically they would have been the same because we would have been moving it into the operating portfolio when it was 95% leased, but we’re moving it in when they’re slightly lower leased.  I think what we’re going to provide or what we will provide to you to help clarify that further to when that occurs is maybe the date of that three year yield actually occurs. 
Christie McElroy – UBS: That would be really helpful because I’m just looking at Shoppes at Highland Village, its 2.84% is that the current yield.
Lisa Palmer : No that’s the three year yield. So that says that when, I think that date is sometime in 2011 if I remember correctly. So that would be four years from when we started construction we’re going to move that, it may even be as early as 2010, we’ll move it into the operating portfolio and at the time that we do that, that’s the expected return. 
Bruce Johnson : And that reflects as does every other return whether it be at stabilized or on a three year basis our current projected returns and what we’re assuming that even though it hasn’t occurred yet, that and other properties wherever we expect to see rent roll downs we’ve already incorporated those into the returns. 
Chris Leavitt: There’s about $8.3 million of roll downs related to Highland Village alone just in 2010, 2012.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman - Citigroup 
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup : I think you mentioned that for the short-term leasing you were doing in the portfolio that the rental spreads were much weaker, versus just your longer term leases, could you maybe out of the leasing that you did in the period could you breakout what the short-term leasing was and give us some understanding of what the spreads were on that short-term leasing versus your longer term leasing. 
Brian Smith : Yes we broke it down for less then 12 months and year to date that rent growth was about negative 13% and represented about 15% of the deals. From 13 to 36 months it was about negative 7% and that represented about 25% of the deals and as I mentioned from 37 up, it was 60% of the transactions and it was pretty flat. It was about minus 0.6.  And all together those will give you the negative 3.6% rent growth year to date. 
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup : And then I think you made the comment that the next year you saw minimal downside, does that infer that we can expect to see flat growth for next year outside of the new leases. 
Brian Smith : Yes, I wouldn’t say it would be necessary flat, but let me explain what we did. What we did was we took an analysis of all the leases that expiring over the next two, three years and we looked at what those rental rates are, and we did that for both retailers smaller then 10,000 square feet and we did it for those greater then 10,000 square feet.  Then we went back and looked at 2009 leasing to date and figured that’s a reasonable proxy for what market rental rates are. And when we did that we found that on the shop tenants we were actually, the expiring leases would have been slightly above market, not very much at all. So there would be a little bit of room, I think there’s like 3.5% roll down from those.  And then on the anchors when you did it that way, it looked like they were actually significantly below market which would allow for substantial rent growth. Now the problem is the, it was such a small sample set with the anchors what we then did is we went back and we talked to all the people in the field, asked them what they thought the rental rates were for the anchors when those specific leases renewed and it was pretty flat.  So when you put it all together I’d say that our belief and what we were looking for in doing that was, is there significant risk that there’s going to be additional rent roll down and the answer to that is no. So where we see it coming I’d say somewhere from flat to slightly negative. 
Lisa Palmer : I’ll just add that we provide the lease expiration schedule in our supplemental that when you look at the anchor rents and you see that they might be low many of the tenants have options. And so it may seem that there’s some upside, but in many of those cases we will won’t be able to capitalize on that even if market rents are higher then that.
Martin Stein : And the key underlying assumption, and this obviously varies by market, the key underlying assumption here is that rental rates have stabilized, are close to a floor, it kind of feels that way but we’re still in a, with unemployment increasing, there’s obviously some risk on the other side. 
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup : And just to clarify that [13%] down, that was a year to date number I think, what was it for the third quarter. 
Lisa Palmer : I believe it was negative 7.4%. 
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup : This is for the short-term stuff. So I’m just wondering whether it got worse in the third quarter or whether you were doing more of it in the third quarter versus the earlier part of the year. 
Brian Smith : We don’t have that. When we started taking a look at that, its not as dramatic as year to date. We rather wanted to focus on the longer term data if you will then just the short quarter. 
Martin Stein : So you got a better representation. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Isbee - Stifel Nicolaus 
Nathan Isbee - Stifel Nicolaus : First of all Mary Lou I wanted to wish you the best, last quarter and I can appreciate that you’re talking about leasing velocity picking up, but last quarter you talked about the small shop tenants who just stopped paying rent. Could you just talk a little bit more about that. Has that continued. 
Bruce Johnson : I think really things haven’t changed a lot. I think it is the same, what’s interesting, Brian indicated I think that the restaurants we were doing more deals with the restaurants but we’re losing, more move outs with restaurants then any other category as well.  So its still the same kind of environment that they’re having and tenants if they don’t, they just finally give up at the end of the day. So I’m not sure that’s changed a lot. I think the biggest change we’ve seen is the change in activity on the leasing side and specifically new leases. 
Mary Lou Fiala : I would agree, I think that as far tenants’ inability to pay its been pretty consistent for the past couple of quarters and I think its still going to be difficult unless some financing opens up to some of these people that they’re just not going to be able to pay it, which is all incorporated into all of our plans.  I think the other thing is is that in terms of rent relief requests, if you look at—
Brian Smith : The rent relief requests are way down. If you look at what we have gotten this quarter, its about 50% less then the rent relief requests from last quarter and about 75% lower then what they were in the first quarter so they’re down dramatically. 
Nathan Isbee - Stifel Nicolaus : And as a follow-up, have you seen any of those that have stopped in June, have you seen any of them reverse course and start paying again, have you seen any of them recover. 
Bruce Johnson : There’s probably some of that but not a lot. What we see happen sometimes is they see that they be a threat of being starting legal proceedings against them, and then they’ll send us a check.
Brian Smith :  We did have an example, we took one tenant all the way through to litigation and got a judgment against them for $50,000 and then it was national retailer and then that national retailer showed up with a check. So obviously people are pressing us and testing us and in this case we took them to the matt and got where we needed to be. 
Nathan Isbee - Stifel Nicolaus : And then the new co-investment partnership that you formed, I’m just curious given your somewhat negative experience this year with the Macquarie JV, your whole thoughts about as acquisition opportunities present themselves over the next year or two why you would go that route to acquire versus acquiring on balance sheet and funding with new equity. 
Martin Stein : Once again what it gives us is is multiple sources and it makes sense to acquire on balance sheet, we have no obligation to do that. To the extent it may not make sense to acquire on balance sheet we can do it in the partnership. So it gives us tremendous amount of flexibility and in addition to the extent there’s a huge opportunity, we’ve got our partnership with CalPERS, we’ve got our partnership now with USAA, so we think its, and we also wanted to mention, as I stated, we wanted to minimum size the things as Bruce indicated to give us enough critical mass to do what we wanted to do, [pertaining] to opportunities in the future.  And I think to be honest with you our experience with our MCW partnership, I think that number one they’ve been great partners. They did have some financial issues but to be able to bring in CalPERS as a partner which strengthened MCW but also we got a great partner there who wants to continue to expand and I think given the option that we’ve got and any fees and promotes that Regency’s been paid, that’s been a very favorable experience for Regency. 
Nathan Isbee - Stifel Nicolaus : Let me ask it different, if you had a $250, $500 million portfolio come to you today, are you more likely to do it on balance sheet or off.
Martin Stein : Our preference would be to do that on balance sheet depending on that making sense, and if we could, especially if we could do that in a way to where we could combine that with an opportunity to enhance our balance sheet. But that may or may not be available to us, especially in the uncertain environment that we’re in. That would certainly be our preference. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Samir Khanal – Morgan Stanley
Samir Khanal – Morgan Stanley: Just wondering about your thoughts on retailer bankruptcies and store closings going forward and can you give us some sort of update on your exposure to the movie rental retailers given the accelerated closings on that side. 
Brian Smith : We’ve got obviously the two big ones there, you’ve got Blockbuster and you’ve got the Hollywood Video one, Blockbuster we have 71 locations not counting the new Neptune Beach one and our exposure, we found out there that they’re probably going to be looking to close about 12 of their units over 2010 and 2011. We’ve already got seven of those closures built into our plan so there’s not much to worry about there. We looked at the rent for those expiring leases. The 12 spaces that we would lose on a pro rata basis about $1.1 million worth of risk and we think that we can release those at almost the same rent.  Remember we’ve always said that that’s some of our best space in the center. So we’re forecasting right now that the releasing rents would be about 1.5% less. Hollywood Video, we’ve got 17 of those in our portfolio, one of those they’ve already committed to continue to pay rent, the other 16 they are negotiating with us if you will. We think its mostly a rent relief play. Again if you look at our opportunities what to do with that space, we’ve looked at them space by space and if we were to do what Hollywood wants to do there’d be about a $4.20 per square foot roll down which translated into about $200,000 of pro rata rent reduction.  If we were to release those spaces we think there’d be a minimal reduction, maybe $0.50 $0.60 or about $28,000 pro rata impact. So the Blockbuster is real, there are 12, they just notified us about that yesterday. As I said we’ve got most of that baked into our plan and then with regard to Hollywood we think its more of a rent negotiation play. 
Samir Khanal – Morgan Stanley: And just in terms of cap rates, do you think we’re getting closer to price discovery for shopping centers and where do you see cap rates for assets in the coastal area versus the interior market. 
Brian Smith : Well what’s changed this quarter is that the A quality grocery anchor centers and the kind of markets you’re talking about, the coastal markets, the urban markets, just the A quality markets, we’ve probably seen a 25 to 50 basis point decrease in that. There is a lot of capital out there chasing the highest quality grocery anchor centers.  For example here in Jacksonville there is a Publix anchor center and it just went to market and got 36 bids, 20 of which are going to best and final, and that one will probably settle out at about an 8.0% cap rate.  So we think the core high quality grocery anchor centers have fallen from maybe 8.5 to the low 8’s. Everything else pretty much starts with a 9 after that if you’ve got a community center, if you’ve got grocery anchored in the secondary tertiary market or if you got B or C quality properties, you’re probably talking 9. The biggest difference being those kind of properties its going to be very difficult to get financing and a lot of seller financing is required for those. So really positive outlook if you’re looking at dispositions of A quality properties, not so good if you’re looking at B or C. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ian Wiseman - ISI Group  
Ian Wiseman - ISI Group : Just to clarify I think last June you discussed how your development and you did no further leasing, you would be yielding about 6%, maybe I just misunderstand this three year yield but what has dropped, what’s changed in the drop down to 5.4%. 
Bruce Johnson : You mean from 6% to 5.4%. 
Ian Wiseman - ISI Group : You said I think in June that if you did [nothing] your development yields would be about 6% so it just looks like that keeps slipping, I wonder whether its tenants pulling out or something has changed. 
Brian Smith : On the current returns which we were talking about before, there’s really not much change. In fact they’ve gone up. I don’t remember what the exact number is, its—
Martin Stein :  So the question is June of—
Lisa Palmer : I think what you’re confusing is that some of those three year yields could be early 2010 and so we may have a lease in place, but not rent paying yet and its not expected to be rent paying until later in 2010. So they’re really different numbers. The current yield is what we referred to is that there’s no further leasing, which hasn’t changed very much. 
Brian Smith : I think there’s been very little change in that regard. 
Lisa Palmer : It’s all a matter of how much lag there is between rent commencement from lease execution say and in some cases there’s a pretty lengthy amount of time. 
Ian Wiseman - ISI Group : Staying on this development question, but if you look across the $3 billion of real estate that you have developed, let’s say since about 2000 and I would say that you’ve targeted 9 to 10% returns, I’m not sure you’ve done the math but where would your development portfolio be yielding today. 
Martin Stein :  2010.
Ian Wiseman - ISI Group : I’m saying since 2000 you’ve done about $3 billion of development, you’ve always targeted 9 to 10% stabilized returns, I’m just wondering in the properties that you have delivered to date, what would the current yield on those developments be. 
Martin Stein : Its interesting, one thing, one number that I can tell you is we’ve recognized since 2000 $300 million worth of recognized profits and that does include, that just includes what we’ve sold, and that doesn’t include what’s unrealized. 
Lisa Palmer : We don’t have it handy here in the room. 
Ian Wiseman - ISI Group : But what would you say that if you were targeting 9’s today, they’re really just 7’s. 
Martin Stein : We went through a period from about 2000 to 2007 where everything we started and delivered was in the 9.5 to 10.5% range. Not everything but on average. And its been this, we’ve still got—
Lisa Palmer : All of our completed developments are currently yielding about 10.2. 
Brian Smith : I was going to say we had a slide, in the company presentation that talked about what the returns were on like it was like 121 properties was underwritten at 10.3 and delivered at 10.2. 
Martin Stein : A substantial amount of value creation and realization unfortunately we’ve given a large amount of it back. 
Ian Wiseman - ISI Group : And just housekeeping, your other operating expenses spiked in the quarter to $3.2 million, what is the run rate on a go forward basis, and what was the cause of the spike. 
Bruce Johnson : I think its real estate taxes primarily but again—
Ian Wiseman - ISI Group :  We have a separate line item for real estate taxes, I just wonder what’s in that other operating expenses/income. 
Martin Stein : There was some more snow removal this year. 
Bruce Johnson : You’re talking specifically third quarter aren’t you.
Ian Wiseman - ISI Group : Yes.
Chris Leavitt: Our utilities were up significantly. Snow removal was up significantly.  
Ian Wiseman - ISI Group : Okay so is that a, should temper that on a go forward basis then, is that fair to say. 
Bruce Johnson : Yes, I would temper that on a go forward basis. 
Chris Leavitt: I would say to you that if you were to average the last three quarters, that would be a better comparison, comparative run rate going forward. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Donnelly - Wells Fargo
Jeffrey Donnelly - Wells Fargo: Mary Lou it goes without saying that you will be sorely missed, and Lisa I’m a Red Sox fan and for his safety and mine, I could never name by dog Jeeter. I’m curious, I’m not sure if you’re able to talk about it but looking out you’ve got about 2.2 million square feet of anchor expirations coming in 2011, 2012. I noticed a little bit of a ways off but it’s a little more then twice the volume of expirations you have in just about any other year that’s rolling, I guess I’m curious given the realities of the junior anchor market that’s out there right now, how are you thinking about retention, approaching those tenants for renewals, how should we be thinking about rents as we come up on those maybe in 2010.
Brian Smith : I think that it goes a little bit to what I was saying before is if you look at, we’ve gone through a lot of the, in the next two, three years, those anchors that are expiring and looked at their rates and again a lot of those did have options and looked at what we think the current market is and we just don’t see that there’s that much of a roll down.  It is a tougher environment on one hand, there’s a lot of space out there in the market and the anchors have enjoyed some pretty good leverage. But what I will say too is that they want to be in the centers more then ever that are generating the top sales. I’ll give you an example.  We have a property in Southern California in the Inland Empire, Falcon Ridge, and they are one of the national apparel guys who’s probably the toughest you can deal with who’s on a co-tenancy situation and they came to us at the expiration of the co-tenancy and said we want to renegotiate a lower rent.  We’ll we knew they were doing well, they were generating the sales and we just said no to that and they’re staying and they’re paying full rent. So I guess I feel while it may be a challenge, its going to be okay. The other thing is the age of the centers makes a big difference and a lot of those are expiring.  Those leases are significantly older and especially with the anchors since they have long-terms and the leases were set, the lease rates were set many, many years ago. The places where we will see the biggest challenges will be those, just like in his report this quarter, the markets that enjoyed the highest rental rate growth. California we did more of the big boxes. We enjoyed the highest rates and there, Florida, and DC is likely to be the place where you see the biggest roll downs. 
Lisa Palmer : I just happened to have the analysis that Brian referred to earlier right in front of me in terms of how we looked at the next three years of expiring rents, and we have it broken down by anchors. Even though we’re showing I think its north of 2.2 million square feet of anchor rent expiring through 2012, all but 400,000 of that have options.  And we show with the [inaudible] expiring average base rent, take 2012 for example, its $9.64. We’ve estimated that current rents, actually be a dollar north of that. But again a lot of those have options so we’re not going to be able to really realize that full potential. 
Brian Smith : One thing I want to point out too is if you kind of look at right now, I’d say let’s hope that this is about as dark as it gets, and we’ve got two situations we could talk about where we’ve got a lot of anchor activity. In Southern California we’ve got our Granada Hills redevelopment and there we’ve got a vacant or will be vacant Steinmart and we’ve got the old [Ralph] space.  And we’ve got six retailers competing for that. We’ve got 20 boxes in total and if you look at the leases that we’re working on right now, those [LOI’s] that we would experience 9% rent growth. And sometimes rent growth doesn’t tell the whole story. For example in the Bay Area, we’ve got, we’re doing leases with anchors, again the toughest apparel national guys, $19.00 whereas in most markets they’re single-digits.  Now those are lower then they were but I think its still indicative of pretty strong centers. 
Jeffrey Donnelly - Wells Fargo: Concerning cash rents, the declines have certainly been significant thus far and we’ve seen that around the country, I guess I’m trying to figure out I guess I’ll call it temporary or lasting the declines have been and maybe you can separate it this way but when you look at your markets around the country how much of that decline do you think is a function of a condition of over supply of space in the market versus just weakness in retailer sales and profitability and their ability to pay the market rents. I guess 51 is maybe a more lasting condition then ones more temporary. Are you able to break that out for call it anchors versus small shop.  
Brian Smith : With the anchors we think a lot of it is temporary which is exactly why we’re doing the short-term leases because we think that things will improve there and we do not want to be locked in for a long period of time. I think for the anchors, do you have a feel on that one Mary Lou. 
Mary Lou Fiala : Yes, I think for the most part it is a bit of both. So there’s no doubt about it. But most of our centers are located, they’re older centers, they’re in dense markets, better incomes, and I think right now its less of a supply and demand issue and more of negative comp store sales, wanting rent relief, doing what they can to try to survive through this. Which is why we’ve had greater negative growth. We’ve taken the approach of the fact that with these tenants that we think are strong tenants that we’re going to go ahead and for 12 months give them rent relief knowing that as things turn around and if in fact it’s an operator that we believe in that we will then be able to go back and continue to get nice rent growth. And we think this is the right way as Brian said in his comments to run the business. And so it looks, definitely that in the short-term we have lower rent growth, in the long-term I think it’s a winning strategy. 
Brian Smith : One of the things we’re doing to again to give you a little bit of color on it, we have, the retailers are also telling us especially small shops that they think its temporary. We have a center in Virginia Beach and there was a small restaurant there, really great restaurant in the market and they were interested in going to one of our centers and they were going to put a lot of dollars into the space to get their restaurant going but they just said in the short-term we’re worried about sales. We’d like to come there. If you could help us out in the short-term, we’ll make it back up to you. And in that case we signed the lease that was about 51% negative rent growth but it was in a center, the space had been vacant for four years. We’ve put them in there. We’ve structured the lease so that within three years those rent steps go back up 50%.  So I think it just goes to the mindset of the retailers in this case which is its temporary. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch 
Craig Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : First I just wanted to say to Mary Lou the whole REIT team here hopes you have a happy retirement and I would ask you if you were travelling but I don’t want to lose a question. 
Mary Lou Fiala :  Thank you so much and after this call you can, we can talk and I’ll be glad to give the whole deal. And its not a question. 
Craig Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  The question I did have though is in the past year, how many of the anchors that would have owned their own space have postponed store openings like the Target in Murrieta. 
Brian Smith : Well the only ones that I can think of that is really postponed is Target, some of the others have pushed out their, some of them were co-tenancy situations that were tied for example to, at our Deer Springs project we had Home Depot and we had several anchors who were tied to its opening so they may have been pushed out a quarter. But Home Depot is opening I think next month and everybody opens with them but the only one that has said we’re just not going forward with this was the Target at Murrieta. 
Craig Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : But do they have, I assume they have that right then. They can just, they own their own pad. 
Brian Smith : Well that’s the problem is when you do, when they buy their own pad, they demand a lot more in the way of, now we have some rights in those cases where if they terminate and they don’t proceed we can also buy the pad back but that’s not what we want to do in this market right now. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller - JPMorgan 
Michael Mueller - JPMorgan : I want to go back to a prior question on the Q3 to Q4 reconciliation, just think I’m missing something here, I want to see the moving parts again. I think you mentioned it was about $5 million of lower NOI which is about $0.06 a share, couple of million of lower fees which is maybe $0.02 a share or something, that’s about 8 out of the $0.14 to $0.15 drop off and I’m not sure if you mentioned what the—
Bruce Johnson : You’ve also got the impact of the USAA transaction which is effectively two months, $104 million, eight and three quarters. 
Michael Mueller - JPMorgan : Okay and that’s a couple of cents on top of that. So that’s probably 10 or 11. Anything else in there.  
Bruce Johnson : I think that covers the differential. I think—
Lisa Palmer : That’s gets it to the high end of the guidance and something beyond that would just be potential further move outs. We just don’t know. 
Bruce Johnson : That’s probably what you missed and I didn’t mention it to Christie when she asked the question. 
Michael Mueller - JPMorgan : Okay, and then looking at the development page and I don’t believe this was touched upon earlier, the yield on the in place portfolio dropped it looks like 30, 40 basis points, somewhere in there this quarter, was there anything in particular that was driving that or was it just a little bit here and there.
Brian Smith : Are you talking about the 7.58% yield. 
Michael Mueller - JPMorgan : Yes. 
Brian Smith : Actually on an apples to apples basis the change was only one basis point. As we always have with these there’s, we move some properties in we move some out, some stabilize so but if you look at just the same properties, its just a one basis point difference. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors
Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors:  Just had a quick question related to a prior question, you mentioned looking at some opportunistic acquisitions or possibly if you were to do a deal you’d look to do it on balance sheet as opposed to in a joint venture just curious are any of your joint venture partners currently expressing any interest to you to do more deals. 
Martin Stein : Yes, USAA would have loved to have done double, triple, quadruple the size of this partnership. They would have done it for $500 million. 
Bruce Johnson : I would CalSTRS and CalPERS are in the same position, both have expressed an interest in expanding. 
Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors: So then in terms of your flexibility of doing it on balance sheet versus doing it in these partnerships, I know before you had a capital allocation process where you worked on sort of a rotation basis, is that still what it would be going forward. 
Martin Stein : We have no requirements with CalPERS or with USAA. We do with the [open end] fund but I don’t think in CalSTRS in Oregon, but Oregon is fully invested, CalSTRS is only five lines. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jay Habermann - Goldman, Sachs 
Jay Habermann - Goldman, Sachs : Just given that you’re doing more deals on a shorter term basis, could you speak maybe to the down side in occupancy this could result in over the next 12 months given that retailers in general still seem to be pretty cautious and then also how are rents on these deals being negotiated. 
Brian Smith : Well mostly short-term leases that they’re being done again are being done at our behest. They’re not being done because they want the space long-term. We don’t want to tie up, tie ourselves up by doing rents based on the current distress in the economy and the market, and have that continue to burden us for many years to come.  So I don’t see that as an issue. Leasing hasn’t been the problem for us whatsoever. As I mentioned this has been the best leasing quarter in, since the first quarter of 2008. What’s been dragging on us would be the move outs. And so I guess, I would probably answer it by saying what’s going to happen with the move outs going forward, there’s some unknowns.  None of us know what’s going to happen in terms of bankruptcies but we’re going to see our move outs continue. In the past we used to average about 1.5 million square feet. This year we’re going to be a little over 2 million square feet. We think that will settle down next year to maybe back to 1.8, 1.85 million as we start moving some of these problem tenants out.  So right now we are in the process of evicting those that are kind of our deadbeats. That’s going to take time. Some of the states are just very difficult to work with. But that will cause us to probably continue to drift a little bit lower and then bottom out. 
Mary Lou Fiala : Just to add to what Brian said, is if you look at our tenants that we’ve done these 12 month leases with its primarily if you remember when we talked about rent relief requests and how we did it, we looked at their balance sheet. They had to come up with a business plan. We really looked at, do we see that they’re viable tenants. So the question is do we see a big risk in terms of decline in occupancy with these people that we’ve structures these leases.  No we don’t see a big risk and I think Brian addressed the rest of your question. 
Brian Smith : You did ask something about the rents and how things are structured, there’s really for the most part no difference between our TI’s, they’re very close to what they have been. They’re very reasonable. We’re not buying it up. We’re not giving free rent. There is some creativity that goes on out there. I mentioned the one where we got 50% rent growth over the next three years.  We’ve also got a situation out in Maryland where we’ve got one of our centers where the anchor went dark and we convinced a retailer to go in there, a good retailer, and we set the rent low but as soon as we get an anchor tenant in there, that rent bumps up pretty significantly.  So doing some creative things like that. 
Jay Habermann - Goldman, Sachs : You mentioned Virginia, California, Florida, as some of your weaker markets, is that where the bulk of the shorter term deals are occurring and I guess can you give us some sense of the magnitude maybe in some of your worst effected markets. 
Brian Smith : I don’t have the breakout of the short-term leases in terms of what market those are in, we could get that for you but I don’t have that. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Lucas - Robert W. Baird
Christopher Lucas - Robert W. Baird: I just need a real quick question, earlier in your comments you had talked about one of the transition revenue items related to a third quarter seasonal effect upon is it an insurance recapture program, could you explain that for me. 
Bruce Johnson : We effectively do first dollar coverage through a captive in our portfolio so we don’t have a deductible amount and that’s billed through to our tenants. To the extent that we have profits after what the expenses were with respect to that captive insurance entity, it shows up in the third quarter. 
Christopher Lucas - Robert W. Baird: So it’s a true up in the third quarter and that is in your recurring FFO number.  
Bruce Johnson : That is in the, as it always has been. Its something that we did every year. 
Christopher Lucas - Robert W. Baird: And for this quarter that number relative to prior quarter run rates is, what was that. 
Bruce Johnson : This quarter $3.5 million which is about the same as its been in prior years. 
Christopher Lucas - Robert W. Baird: And that’s in the other income line. 
Bruce Johnson : Yes. We moved it into the other income. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Samit Parikh - Oppenheimer 
Samit Parikh - Oppenheimer : My question is in regards to the new joint venture, can you describe the quality and location of these assets, maybe relative to your overall portfolio and on the 8.75 cap rate was that on in place NOI or was that a forward looking NOI.
Martin Stein : It was basically in place NOI. It’s a representative portfolio basically from a quality standpoint, pretty close to that and it was across the country and remember the transaction, the pricing was basically negotiated in the second quarter when things are not, there wasn’t quite as much clarity as there is right now. 
Samit Parikh - Oppenheimer : And then on the 6.8% interest only debt that you got on those properties, just wanted to see if you could give some clarity on what you’re seeing in the debt markets. Is pricing pretty much around 7% on seven to 10 year debt and based on that what are your thoughts on the sustainability of these rates going forward to next year. 
Bruce Johnson : In terms of our forecast the 10 year is probably, we use the [Chathams] forward curve in terms of what our projections are and I think as I recall its up about 20 basis points by the end of the year. So what we’d see is that go up even though effectively its not a spread over treasury, its actually a fixed rate. So we’ll probably see that 7% number hold through the next six months. As you are aware we have a big tranche of financing that’s coming due related to our joint venture in GRI that we’re in the process in fact and working through right now.  But we expect that that would still be, the 7% range is kind of a good number for the next six months. 
Operator: Your next question is a follow-up from the line of Michael Bilerman - Citigroup 
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup : Going back to the joint venture you mentioned that you USAA had a desire to make that joint venture a lot larger, is it open end, can they increase the size of that joint venture and what were the fees and just wondering if there is a promoted interest.
Martin Stein : There’s a promote, there’s an asset management fee, there’s property management fees. 
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup : And what size could the joint venture potentially increase to. 
Martin Stein : It could increase by several hundred million dollars and as Bruce and Lisa have been reminding me, we also have a partner that has been on the sidelines in CalSTRS. It looks like they’re coming back into the market. So and CalPERS is very active so to, right now our preference number one is to do something on an on balance sheet standpoint to the extent that we can do that. But secondly we’ve got multiple sources, external capital from end place partnerships. 
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup : In terms of this whole structural move down to the regions and moving a lot of the investment groups, how far along are you in that process and any time organizations go through large changes there’s always some bumps or hiccups in the road, and I guess how can we get comfort that in the next 12 months we’ll be able to see, or we won’t be able to see any of those hiccups. 
Brian Smith : Well for those reasons we’ve been working pretty methodically. We’ve been working on it for quite some time. I think we’re ready to implement. Let me talk a little bit more deeply about it because the changes really just reflect the field operations, kind of the transactions if you will. A person who is on the development side and has 20 years experience and has great anchor relationships, solid judgment, everything, there’s no reason why we can’t bring that kind of talent on to our operating portfolio to help with that and vice versa.  What we’re not changing would be the property operations platform. That is run on a national level. So we have consistent policies, collection procedures, contracts and things like that. So that group will continue to report to John Delatour who handled it before. So no change there.  Also on our national transactions group which did acquisitions, dispositions, they get very, very involved with the joint ventures, are part of our capital market strategy, they’re part of our balance sheet strategy, they continue to operate on a national scale.  So really all we’re talking about would be the field operations on the transaction side. The other thing that should give you comfort is these people are now responsible for all NOI in the field. It doesn’t matter if its developmental NOI, it doesn’t matter if its operating property NOI. They’re responsible for it and if you look at the people we’ve got running it, we’re fortunate to have guys who have worked on both sides of the business for many many years and they’ve got great experience.  Jim Thompson used to run half the country for the operations. He will now run one third of the country. John Delatour has been doing it on both sides. He’s been doing investments, he’s been doing operations. He’ll have the center part of the country as well as the national property management platform and then Mac Chandler, we brought him back specifically because of his experience, knowledge of those markets and I think we’re just very, very fortunate and those people should give you great comfort. So while some things have changed, not everything has changed. 
Martin Stein : And the key thing is the line leasing people, the line leasing officers aren’t changing. We’re changing their focus and we’re enhancing their focus, tightening their focus is what we’re doing. And my expectation I think it’s a good question, but my expectation is not, the downside of it I think its going to give us a better chance with a greater focus, I think as we mentioned before.  From harvesting the imbedded growth in the development portfolio of the $15 million plus of NOI from signed leases and taking that portfolio from 78 to 95% leased, there’s another $15 million plus of NOI, I think it enhances our ability to harvest that imbedded value there. 
Mary Lou Fiala : First of all this is so well thought through and it was thought through with a great group of people and Brian and I together worked on this and I can’t feel any better about it is why I made that comment. But I think one of the things that is so good about what’s happening is we have removed some layers. And so now you have people who have more experience in the business who are going to be directly involved as opposed to just managing.  And Brian said this, but really involved in more of the leasing, more hands on. I think everybody is going to be much much more hands on because you’ve got these people with anywhere from 10 to 16 plus years of experience who spent more of their time managing in the past, because they had bigger territories, now will have smaller territories but really focusing on those markets inside and out, with years of experience that will help benefit us.  So I think unlike what normally happens I’ve been through nine mergers and not that this is a merger but I’ve been through a lot. I have to tell you I can’t feel any better about it, about the process, about the results, about the talent.  We’ve always been, proud of ourselves in the depth of management and talent and this is just a perfect indication whether its Brian, the president in running both operations and investments, and then having his three guys who are more specialists and now they’re going to be [inaudible] of their smaller market.  And then taking that all the way through. It’s the same guys, its what we’ve [inaudible] all along and I’m confident that you’re going to see these results. And you’re not going to see hiccups as a result of this change. 
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup : And if I could just follow-up on a previous question in terms of the leasing, if you looked at the supplemental on page 25 you looked at your weighted average lease term over the last four quarters, you’ve gone from 49 to 48 to 47 and then this past quarter it dropped down to 4.2 years with the largest negative rent spreads. And so when you talked about 15% of, I don’t know if you’re using the two million square feet or the 3.5 million total with the 100% of the JVs but 15% of leasing being under 12 months, I’m assuming that there was a much much greater percentage of that occurring in this quarter and I’m just wondering I know and you said you want to take a more longer term view, but I think what we’re trying to get at is there a difference or a trend in how you’re approaching the leasing today relative to how you were doing it at the beginning of the year. 
Brian Smith : All I can say, we’d have to dig into those numbers to answer specifically what you’re talking about, but there’s no difference other then what we talked about. We’re focused on, let’s be honest, I think for all companies, in the really great markets you didn’t have to worry so much about tenant quality because you signed somebody up, if it didn’t work you, you replaced them.  That view has changed and that’s a significant fundamental difference in the company and we’re doing everything we can now to proactively move out the weaker tenants and replace them with the stronger.  The only other issue that we’re doing that I would say is different is just making sure that if we have those retailers that we want to keep but its going to take significant rent write-downs that we’re going to do that on a short-term basis so as not to cut off our nose but other then that, there’s no change. 
Martin Stein : And because of the market conditions as they have deteriorated from a year ago or six, nine months ago, that’s become more of a part of our strategy. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Fick - Stifel Nicolaus 
David Fick - Stifel Nicolaus : I’m tempted to ask what the reorganization, what Martin and Bruce are going to do, but my question is just a follow-up on the Publix, Kroger comments. The question is this, you observed at both Kroger and Publix are still in the market, I’m just wondering is there any specific that you, not that you would disclose but are you in conversations about specific deals in specific locations that could turn into potential development upside in the next year and are they willing to meet pricing that’s logical in this market. 
Brian Smith : We are talking to them on a case by case basis of any opportunities that may make sense to them. We’ve talked to Publix about a few redevelopment opportunities within our own portfolio and we’re going forward with that. And we do have discussions going on but our pipeline is very small. In fact we don’t have any new, we have one new development that’s in the high probability pipeline for the next year or two.  So we’re talking, its still early. In fact Publix expressed to us one of their biggest problems is they want to do 35 to 55 new stores. But they’re having trouble getting developers to give them so stores so we are in conversations.  
Martin Stein : We are doing a major redevelopment with them in our own portfolio. Secondly I remind you that, this quarter or the last quarter we were aware of sales of a couple of centers where they had a first right of refusal. We went to them and said you’ve got a first right of refusal. Two fabulous centers that we bought at a 9 plus percent cap rate and they are, we’ve got a half a dozen I think it is, joint ventures with them. We joint venture with Kroger in the past so there’s very strong relationships and I think we have an in place joint venture with Kroger.  We’ve got very strong relationships with both of them, with both stores.  
Brian Smith : If we could do more, Neptune Beach is one I talked about in my opening comments, you know we’d be all over that. The ones that don’t work for us would just be those that we’re not comfortable with the amount of shop space they may take or something about the market, but they’re very interested in expanding. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Levinson – PSM
Ryan Levinson – PSM: I just wanted to, I was just wondering the same exercise that you went through breaking down the rent growth on the hole, on the total leases, on the total new leases, new and renewals, I was just wondering if you could do that specifically just on new leases. 
Brian Smith : You just wanted to know the breakdown of—
Ryan Levinson – PSM: What the rent spread was for less then 12 months and then the rent spread for 13 to 36 and then 37 and greater months. 
Brian Smith : For new and renewal, I don’t have that. 
Ryan Levinson – PSM: But just to clarify and this was the negative 13, negative 7, negative 0.6 that was for total leases. 
Brian Smith : Yes, for total leases year to date. 
Ryan Levinson – PSM: My second question, I’m just confused. Looking at this longer term and I’m a little confused as to how even if Q3 lease rates are the bottom which I don’t believe, but I’m just confused as to how you would have flat lease spreads in your in line space when you’ll be renewing 2005 through 2007 vintage leases that had clearly escalated several dollars from where we are today. 
Brian Smith : I think you’re talking about a national portfolio. First of all we have said that the rents in California, Florida, DC where we’ve had some of the biggest run ups, those are coming down. But we’ve also got markets where there hasn’t been that kind of rent acceleration and those are showing more positive rent growth. So I think it all just averages out. But we have gone through space by space and looked at it. 
Martin Stein : But just remember what we did was, some of these rents may have been vintage, 2000, 2003, what we did was we just used the leases that we’ve signed so far this year as a proxy for market. 
Ryan Levinson – PSM: Year to date this year or Q3 this year. 
Martin Stein : Including Q3, including Q2. 
Ryan Levinson – PSM: Year to date average. 
Lisa Palmer : We also we got input from our field, it wasn’t a simple just take an average. 
Brian Smith : The other thing I want to say is we didn’t do this specifically to forecast rent growth, we did this to quantify whether we have much risk of significant roll down and based on that we got several data points that said that our average rents this year across the country are about $21.00 for less then 10,000 square feet and we compare that to what’s rolling you see that we’re right there.  And as Lisa said and as I said earlier, you’re talking about 3.5% potential roll down just based on looking at that way. 
Ryan Levinson – PSM: And just so I’m looking at this on like for like basis, the $21.00 is your year to date—
Lisa Palmer : The $21.99, $22.00. Brian is doing it from memory, I have it right in front of you. 
Martin Stein : And remember also I just want to reiterate one thing real quick is the leasing activity has accelerated during the last two quarters so we’ve had more of the number one not only is it two thirds, but its, just from a pure calendar standpoint, but its back end weighted, the amount of leasing activity. 
Ryan Levinson – PSM: Back end, you mean the 22 is back end weighted to, its more current. If you could just clarify for me then, I’m assuming that you probably have about half of your 2010 leases completed by now. 
Bruce Johnson : It is not like the original mall business, its probably in the 10 to 15% range. 
Ryan Levinson – PSM: But at this point in time beginning of November I would assume that you have a pretty good lead as to what the first half of 2010 is going to look like, just wondering what you’re thinking, does this $22.00 look like its going to hold. You have 15% of your in line space rolling over and that’s why I asked. 
Martin Stein : I think as Bruce indicated, we expect to see some further roll down in rents in the, carrying into 2010. 
Ryan Levinson – PSM: Roll down from the 22 level here. 
Lisa Palmer : I think perhaps, all the comments on the call, we don’t really know. It feels like we might be at the bottom today in some markets but how can anybody be sure. 
Martin Stein : And that’s the reason why we’re not going to give guidance until January and we’ll give more specific guidance then, our February call. 
Lisa Palmer : I think that’s the limit of the questions. 
Ryan Levinson – PSM: I know but you didn’t have an answer for my first one so I felt like that was, I was going to come back to you offline. So I just wanted, if I could just clarify because I still don’t feel like I understand what the answer was. But is rent going to roll down from the 22 level or from the, if I look at page 39 of your supplemental what the in place base rents are, is it going to roll down from that level. 
Lisa Palmer :  The 22 is what Brian said is what current markets are today, what you see in the supplemental is what’s expired. 
Ryan Levinson – PSM: That’s your spread. 
Lisa Palmer : Yes.
Ryan Levinson – PSM: Okay so just, I don’t want to put words in your mouth, I just want to make sure I’m understanding what you’re communicating, that the 22 that you could see rent roll down from the 22 level. 
Lisa Palmer : No we did not say that. 
Ryan Levinson – PSM: I’m glad I asked then. 
Lisa Palmer : Please call me after the call. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of [Alex Barrett – Agency Trading Group]
[Alex Barrett – Agency Trading Group]: Mary Lou, best wishes on your retirement, I just had a question, do you have a breakdown of your new leases between small and large tenants, like in terms of square feet. 
Lisa Palmer : We actually in the supplemental, maybe you’re looking for more then this, we do have a leasing specifics page. Pages 25 and 26 so you can see whether its would be for our [inaudible] as at 100%. We show that there and then we also, that’s the actual new and renewal and then for anchors and in lines we just have the lease expiration tables.  So I don’t know if that’s enough. 
[Alex Barrett – Agency Trading Group]: I’ll follow-up with you offline.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of [Chris Summers – Green Light Capital]
[Chris Summers – Green Light Capital]: I’m trying to better understand the change in the fourth quarter guidance from the last quarter to this quarter, it looks like you’re expecting FFO now to be lower by about at least $12 million from what you thought fourth quarter might be a few months ago. I’m wondering if you could kind of point out some of the larger items that are bringing that down, for the recurring component. 
Bruce Johnson : Have you seen the schedule on the left side. 
[Chris Summers – Green Light Capital]: I have not.
Bruce Johnson : I think that will fully explain the difference in the recurring. What we provided there was if we had provided that same recurring guidance last quarter so you can have an apples to apples number because it is not a decrease. 
[Chris Summers – Green Light Capital]: What one time items were included in the fourth quarter on the last call then. Because the last quarter your fourth quarter guidance was basically like $0.75. What items were in there that aren’t recurring. 
Lisa Palmer : We have about a $13 million promote that is expected to be paid in the fourth quarter. That was in our normal, the last quarter we didn’t give recurring FFO guidance. I think that might be what’s confusing you. 
[Chris Summers – Green Light Capital]: So that promote you don’t expect to have happen next year.
Lisa Palmer : It will happen in the fourth quarter, but its not recurring.
Bruce Johnson : Its not recurring which means we don’t expect it to occur next year. 
[Chris Summers – Green Light Capital]: So the property is really running at like $0.55 a quarter of FFO currently. 
Martin Stein :  You mean on a recurring basis. 
[Chris Summers – Green Light Capital]: So I look at it all things being the same, $0.55 times four is $2.20, maybe that’s a good starting point to think about 2010.
Lisa Palmer : I don’t think that we want to commit to that, but our guidance for the fourth quarter for recurring FFO is $0.53 to $0.58 and that is recurring. So there’s no non recurring items in that. 
Operator: There are no additional questions at this time; I would like to turn it back over to management for any additional or closing comments. 
Martin Stein : Thank you very much for your time and everybody have a great weekend and those with kids have an awesome Trick or Treat. Happy Halloween. Thanks, bye.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Jennifer and I will be you conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Regency Centers Corporation First Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute, to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. (Operator Instructions) Please limit yourself to two questions. If you have any follow-up questions please re-prompt. I would now like to turn the conference over to Lisa Palmer, Senior Vice President Capital Markets. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you and good morning. On the call this morning I have Stein, Chairman and CEO, Mary Lou Fiala, Vice Chairman and COO, Bruce Johnson, Chief Financial Officer, Brian Smith, President and Chief Investment Officer, Chris Leavitt, Senior Vice President and Treasurer and Mr. Jamie Shelton, Vice President of Real Estate Accounting. Before we start, I'd like to address forward-looking statements that maybe addressed on the call. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes, and results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC. Specifically, the most recent reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. I'll now turn the call over to Hap.
Martin "Hap" Stein, Jr.: Thank you, Lisa. Good morning. I have to admit that my future outlook for the capital markets, the economy in general, and Regency in particular, has become more optimistic. Some of my cautious optimism, ironically as a result that I, like many of us on the call, have now been acclimated to the shock and awe of the financial panic that has descended upon the world. My views may also be the result of my hope that we are... what we are experiencing now is the beginning of the end of the crisis. That does not say that any month now, the sun will break out from the storm clouds, start shining brightly on the economy and the shopping center business. Economy still has a long, long way to go before we're able to enjoy any semblance of a meaningful recovery, and the new norm will not look anything like to 2004, 2007 drain (ph) years. Regency has obviously not been immune to the adverse impacts from the extremely difficult conditions in the capital markets and the economy. For the first time in over 11 years, same property net operating income will be less than the prior year. The high probability development pipeline is dramatically less in what has been, and what seems like well over 10 years. The increase in cap rates together with slower lease of developments has also caused a major reduction in development profits. The organization especially development group has been significantly right-sized to reflect the current environment. In spite of the challenges that we face and all things considered, there were several key reasons that I feel good about Regency's future... Regency's position for the future, including signing 230,000 square feet of new leases, and 826,000 square feet of renewals in the toughest operating environment that I had ever experienced. This is evidenced that retailers still want to operate in well-located, quality necessity oriented shopping centers, which are anchored with our best-in-class retailers, especially grocers and discount department stores like Target and Wal-Mart. Approximately $600 million of capital from a combination of the recent equity offering and the dividend cut, as well as the committed mortgage financing will be available to fund a very significant portion of Regency's financial commitments through 2012. As a result, we expect that our debt-to-asset level will be reduced to less that 45% by the end of this year. By maintaining a close relationship with Regency's banking group, Regency should be able to extend a vast majority of the $940 million of bank facilities on reasonable terms well before they expire in 2011 and 2012. Negotiating favorable terms in the co-investment partnerships especially, distribution and time provisions, will continue to work to our benefit and enable us to weather partner issues on a positive basis. Although, the 100 person plus reductions in force have been extremely painful, G&A before capitalization has been reduced by $27 million since 2007. Even after reduction force, I believe that Regency still has an exceptional, talented and deep team in all key facets of the business. And lastly, phasing of developments are putting the brakes on the pace of new developments through evermore stringent underwriting, has preserved precious capital. Now, Bruce, Mary Lou and Brian will provide color regarding results for the quarter and future outlook.
Bruce Johnson: Thank you, Hap, and good morning. FFO per share for the first quarter of 2009 was $0.78 per share, down 10% from this period in 2008, due primarily to a higher G&A and higher interest expense. Gross G&A for the first quarter of 2009 was $7 million lower than the first quarter of 2008, following a reduction in force and lower incentive compensation accruals. However, these savings were offset by a $2.2 million severance charge associated with the reduction, as well as the decline in capitalized overhead given the decrease development activity. Net interest expense was also nearly $4 million higher, primarily resulting from less capitalized interest also related to lower development activity. On April 20, in conjunction with our equity raise, we released preliminary results and revised FFO per share guidance for the remainder of the 2009. The main drivers behind this revision were, decline in capitalized interest resulting from a significantly lowering our development stats (ph) guidance. Secondly, decreased transaction profits. And thirdly, a reduction in same-store NOI expectations. These factors combined with the offering resulted updated guidance for 2009 of $3.03 to $3.28 per share. Regency's number one focus and priority continues to be strengthening and protecting the balance sheet. I mentioned on our recent equity offering of our 10 million shares of common stock, which included the full exercise of the over allotment option by NOI writers. In this very difficult period and uncertain economic and financial environment, we felt it was important to Regency's strategy to provide a source of funds for all of our obligations through 2012. This offering was key in meeting that goal. The net proceeds of approximately $311 million, combined with a recent commitment for a $106 million 10 year mortgage that we rate locked at 7.75% represents substantial progress in securing reliable sources of capital. In addition to this equity offering, Regency also reduced the dividends to $1.85 per share saving $200 million in 2012. And finally, we are in discussions with prospective co-investment partners for them to acquire approximately a 75% interest in some of our properties that will provide roughly a $150 million in cash to Regency. The combination of these four sources, plus our unfunded line of credit balance, will provide almost $1.3 billion, which is more than our obligations for the next three and a half years. And in fact, it is likely to allow Regency to take advantages of some opportunities in the future. To give you an update, Macquarie CountryWide has stated that they are actively pursuing... improving our liquidity on a basis that makes sense to them and to us. And we feel that good progress has been made. Mary Lou.
Mary Lou Fiala: Thank you Bruce and good morning. Same-store NOI was down by 2% in the first quarter, primarily due to tenant bankruptcies, move outs and slower lease out. Occupancy at quarter end was 93.3%. We leased our renewed 1.1 million square feet through 324 transactions. Our renewal rate was 77%, and rent growth was slightly positive at 0.9%. Although these results are well below anything we've experienced over the last 10 years, from my perspective the portfolio is holding up pretty well in this difficult environment. These times are challenging and our strategy has been to maximize cash flow at all of our properties by emphasizing occupancy over short-term rent growth. In order to maintain our flexibility to return to rent to higher levels in the future, in those select cases where newer renewal lease needed to be in the lower rent, we are keeping the majority of these leases to a term of less than three years. Close to 80% of the 251 renewals signed in the first quarter had flat to positive rent growth. The remaining renewals had negative rent growth, but nearly all of these had terms less than three years. This is also a trend with new lease activity. In fact, its very important to note that all new leases, with a term greater than three years, had double-digit rent growth. Mid-term rent release is being granted on a very selective basis. The evaluation process that's been instituted as I talked about last quarter, is extremely rigorous. Rent relief was granted to only 22 of our 7200 tenants in the first quarter. And that's only 3/10 of 1% of our tenants. All of these tenants were local tenants, and the rent release is typically for 90 days, an incorporated favorable terms such as recapture rights and termination rights, and enhanced guarantees. So, what we are actually getting is better leases and improving the quality of the lease document with non-monetary clauses. The point that I want to make is that we're conceding some, but we're getting more in return. And especially more for the long run. As we reported earlier, we've lowered our guidance for the remainder of the year. Same-store NOI growth is expected to be in a minus 5 to minus 3% range, which equates to a $6.5 million reduction in net operating income. We're projecting a high amount of unplanned move outs, slower leasing activity and reduced rent growth. But, given the quality of our real estate, we expect the portfolio to recover from the short-term pay in the not too distant future. What I'd like addressing some type as practice, to give you an example. And I want to talk about one of our shopping centers, and it's called Powell Street Plaza. And that one shopping center accounts for 25% of the 6.5 million projected decline in NOI. Powell Street is a irreplaceable dent into our asset in the East Bay area of San Francisco, with absolute exceptional demographics and tenants sales. Circus City and Shannon & Company moved out unexpectedly as a result of these bankruptcies. But within 90 days, we had letters of intent from two nationally recognized retailers. And they're really strong players. But given the timing to work with these deals, these factors will not be ramping for the remainder of the year. Another thing I think is really for you to understand is that we believe that our negative rent growth is going to be short-term in nature. And we have 10 LOIs for 15 of our vacant spaces and our portfolio over 15,000 square feet. The LOI rent averages 31% higher than previous rents, and then with great retailers such as David Brothers, Walgreens, Jenson Hofu (ph). However, it is important to reiterate that these transaction are absolutely taking longer, and have a direct impact to the bottom-line. We have a number of initiatives, initiatives aimed to improve our operating income. We have an even greater focus on expenses by renegotiating vendor contracts. So, we see a lot of success with that. We've focused on all aspects of marketing, co-calling, web-based marketing, broker events and even a new short form lease that makes it quicker for our brokers to get paid, and therefore makes Regency deals a priority. And more importantly than probably all this, we continue to leverage our PCI relationships. We've had 23 meetings in Vegas with our national PCI retailers. This is fewer than our previous years. But the difference this year is that each meeting will be focused on specific deals at specific properties rather than some of the meetings in the past been kind of a broad state of the union discussion. The team has already completed portfolio reviews with a majority of these PCI retailers and some materials in advance for identifying transactions. So now, we are sitting down at the table with these guys at ICSE. Both sides are ready to make deals. In summary, this is a difficult time. Our real estate is strong, our team is focused and working diligently. And we've positioned ourselves to emerge from this recession with the best-in-class retailers, and solid centers that will enable us to grow rent and same-store NOI in the future. Brian?
Brian Smith: Thank you, Mary Lou, and good morning. I'd like to open my remarks by expanding on perhaps Bruce comments about the company's G&A. As we said before, we are keenly focused on right sizing the organization. We're striving to maintain what is a delicate balance, between the realities of the business environment today, and our desire to keep in place, extremely talented team that not only can effectively execute our business plan, but also take advantage of the incredible opportunities that will be available to those companies that are positioned to thrive. We took steps last year and early in the first quarter 2009, to meaningfully reduce overhead. We eliminated a 141 positions from the plan that existed at the beginning of 2008, which resulted in a savings of $15 million to what was our original staffing plan in 2008, prior to the onset of the recession. About 80% of the savings came from the investment group and investment support function. While that's a lot, we'll continue to explore additional cost reductions going forward. Before the capitalization of costs related to our development and leasing operations, we expect our G&A to be $15 million lower than 2008, which reflects the savings from the reductions in force already completed. However, because we are capitalizing a much smaller percentage of our development group as compared to 2008, our net G&A for 2009 will be approximately 4 to $8 million higher than 2008, subject to the range to new developments starts, this guidance is 10 to $50 million. This reduction is a result of our having significantly tightened our requirements as the kind of developments, we think make sense in the current environment of capital constraints and reduced retailer demand. For us to move forward on a new development, we have to check several boxes. Returns on rigorous underwriting have been further increased to the 11 to 12% range, with one exception being a commitment to a value banker that we feel would be wrong not to honor. When evaluating existing land investments, we'll look at the incremental return on costs, which we need to exceed this higher return threshold. We'll be focusing on developing shopping centers with market-leading, dominant grocers in affluent markets with limited shop space. The development would need to be significantly pre-leased and have strong indications of retailer demand, so as to have excellent visibility to 95% lease up. And we'll not take any entitlement risk. In short, there'll be little difference between these types of developments and buying 95% leased operating centers, other than completing the construction, leasing a limited amount of space and the expected returns. In that sense there are almost what we call acquisition plus opportunities. While our guidance reflects our cautious approach to development, and our belief that there will be very select number of opportunities that can meet these stringent requirements, any project that can clear this far in the current environment is truly a gem, will enhance intrinsic value and should be pursued. Probably the best way to illustrate what I'm talking about is to give you an example of such a project we're working on that does check all these boxes. In Los Angeles, there is a very dense... there is a site in a very dense area, 450,000 people in three miles, and well over a million in five miles. To put that in perspective. This is almost six times the average population density in our operating portfolio, and represents the kind of densities retailers' dream of. But historically, it has been almost impossible to assemble urban parcels in a manner that allows for traditional retail to be built with acceptable levels of risk in return. Generally speaking, urban sites are very expensive. So, the only way to make them pencil traditionally, was to build mixed used projects with multiple stories, charge top of the market rents and take enormous entitlement and leasing risks. Not surprisingly, that is why we've shied away from these projects in the past. In this case however, it appears that we can assemble all the property for about $0.11 on the $1, and thereby built prototypical single-storey retail. We can achieve an 11% return on costs while charging rents that work for retailers even with today's very conservative sales forecast. In short, the current environment is creating a rare opportunity to develop a low-risk urban end fill (ph) project, with most of the traditional development risks stripped out of it, and return 300 basis points higher than previously would have been possible. There are a few reasons we can do this. A large bank has a loan on the property with a developer who can't perform. It appears that we will be able to buy the property through a deed in lieu of foreclosure transaction in which the bank will write-down the value of the land by 50%, plus storing for free, an additional seven adjacent anchors secured by the same note. In addition, Citi is going to give us at no cost, properties crucial to the assemblies. All in all, the land concessions have worked about $45 million. Finally, the Citi has tentatively agreed to further subsidize the project by agreeing to pay for the cost of a theater to go in the property. The demand for the project scheme, all the top retailers were at the site and is far more interest that we can accommodate. This kind of potential investment represents a once in a generation opportunity. But let me reiterate that our basic mood on developments is that we are extremely cautious and in the short-run see limited opportunities to make any sense. When we see ones like this, we are prepared to seize the opportunity. As always, the balance sheet will come first and any such opportunities will need to be funded through property sales, contributions to co-investment partnerships or by other means. During the quarter, we did make some modest leasing progress on the in-process portfolio. Its important to remember though that these projects are 85% leased, and when you include anchor spaces... and when you include anchor spaces, and 75% leased on Regency's company on portions. So, we are starting in a good place. For the first time in several quarters, our team in the field are seeing a definite increase in activity. More retailers are showing interest in the spaces and are actively negotiating terms. In the past, given the steep decline and volatility of their sales, junior anchors could not even run sales models, which were necessary to determine the economics of any lease transaction. Now, sales have stabilized to the point that retailers are comfortable running sales forecast and again, for the first time in many months, they are willing to present the projects to their real estate communities. One of our largest retail customers recently expressed that he is now considering opening as many as three times the number of stores in 2010, and 2011, than it had previously expected to open. This is all good and welcome news that knock-on (ph) will continue and translate into actual lease transactions.
Martin "Hap" Stein, Jr.: Thanks Brain. Thanks Mary Lou, and thank you, Bruce. You've heard from the team what has been accomplished in the first quarter, and some of the strategies that are being employed to position Regency for the future. Let me review very briefly the key elements of that strategy. First, we're committed to preserving Regency's strong balance sheet and access to reliable, external sources of capital, maintaining a large unencumbered pool of assets which currently approximates $3 billion. Second is to protect and grow net operating income, apart from the operating portfolio and developments. Third is to cautiously and selectively invest in compelling opportunities like the opportunity that Brian just described what we call, gems. And finally to proactively manage G&A costs as the business environment dictates. By achieving these objectives Regency will be positioned to cost effectively fund our obligations, take advantage of what should be outstanding future opportunities, enhance our position as the premier national shopping center, owner, operator and developer. Grow per share intrinsic value and generate total shareholder returns that exceed the FTSE (ph) shopping centre index. At this time, we do appreciate your time, and we'll now answer any questions that you may have.
Operator: Thank you. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. (Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from Jeff Donnelly with Wachovia.
Jeffrey Donnelly - Wachovia Securities: Good morning guys. Just a question to the revisions in your guidance. You talked to your revenue growth and NOI growth expectations really sharply from the past. And I guess I'm having a little bit of a difficult time reconciling that decline from the prior quarter, because much of your revenue is in place and generally speaking you haven't been granting a lot of rent relief, and we seem to be over the hump. At least for the time being, retailer bankruptcies. I guess I'm wondering what specifically your are seeing, perhaps in the back half of the year that leads you to be more cautious. Or is it just that you are baking in more conservatism in light of the lack of visibility?
Mary Fiala: It's a combination of a couple of things. Our new leasing in the first quarter was behind plan. And so, we think that even though we are starting to see some pick up in the last month that that's one thing that's going to effect the second half of the year. The second is the fact that we're having high move outs, and they have pretty strong as you know. A lot of that was incorporated into our budget. But we think, and we've got our list of, our watch list to retailers. And you sit down and you look at that list, and you look at the potential bankruptcies out there Jeff, and this is the majority of it. We think a lot of those things are going to happen. And so, as you know, we've always been I am just being realistic, not conservative. And I don't think when you stand back and look at where we're today, what we know has been there, which is I think is baked into kind of the middle of our guidance, and where we think potentially things could get bad, based on some potential bankruptcies. I hope it doesn't get there. But, that's why we took our time, because we're not a annoying the fact there's people out there today, that could probably go bankrupt and they probably will. And we've put that at the low end of our guidance. Now, we hope we don't get there. But, it's a potential.
Jeffrey Donnelly - Wachovia Securities: That's helpful. And maybe this plays into the second question. But, looking at your acquisition and disposition guidance cap rates, at the low end they rose 25 to 50 basis points to about 8.5 to 9%. Is that generally where you see pricing today I guess, overtime better than average assets in your core markets. Or is that just where you think its going?
Brian Smith: I think it Jeff pretty conservative. I think we see for cap price with the A properties and top markets would be about 8.25%. If you go to secondary market, or you go to B property try at 50 basis points. If you get a combination of both maybe a 100. But, what we've done so far has been better than that. The three sold to date in the operating and development side have been averaged to about 7.6%. And we are working on six others that pricing right now looks to be in the 8% range. But I think we're just allowing for the environment to surprise us.
Martin Stein, Jr.: I would also just reiterate that the pricing that Brain went over, reflects one-off pricing. And there is a probably 50 to 100 basis point difference between, where pricing is occurring on a one-off basis, and where it maybe occurring on a portfolio basis.
Operator: We'll take our question Quentin Velleley with Citigroup.
Quentin Velleley - Citigroup: Good morning, everyone. Just the first question in relation to Macquarie CountryWide. I know they've been looking at potentially getting third party equity into the joint venture. Is that... could you give us an upside on whether that's progressing? And the second point on that I guess is, given your liquidity position has improved so much, and given the high quality of the first Washington portfolio in particular, does the likelihood of you increasing your ownership stake in MCW, has that increased?
Bruce Johnson: I think with respect to your first question, I'll answer about what I can answer is that we believe they are making good progress with the initiatives that they've announced publicly to the markets, in terms of either selling off individual properties in the joint ventures, and/or a combination of selling their interest in the joint venture to somebody else. That would be satisfactory to us. Our view is that it has to work for us. And that's the direction we're going with them in that regard. With respect to our interest in potentially buying some of that, we'll have to look at that down the road. We're focused today on the first thing, focused on protecting the balance sheet and preserving what we currently have, and making sure that we see the light of telling (ph) you. That maybe an opportunity. We'll just have to see if it fits in that arena.
Martin Stein, Jr.: Hey Quentin, we could be part of that. But, the vast majority is going to come from a third party source, if it happens.
Quentin Velleley - Citigroup: Okay.
Bruce Johnson: We would say, we're cautiously optimistic. It appears like they are making very good progress.
Quentin Velleley - Citigroup: That's good. The second question is I mean I guess, there's more of hint now potential acquisitions and sort of forth (ph) from yourselves and competitors and so forth. I guess, I just wanted to ask how do you view your longer term ideal leverage levels, relative to making decisions on acquisitions and so forth?
Martin Stein, Jr.: Well, number one and Bruce please provide some revision, Lisa is needed here. But, we don't just look at our debt to cost level or debt to market level. Especially don't look at debt to market, because you may remember that I think our debt to market at one time in the not too distant future, was well below 30%.
Bruce Johnson: And so in addition to debt to asset at cost, we're going to look at our fixed charge covered ratio and our debt to EBITDA. In both those ratios, we'll be looking on a recurring earnings from a recurring earnings standpoint. And we're very comfortable with the current leverage position that we are in right now. And we would figure out the best way to cost effectively finance any new opportunities whether that's on balance sheet or an off balance sheet basis. And that's the reason why... one of the reasons why we're talking about expanding our co-investment partnership program. But in event, we would not be increasing our leverage other than on a short-term basis.
Martin Stein, Jr.: Let me just add to that in addition, Quentin. I think its important to note that in any acquisitions we do that's I mean to the extent that we're going to use third party financing for that, joint venture kind of structure. That joint venture financing is typically only available at like a 50% level. So, that's kind of max number we're looking at today. And whether we do less than that, I think its going to depend upon what the venture itself wants to do.
Quentin Velleley - Citigroup: Okay
Martin Stein, Jr.: We're certainly not going to increase leverage.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Jay Habermann with Goldman Sachs
Jay Habermann - Goldman, Sachs & Co.: Hey good morning everyone, here with Johan as well. Passing your comments you did sound more optimistic, and I know you caveat it saying it's certainly fairly in this process of recovery. I guess specifically in terms of the new leases versus renewals and clearly the existing assets you guys have been willing to make those concessions on rent. Can you talk about the new developments, probably not as much progress in the last few months but just curious, are you doing shorter-term deals there and what sort of concessions you are making?
Unidentified Company Speaker: Jay, as I mentioned, we made modest progress. You saw a 38,000 square feet of net leasing. The number is actually a bit higher than that in terms of the gross leasing. There are several things going on. First of all, we had one project in Oregon where there was an existing tenant was already signed up. And we terminated that lease in order to make room for to bring in Trader Joe's which would not only be a huge boost to the driver at that center but also brought that center to a 100% lease level. Well there's some leasing that was done at Deer Springs for example in Las Vegas where this leasing took place in a section of the project which side to face. So we took that out of the gross numbers and so forth. But I think where we are right now as I mentioned---we're much more optimistic there's a lot more activity. People are actually negotiating with you, show willingness to enter into new leases. I do think where the risk is in the junior anchors, because there is a lot of space available on the market. Fortunately for us it's only about 19% of our vacancy in the development portfolio, is greater than 15,000 square feet. So we don't have much exposure there. I think the juniors recognize it, that leverage we're trying to take advantage of where they can. We're not giving much of the way concessions. TIs in particular are up very, very modestly but still less than what we have in the budget. And rents as I can say it is still a function of the strength of the size and where they can do and they will. Well one thing that we are seeing there is an improvement in the development portfolio is that the junior anchors and national retailers are aware that we cannot give the co-tenancies and the lack of opening covenants they used to try to get and now on new projects going forward, we're not seeing that. So it's very positive.
Martin Stein, Jr.: Before Jay, Mary Lou wants to add a comment as it relates to the operating portfolio, I want to say that we're looking at each development on a case by case basis. And where we are giving lower rents today and we think the market's going to -- it's just a temporary dip in the marketplace. We're doing, we are taking shorter term leases. And in a few cases we so to speak produced the rent for longer period of time.
Mary Fiala: Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer:} And Jay, I just to comment, you mentioned the operating portfolio and really tried to explain our philosophy behind lower rent growth, because we've been focused more on occupancy and revenues flowing. And I thought it might be good if I look at a month, just one month, we had six flats that were over 12000 square feet. One was at a strong center in California, Barnes & Noble that we did have a 30% rent reduction, but it's only a 12 month lease. We had another center with Jo-Ann Fabrics that we kept the rents flat and again 12 month lease. But there we had four other leases that are five years, that had anywhere from 8 to 12% increase at rental rate growth. So our philosophy has been in these good centers and good market is to keep the anchors, keep the cash flow and give us 12 months to figure out can we do something with that retailer or do we have guest by this time to replace it. And then in the meantime we think it protects us from our inline tenants to not have that big dark box in there. So our rent growth hasn't been as strong as certainly history has shown, but that's in our philosophy. So we think overall and again they're short-term leases where we have given it. And so I think it's really going to help us going forward.
Jay Habermann - Goldman, Sachs & Co.: And just following on the theme of development I think Brian, you mentioned looking at incremental return on costs. So on page 17 of the supplemental where you show the land held for future development or sale, I guess in cases maybe where the land costs -- certainly that land cost might be lower today if you looked at those investments. Do you still plan to move forward? Do you think with some where you might see returns of say maybe 6 to 8% or it's below your sort of threshold?
Brian Smith: I don't think it will be 6 to 8%, what we did Jay is took a look at the land held. And we think about 30% of that, we can sell and probably come out close to breakeven. The other 70% we would see developing. Of that 70% we kind of looked at and said what would it take to get the land price? How much reduction will it take to land price in order to get those returns, overall to about 10.5%? And it looks like about say 24% is the number we came up with. And then if you look at the incremental return, if you strip out just the land, it's north of 15%, if you subtract out all of the cost to-date, that we've been incurred including pre-development costs, the incremental returns would be up in the 16% range. I don't know if they would stay there, but the fact is that they're going to be highly accretive on a go forward basis.
Jay Habermann - Goldman, Sachs & Co.: Okay, thanks. That's helpful.
Martin Stein, Jr.: And I see -- the projected, once again, projected return on costs, this is the projection even on current -- on total current cost is 9.5% range.
Jay Habermann - Goldman, Sachs & Co.: Great, thanks.
Unidentified Company Speaker: Thanks Jay.
Operator: We'll take the next question from Paul Morgan with Morgan Stanley.
Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley: Good morning. Just to little bit focus more on development pipeline, I mean you had phased a number of the projects that were in some of the housing bust market. And I'm wondering I guess first of all, whether that you basically kind of trimmed down as much as what you've got in development right now, as much as you can and what -- there is lot basically stuff that you have to complete? Or is there more potential? And then on the leasing specifically, are some of these ones that are only 50-60% leased. I mean how long over might there be to co-tenancy triggers and some of those stores that are leased going darker taking out?
Brian Smith: I think the phasing is pretty good. We spent a lot more time on it over the last quarters scrubbing those costs. And so I think what you see right now is about a $125 million worth of costs we've pulled out of the development pipeline process to move to future phases. I don't think you are going to see any more than that, and we'll bring that online as the demand picks up. There are some of the large projects that are not -- have not leased too well in the growth areas. They do have co-tenancy risk most of that we've already seen triggered and are in the numbers. And the other ones we're negotiating with them right now. We'll handle the same way Mary Lou discussed, any concession we give them, we will get something in return, but we do have some exposure on those projects. A handful of the large community centers.
Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley: Okay, and then going to Mary Lou's comment about the short-term leases that you are doing, I mean are those local tenants primarily and what's the typical kind of rent roll down that you're seeing for the short term renewals or the national as well?
Mary Fiala: Paul for the most part, they are all locals. And when we are doing rapidly part of those 22 that we talked about and I think in the last quarter we had 34. So we're actually seeing rent lease going down than what we're getting. But for the most part it's all locals and we're doing 90 day re-lease and then looking at it again. And if I can kind of reiterate what I said the last time, our plan was that we looked at what kind of sales information they have, we expect income statements, credit applications, and then their recovery plan, look at rent to sales ratio and to determine what we think that we can do. We're seeing a decline but it's interesting when you dig into this and look at more specific, in the new leases, there were three deals that we did last quarter, that were anywhere from 30 to 50% down without those, only those three deals we would had a 11.5% increase on new leases. So sometimes, that big number especially on a quarter basis can skew it because there could be a couple of big deals that so -- overall it's very healthy. We're seeing high renewals and we're really minimal rent reductions but where you have a couple of these big deals that really steals the numbers.
Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley: Were they shorter? Were those shorter term deals that you're talking....
Mary Fiala: In every case all those were under a year.
Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Thanks.
Martin Stein, Jr.: Thanks Paul.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Michael Muellerwith with JPMorgan.
Michael Mueller - JPMorgan: Hi I guess maybe it's a question again for Mary Lou, but when you're thinking about 2010 and I knows it's quarters away at this point it seems even longer. But what sort of assumptions are you operating under with respect to occupancy? Do you think occupancy is going to be down on an average year-over-year at this point? Does it feel like? Do you think, it's seems like rent spreads could still be in negative territory. Just wondering what the early read is on '10 at this point?
Mary Fiala: This is -- it's hard. I'll be honest with you. We're seeing it. If I could look at '10 and say everything was stable. And that we didn't have more bankruptcies and second, third, fourth quarter, I sit here saying that I think that occupancy is going to stabilize. And as I touch with them the 10 deals, 15,000 LOIs and assets should come into play in '10 which is a $4 million increase. So, I am thinking at 10 overall. And if you look at year-end, occupancy 10 versus year-end of '09, I think its going to be stable to maybe even slightly positive. I think that rent growth in the second half of '10, you are going to see some really some positive numbers. I think the big question that we are trying to get on arms wrapped around, and trying to plan '10 is what happens to those retailers who are on our watch list and everybody else's and do they declare bankruptcy in third... second, third and maybe even some of fourth quarter. And what does that do to the numbers. So, I wish I could give you. We are working on that. And Hap quite frankly asks me that question pretty much every day. And so, we are working on that to try to get a better handle of that. And if I didn't have that caveat out there, I feel like could sit there and lay out a little bit scenario. But, we're hoping in this next quarter to do a better job get our arms around them, it wouldn't give you better direction.
Martin Stein, Jr.: I will add, Michael, that as Mary Lou indicated earlier, and our current projections, we have incorporated a good amount of what we call a reserve rent plan move outs. Whether its going to be adequate is once again... even as the economy starts stabling out, you could have a continued period of increasing unemployment for the next several quarters. And what impact that's going to have on retailers is just hard to tell. I think that the... what's encouraging to me is it just appears like it doesn't feel like we are anymore going off the edge of the cliff right now. But, that means... and that's to a large extent having that... not going where level of comfort is encouraging. But, it doesn't mean that we're not going to have a number of quarters of slag like in the economy, and then its impact on the shopping center business, even when you've got strong anchors and great locations.
Mary Fiala: I would tell you the things that's most encouraging to me is that we had over million square feet in the first quarter. And that trend I mean, really is still like its continuing. We have a lot of leasing that we're doing. And also as I stated, the rent reductions are all short-term. So, I think its going to impact us probably through '09 and part into '10 and I'm really optimistic.
Michael Mueller - JPMorgan: Okay. Great. And a follow-up for that watch list that you're talking about. Can you give us a sense as to what does that representing in terms of occupancy percentages that a percent of total square footage is it 2%, 3%, or how big is that list?
Mary Fiala: It's not a huge list. It ended up when I looked at it, it ended up taking occupancy down to about another 1% at the most over and above what's in our move out reserves, if everything happened. So that's really ugly. And so obviously, we don't think all of that's going to occur. So, I think that is kind of the negative news. But, that's incorporated in our lower end of the guidance, that's a 92%. So, we feel our guidance covers really all of that, the minus 5 NOI and the 92%.
Michael Mueller - JPMorgan: So the 92% factors that in or its 1% below that?
Mary Fiala: No, no that's it.
Michael Mueller - JPMorgan: Okay. Great, thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Nathan Isbee with Stifel Nicolaus.
Nathan Isbee - Stifel Nicolaus: Yeah, just circling back to the same-store NOI question again. The guidance when originally issued was negative 1 to negative 3.5. You spoke at that time of it being a very conservative look at the portfolio lease bringing spaces. And I guess it's a two part question. I mean are you actually even more pessimistic now than you were two and a half months ago, about the bankruptcies and when you talk about the guidance of occupancy, that hasn't changed even as you take your same-store NOI guidance down, and you've increased...
Mary Fiala: No, what we did is... we adjust the high end of the guidance down from 93.5 to 93. And we think 92 to 93% is the same. And I think the things that have... are we more conservative, Yeah. And some of it has to do with the facts that the move outs. Although, we had a reserve, we are hitting that number. It's definitely... that's the big issue that's occurred as longer lease of time. And the fact that in new leases for the first quarter; we had significantly less leases now. We're seeing some of that is timing. And we are very encouraged in the month of April that we had 476,000 square feet of leasing. So, I'll tell you some of it is timing. It's taking longer to lease out, and move out our current... stronger than we expected. On the flip side we're doing a heck of lot of leasing. But, a lot of our low end of the guidance, absolutely has to do with the fact like I mentioned these bankruptcies that are out there that we are taking into consideration. And you look at them and leasing for them, it happen. And so, some of them, not all of them but some of them. And it is incorporated to in both their low end of NOI and our low end in terms of occupancy.
Nathan Isbee - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. Now, when you've talked about the 92 - 93 at the occupancy at the period end. Is that the lowest it will get during the year, or do you expect it to below?
Mary Fiala: To be honest... I don't see think today that we expected to get is 92.3%. And we think that's was happened in late in second quarter, beginning of third quarter. And that'll be a point in time exit, because that's the lowest percent we think hit this year.
Nathan Isbee - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Alex Barron with Agency Trading Group.
Alex Barron - Agency Trading Group: Yeah, hi. And good morning. I was wondering, as far as the change in occupancy from this quarter to last quarter, how much of that is attributed to small tenants versus larger tenants?
Mary Fiala: Yeah, I just think for the most part 60% of it, it comes from the large tenants, and 40% comes from the smaller tenants. So, that's... it's a blend. But, it's a typical blend of what you see.
Alex Barron - Agency Trading Group: Okay. And then, are you finding basically that as far as the smaller tenants that had... for every one you loose, it's just kind of you are just basically backfilling another one. Is that generally what's happening?
Mary Fiala: I'm not sure exactly. It's just taking longer to fill those spaces. But yeah, we're... and we're doing a lot of things trying to be a little bit more creative, trying to sell those spaces. We have had a focus because our promoter is high quality and our anchors are still performing extremely well across the board. So, when you have this normal path that fails, there are guys around that are now going to be sellers with a retailers, and bringing them in to our reach, our sight as a retailer. But, it's taking longer. And we also have been pretty creative in terms of trying to go after a more service tenants, the dentists and the chiropractors, and spending doing marketing to people who aren't graduating from universities starting their own practice. So, it's just taking more work and it's taking more time.
Alex Barron - Agency Trading Group: Okay. Now, as far as the grocery anchored centers versus the ones that aren't. What typical, if or have you measured what the difference is between occupancy of those centers?
Mary Fiala: I have. If you look at grocery anchored centers, we've been looking at under 125,000 feet. And you look at that and our same-store NOI in those would be a minus 1.4%. Our rent growth would be a positive 1%. And our occupancy would be 93.5%. Then you look at the community centers, our same-store NOI is minus 2.7%, rent growth is 0.8%, and occupancy is 93.1. And then that gives us the total. So, we have looked at that, because I do think, if you look at regions and then you got grocer anchor is high quality. Why... it's really in more of the community centers, and a lot of these big boxes that are taking longer to replace. But again, I'll reiterate, if you look the 15 big spaces that we have available, we got LOIs out there. And the fact is that 31% increase in rents, it's just not going to hit in '09, and it maybe into '010 we probably start seeing the revenue commence.
Martin Stein, Jr.: Now, I just think it's important to note that, yes, the cup is not full. But, the half full portion, when you consider that in the first quarter, we signed a million square feet of leases, 800,000 square feet of renewals, and 200,000 square feet of new leases. And really, our activity in April was an acceleration of what we experienced in the first quarter. Obviously, even as the economy starts bottoming out, there is still going to be some additional fall out. And I think we're incorporating that into our projections.
Mary Fiala: One thing I'd mentioned too is that part of what impacted this quarter was the fact that, in aggregate there were 19 retail bankruptcies in the first quarter. And for those impacted regency, was risk came (ph), Shannon & Company was just discount jewelry store, SNK and everything about water. That was a 1.5 million of revenue on an annual basis. But, that was a 1.5 million of revenue. So, those are the things that... we think those kinds of things that may not take that many retailers. The good news about our portfolio is, we didn't get impacted by all 19, we only got impacted by four, but it still hurt.
Martin Stein, Jr.: And we're inline with that. And our reserve in that so far is covered the bad news to date.
Mary Fiala: Yes.
Operator: We'll take our next question from David Einhorn with Greenlight Capital.
David Einhorn - Greenlight Capital: Yeah. Can you talk a little bit about the temporary rate reductions? Who they're being offered to? How temporary they are? What the amounts might be? And what the policy is? It sounded like last quarter you were sort of resisting that?
Mary Fiala: Well, when you look it, we are resisting it. But, it takes it's kind of like I said, if you look at it, and a couple days examples. The one that I mentioned was the Barnes & Noble. And it's in a really strong center in California. It's a negative 30% fixed days. But, it's only 12 months. And then the JoAnn's which was the flat. And again, it was 12 months. And then rest of them for the most times, we've got a few big bags retailers, the rest of them are a lot of local tenants. And a lot. I mean, but local tenants that we've done in the 90 days and their mid-term leases they are 90 days that we've given the rent release to. And again I think the key is that there were 34 in the fourth quarter and only 22 in the first quarter. So, it's just that our... and our process what's going...
Bruce Johnson: I think you're confusing from what Mary Lou is talking about. She used the Barnes & Noble example, that was at least exploration.
Mary Fiala: Right, right.
Bruce Johnson: It's not... that is not a mid-term risk reduction.
Mary Fiala: So that's mainly a...
David Einhorn - Greenlight Capital: Okay. Only 22 mid...
Mary Fiala: Yeah, only 22 mid-term and some of these are rent at the time. Every time, the bags that I gave you were all renegotiations at time of renewal. Maybe, a little bit of a confusion.
David Einhorn - Greenlight Capital: Right. And what's your annualized amount of rate reduction and how... what is duration of the reduction? And how much has already flown?
Martin Stein, Jr.: We've indicated it was like that it's like in the case Barnes, maybe it was a year or for some of these reductions, the mid-terms are only 90 days.
Mary Fiala: Yeah. All that local rent for 90 days. So, if it's a short-term. Its not...
Unidentified Analyst: Its 22, 3/10ths of 1% of the 7100 tenants.
David Einhorn - Greenlight Capital: Okay.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
David Einhorn - Greenlight Capital: Thanks.
Mary Fiala: Thanks.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Jim Sullivan with Green Street Advisors.
Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors, Inc.: Thanks. I wanted to follow-up on the leverage question that was asked earlier, you talked about a number of different ways to measure leverage one way that you did not mention is debt divided by the market value of your assets. And if we were to use say an 8.75 type cap rate, to value your portfolio, your leverage on that measure is somewhere around 50% plus or minus. And on the Kimco's kind of Mil Cooper (ph) said that the right sort of right leverage level for Kimco as he looks out a couple of years is in the 25% range.
Martin Stein, Jr.: Right.
Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors, Inc.: Is that a number, or is that a target that makes sense for your company? You said, specifically you don't intend to increase leverage, but you didn't say that you specifically intend to reduce it.
Bruce Johnson: Jim, I want to reiterate that I do think that just looking at debt to market cap can be... is not... it has certain flaws. As you may remember, I think in 2007, our debt to market cap was well below 30%.
Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors, Inc.: Yeah. And just to make it clear, I am talking about the debt to the market value of your assets as opposed to...
Bruce Johnson: If were to take Green Street's analysis of what our market value of the assets was at that time I think that the number would've been real close to that number. It would certainly be well below, it would certainly be well below 35%. So, that's number one. So, in mind, or in our mind there's a couple of other metrics that we think or we're going to look at as closely if not more closely than that. And that's a fixed charge coverage ratio and debt to EBITDA using recurring earnings. And I just said that we are comfortable with our current debt level at this point in time. And we'll analyze future opportunities to potentially reduce debt on a cost effective or opportunistic basis in the future.
Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors, Inc.: You want to talk about targets based on the measures that you think are the most appropriate ones?
Bruce Johnson: I would say that, once again, that we're... the debt-to-EBITDA is in fixed range. And that our fixed charge coverage ratio on a recurring earnings standpoint is in the 22 (ph) range. And I think that's within the range. Could those coverage levels get higher? If there's a way to opportunistically do that on a cost effective basis, we would certainly give strong consideration to so.
Operator: We'll take our follow-up question from Quentin Velleley with Citi.
Quentin Velleley - Citigroup: (inaudible). I just want to sort of follow-up on your comment on the current investment essential for more time investment. In terms of at least... are there likely to be new relationships or existing relationships I don't know whether you could give sort of any idea of the quantum of capital sort of assets the basic kind income relationships. And also, whether there is a preference to investment into grocery anchored assets.
Martin Stein, Jr.: I think, number one, Quentin, there is, to your second question, there is a preference to investing in grocery anchored assets. That's also reflected on the mortgage financing side, because of the necessity kind of more stable asset class. And I think that we're seeing that on the investment side. And one of the reasons that we are cautiously optimistic about MCW's ability to execute their plan is, because of interest on grocery anchored shopping centers. And then lastly, I'll say that we are in as anchor, as Bruce has indicated, we are in active discussions with prospective co-investment partners -- doing a co-investment partnership, and I think that the primary interest is on grocery anchored assets.
Quentin Velleley - Citigroup: Is that have -- you are trying to get partners to buy out the existing joint venture or you're finding partners to buy new grocery anchored centers?
Martin Stein, Jr.: I think that you are talking about expanding our co-investment partnerships that would be to -- as we stated is part of our plan that we would like to generate about 100 to $150 million from the sale of an interest in so to speak existing Regency assets to create a new co-investment partnership. And then we also whoever to do that, we would also like to feel that new partner would be a reliable partner on a go forward basis.
Quentin Velleley - Citigroup: Right.
Martin Stein, Jr.: So either continue to, in theory, fund new investments. Either new balance sheet investments that Regency has slash developments, slash take out of that or secondly to make third party acquisitions.
Quentin Velleley - Citigroup: And sort of follow up question, just regarding guidance. At the time of the equity offering, one of the key drivers of the reduction had been an increase in net interest expense going from 12 million to 19 million. And I was curious how much of that is related to a potential bond offering versus higher cap interest, or lower cap interest from the development, not tapping development. That was just one specifically on guidance. And then the other two on guidance was, I think it's just very clear. Your same store NOI is down because your weighted average occupancy for the year is probably down 100 to 150 basis points from your prior guidance because it's taking longer time to leasing your higher move out.
Martin Stein, Jr.: That's correct.
Quentin Velleley - Citigroup: So that's what you sort of verify that. And then the last thing on guidance was just on the transaction profits, the 15 to 20 million effectively with 4 million booked. And I think you had anticipated about 12 million mcguire (ph) promote in the third quarter. Is that effectively how you get, four plus twelve gives you the 16 so just some...
Martin Stein, Jr.: The answer is yes on that. Yes on the lower average occupancy and it is lower capitalized interest. Almost 100% of that.
Operator: Okay. The next question from Chris Lucas with Robert W. Baird and Company.
Christopher Lucas - Robert W. Baird & Co.: Good morning everyone. Just a quick follow up question on the watch list. Mary Lou, just your thought process how much sort of percentage wise of that watch list would be a Chapter 7 versus Chapter 11 risk?
Mary Fiala: It's hard to say but if I look at it, I think there's probably just a three Chapter 7 and the rest of them would be 11.
Christopher Lucas - Robert W. Baird & Co.: And then Bruce, a quick detailed question on bad debt expense for the quarter?
Bruce Johnson: Your question is?
Christopher Lucas - Robert W. Baird & Co.: How much was it?
Bruce Johnson: It's been running about same bad debt expense -- it's been running pretty much of where we've been for the last year. And I just want to reiterate rate of the bag debt expense, watch list et cetera that in our projections we have incorporated what we think is a reasonable estimate for reserve for unplanned move-outs, whether that reserve and we think it's going to be adequate. And just we tried in a very limited team trying to incorporate that into our projections. This is the best I can.
Mary Fiala: What we do want to do is every quarter staying back and have a number, if we took our first quarter and even if we want to look at last year and then we came back and revise it. We don't want to get these bankruptcies -- this happens. And we put as a pricing in a downward guidance. So, we literally took the whole year, laid back and said what could happen if we get what we felt was reasonable and potentially probable.
Christopher Lucas - Robert W. Baird & Co.: Is there a number for the first quarter?
Mary Fiala: What do you mean, is there a number?
Christopher Lucas - Robert W. Baird & Co.: What was the bad debt expense for the quarter?
Unidentified Company Speaker: In line with what we had last year.
Mary Fiala: Well, because I don't think we know that exactly, I'll get back to you.
Christopher Lucas - Robert W. Baird & Co.: That's fine, okay.
Unidentified Company Speaker: That was added to our reserve, the first quarter was $500,000. Your question is how much we pulled off of that, I guess.
Christopher Lucas - Robert W. Baird & Co.: Correct. Okay, that's fine. I'll talk to Lisa offline.
Mary Fiala: Okay, thanks.
Christopher Lucas - Robert W. Baird & Co.: Thank you.
Unidentified Company Speaker: Thanks Chris.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Jim Sullivan with Green Street Advisors.
Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors, Inc.: Wanted to follow-up on that bankruptcy issue. Lou can you comment on the bankruptcies that have occurred so far and the pace relative to your expectation?
Mary Fiala: As I said, that the four bankruptcies that affected us so far were with camera but that's also with camera and photo as well, to date owned by the same entity, same company S&K and everything but water. The ones that were incorporated into our prime quite frankly, as we thought the risk was going to happen, then we really bought the Shade company was the S&K and everything but water, we didn't have that incorporated into our plan. It doesn't mean it's kind of go back and okay, we need to sit down and really look at this and see what's out there, where do we think our risk is, and who do we think to the question, and you got to balance this in terms of sharing information with respect to our retailers, but which ones do we think are really going to go to Chapter 7, how does that impact and which ones are going to go 11, and then which then go property-by-property, space-by-space and go to 11, which ones do we think are going to be either renegotiated balance down-sized or rejected and let that out. So, that's the process that -- it was big process this quarter going through that.
Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors, Inc.: And as you do look forward, what's your expectation as to what the key trigger will be on putting those on your watch list actually into bankruptcy, is it looming debt maturities of these retailers out of the corporate level? Is it your concern that you're going to have trouble perhaps securing inventory financing as it gets towards the middle of the year or is it the expectation of continued deterioration in their operating fundamental?
Mary Fiala: Yeah, I mean, I'll tell you in every case it starts with deterioration in operating fundamentals. And then when you start looking at somebody's cash in the balance sheet it's really they have problems. So you're looking at deteriorating fundamentals, problems on their balance sheet and you sit down and go okay, do they have a plan and this is where I think it's great having the people obviously working with those. And I think we'll get more color even after I see after that, we can share with some in their rate, what is their plan to turn their operating fundamentals? And is it a solid one or if they don't have a plan and they have just this, that's going to repatriate where we think they're going to end that. So it's a work in progress but it all starts in everyone at least -- starts with cooperating fundamentals.
Unidentified Company Speaker: But I'll also say it's important note that retailers aren't sitting back and assuming that all of a sudden the operating environment is going to get any better and they are taking significant and meaningful measures to be able to in effect survive and even go cash flow positive in today's low sales levels.
Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors, Inc.: Thank you.
Unidentified Company Speaker: Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Michael Collin with Aerohawk (ph) Capital.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Sort of a little bit of philosophical question or maybe if you could talk about the rationale that went in sizing the offering at the level that it was sized, it would seem to me that given sort of the availability of capital right now and the window that's opened, I might have chosen a more conservative approach in terms of raising many multiples of what you've raised in the context of one, it delevers you, two it provides liquidity and three if the world turns out to be okay, it gives you the flexibility to put for capital to work when a lot of the private real estate begins to move its way back to the market, and be sort offset if you will. So it helps you defensively and offensively it would be the way I would I think about it. How did you think about it and why didn't you do more?
Unidentified Company Speaker: There were a lot of considerations there, I think what we wanted do was to make basically number one address a significant, very significant portion of our capital requirements through 2012, that was number one issue that we looked at. Secondly, we didn't totally take out the ball on two other issues. Number two, we felt like we were able to raise capital, if you look at our analyst views of what the implied cap rate was on a minimally diluted or maybe even accretive basis to our per share NAV. Thirdly we did look at overall dilution and we felt that we could accomplish what we accomplished. It was a multi pronged approach. Remember Michael we raised, I think that the reduction in the dividend through the current $6 million of committed mortgage financing through the equity offering and through where we think we're going to be able achieve the sale to the co-investment partnership. I think the number is $700 million and I think that it puts the balance sheet in good shape and I think that we're positioned, we feel that we still have all of those elements. We still have a close to $3 billion unencumbered pool available to us. We have on balance sheet opportunities available to us and to the extent they are compelling opportunities. We can finance those in a way and they may be done in the way that will further enhance the balance sheet over time.
Unidentified Analyst: Right, I mean I guess that's a little bit mixing issues in terms of liquidity and capital levels, but just in terms of any desire to kind of de-leverage the balance sheet you could sort of de-lever at certain point if the world decides 50% is not the right level and it might be 52 or something like that, that gives you the flexibility when maybe some of the distressed sellers come to market. How did you weigh that opportunity in your equation?
Unidentified Company Speaker: Well, what we did was we felt regard our balance sheet in a very comfortable position and I will say that in 35 years that I've been in the business, there has never been a position where somebody with the balance sheet of where Regency is today where you were in a position to raise capital, to take advantage of compelling opportunities. And we feel comfortable that we can pull a modest amount of offense today and to the extent that they are compelling opportunities of larger scale will be in the position to take advantage of those in the future.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Chris Summers with Greenlight (ph).
Unidentified Analyst: Hey guys, I just wanted to talk about some of the lease tenant improvement trends. I know this in the quarter that, on the new leases tenant improvements picked up quite a bit. And if I subtract that from the base rents looks like rents fell to the ballpark of like 22% from the fourth quarter. Is that trend kind of continuing and is that the right way to think about this?
Mary Fiala: Well let me talk about TIs to begin with. We had one deal this quarter which was grocery Delphos (ph) and without that one deal it would be $1.47. So it is we are really seeing that TIs are going to be right in line with historical levels maybe a little higher but not much.
Unidentified Analyst: Say $1.70 that's when you divide...
Mary Fiala: $1.47 without that one deal. So...
Unidentified Analyst: And now if you were to annualize it as opposed to...
Mary Fiala: I'm not understanding what you're asking.
Unidentified Analyst: So the tenant improvements in the quarter on new leases was like $18.31?
Unidentified Company Speaker: I believe so.
Mary Fiala: No, $1.47
Unidentified Analyst: That's a one deal.
Unidentified Company Speaker: Right but on the new leases. Was that a new lease or renewal lease?
Mary Fiala: That was a new lease.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it.
Mary Fiala: Okay.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay and then, all right. I thank you.
Operator: And we have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn it back over to Hap Stein for any additional comments.
Martin Stein, Jr.: Again we appreciate your time and interest in Regency and wish that you enjoy the rest of week and have a great weekend. Thank you very much.
Operator: That does concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good morning. My name Cynthia and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Regency Centers Corporation Fourth Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer period. (Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn the conference to Lisa Palmer, Senior Vice President, Capital Markets. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Cynthia and good morning everyone. On the call this morning are Hap Stein, Chairmen and CEO; Mary Lou Fiala, Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer; Bruce Johnson, CFO; Brian Smith, President and Chief Investment Officer; Chris Leavitt, Senior Vice President and Treasurer and Jamie Shelton, Vice President of Real Estate Accounting. Before we start, I'd like to address forward-looking statements that may be addressed on the call. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results, may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. I'd like to turn the call over to Bruce to discuss the pending accounting resolutions regarding the timing of recognition of gains. Bruce?
Bruce M. Johnson: Thank you, Lisa. The recent distribution and kind of properties resulting from the dissolution of two entities in our partnerships with Macquarie CountryWide raised question under FAS 66 regarding when partial gains from sales of properties to current investor partnerships should be recognized. Regency's auditor, KPMG has historically agreed with the company's application of FAS 66 in accounting for these gains. However, due to the absence of any controlling in the coming literature, at KPMG's request, reasons that you will see guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding this question. Regency historically has recognized gains on the sale of properties to co-investment partnerships at the closeting date excluding that portion attributable to its percentage interest in the partnership. If the partnership subsequently sold the property to a third party, Regency then recognize the gain on the portion of the property attributable to its remaining ownership interest. The question is or isn't whether Regency's rights under certain JV agreements, that allow Regency to call for a liquidation of the entity. And in so doing, receive a distribution and kind of the properties owned by the partnerships are in fact an option to re-acquire the properties. If these rights are deemed to be options then all partial gains previously recognized by Regency on the sale of properties that are still owned by these partnerships would be deferred until such time the partnership is liquidated or the property is sold to a third party. To the extent that any such partnership's subsequently sold a property during the period in question, the deferred gain will be recognized at the resale date. While you can read the details of the potential adjustments in our press release, the bottom line is, that regardless of the accounting treatment, there is absolutely no impact whatsoever on Regency's cash position or the inherent value of the company's assets and liabilities. Additionally, the company is well within compliance on all loan covenants with our bank line and our public debt. Our intent is to disclose the results of our compliance to extravagates related to this debt shortly on our website. I will now turn the call over to Hap for his introductory comments.
Martin "Hap" Stein, Jr.: Thanks Bruce. As everyone is acutely aware, the economy has deteriorated further since our last call. The deepening recession with declining retail sales and a meaningful reduction in demand for space has made the environment for operating shopping centers much more difficult. While it seems that the financial markets have avoided collapse, and are thought a little before capital which is so important to the real estate industry, has been reduced from a flight to a trek (ph) and the cost is much more expensive. Since the beginning of last year I believe cap rates for A-quality shopping centers have moved from approximately 6% to 8% with a corresponding decrease in values of at least 25% and by even more for lower quality shopping centers and portfolios. Regency's operating portfolio, our developments and our capital recycling, have obviously not been immune to the decline in asset values and the slowdown in tenant leasing. The cumulative impacts were particularly harsh as evidenced by the $50 million write-down of operating properties, developments, land and pre-closing cost. For the first time in the 15 years that Regency has been a public company, we have not made met earnings expectations. They disappoint. At the same time, I am extremely proud of several noteworthy accomplishments and the detainment (ph) of these as a testament of inherent strengths of our companies especially given the tough conditions. The successes include; achieving nearly 94% occupancy in the operating portfolio while increasing rents by over 10%. The 2.6% growth in same-property NOI represents the 10th consecutive year of growth greater than 2.5%. The expansion of Regency's bank facilities by more than 50% to $941 million. In December Moody's and S&P reaffirmed our investment grade ratings, at BAA2 and BBB plus. These are clear evidence of the strength of Regency's balance sheet and the careful steps that were undertaken to manage resources and uses of crisis capital. The sale of over $400 million of operating properties developments and outparcels produced almost $300 million in net proceeds, including 47 million in the fourth quarter. Regency also placed $250 million of mortgages, $102 million of which were funded in the fourth quarter and $43 million which came at the end of December. A $20 million promote was earned from the co-investment partnership with Oregon with a return of almost 14% since the infection (ph) almost eight years ago, outperforming the NCREIF index by more than 120 basis points. Gross G&A cost were $20 million less than original plan and over $10 million less than 2007. In spite of being negative, which is now so is (ph) Regency's total shareholder returns significantly exceeded and NCREIF shopping center index in 2008. So let me now turn to the future in share with you my thoughts on how Regency will weather combined financial and economic storms which show no signs of letting up any time soon. As a matter of fact it appears that the economy will continue weaken which will further dampen tenant demand and accelerate pressure on rents and store closings. First and foremost, preserving the balance sheet and funding future capital commitments will remain the top priority. While fully recognizing the uncertainty of the world today, hopefully after Bruce's review you will share my cautious optimizing about our ability to fund these commitments, which in assets fall into three buckets. First; balance sheet maturities, second; little maturities in our co investment partnerships, and third cost to complete in-process developments. Regency's necessity-oriented high-quality portfolio should hold up to the downturn relatively well. Fortunately as Mary Lou will describe, in spite of the portfolio's recession-resistant attributes, it will not be immune to the impact, I wish, returning into a pretty nasty recession. As you will hear, we are projecting net operating income to decline for the first time in over ten years. Regarding leasing out developments, I do want to point out there is a silver lining here. In that the significant amount of emphatic growth that we'll realize over the next several years as leasing has increased from 75% to 95% and the returns grow to over 8% from the current 5.9%. As Brian will explain, Regency's development program has been retooled and slowed. Tank full cuts are being made to enable Regency to forward the development program during these lean times while still maintaining adequate muscle through in prospects improved as the recession finally ends. There is little doubt that retailers will not return to prior growth levels for the foreseeable future. This means that the new norm will mean fewer opportunities. At the same time, it seems that the number of competitors will be even more dramatically less. Land prices will be significantly lower and Regency should be in an enviable position as one of the few viable developers, retailers and land sellers. With lower levels of development and leasing activities, there'll also be meaningful savings and the operations in corporate support areas. The necessary measures are being taken throughout the company to make sure that the organization is right sized in the current environment. Keeping our team fully engaged and not compromising Regency's special culture, remained challenging top priorities. The bottom line is given that the projected reduction in same-property NOI, lower development gains and fees, higher net G&A as result of lower capitalization of development overhead, and lower capitalization of carried cost due to lower level of development starts in phasing, we are expecting FFO per share to be in the range of $3.30 to $3.70. While the dividend coverage at this level is well below what we like to see, today our intent is to continue to pay the dividend of $2.90. While I feel strongly that cash dividends are integral and important parts of the rate and Regency's models, in this environment the sustainability of the dividend and all the need for capital should be and will be rigorously monitored. As many of you saw in our earnings release, Mary Lou shared with us her desire to retire at the end of 2009 to spend more time with her family. It's with very mixed emotions that I announce here succession plan. Mary Lou has made an extraordinary contribution to building Regency and the great company it is today. As is her style, Mary Lou wants to make certain that we have enough lead time to allow for smooth transition. Many of you have asked; who will be the next COO? In light of the current operating environment, Mary Lou has agreed to continue as Chief Operating Officer and now Vice Chairman, until the end of 2009 and longer if needed so we will announce the COO's succession when appropriate. Although, effective immediately Brian Smith will become President. Mary Lou will clearly be difficult to replace but we're fortunate to have a skilled Executive right in our amidst, a Regency veteran, someone with deep experience in the shopping center business and an understanding of the unique culture that defines and differentiates Regency. It was an easy decision for me with the Board's strong endorsement to cap Brian as our next President. In addition to his new role, Brian will retain his Chief Investment Officer responsibilities. The board also elected him as a director. In addition, Mary Lou will remain on Regency's Board after her retirement ensuring our continued access to our unique retail expertise and ongoing council. I'm also announcing today that Bruce Johnson has been named Executive Vice President of Regency Centers. While this elevated title recognizes the vital contributions as a top executive Bruce has made over the years, his wise and experienced leadership has been particularly valuable as we have navigated the difficulties in the financial markets and economy over the last 12 months or so. Through the years, Regency has built a great company with an outstanding deep and experienced management team that will be able to not only work through the current downing challenges but also position the company for the future. Mary Lou?
Mary Lou Fiala: Thank you, Hap and good morning. Let me start by saying, I just as you know I absolutely loved Regency and I clearly loved the team that I've worked with and will continue to work with. And I've enjoyed helping build such a wonderful company. And although I have announced my retirement, I plan on going full force to this transition. I'm truly excited that Brian is my replacement as the President. We've always been proud of our jobs of management and his promotion is a true testament not only to Regency but more importantly to Brian. He has strong leadership skills and his clear vision that'll enable us to lead, to help lead Regency through this challenging time. So, let's begin with this year's results. Occupancy, for the quarter was, from 95.3% in third quarter to 93.8% in the fourth quarter or a 50 basis points decline. But within that, there is some good news. 64,000 feet (ph) of that was in Albertsons while in fourth quarter we've achieved a $2.5 million termination fee and in the next year weeks, we will have a grocer signed up to replace the Albertsons with significant upside in rent. We also lost 3 million (ph) and things for 90,000 square feet and then while we're in final negotiations with replacement tenant and again there is upside in rent and the other two, we have excellent process. So, this shows the strength of our portfolio despite what's going on in the markets. In 2008, rental growth was over 10.5% and our same-store growth was 2.6%, 1.9% if you exclude termination fees. And we leased over 4.7 million square feet of space in the operating portfolio and another million in our development. So, we should just take a moment and enjoy these remarkable results. But, what a difference 90 days make! Here (ph) in general cannot predict their sales trends, they cannot appropriately plan inventory levels and G&A. And our overall goal is like everybody else, is to protect our balance sheet by reducing cost. First and foremost G&A, then inventory and third, real estate. So, what does this mean for Regency? Well grocery-anchor (ph) over 80% of our centers have seen sales increases in 2008 of 4%. And three of our largest significant tenants are drug stores whose sales are up over 5%. And necessity driven retail has help up in the past recessions much better than other different product type. And this is to be true for Regency's predominantly grocery-anchored high-quality portfolio, which is expected to continue to soundly perform. Evidenced by the fact that Regency's actions here over the last nine years has averaged 95.2%, which is almost a 400 basis point higher than the average actions of (ph) shopping centers in an acreage database. With that said, we are not immune to the market conditions. The retailers are struggling and honestly the consumers just flat out, isn't spending money. And given these circumstances we expect same-store analyze to be at minus 3.5 to minus 1%, or flat to minus 2.5% excluding termination fee. And rent growth to be flat to up 5% in 2009. This decline is driven by an expected decrease in average access fee and lower termination fee. And we think these assumptions are reasonable that times like this, environment life changes everyday and our plan is to push as hard as we can. Like all landlords, Regency is being receiving request to rentals assistance from a great number of tenants. And I don't see our answer as no. But for anybody who is stronger right now but those exceptions there is a few people that we've made exception for. But either with that, we have a fair but rigorous process that's implemented consistently throughout our portfolio. We request three years of sales information, income statements, credit applications, the recovery plan and determine events to sales ratio. We are currently using a national chalk lift (ph) and look at these requests phase-by-phase and tenant-by-tenant. And when we go through this process with the three quarters of our tenants don't even know its fine. Any reduced rent is deferred and not forgiven, at least right from (ph) straight from the tenant giving us full control over the space. Now out of approximately 9,000 tenants we've granted readily just 37 over the past one month and in 28 of these cases, we are able to extend term of the lease. These are reported in our fourth quarter results as renewals and the reduced rent is already incorporated into the renewals and growth calculation. There is some good new out there. Some of the end mind (ph) tenants are still performing well. As we all know, moderate priced restaurants such as McDonalds and Subway are doing great and some other retailers are expanding in our portfolio like massage and game stop. Making deals with tenants like these as well as relocating the best retailers out of our competitors properties are lower quality B&C properties and putting them to a Regency Center allowing that retailer to upgrade their space as well as have better result, is of primary focus of the operations came in 2009. We must maintain occupancy in our operating properties and increase expertise (ph) in our developments by continuing to concentrate our marketing to our PCI retailers, our brokers and our local tenants in competing centers. The economy is having a negative effect across the country. But with that said, we are seeing strong occupancy and solid land growth in the Bay area, the Pacific Northwest, southern California. What is important to note, that the vast majority of our operating properties are in the coastal in-field markets, as well as the Mid-Atlantic and the Carolinas. And even though Florida and the Northeast had a solid '08, we are starting see some pressure on occupancy in those markets. The Mid-West and Georgia have been tougher markets for those, where we have already experienced some deterioration in occupancy. Although, we do not expect to be immune from these economic forces that are affecting the retailers, but the quality of our portfolio, our strategy and our team, should ensure that we'll make it through these difficult times, relatively unscathed. Brian?
Brian M. Smith: Thank you, Mary Lou, and good morning. I have read with interest many of the research reports over the last 12 hours or so, including your flattering comments about Mary Lou. And I could not agree more. When you think of falling in Mary Lou's enormous shoes, no one can replace her, and I'm fortunate she will be here to help me along the way. In the fourth quarter, we started two new developments totaling $24 million. Let me briefly talk about them, because they represent the kinds of opportunities that make sense, even in today's environment, where any new development should be and are being undertaken cautiously if at all. Northgate is a small curve (ph) anchored neighborhood center in Greeley, Colorado, with the return in excess of 11%. Central flosin (ph) is a grocery-anchored project in urban Los Angeles, with limited shops that we have been working on for more than a decade. Although only considered to start this quarter, the project is nearly 60% pre-leased, and we have presale agreement in place, that provides for an approximate 20% profit margin. In addition, we began the second phase of our coal paper development, where we will be building a 68,000 square foot giant of Carlyle grocery concept. This additional development adds a full service grocer to the original project, without taking on any entitlement or leasing risk, while achieving better than the 10% return. Carlyle is one of the grocers doing great right now, having recently reported a 5.4% comp store increase and should provide significant boost to foot traffic incentive. We completed two developments during the quarter totaling $25 million, with returns of 11.46 before JV participation and 9.1% after. For the year, our completions totaled $121 million with a weighted average return on cost of 10.68% before participation and 10.3% after. Of the projects under construction, we are presently 78% funded, with 85% leasing committed. The current return on end process projects at the end of 2008 was approximately 6%. In other words, if we didn't lease another space but completed construction on all the phase I space, our return will be 6%. Our projections are that this will increase to 6.7% by the end of 2009, inclined at about 8% in the next few years. Going forward, we remain mindful that capital is precious, and all investments will be viewed in the context of the balance sheet. We may decide to pursue a few select compelling acquisitions and development opportunities, which may involve land already owned, commitments to key customers or a distressed seller. Return and profit margin guidelines have been increased after underwriting standards are in place. We've said before there will be extraordinary opportunities available to companies with strong balance sheets and the expertise to take advantage of them. Already, we are evaluating several distressed situations that we can take advantage of. We are able to structure them so as to greatly reduce risk in ways we've not seen in 20 years. Let me give you some examples of what we are seeing. In Southern California, we are working on an opportunity to develop a project in a very dense end-filed market with 460,000 people within three miles. Even in this environment, the retailers are all over opportunities to open stores in tense markets like this. As the average spending per consumer drops, the retailer needs more bodies to provide the same purchasing power in sales volume and these kinds of locations provide that. This opportunity, like others, is a result of the developer's inability to perform and we are working with the lender on a $10 million reductions in loan amount. Project is fully entitled with the best-in-class anchor retailers, all of which are signed. Given it is our ability to say, there are backup anchors for every space. There is limited amount of shop space, and it's already 77% leased. Also in California, we made an offer at a bankruptcy auction to buy a 70,000 square foot building, in a terrific location with only 22,000 square feet of occupancy. Our offer was for $1 million, with $14 per build able foot ... per building foot. Being the only bidder, our offer was accepted, although the bankruptcy judge ultimately decided to take it back to auction again, which we are awaiting. Even without leasing up the vacant 48,000 square feet, this acquisition revealed a 25% return in costs. I use these examples to illustrate that there are great opportunities out there, and more are sure to come, given the dearth of competition. When considering distressed acquisitions and development opportunities, we need a team that's ready to pounce. But to reiterate once more, these opportunities no matter how good, will not be undertaken at the expense of the balance sheet. As for future developments, we dramatically reworked and reduced development pipeline this quarter, as conditions deteriorated. As a result this reduction, we wrote-off over $15 million of pursuit cost in 2008. The total amount of remaining at risk dollars that controls the entire pipeline of projects is now only $3.4 million. Other remaining pipeline more than half the projects involved land that we already own, and we will move in the production when appropriate. It's important to remember that any development we will do will involve on the top anchors with a 100% pre-leasing of those anchors, and significant pre-releasing of shop space. Before -- let me briefly elaborate on Hap's comments regarding cap rates. With so few transactions out there, it's difficult to gauge values in the current market. The MCW sale at inland could be used as a comp, but clearly such a large portfolio carries a significant discount in today's capital constrained environment. Retail Capital Analytics says, the strip center of cap rates for the fourth quarter averaged 7.4% so, that's another data point. As for more recent comps, I am aware of only three retail centers having traded in the first quarter. Our own Regency Village public anchor center closed at 7.41% cap rate or right about where Retail Capital Analytics take the average cap rates. Another public center in Florida closed at 7.8% cap rate. And just this Tuesday, our community center in Chino, California traded at 6.0%. In short, there are too few transactions to provide a definitive measure of current cap rates by these things some conclusions can be drawn from these examples. First, big is bad, and large portfolios will trade at significant discounts, particularly if distressed is involved. Second, one-off sales for quality assets are probably in the 8% range with some trading lower, significantly lower in the case of the Genoa project I mentioned, while others can trade higher. Third, financing is key to any acquisition today, and only the better quality centers can get financing. Bruce?
Bruce M. Johnson: Thank you, Brian. Although funds from operations of $3.75 per share were significantly less than our objective in last year, these results were accomplished in an unfavorable development and sales environment, and after $50 million of dead deal costs and impairments. The components of the $50 million were, as Brian indicated; $15 million of dead deal costs as we retooled the development pipeline, and $35 million of impairments, comprised of $19 million of operating properties, $7.5 million on one in-process development, and one land held for future development, $6 million on investments in unconsolidated partner shifts, and the remainder on our appraisals and our note receivable. I think it's important to note that the impairment calculations where based upon what we believe to be conservative assumptions. We are expecting FFO per share in 2009 to be in the range of $3.30 to $3.70. Last quarter, we indicated that FFO would be approximately $0.60 higher than this. Since last quarter, we have significantly reduced our expectations for the development program. And as a result, the revised guidance includes lower development gains, $12 million of higher net interest expense, and higher G&A, $8 million higher than ' 08, and $14 million higher than last quarter's guidance. Also, in this range is further reduced same-store NOI. As you've heard from Hap and Brian, our business plan comes full circle back to balance sheet management. We cannot say it enough that strengthening and protecting the balance sheet is our number one focus and priority. We have updated the detailed scenario analysis, available as an excel file on our website, entitled Balance Sheet Capacity. And I will walk you through the major components. Referring back to Hap's remarks of future capital commitments; number one, was balance sheet loan maturities. During the next three years, balance sheet maturities total $725 million, with only 235 million expiring by the end of 2010. We believe these needs can be funded by placing mortgages on Regency's unencumbered assets which generate $250 million of NOI and $3 billion of estimated value. Modest sized mortgage loans and quality shopping centers sponsored by highly regarded operators like Regency, seems to be one of the sweat spots for mortgage lenders. We have excellent relationships with lenders as evidenced by our placement of over $215 million of debt at a weighted average interest rate of just under 6.3% in 2008. And we are currently reviewing applications from two live companies for 10-year mortgage loans on core properties totaling $47 million. The interest rates, range from 6.75% to 7% with loan-to-value ratios in the 50% range. The second bucket is loan maturities in our core investment partnership. Regency's share of mortgages maturing during the next three years in our partnerships is $297 million. Assuming conservative underwritings, Regency's share of these loan pay downs in order to refinance would be in the $100 million range. Also critical to these loans being extended or refinanced is our majority partners' ability to fund its share. On this front, good progress is being made by Macquarie Countrywide to most of their balance sheet. We agreed to dissolve two of our original core investment entities which resulted in the portfolio as is been distributed to the partners through a one-for-one selection process. This distribution and comp process allow us to select half of the first 12 picks from the portfolio. As a result, we received six quality shopping centers with some favorable mortgages. It is ironic that this extremely favorable term is causing us some conformation with the accounting policies. In addition, we will receive a promote of approximately 11 to $13 million which is based on year-end 2008 appraisals. In time, the distribution allows Macquarie Countrywide, the flexibility to generate cash through the sale of properties distributed to them. Macquarie Countrywide has since closed on the sale of seven properties to Inland. The balance is expected to be closed at the end of the first quarter with a total value to Macquarie Countrywide of approximately $425 million and generating almost $200 million in equity capital for them. Macquarie Countrywide has publicly announced that it is actively working to raise additional capital through assets and entity transactions. Finally, the third bucket is cost to complete the in-process developments and committed new investments. Two phasing process, that Brain discussed, the net cost to complete the in-process developments have been reduced to $186 from $241 million since last quarter. As indicated, this additional phasing has resulted in negative impacts on net interest expense. As I mentioned, we believe that $825 million of balance sheet in partnership refinancing and commitments can be funded by placing mortgages on Regency's unencumbered assets. You should know that our plan is to stay well ahead and proactively begin this process now. It's also important for you to remember, that we have over $600 million of capacity on our line today, which alone could fund all of our commitments over the next two years and the cost to complete the developments even if we are unable to raise capital from asset sales or contribution through ventures. Hap?
Martin "Hap" Stein, Jr.: Thanks, Bruce, Brian and Mary Lou. In summary, in these extraordinary times the near-term impaired is clear, protect the balance sheet, achieve 95% occupancy in our operating and development portfolios, rationalize the development program, operate efficiently and keep the team energized to emerge from these difficult times in strong financial shape. Longer term, be poised to capitalize on compelling future acquisition and development opportunities which will be available from distressed sellers. In spite of the downing challenges I am confident that we can achieve these goals and emerge from the tsunami, while not unscathed, in much better shape than others. The reasons alluded in to my face and Regency's inherent assets, strong balance sheet, a quality recession resistant operating portfolio, industry leading operating systems, excellent tenant, lender and partner relationships, value creating investment capabilities, and especially a superb team of dedicated professionals to have really earning your rights. At this point in time, we appreciate your time, and we'll now are going to answer questions that you may have.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Stein. (Operator Instructions). We will take our first question from Michael Bilerman with Citi. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning, guys. This is Frank Milali (ph) I am here with Michael. Just a first question you were asking to give 2009 guidance for same-store NOI. I'm just wondering, if you can outline what your expectation are for occupancy leasing spreads in any level of rent assistance that you've got factored in?
Mary Lou Fiala: Yeah, let me ... you can go through the guidance page where we have all that other broken down, in terms of that with occupancy. We said it would be 92 to 93.5%. Rent growth would be 0 to 5%. If you are confused, you can get it all off the guidance page.
Unidentified Analyst: So does rent rise includes some kind of rent assistance allowance?
Mary Lou Fiala: Yes, absolutely. It's all incorporated, and what we believe will happen in '09.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay.
Mary Lou Fiala: We've built that into our budget.
Martin “Hap” Stein, Jr.: And Quentin remember, as just Mary Lou said, there have been approximately 30, only 30 cases where we have ... 37, where we have at the out of 9,000 tenants, where we have redone leases. And in one of those cases, we are getting lease extensions.
Mary Lou Fiala: And let me just tell you say real quickly, as far as the primary drivers of NOI and the declines, as you know, we had strong termination fees and so and put that in there that we would see flat to minus 2.5% without being up against those termination fees to being a more normalized rate. Secondly, quite frankly we planned higher move outs. We think that there is going to be a more of big vast move out, and monotype. Typically, it's been like 45% big backs in line, and we've laid that into our budget too. So we've been, we've feel realistic but probably very conservative in terms of our approach for looking at 2009.
Unidentified Analyst: Just in terms of the development pipeline. The return expectations comes down from the third quarter. I am just wondering, if you can outline some of the drivers that that intend, what rents getting and what you are assuming for late, and costs spending in circles?
Bruce Johnson: The development returns, if you look at the in-process portfolio in the supplement, you will see that they were down 71 basis points before JV partner participation and 68 after. 44 basis points of that total was attributable to the phasing we're doing. We've got 11 projects where we are ... we decided that we just do not want to build that certain amount of square footage today and we've pushed that out into the future now. As Hap mentioned, there is going to be some pretty good embedded growth in that. The phase II returns of stuff, we're not going to build now but we'll push out later. We have a return of, and right now it's performing at 12.1%. So obviously, to take the most profitable parts of the business out of the developments and push it out, it's going to impact you're Phase I that we're building.
Martin “Hap” Stein, Jr.: So you've got the cost, but not the land cost and a lot of the site work cost there.
Unidentified Analyst: Right.
Martin “Hap” Stein, Jr.: But, not the turn.
Bruce Johnson: So if you take out the phasing, then you're really left with an apples-to-apples comparison from last quarter of about a 24 basis point reduction and 10 of those basis points were attributable to one project and that's our big Deer Springs project in Las Vegas, where we lowered our rent to our NOI estimates by 800,000. And then 4 basis points is our Marietta (ph) project in California, where the project is basically been delayed a year.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thanks.
Mary Lou Fiala: Thanks Quentin.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Steve Sakwa with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Steve Sakwa - Bank of America: Good morning, thank you. I guess just following up on that, I guess, it sounds like most of the delay is due to phasing and two projects. But I guess why wouldn't rent be coming down on the balance of the developments? And why would that have I guess a bigger impact on the returns on the development side?
Martin “Hap” Stein, Jr.: First of all, severance number 70 ... they're 78% leased right now, keep that in mind.
Bruce Johnson: Right. And as I mentioned that 24 basis point apple-to-apple ten of it is attributable to other projects that have had leasing shortfalls.
Steve Sakwa - Bank of America: And Brian, can you, I guess help us quantify or think about what is 10 basis point, is that sort of a 5 to 10% reduction in kind of asking rents for the balance of the space or something less or something greater?
Brian Smith: I'll break it out for you. If you look at the actual NOI variance, it's about $16.9 million. Of that 16.9 million, 15.2 of it was pushed out with NOI was pushed out in the phasing. Of the remaining amount, the 1.7 million, you got again half of it, 800,000 came with your Deer Springs project and then about 500,000 came from two other Southern California large community projects. So it's really what's happening is we built too much space on some of the large projects and we've reduced that. The other thing that has happened is we changed the scope on lot of the projects. For example, we've got a project in Southern California where we had LA Fitness and we decided we did not want to do a lease with them. We ended up selling the parcel to them, let them spend their money. There's obviously a reduction NOI that goes with that. So, I don't think it's the rent have been dialed down too much I think we've done that in the past. It's more that's changes scope in phasing plus the big projects, particularly in Southern California.
Steve Sakwa - Bank of America: Okay. And then if I can maybe ask a question to Bruce on the guidance, when you talked about I guess the Promote, just to be clear on this, unwinding of the Macquarie partnerships you have recognized I guess you are getting up extra property or so in time, but you're going to also recognize kind of the one time fee?
Bruce Johnson: That is correct.
Steve Sakwa - Bank of America: Okay. And then just in terms of the fee?
Bruce Johnson: If I can speak before you ask that question, just a little bit of clarification maybe on Brain. Because I think what we really are seeing to extent to our revenue reductions in the government area, it's really on a geographical market basis, it's not across the board. We're not seeing that across the board. I think Deer Springs would be the one that we did have that and which is in Las Vegas. But it wouldn't be across the board.
Steve Sakwa - Bank of America: Okay. And then just, the 12 million is included in your guidance of 15 to 28?
Bruce Johnson: Correct.
Steve Sakwa - Bank of America: Okay. And then --
Bruce Johnson: I appreciate it. Moderator?
Operator: Mr. Sakwa, have you done?
Steve Sakwa - Bank of America: Yes.
Martin “Hap” Stein, Jr.: Yes.
Operator: Thank you, thank you.
Martin “Hap” Stein, Jr.: Unless he wants to get back in the queue again.
Operator: And we will take our next question from David Wigginton with Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead.
David Wigginton - Macquarie Capital: Good morning.
Martin “Hap” Stein, Jr.: Good morning.
David Wigginton - Macquarie Capital: I had a quick question regarding the winding down of the joint ventures. What is the expected decline in recurring management fees from the two lost, I guess the desolation of the two JVs?
Mary Lou Fiala: And that's why David, to look that this is, I think Macquarie has us closed in the past what fees are for these partnership. The 25 basis point asset management fee and property management fees are 4%. Their June 30 evaluations were right around $750 million for the combined two entities. So if -- you can double check my numbers. So if you go through the math it's going to end up in a net basis to Regency in terms of our shares with those fees that are paid. Remember we own 25% of those ventures. About $3.5 million
Martin “Hap” Stein, Jr.: We have that dialed into the guidance that we provided.
David Wigginton - Macquarie Capital: And then just with respect to the other JVs, do you expect any of those to be wind down in 2009 and what is the I guess the relative quality of those assets compared to your existing portfolio.
Mary Lou Fiala: Again I think as, Bruce and Hap both mentioned in the call before it has publicly announced that they continued to look at more alternatives in terms of property sales and early transaction then that they are making good progress on it. I think tat that is a question for them at this point. In terms of how it would impact us and the profits that we have, the profits that we have remaining in our Macquarie's venture are extremely high quality. And the ones that we distributed I would still say are high quality because they're all Regency's portfolio of high quality. So although it maybe below the average in terms of demographics to our Regency portfolio it's still better than and 90% of the shopping centers that are out there.
David Wigginton - Macquarie Capital: And so, you say below average, or are you talking about the ones that were distributed, or the ones that are being held in?
Mary Lou Fiala: Ones that were distributed but below the Regency average.
Martin “Hap” Stein, Jr.: Regency average.
Mary Lou Fiala: I didn't say that's below average, still 90% better than what is out there.
David Wigginton - Macquarie Capital: Yeah, I know. Understood, understood. Okay, thank you.
Martin “Hap” Stein, Jr.: Thank you, David.
Operator: We will take our next question from Jay Habermann with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs: Hey, good morning. Starting first, I guess, just in terms of same-store NOI, and how you gain some comfort I guess, as you looked into 2009, given the deceleration and occupancy quarter-over-quarter, and this part of that. Can you expand a bit, just on maybe, sort of the small shops based versus say the anchor stores? And furthermore, whether you're still seeing the anchor stores, the commitments for some of the major projects that you have in your pipeline?
Mary Lou Fiala: Well, let me talk a little bit first about same-store NOI. We really do have a lot of comfort level with what we did. And I think, as we've never been under ... we've averaged over 3% same-store growth for the past 9, 10 years. So, when we came out with this guidance, and we've done it very thoughtfully, the high-end of the guidance, it's really looking at lower terminations fees and a couple of 100,000 square feet of greater move outs. When you get into the low-end of the guidance, we literarily sat down and it looked it retailer by retailer, and I'm not comfortable saying who they are, looking at our portfolio, doing that, some of these retailers that share fortunately on and to go until 11, they're going to go into 7, because they're not going to be able to get credits, and work their way through it and what would that be and that represents the low-end in our guidance. So, I feel like we have really thought through, the amount of top move outs, which is typically, as I said about 55% of our move outs, 45% of the GLA (ph) has been bigger boxes. And our guidance really reflects that. And in terms of people who are replacing some of these big boxes, as I mentioned, we have a grocery store replacing the Albertsons. We've got several significant tenants, the Dollar Tree's taking on, believe it or not (inaudible) Tuesday morning, City Trends which is a moderate price fashion store and lot. And those are some of the people that are growing. But with that I will say, yes, we've got good interest. Yes, we're working deals. The deals are harder, but more importantly they're taking longer. And that's why we changed our down time in this guidance too, and when we talk about it from 8.8 months at the end of this year to 11 months next year. And that's incorporated into it. So, I really feel like we've got it covered. Really, as much as you are capable of, of how bad it could be, and what do we think is really going to happen and that's why we gave the range that we gave.
Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs: So, thus far you aren't seeing the anchor stores pull out of their commitments to open in your developments?
Mary Lou Fiala: Brian, you can tackle that one.
Brian Smith: The only thing we've had, we haven't had a big pull out. If they got bigger signed contracts, they got to sign contract. What we've had are some requests or just deferrals for a year. The biggest one that hurt us is our Marietta project. And I think I mentioned to you that that one of the ones that took the biggest hit this quarter. And that was a situation where we actually went under construction at the site work, and target decided at it's doing all across the country. They want to push out their openings that were scheduled for 2010 and 2011. So they are still committed, they're still going to go forward. But it's been deferred a year.
Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs: And Brian, just one more question for you on the question of whether or not to invest in these opportunistic transactions, the 25% return you mentioned versus sort of the 8% yields on development. I mean, why not curtail the developments further for the next two years?
Brian Smith: If we could get those consistently we would. I mean, the problem is that they were such a good deal the bankruptcy judge said, let's take another cut at this. But every, we aren't -- any development we do is not only subject to the balance sheet, but we are going to compare it to any of these other opportunistic opportunities and if we can get 10.5%, 11% maybe a 9% current returns, without taking the development risk that's what we will do.
Mary Lou Fiala: Remember Jay that that 8% too is on $1 billion of properties that are already...
Martin “Hap” Stein, Jr.: I mean, yes. I mean, are...
Mary Lou Fiala: They are already 75% leased and 85% funded. But they're not new investments.
Martin “Hap” Stein, Jr.: Just reiterate our ... to the extent that capital is available, let me reiterate. The current guidelines taking aside land already owned and has been increased again this past quarter to 10.25% for grocery anchors shopping centers, higher for larger centers and with a 200 basis points margin.
Mary Lou Fiala: Thanks Jay.
Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs: Okay, thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Craig Smith (ph) with Banc of America. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. On the recovery rate, I feel have a dropping from 79.4 to a range of 74 to 76, what is driving that downward?
Mary Lou Fiala: Primarily, reduction and occupancy.
Unidentified Analyst: But you had a reduction in occupancy in '08 and it actually picked up over '07?
Mary Lou Fiala: Yeah. Go ahead.
Martin “Hap” Stein, Jr.: What happened in 2008 you saw a slight uptick compared to 2007. It's really the mix the expenses that were recovered from our tenants when you look at our fixed expenses versus operating expenses. We clearly recover higher percentage of that in those types of expenses, fixed over variable expenses.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. So, this was the fact for the occupancy is going down, you are unable to split some of those charges over every tenant?
Mary Lou Fiala: It's also correct. I think it's important to recognize that large occupancy drops have been mostly happened in the last two months of the year. So --
Unidentified Analyst: Good point.
Bruce Johnson: So the asset occupancies for the year were still very close to 94.67% decline in occupancy really have in -- In last two months. So we had 10 months of recoveries that we were at closer to 95%.
Mary Lou Fiala: So the positive really this year was more of the mix of where it came from and that too was impacted by floor.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Great, thanks for that clarification.
Martin “Hap” Stein, Jr.: Thank you, Craig.
Mary Lou Fiala: Thank you, Craig.
Operator: We will take our next question from Jeff Donnelly with Wachovia Securities. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey Donnelly - Wachovia Securities: Good morning, guys. Can you provide any specificity to us about how you are thinking about the length of downtime between leases and single tenant incentives like TI dollars and free rent to your 2009 guidance? And at least maybe worst things which you have experienced in 2008.
Mary Lou Fiala: I'll tell you what, a lot of what we did is to really took first quarter, we typically do our budget accounts in September and we went back in redid our budgets in December we've to make a more real of what's happened with November, December. As you know, November, December comp store sales and the retailers in general are down 92.3% which was what happened in the year. Our free rent isn't in that vocabulary so we didn't really have any discussions with that. In terms of downtime we see best thing is tickup and we've wrapped out literally quarter-by-quarter and we're seeing that going up. And honestly with our working consensus of how long especially in the last November, December and even quite frankly through January, how long is it really taking us to fill these boxes, what are the boxes that are going to be empty and the bigger box is obviously going to take on. But even this smaller boxes are going to sell us more our work in-process. What else Jeff, do I answer your question.
Jeffrey Donnelly - Wachovia Securities: In months...
Martin “Hap” Stein, Jr.: Downtime.
Brian Smith: Downtime.
Mary Lou Fiala: Yeah I gave that already, I said we went from 8.8 months to 11 months in the last question.
Jeffrey Donnelly - Wachovia Securities: Okay. And it's the follow-up and a little more of a broad question a little bit. Can you talk a little bit about how you see retailers approaching their plans to downsize store counts -- I mean I guess I'm curious do you find that this tends to be called top down strategic view where its, sort of, their market opportunity unit level revenues and profits and with some eye towards economies of scale in that market or is it you're experience is just not that organized and more a function of lease role-over?
Mary Lou Fiala: No, I hesitate. It's changed completely from what it always was. And every single retailer that I talk to is all about protecting their balance sheet, period. And like I said now they are cutting G&A, they're cutting their inventories. The big problem that they're having in determining closing stores if they don't know, the stores that last year made money in maybe fourth quarter they had 20% exit comp-store in this year there could be 20% on top of it but they don't know. So they are literally going to their portfolios and trying to do the best. Its more balance sheet related, and where they're losing the months money than anything else. It is not a strategic in terms of the retailer and where they want to be, although I think cannibalization and comps come in through it. But is the literally what is pulling our balance sheet down and why do we have to get out of it. And that's why they are either trying to down size the size of their space and just to renegotiate transport accounts and close locations. And then it's really other the way too, it's CEO driven. We talked to the heads of real estate, it is driven by their CEO coming back and saying it's our third largest cost, how are you cutting it?
Jeffrey Donnelly - Wachovia Securities: And --
Martin “Hap” Stein, Jr.: Thanks Jeff.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Chris Lucas with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Christopher Lucas - Robert W. Baird & Co.: Good morning, everyone.
Martin “Hap” Stein, Jr.: Good morning.
Christopher Lucas - Robert W. Baird & Co.: Just a question on the term fees, can you list what the fees were for '08 and what your expectation is for '09?
Mary Lou Fiala: Yeah. Before Mary Lou even answers, just say that we did -- we do break them out in our supplementals. We have a line item for terminations fee.
Mary Lou Fiala: Yeah, but I think to answer your question. Historically, our term fees have been 8 to $0.10 a foot. This year it was unusual, because we had two really big ones. One, the Albertsons that I mentioned for 2.5 million and then we had one at Palm Street (ph), for a 1.2 million, but this year, it was $0.20 a foot. It was really unusual. So for next year, when we're looking at it, we're taking the low-end of our norm at $0.08 a foot. On one hand intuitively you think next year would be a good year for term fee. And so, I think there will be people who want to get out the leases and will get them. The flip side, the retailers are protecting their balance sheet and they are trying to hold on to their cash. So, we projected it at the low-end of the norm for those reasons.
Christopher Lucas - Robert W. Baird & Co.: And then going back to the guidance question as it relates to comp, is there any equity dilution planned in those numbers?
Martin “Hap” Stein, Jr.: Bruce, is there any equity dilution plan in the numbers?
Bruce Johnson: Not currently.
Christopher Lucas - Robert W. Baird & Co.: Okay, thank you.
Mary Lou Fiala: Thanks Chris.
Operator: We will take our next question from Jim Sullivan with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors: Hi, good morning, and we see about here (ph). Just had a quick question with regards to a subject that you touched on earlier with Craig. With respect to common area and maintenance, can you talk about how that has shaped from various anchor and non-anchor tenants in your shopping centers? And furthermore, how does that cam burden shift, between the landlord and the tenants as vacancy increases?
Martin “Hap” Stein, Jr.: I am going to say it on a pro rata basis, based on the size of the centre. Obviously, the anchor tenants have certain restrictions and gaps in their clauses and their leases. But, if there is an anchors dart, unless we have the right to what we call after anchor our tenants, then we really look at that. We don't do that that often. They will continue to pay their pro rata share, and you will see a downward pressure on recovery rates.
Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors: Is there an increasing vacancy then, you would -- they would take their pro rata share whatever that was and then the landlord would put the bill for the rest.
Bruce Johnson: Yes.
Mary Lou Fiala: Yes, absolutely.
Bruce Johnson: But most of it's fixed. So, it's going to just drop to the bottom-line where you don't recover effectively.
Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors: Okay, thank you.
Martin “Hap” Stein, Jr.: Thanks.
Mary Lou Fiala: Thanks you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Michael Mueller with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Michael Mueller - JP Morgan: Yeah, hi. With respect ... can you hear me?
Mary Lou Fiala: Yeah, we can hear you fine.
Michael Mueller - JP Morgan: So you can hear me, okay. With respect to the development pipeline, how should we be thinking of the pipeline as really buy and hold going forward? I know you have what looks like 3 million to maybe where you have some development gains, embedded in your guidance but not a lot. So, what are you thinking there? Are you thinking its buy and hold, or development and hold, or developing and contributed, not a significant margin. How should we think about that?
Martin “Hap” Stein, Jr.: I would say that it appears like there's going to be a higher percentage, it's going to be develop and hold, when it's going to be restored. I still think that there is a ... that there will be some continued development sales. And there will be continue to be some developing contributions.
Michael Mueller - JP Morgan: Okay. And then second question is with occupancy heading down in 2009, I know you don't have 2010 guidance out. But, how do you think that plays out, as you move to 2010? Is occupancy lower year-over-year or do you have visibility on tenants to make up what you think you will lose in '09?
Mary Lou Fiala: No, we have been working on that. And looking at it one hand as we did, the downside analysis from our own portfolio, which is the low-end saying oh, my gosh could all these things happen, which is our downside that we gave you 2.5%. Do we think that will continue or not? On the conservative case we probably see 10, minus 1 to flat, but let's find out what it is, is we are going to start leasing in places with that great centers. We've got a lot of action more than you'd expect. So, I think that there is going to be some upside in our sequential upside in accuracy, especially in the second half in '010. I think the first half of '010 is still going to be tough, second half you're really going to start seeing some results, based on what we know about portfolio what's actually going on.
Michael Mueller - JP Morgan: Okay, thank you.
Mary Lou Fiala: Thanks Mike.
Martin “Hap” Stein, Jr.: Thanks Mike.
Operator: And we will take our next question from R. J. Milligan with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
R.J. Milligan - Raymond James: Good morning. Just a question on the guidance, the $0.21 to $0.39 per share, I am assuming that's a combination of transaction profits, and dead deal costs. Can you break that out for me?
Bruce Johnson: We've assumed that dead deal costs would go back to our normal, which is about $4 million a year.
R.J. Milligan - Raymond James: Okay.
Unidentified Analyst: Again, I'll rephrase it. We paid 39 the in supplemental. Also, we actually break out, we had a transaction profits net of those pasts in the guidance for the year is15 million and 28 million. And then separately that will exclude the Macquarie Promote that we've talked about. And then separately, we list out what we expect from the third party seasoned commission as well.
R.J. Milligan - Raymond James: Okay, thank you. And my last question is just, if you guys can provide any more color on your approach so that dividend in what you guys are thinking about going forward, in terms of the possibility of doing it, the stock dividend?
Martin “Hap” Stein, Jr.: I just want to reiterate my comments. As number one, and if the risk of sounding redundant, we feel that the dividend is integral to the rate model and to the Regency's model and our intent is to continue to pay the dividend of $2.90. At the same time, if we don't feel that for any reason that's not sustainable, and I am not just talking about, because of one quarter, or two quarters, but for reason in the future for instance, Mary Lou's assumptions regarding NOI growth, which she feels are very conservative, tend to be not conservative enough. And that could in effect, change our outlook in that regard. And at the same time, we feel I've got to say, we feel, I'm cautious, that I'm cautiously optimistic about our ability to continue, our ability to tap the mortgage market. I mean, we are still seeing a lot of activity there. We feel like we are in the sweet spot so to speak of the Fannie and Freddie Mac standpoint. For shopping, for shopping centers and that mortgage capital will be available to us. As Bruce said, we are going to get on the front end of the curve to do that. To the extent that's not available to us. That could create another set of circumstances. But before we do that, I think as you will see in the guidance, we have given from a development star standpoint zero. We are prepared to stop all development to make sure that we have the right capital to put in effect, preserve the balance sheet. So ... but in effect nothing is off the table today at the same time.
R.J. Milligan - Raymond James: Okay, great. Thanks for the additional color.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks R.J.
Operator: We will take our next question from Nathan Isbee with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.
Nathan Isbee - Stifel Nicolaus: Hi, good morning.
Martin “Hap” Stein, Jr.: Good morning.
Nathan Isbee - Stifel Nicolaus: Can you talk a little bit about the small shop leasing in the development portfolio, and specifically have you seen any uptick in signed lease fallout before opening?
Bruce Johnson: No, it's pretty consistent with what it's been. Fourth quarter is always slow. But we did a fair amount of leasing. And I still don't see any difference at all right now.
Nathan Isbee - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. And do you haven't seen --
Bruce Johnson: It hasn't turned down.
Nathan Isbee - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, great. Thank you.
Mary Lou Fiala: Thanks Nathan.
Operator: We will take our next question from Alex Ben (ph) with Agency Trading Group. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Yeah, thank you. Good morning.
Mary Lou Fiala: Good morning.
Unidentified Analyst: Wanted to ask you guys, in terms of how you guys define your occupancy rate? What's included in that number? What's not included, I mean when a tenant like the moment top is no longer in business, at what point does that kind of affect that number? Can you help me out with that?
Mary Lou Fiala: Yes. From the time a tenant was out till the time another tenant moves in, and that's how we look at it.
Unidentified Analyst: So, is the occupancy rate a physical occupancy rate or is it more like a financial, as long as you have a lease in place it still counts in the number?
Mary Lou Fiala: It's financial.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. My second question is, you mentioned that on some of these new developments, you were expecting like a 6% type of yield. I was wondering, I mean, where if you had to get debt financing like permanent debt financing right now for those projects, where are those numbers penciling at rates?
Martin “Hap” Stein, Jr.: Alex, let me be clear. The 6% we've started projects that are already underway. The 6% is our current return, if we don't lease another square foot. And we fully build out the phase I. And the returns will get up to about 8% with the current phases, when we lease those developments up. Now, if we were start a development today, the total return expectations would be at least 200 basis points out of net.
Mary Lou Fiala: Thanks Al.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Martin “Hap” Stein, Jr.: The important part of that answer though is that there is no debt on those projects to date.
Unidentified Analyst: Right. That's why I was kind of wondering where the market or if you guys have tried to obtain some, what kind of pricing you are...
Martin “Hap” Stein, Jr.: Basically, we only have financed basically stabilized projects today that's what. And in fact we spent about 800 million already, it's already incorporated into our numbers and the cost of completed of another $180 million and after that cost to complete and we don't lease another square foot, it's a 6% return. But I'll just reiterate, we are continuing to able to put mortgage financing on completed developments and existing operating prosperities that are A-quality properties.
Unidentified Analyst: And then thank you, very much.
Mary Lou Fiala: Thank you.
Martin “Hap” Stein, Jr.: You're welcome.
Operator: We will take our next question from Anar Ismail with Gem Reality (ph). Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning. There are a lot of moving pieces, and if want to focus on just something that is going to move the needle, something that keeps you up nice. What is the one thing among the possible things that will happen next year that you think is the most important to the biggest, your biggest concern?
Martin “Hap” Stein, Jr.: I think the, if you look at it, the key things that we want to do is to achieve our net operating income objective and get our occupancy stabilized because that will pay dividends into 2010. And secondly, we've got although I think we are extremely well positioned with having $3 billion in unencumbered assets, is executing our plan related to the mortgage financing.
Unidentified Analyst: And among the things that could actually happen is it like as it relates to local tenants as it relates to anchor. Is there anything in particular that you're most worried about?
Martin “Hap” Stein, Jr.: I guess Mary Lou indicated I think we feel and it is not to say that things couldn't get worse, but I think we've incorporated some reasonably conservative assumptions into the guidance that we provided.
Mary Lou Fiala: And I had reiterated when we did that, we set down and looked at what we found there is the 5% rent growth. And what we have consistently done over 10%, number one. Two as we looked at greater move out both in the site shop and in the anchor, the way we changed our down time from 8.8 months to 11 months and we have also in the downside of our guidance looked at a group of retailers that we think have potential of go and chapter seven during this year. And what this had to is best to our numbers. And some of those are already incorporated our plans and some of them are in addition. But all that's incorporated in our range of the guidance. So like Hap said, things can happen if the difficult world out there but to the best of our ability and knowledge today, we feel it's comfortable as you can be with that guidance.
Martin “Hap” Stein, Jr.: And let me just also say and I think this is correct Marry Lou, the January has started inline with expectations.
Mary Lou Fiala: True.
Martin “Hap” Stein, Jr.: So our experience in January is inline with the guidance that we've provided to you. So, it's not as nice as January of '08
Mary Lou Fiala: '08, yeah.
Martin “Hap” Stein, Jr.: Or especially of '07 but we haven't fallen off the cliff either and I think there were some concerns that the economy might do that and when have that efforts impact us that has happened to they were one month so far so good.
Mary Lou Fiala: One good thing we see no renewal rate hold at 79 to 80% which I think is a big gain in this environment.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Operator: We will take a follow-up question from Chris Lucas from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Christopher Lucas - Robert W. Baird & Co.: Yeah. Bruce, real quick. On the $250 million of unencumbered NOI how much is NOI that is from projects that are developments in-progress?
Bruce Johnson: Not as good score. This is actually the unsecured pool NOI numbers that is with well. That's where that number comes from.
Christopher Lucas - Robert W. Baird & Co.: Is it --
Bruce Johnson: None of our developments in-process, technical sense what's the reasons of certain occupancy they go in, which is at 80%. But if they're not about in that rent paying occupancy, if they're not there they aren't in that number.
Martin “Hap” Stein, Jr.: And I really appreciate you pointing that out and came back on for that call. So in fact as we achieved 95% leased and it's going to take us longer than we expected and it's going to be more obvious to get there that unsecured asset pool is going to continue to grow. Good point, you made Chris.
Bruce Johnson: While and the other point we indicate by the way we've got this much of unsecured -- our unsecured NOI available for that. But that really doesn't include all of those projects that were already financed. So in terms of that that's rolling over you really got to throw them in bucket as well if you want to look at the total keep going.
Christopher Lucas - Robert W. Baird & Co.: Thank you.
Bruce Johnson: Thanks, Chris.
Mary Lou Fiala: Thank you.
Unidentified Analyst: This was the only one left, if you have another question feel free.
Operator: And at this time there are no further questions. Mr. Stein, I'm going to turn the conference back over to you for closing comments.
Martin “Hap” Stein, Jr.: Just once again thank you for taking the time to join us on this call and as indicated we look forward to a very challenging but gratifying year, if we can execute our plan in 2009. Have a great week. Bye, bye.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude today's Regency Centers Corporation fourth quarter 2008 earnings conference call. We thank you for your participation and you may disconnect at this time.

Operator: My name is Cynthia and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Regency Centers Corporation third quarter 2008 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question and answer period. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Lisa Palmer, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets.
Lisa Palmer: On the call this morning are Hap Stein, Mary Lou Fiala, Bruce Johnson, Brian Smith, [Chris Levitz], and [Jamie Shelton]. Before we start, I’d like to address forward-looking statements that may be addressed on this call. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10K and 10Q which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in these forward-looking statements. I will now turn the call over to Hap.
Martin E. Stein, Jr.: Regency is currently operating in an environment that combines an unprecedented crisis in the capital markets and a recession. Although the fact that the atmosphere is difficult is no surprise, I for one have been taken aback by how severely and rapidly the financial markets have frozen.  Historically we’ve been very accurate with our guidance, and notwithstanding the current tough and uncertain realities especially as they relate to the transaction side of our business, it is personally very disappointing to me that we will be well below our prior estimates of earnings for the year. Before Bruce, Brian, Mary Lou and I describe how this mêlée is impacting our business, the steps that Regency is undertaking to preserve our balance sheet, and strategies to prosper in the future in the short- and long-term implications to the balance sheet and earnings, I do want to comment on a few key results and Regency’s attributes which I really believe are relevant to our future. The signing of 600,000 square feet of new leases: 300,000 square feet in the operating portfolio and 300,000 square feet in developments. Almost 900,000 square feet of renewals in the third quarter at 13% higher rents are indicative of the fact that retail demand for better shopping centers still has a pretty steady heartbeat and that Regency’s quality operating portfolio and developments are demonstrating resilient health in the face of the worsening economic conditions. Mary Lou and the operations team are still confident that same-store NOI growth for the year will be 2.4% to 2.7% for Regency’s ownership share. The contribution of four completed developments with a gross value of $158 million to the open-end fund and the Oregon partnership that occurred very close to the end of the third quarter demonstrates the strength of Regency’s relationships with our partners and the attractiveness of quality shopping centers to institutional investors even in today’s markets. While I knew it was important at the time, I didn’t fully appreciate Regency’s move last spring to expand our bank facilities by $343 million to $940 million will turned out to be. With only $70 million outstanding on the line of credit portion of the facility, Regency has over $645 million in funding capacity still available. The line of credit doesn’t expire until 2011 and there is a one-year extension option for $600 million of the line. Regency has only $235 million of debt on the balance sheet that matures during the next two years. As Bruce will ex plain in further detail, we have more than adequate committed sources of capital including line capacity to complete the in-process developments, pay off corporate debt maturities and refinance maturing mortgages by infusing equity to the more stringent underwriting requirements that are in place today. In addition, with over 87% of assets unsecured Regency has over $3 billion of unencumbered assets that are available for mortgage financing. Let’s now turn to Regency’s strategies for working our way through these severe challenges preserving a strong balance sheet and turning the turmoil into a time of opportunity to create substantial future value. First and foremost. All committed sources and uses of capital are being vigorously monitored. New development is being slowed and will be halted if necessary to make sure that we have more than adequate capital to meet our funding obligations and maintain dry powder to take advantage of future opportunities which are already becoming more attractive. Second. As mentioned earlier there is significant capacity that can be accessed for mortgage financing from the $3 billion of unencumbered assets. Mortgages are an alternate source to refinance the balance sheet debt that expires during the next three years. Regency has developed excellent relationships with a handful of mortgage lenders and these lenders seem keenly interested in making loans to select borrowers especially in modest loan amounts on quality shopping centers. Third. Establishing a co-investment partnership funding source for grocery anchored and community center developments after 2009 is a top priority. Financing the development program on a cost-effective basis is critical to providing capacity for future developments and acquisitions. Fourth. The guidelines for returns on total invested capital for developments have been raised to 10% with a 200 basis point margin. This represents a 150 basis point increase since the beginning of the year and 100 basis points in the last quarter and is based on cap rates settling into the 8% range. The return thresholds will be increased again to the extent the cap rates and/or our cost of capital turn out to be higher. Special consideration will obviously be given to land that is already owned, developments with a lower risk profile and prior firm commitments to anchor tenants. Having said that, we are not being bashful to renegotiate with landowners to increase returns to an acceptable level and we will not proceed even if the consequences involve walking away from pre-closing costs and expensing development G&A. As important as returns, new development opportunities are also being scrutinized to ensure that there is significant pre-leasing and excellent visibility to achieve 95% lease-up. The appeal of a development to co-investment partners and institutional buyers is also a critical consideration. Yet, the current turmoil in the capital markets will cause a significant number of distressed sales. This should provide Regency with what should be compelling acquisition opportunities. We will seek opportunities that generate returns in excess of Regency’s cost of capital after incorporating the impacts from the downturn and are being bought at cap rates above the long-term average for the property. A key initiative is to make sure there is dry powder for these opportunities and leveraging our institutional relationships to effectively finance them. Sixth. As announced MCW, Macquarie Countrywide, is committed to bolstering their balance sheet and their capital management initiatives which may include property sales or entity level transactions. We are working closely with them and this will happen on a basis that makes sense to Regency. Seventh. The leasing team is totally focused on returning the occupancy of the operating portfolio to 95% while continuing to increase rents. Achieving 95% occupancy in the developments also remains a critical objective. Finally, G&A costs have been carefully scrutinized and the size of the organization is in the process of being right sized to fit the current environment and a level of development starts in the $250 million to $350 million range. In the longer term assuming that Regency’s high quality portfolio can withstand the recession and assets with flat same-property NOI the next year or so and that the capital markets begin to slowly thaw and we have some success executing a modest portion of our capital plan and we’re able to progress on retooling our development program, then our very preliminary view would be that FFO per share would be in the same range for 2009 and 2010 as we’re expecting in 2008. Bruce will give you more information about that. From there we should and expect to be in a position to generate respectable growth in 2011 even with transaction profits at less than 10% of FFO. Bruce will discuss the implications of these actions on 2008 earnings as he details our revised range of FFO per share guidance and more information and details on our capital market strategy.
Bruce M. Johnson: In this day of recognition I salute our veterans. Regency’s FFO per share in the third quarter was $1.21 nearly 25% higher than this period a year ago. We exceeded consensus in our own guidance largely because of lower accrued incent compensation and earlier-than-anticipated development profits. While the third quarter exceeded guidance, we’ve reduced our expected range of FFO per share guidance for 2008 to $3.90 to $4.35 per share. The main driver of downward revision and the wide range is transaction profits. The previous guidance included expected transaction profits of $63 million to $78 million. The new guidance range assumes transaction profits between $26 million and $50 million. Components of the transaction profits that have been impacted are: Promote income, development gains, and debt deal costs. The Promote from Oregon partnership is expected to be approximately $15 million to $17 million due primarily to higher cap rates which are expected to be in the range of 7.25% to 7.75%. This compares to our PAR estimate of $21 million to $23 million that was based on an average cap rate of 6.75%. It is interesting to note that a year ago the properties were valued at a 6.25% cap rate which would have resulted in a $30 million payment. More troubling is the real risk that Promote could be totally eliminated if we don’t beat the [Nikkei] index. Although as of June 30 our portfolio had a 17% return and was meaningfully outpacing [Nikkei] 14% return, we are concerned that many of the participants in [Nikkei] will not be as closely reflecting the current market as we are with current appraisals. This possibility of not receiving Promote contributes $0.21 of downside in our FFO per share guidance. Without this, the low end of our guidance would be $4.11. With respect to development gains, $115 million of developments are on the market for sale. As you’ll hear from Brian, nearly $17 million is under contract. We are actively negotiating LOIs on two more centers and reviewing offers on three others. Depending on how many actually close in this uncertain market and the resulting cap rates, our fourth quarter gains from these developments could range from $6 million to $21 million. Finally, the estimate for writing off debt deal costs has been increased to $7 million to $10 million from $4 million. This is the result of tougher underwriting requirements as Hap indicated and scrubbing our pre-closing costs. You’ll note that a debt deal cost line item has been added to the statement of operations. In prior supplemental debt deal costs were treated as an offset to development gains. As Hap said, G&A costs have been carefully scrutinized. Gross G&A for the year is projected to be $6 million less than 2007; however capitalized overhead is projected to be $9 million less than last year due in large part to the reduction in development starts. As a result, G&A is expected to increase by approximately $3 million on a net basis for the year. I do want to note that net G&A in 2009 is expected to be $6.2 million less than in 2008. These are unprecedented times in the capital markets. We cannot say enough that strengthening and protecting the balance sheet is our number one focus and priority. Given our conservative stewardship, the balance sheet is in excellent shape. There is currently only $70 million outstanding on Regency’s line of credit leaving nearly $645 million of available capacity. I calculated a downside analysis of our balance sheet capacity that assumes no property sales, no cash flow and no refinancing of maturing debt. Given our ample credit facility, we could operate through 2010 and still have over $170 million of available capacity in the line of credit at the end of that year. This analysis is available on our website along with our supplemental as an Excel file titled Balance Sheet Capacity. The scenario assumes refinancing our funding of $210 million of maturing bonds and $25 million of mortgage loan maturities, $240 million of net costs to complete the in-process developments, and $30 million of new fourth quarter starts and provides $34 million of equity into our co-investment partnerships to refinance maturing mortgage debt. In addition to the capital available under our line of credit, as Hap mentioned, over 87% of Regency’s total real estate assets are unsecured. Valued at an 8% cap rate this provides over $3.1 billion of value that when leveraged at 55% loan-to-value would provide over $1.7 billion of potential loan proceeds. It is important to note that secured financing is still available. Our experience is that low leverage grocery-anchored centers are a sweet spot for mortgage lenders. As evidence of this we are close to a commitment on a seven-year 50% LTV $43 million mortgage on a three-property portfolio at a coupon rate of 6.85% that we brought to market in early October. We continue to have a high level of interest from our life company relationships for loans of this type. Finally, the dividend is secure and sustainable at its current level. Given what we are currently projecting for FFO, the dividend payout ratio is in the range of 67% to 74% of FFO and 74% to 83% of AFFO.
Brian M. Smith: Before I discuss our thoughts on development in this environment, let me quickly review the performance of our in-process developments and discuss the remaining 2008 development sales. Leasing continues to be soft but it’s certainly not dead. In the third quarter we leased 341,000 square feet of development space. That’s about 45% more than the average of development leasing done in the first two quarters of this year. Stabilized returns on the $1.1 billion of in-process developments on a quarterly apples-to-apples basis are up 5 basis points. If we assume we can’t lease another square foot of space, the current return on invested capital is approximately 6%. Although leasing the in-process portfolio in the middle of this downturn is a challenge, there is reason for optimism. The best retailers are signing leases but only in projects where they can expect to generate strong sales. Our best weapon in leasing space then is to prove to the prospective lessees that our superior locations generate high foot traffic created by strong anchor sales volumes. Let me give you three recent examples of where this is in fact happening. About five weeks ago Kohl’s opened 47 stores across the country. Two of those were stores we developed for them in South Florida. One of the stores opened is the number one highest volume store of the 47 nationwide and it continues to enjoy that same position today. The second store we developed for them is in the top 15 of those 47 stores that were recently opened. Similarly in our shops at Stonewall project in Northern Virginia, Wegman’s recently had one of the best openings in its history with overflow crowds too large for its parking field. In fact we got word this morning that Staples said that their store there is “on fire.” That’s their quote. I think these projects are good examples of how even in difficult economic times thoughtfully conceived projects in superior locations with top tier anchors can result in robust sales and there’s nothing that attracts retailers like strong demonstrated sales. On the disposition front we’ve got eight development properties on the market at an estimated total price of $115 million and if all sold could generate as much as $21 million in gains. Of these eight properties, two are currently under contract with a third nearing contract execution. All three of these are single tenant buildings so there’s very little due diligence challenge or risk for the buyers and therefore these sales have the highest probability of closing. The gains associated with these three sales would be approximately $6 million. In addition we are actively negotiating letters of intent with interested buyers on two other centers which represent nearly $9 million in gains and are reviewing offers on three other centers w hose gains would total $6.5 million. As Bruce said, these are unprecedented times. Going forward caution is the order of the day and we are being highly selective in the opportunities we pursue. All investments are viewed in the context of the balance sheet and will not proceed if capacity is an issue. The projects we do pursue will be those that retailers want, that consumers want and that our co-investment partners ultimately want to own. In short, projects are being evaluated based on the ability to quickly and profitably recycle capital. As for specific directions to our team we will continue to focus on the most desirable markets with the strongest demographics anchored by the top retailers. No real change there. We will not be pursuing mix use projects nor will we buy land to hold except for extraordinary opportunities. We’ll be doing a higher percentage of grocery-anchored centers catering to nondiscretionary shopping. We will further reduce the amount of shop space we build. It’s already down but it’s going lower. In early 2007 shop space in our in-process projects amounted to 33% of the GLA. Today our in-process projects average 19%, our 2008 starts will average 16%, and our 2009 starts look to average just 13%. We have significantly raised return requirements. As Hap indicated we expect new developments to be underwritten at returns 200 basis points higher than the expected cap rate for the proposed development and that actual cap rate will reflect all risks and market conditions unique to that project. Return thresholds will be increased again to the extent cap rates and/or the cost of capital increase. We will give special consideration to projects where the land is already owned, developments with lower risk profile, and where we have prior firm commitments to anchor tenant customers. Given the increased return requirements, our development pipeline is being retooled. Returns will rise to acceptable levels or we’ll drop the pursue. A meaningful portion of the pipeline consists of projects where Regency already owns the land and we expect eventually to move those holdings into production. Where proposed projects fail to make the cut, there will be write-offs of pursuit costs. The total amount of at-risk dollars that controls the entire pipeline of projects is $11 million. For projects that don’t currently meet our new hurdles, the at-risk dollars total about $6.6 million. We fully expect that we’ll be able to restructure many of these projects and dramatically reduce the amount of potential write-offs. While the amount of development is being significantly curtailed until the capital environment improves, we will continue to pursue these investments under the right terms as we are in my opinion entering a period of immense opportunity. In today’s environment development is significantly less risky than it was a year ago. Today land prices are down, construction costs are soft, and with a complete lack of competition we are pretty much able to negotiate whatever terms we need. For the first time in about 15 years we can negotiate to tie-up properties for as long as necessary and put off closing until we have all entitlements and significant leasing in place. This is in marked contrast to market peaks where the developers had virtually no negotiating power with landowners and were forced into taking increasing amounts of risk. Today cities are willing to work closely with us on reasonable terms and retailers are bringing us many exclusive opportunities. In short we’re entering the sweet spot of development that comes around very rarely and in those periods developers can create extraordinary value. The only weak ingredient in this model today is retailer sales but the projects being pursued will not be delivered for several years when that demand is back. These opportunities no matter how good will not be undertaken at the expense of the balance sheet. The bottom line is that Regency’s development program is being retooled and slowed. The volume of development starts and at least the amount of Regency’s investment will be reduced as a result of higher return guidelines, tougher underwriting standards, the need for transparent takeout commitments or real financial partners, and limits on capital commitments. Projected starts for this year have been reduced to $180 million. The remaining $30 million is scheduled to come in at 10%. The amount of development that is started next year very well could be less or more based on how successful we are in executing our financing plans. I do want to point out that most developments that would be started in 2009 would not be stabilized until the period of 2011 to 2013. Furthermore, it’s important to remember that any development we do will involve considerable pre-leasing. Of the remaining 2008 starts we are currently 84% pre-leased and the projects we hope to start in 2009 I expect will be approximately 80% pre-leased as well. The days of closing without this kind of leasing are long gone. [Inaudible] Regency is extremely well positioned for profitable growth when the economy returns to normal. In addition to traditional investment opportunities we’re very likely to see banks, mezzanine lenders and hedge funds taking back huge amounts of unfinished developments. They will need to team with a strong company with development and operating capabilities to see their way out of these projects. As I’ve said before, anchor tenants will turn to the handful of companies that have performed for them during difficult times. Not only do the best retailers still need to expand, they need reliable development partners of which there are few today. The development business is not one that easily can be started and stopped and restarted again as development takes years to hatch and future returns will become more attractive as landowners find [inaudible] and land prices drop. Hopefully by 2011 development starts can be returned to the $300 million to $400 million level with margins of about 200 basis points thereby creating significant value.
Mary Lou Fiala: Regency’s necessity driven market grocery-anchored operating portfolio is holding up remarkably well in the face of an increasingly challenging environment. Occupancy for our pro rata share of the portfolio was 94.3%. Rental rate growth was in double digits at 13.8% for the quarter and 11.6% year-to-date. 1.2 million square feet of new leases and renewals were signed during the quarter and NOI growth for the quarter for Regency’s wholly-owned portfolio and shared partnership was 2.3% and 2.5% year-to-date. The total portfolio posted 2.6% NOI growth year-to-date. Occupancy has dropped from 94.6% last quarter to 94.3% in the third quarter, a decline of 30 basis points. There has been a slight uptick in move-outs in the operating portfolio this quarter but year-to-date are 110,000 square feet higher than last year largely attributable to two Linens N Things. The portfolio is performing solidly on a regional basis. Strong markets for us continue to be California where average same-store growth is over 4%, occupancy is 98% and rent growth is over 20%. The Northeast is another very solid market with same-store growth of 2.5%, occupancy nearly 95% and double-digit rent growth. Texas is also strong with NOI growth of almost 3%, 94% occupancy and again double-digit rent growth. And honestly I’m pleasantly surprised to see how well the Florida portfolio is performing. Despite the tough economy, NOI is positive and the portfolio is 94+% leased and rent growth is over 8%. Our tough area honestly is the Midwest and it continues to be the most difficult market with flat NOI and low rental rate growth. To quote Hap, our portfolio looks pretty darn good. We’re still leasing over 3.5 million square feet of space and due to strong anchors and better demographics, the sales at our centers are good and the retailers are healthy. As the consumer turns to value and necessity retailers, several retail categories continue to see sales increases. Grocers are up almost 6%, drugstores over 3% and discounters over 4%. If you were to review these results in a vacuum, you could assume that this year’s not much different than any other. But given the credit crunch retailers are not able to access the capital needed to expand and grow their business. Downtime for vacancies is increasing in both new developments and the operating portfolio and therefore putting downward pressure on rents. As a result we are forecasting year-end occupancy to be between 93.8% and 94% on a pro rata basis. For the most part with the exception of exposure to five Linens N Things and two Circuit City stores impact from bankruptcies have been minimal. Even on the short run where these move-outs hurt our numbers, there’s still good news. In Santa Barbara we’re replacing the Circuit city with Whole Foods at significantly higher rents and across the country as we look at these spaces we’re proactively working with retailers like Fresh Market, Marshalls, Nordstrom Rack, Best Buy to fill these larger spaces. It may take a little longer and we may have some short-term pain, but these are strong retailers in strong centers.  In addition to major retailer bankruptcy, odds are high that over the next few months Regency will experience an increase of move-outs in local tenants as well. But excluding grocers we do not have any significant tenants that are over 1.5% of our revenue. Our geographic and tenant diversity will continue to minimize the impact of retailer failures in the future. The leasing teams are totally focused on returning the operating portfolio back to 95% while continuing to increase rent. Our preference for better operators is even greater during a recession. Existing tenants are being proactively approached for early renewals. The leasing team is spending even more time cold-calling retailers in competing centers about upgrading their space in Regency’s better performing centers. These same programs are being applied to achieving 95% occupancy for development. For the remainder of the year we’ve narrowed our same-store guidance to a range of 2.4% to 2.7%. It’s important to note that in October we received a termination fee of $2.5 million that does add 70 basis points to our full-year same-store growth. The same-store growth range excluding termination fees is expected to be about 1.7% to 2%. We’ve raised our rent growth guidance to 9% to 11% given our performance year-to-date even though we’re expecting moderated rent growth in fourth quarter and continuing into ’09. While I have confidence in the guidance given for the remainder of this year, we believe that next year’s going to be even more of a challenge. At this time my best guess is that in the face of the recession we may have flat same-store NOI, and in my mind if this environment our portfolio maintains occupancy of 93% to 94% and sustains the same level of NOI or perhaps even see some growth, it’s a testament to our high quality and sensitivity driven portfolio that’s truly built to withstand the strong headwinds coming our way and that in the next two years we can get back to our 95% occupancy and our normal 2% to 3% same-store growth.
Martin E. Stein, Jr.: I do want to close with what I believe are two important messages. First, I feel extremely fortunate to be working with an experienced cycle-tested deep leadership team which is totally dedicated to meeting the unprecedented challenges which we are now facing. The tough decisions are being made like renegotiating land contracts, walking from projects that have been worked on for months and at times many years, and especially reducing headcount. These steps are being taken to preserve the balance sheet while at the same time we enhance Regency’s franchise as the premier operator and developer, intensely manage our portfolio and position Regency to take advantage of compelling opportunities to create significant value in the future from developments and acquisitions. I also think it’s fitting to end the call by finding perspective regarding survival versus thriving. If you’d indulge me for a minute and let me read from an excerpt from an op ed column in the September 28 New York Times by one of my favorite writers [Tom Friedman]; many of you may have read it; but I do want to read it again. “When I need reminding of the real foundations of the American dream, I talk to my Indian American friends who’ve come here to start new companies. Friends like K.R. Sridhar, founder of Bloom Energy. He emailed me a pep talk in the midst of this financial crisis, a note about the difference between surviving and thriving. ‘Infants and the elderly who are disabled obsess about survival,’ said Sridhar. ‘As a nation if we just focus on survival, the demise of our leadership is imminent. We are thrivers. Thrivers are constantly looking for new opportunity to seize and lead and be number one. That is what America is all about.’” Finding the path to thrive has never been tougher. The mountain that we are climbing is very steep. It’s got some landmines on it and the fog is really thick. At the same time we can’t overlook the fact that we start this climb with some amazing resources: A strong balance sheet, a quality recession resistant operating portfolio, excellent tenant relationships, value created development capabilities, a reputation as a best-in-class operator that owns and develops high quality assets that even today are attractive to institutional investors, and especially the world-class team that I work with. After a long and arduous journey that almost certainly involved one slow step at a time, some tedious back-tracking and new paths to get around the unexpected surprises that are still in front of us, we will get to the top of the mountain. The reason that our journey will be a gratifying success is that thriving is what Regency is all about and what we’re committed to doing. We appreciate your time and we’ll now answer any questions that you may have.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Quentin Velleley and Michael Bilerman - Citigroup.
Quentin Velleley - Citigroup: In terms of your current development pipeline, you spoke about return hurdles and so forth increasing on that and the potential for some write-downs. If you’re going to make some merchant gains in the future, could you just maybe speak about what you’re expecting in terms of net development margins on those existing projects?
Brian M. Smith: If we do a 200 basis point spread, that equates to about a 29% profit margin. If we built a 10 and contributed an 8, that would be 29% profit margin.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup: That’s really on the future stuff?
Brian M. Smith: Yes.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup: How about the $400 million that’s delivered and the stuff that’s scheduled to deliver over the next year?
Brian M. Smith: Depending on the cap rate, the stuff that we would expect to deliver next year would be in the neighborhood of at 7.5%, you’re probably at 20% and if you’re at 8% you’re getting down around 15%.
Quentin Velleley - Citigroup: You mentioned Macquarie Countrywide which obviously has some difficulties at the moment. If Macquarie Countrywide becomes the fourth seller of assets, would you be a potential acquirer of those assets or is it more likely that you would inject equity into the joint venture?
Martin E. Stein, Jr.: The possibility of us being an acquirer of some of their positions is a possibility and it’s also a possibility there may be other investors that may be buying their positions.
Quentin Velleley - Citigroup: Is this something that you’re actively thinking about at the moment?
Martin E. Stein, Jr.: I think they’ve announced that they are actively involved in considering both entity transactions as it may relate to the partnership and the possible sale of assets. As I said, we’re working with them closely and expect that something can be accomplished on a basis that’s going to make sense to Regency.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christy McElroy - Banc of America Securities.
Christy McElroy - Banc of America Securities: Bruce, you talked about appetite among lenders for doing deals on grocery-anchored centers. Can you give some color on the appetite in pricing for doing deals on larger community or power centers, and when you complete and stabilize one of these centers are you typically putting on permanent debt before contributing it to the open end fund?
Bruce M. Johnson: I’ll answer the last question first. We’re trying to do that simultaneously to the extent we can although you’ll note that we contribute the assets to Oregon in the process of doing that mortgage financing that I referred to in my comments. Larger centers are more difficult to finance today in general. The sweet spot would be $10 million to $15 million per center from a loan perspective. To the extent you get above that you start to get a little push back from lenders that want to do that. You just narrow the amount of lenders that would do that.  Current spreads today are probably for our types of property are probably in the 350 to 400 basis point range but I’d say between now and the end of the year you’ll see less activity just because we’re at the end of the year and I think there are a number of lenders that are waiting to see if there’s more clarity even on their side of the capital markets.
Lisa Palmer: I’d also add on the larger community center side Bruce is absolutely correct in terms of the larger dollar amount it gets a little bit tougher and you may have fewer players but still the most important thing is the quality of the tenant and the credit quality of the tenants that are in the shopping center. If you’ve got a community center, for example with Target on the lease, you’d be able to get a loan on that as easy as you would with a public company.  Analyst Then Hap, you talked about opportunities out there that are becoming more attractive, can you provide just some additional color on what types of opportunities you’re seeing in the transaction market today if any? And, how much distress or what kind of pricing you guys really need to see out there before committing capital more aggressively.
Martin E. Stein, Jr.: We indicated that we kind of feel that longer term in general and better assets may price better than this but in general, cap rates are moving to 8% so we would need to see in effect it would have to be accretive to that. There may be some distress sales that we are aware of where you might see some opportunities in that regard but we can’t speak to any of those right now because they haven’t occurred but we believe there is good prospects that that my evolve in the months ahead. Analyst Did you say they are moving to 8% or they have moved to 8%?
Martin E. Stein, Jr.: We’re saying that we expect them to move to the 8% range because with obviously cap rates being lower for infill properties and more coastal markets and cap rates may be higher for what you may call more commodity type product.
Lisa Palmer: I think I would just add that it’s so difficult right now to really know where cap rates are because there are so few transactions occurring. I think that’s the most important thing and because of the capital markets, once the capital markets start to clear up a little bit in fall there will be a clearer picture as to where cap rates are going to go.
Martin E. Stein, Jr.: You might just share the full range of appraisals on the Oregon.
Lisa Palmer: We’re still in the process of getting all the appraisals that determines our promote for the Oregon partnership and cap rates if I need to be honest have come in on these appraisals from 6.25% to 8.25% so it definitely varies and clearly the appraisal market as some people know sometime lags the actual market.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Jay Habermann – Goldman, Sachs & Co.
Analyst for Jay Habermann – Goldman, Sachs & Co.: Just turning to the balance sheet and your available capital at this point, you’ve mentioned in the past that you’d be open to providing seller financing to get deals done in the event that the opportunity does arise. What are your thoughts on this today and have they changed at all from a capital preservation standpoint?
Bruce M. Johnson: No, I think we’re still in the same position with respect to providing seller financing, we do it on a same basis where we look at who we are dealing with and the type of property that we are selling and the likelihood for repayment. Our general rules are 35% equity, in other words we wouldn’t do more than 65%, there could be some variances in that and we’re trying to basically target market rate deals. Basically using points or basis points over whatever the treasury is. Our view on that is that still is important on our capital recycling plan where you wouldn’t get any money if you didn’t sell the assets without the seller financing so we’re going to generate 35% of the proceeds in terms of capital recycling from that respect. Now again, that money would be used on a sparing basis. 
Analyst Jay Habermann – Goldman, Sachs & Co.: Turning back to [inaudible] build for a second and your outlook for 2009 and 2010, I guess how should we be thinking about gains as a percentage of your earnings going forward? Would you consider at this point of removing gains or merchant build gains from your guidance all together with anything recorded being incremental to base line earnings?
Martin E. Stein, Jr.: We’re going to have more definitive guidance on our call at the end of the year, our year-end call and we’ll try to provide as much guidance as we can as far as transaction gains. We do believe that even under some more conservative assumptions that a certain amount of gains can be generated but more to come on that.  I think as I said I think the guidance that we provided, that Bruce has given for 2008 is probably a pretty good range or starting point for guidance for 2009 and my kind of inclination right now is it ought to be somewhere in that range. 
Analyst for Jay Habermann – Goldman, Sachs & Co.: Then just to follow up, the lower end of that range then being sort of the baseline or the conservative just looking at what to expect in terms of the lower end versus the higher end of that range?  
Martin E. Stein, Jr.: Like I said, the range - for right now we haven’t given guidance but as I indicated we’re looking somewhere in that range of $390 to $435 and we’ve have a pretty good preliminary look at the numbers but we’d like to have another in effect 90 days for there to be a little more clarity in the capital markets before we provide any additional guidance.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Louis W. Taylor – Deutsche Bank Securities.
Louis W. Taylor – Deutsche Bank Securities: Hap, or Bruce or Brian can you talk just a little bit about the deals you’ve got on the market for sale? Are any of them going to third parties or what percent is going to third parties? Just give us a sense for buyer profile and their source of equity?
Brian M. Smith: They’re all private buyers. We’ve got two of them are all cash buyers and the remaining ones of the ones we expect to close will be seller finance.
Bruce M. Johnson: But remember a lot of these are single tenant occupied buildings. I think there are two multi tenant buildings, large what you call typical shopping centers.
Brian M. Smith: Three that are under contract are all single tenants. The ones that we’re negotiating LOIs, one is a single tenant buildings the other is grocery anchor centers and the ones that we’re evaluating offers right now are grocery anchor.
Louis W. Taylor – Deutsche Bank Securities: But private buyers I mean institutional, are they families, are they local?
Brian M. Smith: Families, local people not institutions.
Louis W. Taylor – Deutsche Bank Securities: Then second question just pertains to just development leasing, I mean how much is really actively in negotiation today for the vacant space that maybe takes occupancy maybe second quarter or later next year? Or, is that environment really just pretty quite right now?
Brian M. Smith: Like I said we did 341,000 square feet of development leasing this quarter which was 45% more of the average of the prior two quarters. Now, whether that indicates an uptick or not I don’t know. I think it feels pretty consistent with what it’s been for the first two quarters. The projects that are the best located that were not built in the markets depending on future growth continue to lease well and those that were built in markets that did require a little more housing on the ones that were slow. One of the projects we’re going to be doing in the fourth quarter would address one of those. For example, in Culpepper Virginia we have a project where the housing market is slow, we have a Target anchored and what we’re going to be doing there is that one of ours starts is just to build an [inaudible] grocery store and no shop space and just create some additional foot traffic to hopefully help the sales of that center and therefore the leasing. 
Louis W. Taylor – Deutsche Bank Securities: I guess where I was going with that is how much has the leasing environment changed in the last 30 to 45 days as opposed to what happened in Q3.
Mary Lou Fiala: It really hasn’t changed that significantly in the last couple of quarters. The thing that’s changed is the time it takes to lease up the space. It’s changed, as I mentioned even in the operating portfolio and looking at some of these move outs that we have, Circuit City and the bankruptcy from Linen n’ Things, we’ve got create deals going on with a lot of good retailers. Out of the spaces that we have I think there are two that we don’t have anything going on. Whether it’s a development or an operating portfolio, it’s taking us a longer time to lease up but we’re still seeing strong activity and I think Brian said it very well, that most of our developments are leasing up at a reasonable pace, slower than it has been but a reasonable pace. We just have some out there that depending on housing growth that is very slow and very difficult. But, not a significant change in the last 30 to 45 days.
Martin E. Stein, Jr.: The bottom line is to date there’s still a pretty resilient heartbeat out there. It’s not as strong as it was obviously a year ago and there’s a chance that things may slow further. I think that our projects are now that we moved out to 40 months from putting the spade in the ground and a couple of years ago our average was like 24 months and we rigorously go over the portfolio every quarter and I think we’re being pretty conservative in our assumptions but could things slow further? The answer is absolutely that’s possible.
Lisa Palmer: The thing that’s out there that really has changed is the fact that the inability for people to get credit. Where we’re seeing the challenge isn’t the fact that we have our PCI retailers who quite frankly many of those sectors are having nice mid digit comp increases over the previous year but where you’re depending on a franchisee to open a location, they have the franchisee, the franchisee today just can’t go to the bank and get the credit. So it may take $350,000 to $500,000 to open a location but they need that and they can’t get it. That’s the primary reason that we’re seeing a slow up both in developments and in operations. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from Jeffery L. Donnelly – Wachovia Securities. 
Jeffery L. Donnelly – Wachovia Securities: Bruce and Hap, I know you’re reluctant to give 2009 and beyond guidance at this time but I’m curious if you annualized your Q4 ’08 FFO excluding transaction profits you’re at about $3.40 a share and that seems to leave a pretty wide gap from the $3.90 to $4.35 I think Hap you said in your comments. I know you don’t want to be specific but can you at least in very broad strokes give us a rough sense of how you feel that $0.50 to $0.70 share differential?
Bruce M. Johnson: My answer would be is that there clearly is going to be some transaction related business in that, that would be the component of our plan and in addition you’ll see reductions in G&A that occur that our [inaudible].
Martin E. Stein, Jr.: And you’ll see some growth in what somebody might call non-transaction FFO.
Jeffery L. Donnelly – Wachovia Securities: G&A reduction Bruce, just to be clear beyond your run rate in Q4.
Bruce M. Johnson: Yes. [Inaudible] $6.2 million difference.
Jeffery L. Donnelly – Wachovia Securities: The second question I guess for Brian and Marylou, in your development pipeline you’ve been managing down your small shop space obviously for some time, does that tell us that in your core portfolio we should expect greater retention and releasing issues among small shop tenants than in big box? Then I guess just within the small shop side, do you think your mix between PCI and mom and pop tenants is going to shift around at the margins?
Mary Lou Fiala: First of all our renewal rate on our core portfolio is over 80%. Even if we look at next year and 2009 we’ve already early renewed about 15% of those side shop tenants. Our rental rate growth and renewals have been extremely strong year-to-date, over 12%. So, the answer to your question, yes renewal is a focus, maintaining occupancy is key and that’s true whether it’s in an in process development and it’s true in terms of or operating portfolio. As far as is it going to shift on the margin, yes it will shift on the margin. What we’re doing today is because of the fact that our franchisees are not able to get credit and we can’t grow as quickly as they would like or we would like in our portfolio we are focusing on real strong regional players in a market that are in a center that quite frankly don’t have the characteristics that we have both in terms of our anchor sales, demographics and many cases density and we’re going out there and our guys are out there cold calling these people and moving them in and showing how much stronger they’ll perform in a Regency Center. We’re seeing some nice success with that but it will only be on the margin and as soon as this credit crunch breaks loose – I mean, we’re real happy with where we are with our PCI retailers. But, that’s what’s making it change but still we have not lost sight at all in terms of really keeping the tenant quality high.
Martin E. Stein, Jr.: Let me get back to Jeff’s question and I think that we do expect some growth in non-transaction related FFO to occur as developments lease up, and some of that leasing has already occurred, we’re just not getting the income from that right now because those leases come in to place from G&A savings. So, I think if you take transaction income aside, we are expecting some pretty meaningful growth in what I call non-transaction related FFO. That doesn’t include much growth in same store.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Michael W. Mueller – J. P. Morgan.
Michael W. Mueller – J. P. Morgan: Bruce, can you clarify your comments on G&A? If we’re looking at the G&A that’s actually hitting the P&L, it’s not capitalized, how much lower is what you’re talking about it could be in ’09 versus ’08?
Bruce M. Johnson: ’09 over ’08 is $6.2 million net.
Michael W. Mueller – J. P. Morgan: And that’s expense?
Bruce M. Johnson: Correct. That would be the amount that we showed that would be expense difference.
Michael W. Mueller – J. P. Morgan: Then if we’re looking at I guess the margins Brian laid out for maybe 15% to 20% on the development gains next year lower than what it has been running, it seems like volumes would have to be a little bit higher. Can you just talk about, I know you don’t have the crystal ball right now but when you look at what could be contributed or sold next year, does it look like it’s going to be a mix of stuff going to the take out fund as well as third parties? Or, is it more heavily skewed one way or the other?
Bruce M. Johnson: There will be a component that is going to effectively meet, two properties that will meet the open end fund and the rest will be third party base [inaudible] beyond to the funded [inaudible] if that get’s expanded.
Lisa Palmer: We’ve gone as far as to give you that exact number for the fund contributions on that balance sheet attached to these slides, of what we expect in terms of the cash coming in.
Bruce M. Johnson: We’ve also identified and as I indicated, one of the key initiatives that we have is to have a joint venture or co-investment partnership in place as it may relate to grocery anchored shopping centers.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Nathan Isbee – Stifel Nicolaus.
Nathan Isbee – Stifel Nicolaus: You had spoken before about the higher development yields that you’re going to be demanding on the future projects, can you just address the current land inventory much of which was bought above current market value and your ability to get to those higher yields using that land?
Brian M. Smith: The things that would keep the returns from immediately getting up to the level we’re talking about, one of those reasons is the land held. Overall, for the projects we think will go forward we’ve got about $350 million of ultimate development costs and the return on that would be probably in the low 9s in terms of 10s. We’ve got some projects that are mid 10s to almost 12% but overall they look pretty darn viable in the low 9s.
Nathan Isbee – Stifel Nicolaus: So talking about that 200 basis point spread it doesn’t make sense to build those to a 9% or low 9s?
Brian M. Smith: No.
Bruce M. Johnson: Wait a second, it does make sense to build those because in effect we’re converting the land in to an earning asset. 
Nathan Isbee – Stifel Nicolaus: I guess in a perfect world you never would have bought it but now you have it you could find a way to monetize it?
Bruce M. Johnson: Yes.
Operator:  Your next question comes from [Avi Learner] – Robert W. Baird & Co.
[Avi Learner] – Robert W. Baird & Co.: I was wondering, related to your joint ventures are you seeing any interest either from new partners or expanding or extending relationships from existing partners?
Martin E. Stein, Jr.: I would say that there is a good change that it will be an expansion from an existing partner or partners.
[Avi Learner] – Robert W. Baird & Co.: That’s in negotiation or are you pretty close?
Martin E. Stein, Jr.: More to come on that regard. As I indicated, this is something that’s important for us and now is not exactly the best time to be having discussion right now with folks and we’re going to do this on a proactive but thoughtful and diligent basis.
Bruce M. Johnson: This initiative is not a new initiative, actually it’s something we’ve been talking about for over six months. It’s something that’s been on our to-do list for some time.
[Avi Learner] – Robert W. Baird & Co.: Secondly, with regard to those projects eligible for the open end fund, are you taking any steps either promotions or TIs to generate more leasing velocity in those projects?
Mary Lou Fiala: No, we’re really not. I think we’re in pretty good shape for the projects that will be contributed in to the fund and we haven’t really seen a tick up in that at all so no.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Michael Bilerman – Citigroup.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: The note receivable balance went up about $35 million, was that a note relative to the developments that were sold in the quarter, or was that something else?
Bruce M. Johnson: That was related to the properties we contributed to the Oregon fund.
Mary Lou Fiala: In fact, in Bruce’s comments he noted the $43 mortgage at a 6.85% coupon that we are very close to getting commitment for. That is to repay the $35 million note for Oregon.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: And you don’t adjust anything on your gain calculation when you provide seller financing?
Bruce M. Johnson: No, as long as it is market rate financing.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: Then just coming back just to make sure I understand 4Q relative to what has happened this year and next year, the G&A specifically I think you talked about it being – just trying to back in to it it’s about $16 million in the fourth quarter, if total G&A was up $3 million for the year?
Martin E. Stein, Jr.: That would be close enough for drill I think.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: Then you’re saying when you look at totality for next year you’re going to be $6 million less?
Bruce M. Johnson: Yes.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: Is there anything in the fourth quarter that would be affecting that a $0.85? In Marylou’s comments I heard something about lease term fees. I don’t know if that was already received or to be received or anything on out parcel gains?
Mary Lou Fiala: It was received.
Lisa Palmer: In October. 
Mary Lou Fiala: In October right, so it was in the fourth quarter but we’ve already received it in October. We obviously didn’t state it in third quarter numbers.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: And that was $2 million?
Mary Lou Fiala: It was $2.6.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: Is there an expectation at the low end of this guidance for additional lease term fees or any out parcel gain?
Bruce M. Johnson: No, not from our perspective at this point.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Jim Sullivan – Green Street Advisors, Inc.
Jim Sullivan – Green Street Advisors, Inc.: Can you help me understand a little bit better which assets under development are merchant building assets? As I’m looking at the dispositions during the quarter it’s more confusing than it has been as to what you consider to be merchant building and what you don’t especially with respect to assets on which you’ve taken depreciation. 
Mary Lou Fiala: I’m not sure we understand the question. I think historically that we’ve always said that everything we build we’re willing to hold long term and clearly some of these single tenant properties that are currently on the market and expected to be sold were identified at the beginning as likely candidates to be sold at completion although we’d be comfortable holding them. So, there’s really no merchant build program.
Martin E. Stein, Jr.: Jim, are you specifically referring to the four assets that we’re contributing to partnerships?
Jim Sullivan – Green Street Advisors, Inc.: Yes. It looks like where there were gains over gross book value those were merchant building and where there was a loss in one case it was not considered merchant building. I’m just trying to understand that.
Brian M. Smith: You referred to a loss?
Jim Sullivan – Green Street Advisors, Inc.:  Yes, Independence Square.
Bruce M. Johnson: I think Independence was really tied in with a portfolio sale that we did with Waterford which was driving that loss but I think it was a very, very slight amount, wasn’t it?
Jim Sullivan – Green Street Advisors, Inc.: That’s the confusion, what’s an operating property versus a merchant build property for purposes of your accounting.
Bruce M. Johnson: Which schedule are you referring to?
Jim Sullivan – Green Street Advisors, Inc.: This call has gotten long, I’ll take it offline with you but I think that would be helpful to have some clarity?
Bruce M. Johnson: We’ll look at that Jim. I think I understand your point now and that’s a fair comment.
Jim Sullivan – Green Street Advisors, Inc.: Then secondly, Brian I’ve heard comments on the call with respect to the development pipeline about further reducing the amount of shop space which would seem to be the right thing to do but hurt your overall yield because of the differential in rents. Then I’ve also heard comments with respect to extending the lease up period which would seem to increase your carrying costs yet when I look at the development yields that you’re showing I believe they’re down 3 basis points this quarter versus last quarter.  How could you reduce the shop space and extend the lease up and not negatively impact your yields on what’s underway by more than say 3 basis points?
Brian M. Smith: Well, first of all most of that Jim we did in prior quarters. We’re at 40 months this quarter but we were pretty close to that last quarter, it might have been just a couple of months different. So, we’ve already taken those impacts which already lowered the returns down to where they are right now. 
Bruce M. Johnson: Just to be clear, the reduction in shop space is on the pipeline, the increase in the lease up time is on what’s in process which is already what’s underway Jim.
Jim Sullivan – Green Street Advisors, Inc.: Finally, the lease termination fee, can you provide a little more detail on that, that’s a pretty big number?
Lisa Palmer: Yes, we had a shopping center in Austin Texas that was an Albertsons. So, we accepted their lease termination fee. It was one of those leases where a third party had owned it, we’re very happy to get $2.6 million, we’re already working on another anchor that’s a strong anchor that would go in to that space so it really is a win/win.  Like I said, we’re seeing this a lot and I think it just helps everybody to understand, some of these vacancies that have come open and available we really feel are huge opportunities to upgrade the quality of the retailer in our centers and this is an example of one of them. So, in the short term it’s painful, in the long term it’s real good news and we have a lot of good news that I think you’re going to be seeing over the next year and especially the year after.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Michael Bilerman – Citigroup.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: On the $400 million of stabilized developments that are sort of held to sell or to hold, what’s the current yield on that? Specifically, is there more upside to go as you think about leasing up or is it really the leasing from –
Bruce M. Johnson: I think the range is 9% to 9.5%. I’m pretty sure the $400 million is north of 9%
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: Already? 
Bruce M. Johnson: Already and they’re already over 95% leased.
Lisa Palmer: Mike, my best guess would be it’s slightly north of 9.5%.
Bruce M. Johnson: It is north of 9%.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: And you’re really thinking then on the $1.1 billion of the sort of construction in progress of which you’ve already spent which is obviously a very low yield today, under 2% as you are just in the lease up process that that’s where, even if you don’t sell these assets next year, as you start to lease up and get more income you’ll get that FFO accretion?
Bruce M. Johnson: Right. We refer to that as new development NOI. That doesn’t show up in same store.
Brian M. Smith: But if you take the amount that are leased today and the cost to complete exclusive of any future phases that we’re not committed to today, the current in place return is real close to 6%. Also, I want to note something else, getting back to Nate’s question about land, to the extent we’ve got about $175 million, $200 million of land on the books, to the extent that we’re able to convert that land to 9% returns that’s $18 million a year in FFO, not gains but constant FFO that is out there.  Obviously to the extent those assets could be sold is a portion of that but – even though, yes could we buy those assets at lower value today, yes but I think for the most part we feel real good about the future potential of those land assets that we own.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: Then my last question is just some of the downside analysis Bruce that you prepared which is very helpful, that assumes zero development starts in 2009 and 2010?
Bruce M. Johnson: That is correct. What we show you is effecting the guidance for 2008.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: Where you are today?
Bruce M. Johnson: The $30 million is the only new component that is in that analysis.
Operator:  At this time there are no further questions. Mr. Stein I’ll turn the conference back over to you for closing comments.
Martin E. Stein, Jr.: We appreciate your time and you can be assured that we are focused to move Regency forward in these challenging times but feel that we’re going to be well positioned as I indicated not only to survive but also to thrive. Everybody have a great day. Thank you.
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen this will conclude the Regency Centers Corporation third quarter 2008 earnings conference call. We thank you for your participation and you may disconnect at this time.

===== 2008 Q2  (2008-08-07 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Jamie Shelton - VP of Real Estate Accounting Hap Stein - Chairman and CEO Bruce Johnson - CFO Brian Smith - CIO Lisa Palmer - SVP of Capital Markets Chris Leavitt - SVP, Finance and Treasurer
Analysts: Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs Jeff Donnelly - Wachovia  Paul Morgan - FBR Investments Christine Mcelroy - Banc of America Securities Michael Mueller - JPMorgan Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors Michael Gorman - Credit Suisse Chris Lucas - Robert W. Baird
Operator: At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Regency Centers Corporation second quarter 2008 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jamie Shelton, Vice President of Real Estate Accounting. Please go ahead, sir.
Jamie Shelton: Thank you, Pauline and good morning. On the call this morning are Hap Stein, Chairman and CEO; Bruce Johnson, CFO; Brian Smith, Chief Investment Officer; Lisa Palmer, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets; and Chris Leavitt, Senior Vice President and Treasurer. Unfortunately, Mary Lou has come down with a stomach virus or food poisoning and despite her best efforts, was unable to join us this morning. Before we start, I would like to address forward-looking statements that may be addressed on the call. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors, which could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. I will now turn the call over to Hap.
Hap Stein: Thanks, Jamie. Good morning. Unfortunately, although Mary Lou is not really healthy right now, we expect her to be back on her feet. Lisa Palmer will be covering the operations portions of the call. As we complete the first half of what we expected to be a very challenging year, the team and I would like to spend this time looking forward to the rest of 2008 and to the future. In addition to providing color behind the numbers, I'd ask the team to share Regency's strategies to meet the goals we set, given today's very challenging environment. The economic weakness seen among the capital markets are being expressed, moderated tenant demand, peer to capital availability, even riseng cap rates. Bruce will begin with a description of the steps that are being taken to execute Regency's capital recycling strategy, [though] the balance sheet remains strong, with reliable access both internal and external sources. Lisa, who as I mentioned will be filling in for Mary Lou will then highlight the resilience of the operating portfolio, both the expanding and contracting retailers and the impact on Regency's portfolio, plus the major measures which are being implemented to maintain 95% occupancy.. Finally Brian will elaborate in process development including the steps being taken into this 95% for maintaining occupancy and the increase scrutiny that has been given to new development opportunity to make sure that precious capital been carefully, diligently relieved. Bruce?
Bruce Johnson: Thank you, Hap, and good morning to Mary Lou and everyone else on the call. When the capital markets are in turmoil and availability is severely constrain capital just [came]. The need for a strong balance sheet and access to reliable sources of capital is more critical than ever. As a result key ratios, buying balances, future sources and usage of funds and the development inventory are being closely monitored to ensure that we maintain our strong balance sheet access to capital. Thanks to a [considerable level] of our stewardship, the balance sheet is in great shape, there is currently 573 million of availability onto our recently upsize bank lines. In addition, assuming an average cap rate of 7% there is a $660 million of estimated total value from developments with approximately $180 million of estimated gains. These developments are currently 96% lease and together we have committed capacities from our co-investment partnerships provide a significant amount of visibility in meeting both Regency's future recycling and transaction profit objectives. You'll note that we have modified guidance for contributions to co-investment partners. The revised guidance reflects a plan to contribute five centers and a gross value of $170 million. We'll contribute two properties for the open end fund by year end. Silver Spring Square and Phase IV of Vista Village and the other three centers are targeted for contribution to another co-Investment Partnership. To change the plan was the decision to delay the contribution one larger community center to the open end fund. Although the center was 95% leased last quarter and cost to 95% was rent, the rent payments for the last month, we have 270 days from that [trigger to deplete] the contribution. We planned to use the allotted time to allow us to maximize value with additional leasing which we expect to happen in early 2009. With this delay contribution of a larger center in order to meet our capital recycling needs we've had a two smaller grocery anchored centers from our completed developed inventory through our plan. Mortgage financing has entered books of the growth of the co-investment partnerships because CMBS market in disarray and banks suffering through their world publicized problems. Insurance companies remained the one reliable source for longer term financing. Insurance planners are focusing their limited capacity and making low leverage mortgage loans 50% to 60% of value on high quality assets to select by borrowers. These conservative guidelines fit Regency’s co-investment partnerships very well and we have been working closely with a handful of companies with whom we want to grow our relationships. In fact, last month we received commitments in lock rate for almost $110 million of new and re-financed mortgages in average all in coupon rate of 6.3%. Progress is also made with the disposition of operating profits. During the quarter a seven property Mid Atlantic portfolio of [(B) minus and (C) centers] was closed. The purchase price of $108 million represented a 7.75% cap rate. The [Emanuel's] anchored center in Texas was also sold by the Oregon partnership at a 6.5% cap rate or $13.8 million. We do feel that selling B&C centers will be more challenging in the months ahead. Bank finance in the high leverage levels in the 75% range that buyers have typically required to purchase in non-investment grade properties appears to drying up. This may mean that on a select basis Regency may provide [the sellers time] as long as we have a meaningful investment by the buyer to move targeted properties from the operating portfolio. Finally, I want to remind investors that it is less than $85 million of consolidated debt maturing to September 2010. Lisa?
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone. Before I share with you the story behind the numbers, our view of the future and color on some of the key markets where our properties are located, it is worth noting how remarkably well Regency's portfolio is holding up in the space of the weakening economy and moderating of [retail] demand for space. While our NOI growth for Regency's 100% own portfolio and share of partnerships was 2.2% for the quarter and 2.6% year-to-date., the total portfolio has 3.4% NOI growth in the quarter and 2.9% year-to-date. Occupancy for the whole portfolio remained above 95%. Rental rate growth was 9.2% for the quarter and 1.3 million square feet of new leases and renewals were signed. We are specially gratified that our portfolio has remained approximately 95% lease. We believe that is a testament, not only to the quality of our real-estate, but also to the proactive measures we have in place to navigate the current retail environment. Today, even more of a premium is being placed on the quality of the centers. [Post Street Park] in the Bay area is an example where we proactively replaced the struggling tenant. We terminated a 15,000 square foot national furniture store and negotiated a $600,000 termination fee. The new lease was executed in July with the new tenant at a 9% higher rent with no loss in rent during the transition period. The other component of Regency strategy to maintain occupancy is to renew a high percentage of our existing tenants. Year-to-date, we've renewed 82%, which is impressive and higher than our historical averages. This includes proactively approaching anchors to renew early, as was the case with Target at Pleasant Hill and and [Randall's at Wesley and Plaza]. Pleasant Hill is located in the Bay area with high surrounding income. Target lease was set to expire in November of 2009 with no remaining firmer options. We signed a renewal at significantly higher rent and longer term. Renewing them really solidifies our presence early in our center. Rent growth remains solid and we expect to end the year within our guidance range of 8% to 10%, and this growth is being achieved with only a modest increase in tenant improvements. Maintaining 95% occupancy is the main challenge that we face in the operating portfolio, while tenant move-outs have not increased above historic annual average of about 3.5% of GLA, moderating tenants demand is increasing downtime. This period with a year ago averaged approximately eight-month is now about nearly a month. However, it’s important to keep in mind that while demand is moderated, retailers still want to keep the good locations and quality shopping centers and both anchors and PCI tenants are still expanding into the best locations.  For example, as we all know, even though Starbucks announced the closure of 600 stores of which Regency only has six and even though they were the largest landlords, they are still slated to open seven new stores in our portfolio. Not all retailers are impacted equally by the decline of discretionary spending, in fact some continue to grow. Luxury goods, department stores and apparel stores all saw a negative year-over-year sales growth in the first half of 2008. But grocery, drugs and discount stores saw a positive growth. And as we've said even during these tougher times these historically 90% of the categories in Regency centers have had a flat to positive comps in recessions but even more importantly this year over 50% of the retail categories in our centers are still enjoying 3% plus comp store sales growth.  Before I turn it over to Brian, I would like to give you a little regional favor. Florida and California are two states where the housing slowed down and potential fallout on shopping centers have garnered a lot of attention. Our business remains a corner business, although a few of our Florida centers are certainly experiencing a slowdown, occupancy for our operating properties in Florida remains above 95%. Rental rate growth has been about 8% and same-property NOI is positive and forecasted to exceed 2% for the year. Regency has minimal exposure in California to the markets that been hurt by the housing crisis. Our California properties are enjoying strong same store growth of over 3%, 97% occupancy and rent growth across the state that averages double digits. Texas is another positive story. Occupancy is improving and thanks to the proactive early renewal and expansion of several anchors, same store growth is in excess of 2% and rental rate growth above 10%.  On the other hand, as we've discussed in the past, the region which -- what still appears the least promising future prospectus remains the Midwest. Same-property NOI growth is essentially flat in that region. However, it's of note that Midwest only represents 8.5% of Regency's total net operating income. The important thing is that we plan for these challenges. There is downtime and pressure all round, moderating tenant demands and declining consumer spending but the persistence of our team, the inherit quality and cycle resistant nature of the portfolio and retailers' strong desire to operate in the best location gives us confidence that we can achieve same-property growth on Regency's share of the operating portfolio of 2.4% or higher. Brian?
Brian Smith: Thanks, Lisa. Well, as you heard from the others here today and on past calls, we are operating in a very different and challenging environment. Due at these times, the investment group is focused on; first, carrying out our role and preserving the company's strong balance sheet. We do this by working hard to stabilize the in-process projects to maximize their value. Second, using this recycle capital to selectively pursue investment opportunities where we can create high quality shopping centers and generate track of returns. In terms of the in-process projects, we are fortunate to have a large, diversified portfolio of projects underway. As I said last quarter, of the 48 projects that are in-process, there are 9 that have experienced weaker demand with the downturn in housing. Five of these are straight forward neighborhood centers whose grocery sales are good and we expect these projects to be solid long-term holds. These involvements are 85% leased, the other four are larger community centers that because of their size and amount of small shop space will take longer to lease which is one of the reason why we are facing these larger projects. Assuming no phasing and full build out these centers are nearly 70% leased. These larger projects are ones we believe in strongly and ones on long-term. Each enjoys the dominant location within its respective market and each has generated strong anchor demand. But the reduction in housing activity has slowed shop leasing. Let me give you one example, Deer Springs in North Las Vegas submarket is very well anchored by Target, Home Depot, Babies and Toys "R"Us, PetSmart, Staples and others, without question it enjoys the premier location in that submarket. And when the housing growth returns it will be extremely successful. We reduced guidance for 2008 stabilizations. What is driving the reduced completion guidance for the year are Anthem Highland in Las Vegas and Shops of Highland Village in Dallas. Anthem is 90% leased and Highland Village is 82%. But given the tougher leasing environment we don't expect them to reach 95% leasing threshold by year end. Although it is taking longer to stabilize, some projects quarterly returns on the $1.1 billion of in-process developments on apples-to-apples basis are down only 10 basis points. Our Deer Springs project in the North Las Vegas sub-market accounts for six of those 10 basis points, while Red Bank in Cincinnati represents two basis points. The other 46 centers combined account for the remaining two basis points. While the environment is tough we are making progress and on a portfolio basis we are holding our own. Returns have held up and there has been leasing progress. Still, we have much to do and are taking the following steps to ensure the success of these projects in today's world. Where demand for shop space is soft, we will face the construction of the space. We have underwritten lower rents where we believe the market is new or where we believe its necessary to attract the right high traffic generating retailers. We are creating additional leasing incentives and have allowed more time in our models to lease up the space. Finally, we are focusing even greater amount of our efforts on the leasing of the in-process projects by reallocating our more seasoned and top talent to focus on the more challenging projects. Now the silver lining; we continue to see an environment that increasingly favors strong developers with solid retail relationships and the ability to fund projects of their balance sheets. These opportunities are getting better even in the phase of the current slow down as the competition disintegrates. The sum-up question is, whether the risks outweigh the rewards in today's environment and I would like to interject my thoughts on this.  First of all this is a cyclical business, projects we are working on now will not be open for years to come, at which point the current economic woes, will hopefully be a distant memory. Second, there are always good development opportunities. But we take more work to find and the risk surrounding those opportunities must be weighed carefully. Most of the anchor retailers are still expanding including many of the grocers such as Publix and Kroger but also Target, Lowe's Kohl's, off price software retailers off supply stores and others.  As we've reported quarters ago, these retailers would just as soon push all 2008 openings in the later years, but they are actively looking to fill 2010 and 2011 opening slots. We were very mindful of the risks and the environment in which we find ourselves, but we will not build for the sake of building and will only start new projects if they make a compelling sense.  So far this year we have moved almost $300 million in high probability 2008 starts. It’s either a lower probability category or we push them in the 2009 or beyond retailers want to open. I'll address specific 2008 starts at the moment, but first I would like to address, how we are tackling the risk we are facing. First of all, we have raised our return guidelines for new development commitments 59%, to some projects already [touching] higher. The high returns will likely not start showing up until 2010 given long lead time required to bring a project to the point where it’s ready to start. We've also tightened our underwriting with longer leased-up times and more conservative rents brands being a model. As has been discussed previously, we are planning fewer side shops spaces and are focusing on more infill demographics, and those areas with higher purchasing power, this is where the top retailers want to be. We are also requiring more pre-leasing before we close them [a land]. We are planning to start $300 to $425 million of new development in 2008, this is about at $100 million lower than our guidance last quarter hence appropriate given the comments we just made. We currently expect to start 12 new projects this year and I do believe they are compelling. Four of them are bread and butter grocery anchored neighborhood centres. Three of the starts will be second or third phase as of existing successful projects with limited or some in one case no shop space to lease.  One of the projects we discussed last quarter is a rare opportunity to find property on the San Francisco Peninsula and a great infill location in East Palo Alto that enjoys extraordinary demographics. We purchased the vacant Home Depot Expo building so this investment contains no entitlement, development or construction risk.  Within weeks of closing on the purchase, we executed two anchor leases bringing the building to 100% lease. This investment should generate double-digit and millions in profits. At least four community centers, one is the Target [loads] anchored project that we were working on for years and got fully entitled but the project was stopped through a legal challenge. That litigation is now behind us and we are ready to go.  In Northern California, we'll build a center anchored by Target Toys "R" Us, Babies "R" Us and Nordstrom Rack. In fact, it’s a last parcel of retail land that we know of in the bay area situated on the interchange with an interstate freeway. And other is in the Metro Miami area in a very densely populated and under retailed area over 90% of this center is least or an active negotiation. Final project is located at the entrance to the best mall in the area with a half mile of the frontage on the city's main highway. Retailer demand there is incredible.  In short, these are in my mind compelling opportunities worthy of our capital investment. If necessary we'll delay any of these projects, as circumstances dictate we may add to them. This is quarter, we are approached either by anchor retailers or by financially strapped local developers with at least twelve very intriguing development opportunities. Turmoil creates opportunities and Regency is seeing a lot of opportunity in this turmoil.  Make no mistake about though margins particularly on the in process projects have been effected by downward pressure on rents, retailers, particularly the junior anchors, exercising leverage they believe they have and being very deliberate as in their decision making. Shop retailers in many cases are out of the market and cap rates are expected to rise. But in spite of these pressures we still expect net margins to be approximately 20% after fully allocating G&A costs. Looking out in to the 2010 and 2011 pipeline, we should see somewhat expanding development returns thanks to lower land prices and [hidden] costs. Given the lack of competition and the resulting, plus our quality development opportunities are things the local partners are finding, we have a luxury of sorting the week from the [chart] is taking only the best of the available opportunities. Hap?
Hap Stein: Thank you, Brian, Lisa and Bruce. Regency did have a solid quarter, the growth and the value of the operating portfolio continues to be remarkably resilient. The end process developments in spite of the longer lease up tenants should create significant value even after factoring in our cap rates in lower margins. There seems to be a number of extremely attractive new development opportunities, they are coming our way and would appear to be higher returns and higher margins. Most important of all between a large inventories of developments that are completed in lease, available capital from the co-investment partnerships the bank to sell all these, there is a tremendous amount of visibility and not only realize development gains but also to maintain a pristine balance sheet. As good as these recent results look in the rear view mirror, the road ahead promises to be in to a place of pretty speed bumps from both the economy and from the capital markets. And Regency will certainly not be immune to the effects of longer lease-up time on occupancies and the operating portfolio and developments, lower development margins for higher cap rate, cautious vendors and co-investment partners. As you've heard from the team, proactive steps are been taken, to shore up [pre-payer] for worsening conditions in each part of the business. The bank facilities were substantially expanded earlier this year and the co-investment partnerships have been in place as reliable take-out vehicles for developments. The capital markets team is working closely with the handful of permanent lenders to ensure the flow of mortgage loans for co-investment partnerships. Regency's tried and true investment focus has enabled us to build a high quality portfolio. It should weather the storm in the downturn relatively well and we've been pruning weaker assets for years. Basing of the development pipeline is receiving a huge amount of attention. And achieving and maintaining 95% occupancy in the operating portfolio in new developments is the top priority for both operations and investments. Although the number of opportunities from local developers and retailers look extremely interesting, new developments will be scrutinized to make sure that they are truly compelling investments for Regency. G&A expenses and the number of employees are been fully and carefully monitored, while keeping the team engaged, focused and motivated. Although this current downturn feels like it might be pretty nasty, the Regency's management team have been through this and I've been through these cycles before. As a matter of fact, many of the legacy shopping centers in Florida and California repurchased on what it now looks like unbelievably favorable basis after the last severe real-estate downturn that was caused by the [housing] melt down and the recession of 1990 and 91. We believe that we continue to execute using sound cautious judgment and conditions don't deteriorate much further we can achieve FFO per share growth within the guidance range, which we provided for this year. In addition and more importantly, we should be well positioned for the future to meaningfully grow FFO intrinsic value and push share basis to our strong balance sheet and access the capital, high quality assets, operating and development expertise and tenant and partnership relationships.  We also realized that is not too far from the realm of possibility where conditions in the economy and financial markets do deteriorate beyond even what our current conservative expectations are. And we are taking the necessary actions to make sure that if the unforeseen does happen, Regency will be able to withstand some pretty severe additional body blows until the cycle does and return in the right direction again. We appreciate your time and I'll be glad to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question will come from Michael Bilerman with Citi.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup: Good morning. If you could go out also with me as well. Brian it was very helpful in laying out your thoughts on development. Can you give just little bit more granular detail, you talked about lowering the amount of starts for this year and you talked about the project that have comprised the 300 to 400. Can you talk a little bit about the projects that delayed and then anything else as you went through that process when you looked at your potential '09 and 2010 starts that you decided to pass on or just delay indefinitely. Just give a little bit more color about those steps that you are taking.
Brian Smith: I think in some cases where we have the flexibility to just push them off at the end of it where we have long options periods and everything then if the retailers are saying that they would prefer to wait then we can accommodate that easily and we push them out. Some of the projects that we have just dropped would be those where the junior anchors may have tried to just exercise a little bit more leverage on us. That would have had an impact on the returns we decided it was not worth going forward with those.  However, for the most part, the pipeline remains about the same, its about 1.65 billion which is about 150 million less it was last year this time. That is because they like the opportunities, they like the location and everybody feels that we would push them off a little bit. We would like to do that.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup: You talked a little bit about yields coming down, lower rents, additional incentives, more time to lease up, you have said 10 basis point on the active pipeline but 80% of that was two projects. So I am surprised you hear all this caution. However, then the actuality of it rolling through your yields, you cannot really see so I am just trying to piece it together. Is it more so on the future pipeline or you expect the yield as you move through this and as you start to see when rents will come out, will come down?
Brian Smith: I think on our active in process pipeline we have already reflected the head. I mean we rolled several of the projects down in prior quarters. This quarter Deer Springs took a much bigger hit because we lowered rents across the board. We have lowered it on anchored sub space and on ground leases so that was a big hit. However, most of them in number have already been reflected, we have pushed back our lease up period from 31 months at the beginning of the year to 39 months currently. So it is not a big surprise to us. I think going forward, we are just being much more cautions in our underwriting as I said we have got fewer shop space. We have already reflected the lower rents. That is why I think you are continuing to see a dip, rents slightly sub 9 in 2008 starts, 2009 should be somewhere about the same as 2010, we are already seeing right now returns of 9.5% to 10% range.
Hap Stein: We are able to exercise a little bit more leverage with land auctions.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup: Then as a second question. I do not know if that was talked.
Lisa Palmer: I think that is two hours.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup: That is considered too. I will get in a queue.
Brian Smith: You can get back and ask again.
Lisa Palmer: We will welcome you back.
Operator: Moving on from Goldman Sachs, we will hear from Jay Habermann.
Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs: Hey good morning, here with John as well. You know obviously given your more cautious comments. I just wanted to zero in on the transaction based income you have baked in to your fourth quarter. Are you expecting a number around $1.70 based on full year guidance? Can you just give us a little bit more comfort obviously on the assets that will be sold or are you anticipating will be sold in and are you just sure of your comfort level there?
Lisa Palmer: Well, I will speak for the co-investment partnerships and have Brian or someone else speak to the third party sale. I think in Bruce's comments, he spoke about that we have a $170 million plan for contribution to our co-investment partnerships and you can use average margins on those, so they are how much of the transaction profits are going to be coming from those to buy the properties that we are selling. Two of them are going to be going to the fund. We specifically name them, Silver Spring Square and Visa Village IV. Silver Spring is a target Wegmans anchored center that meets all of the criteria of must offer, must pay and Bruce referred to the 95% trigger date. While the trigger date on Silver Spring was in the first quarter of this year, so that absolutely will be fabulous to the partnership for year end. The one thing that is going to be on the value. It is subject to appraisal. We do believe early indications that the appraisal is going to more than support what the price is going to be for that property. The second, Vista Village really just a small property, it is a Phase IV an existing property that is already in the front. So the comfort level on those two is extremely strong than the other three are three first rankers, completed developments from our completed development inventory that we have talked about in past quarters. We have already are in the process of working with one of our other partners despite those and I would say the comfort level on those is north of 90%.
Bruce Johnson: Yes I am not sure we can say much more than we what we said other than the fact that we, you will note that the guidance remain exactly what was last quarter and we have just recently again went through all of those transactions that we expect to occur in the next two quarter period. Feel exactly as our guidance has indicated.
Lisa Palmer: We understand that is important for us to be transparent and perhaps have these transaction purposes visible as possible which is why we are really trying to give you as much detail as we can.
Hap Stein: All those centers are over 95% lease and pretty most being sold to third parties and we feel the cap rates were using our probably average 7% and plus. 
Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs:  Okay that is helpful. Just second question you mentioned….
Brian Smith: Jay, just went over the comment there and then I did give us some background, which is the premises we are talking about the development in our inventory that is available because that is really where our transparency and comfort should come from with transaction process.
Hap Stein:  It just reiterate that Bruce and I gave a number of $650 million with the properties were 96% leased and have a estimated value of 7% cap rate of $180 million.
Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Then just second question, you mentioned the opportunities where some cash strapped developers have approached you. Can you give us a sense of what types of returns you might be able to extract there and even the dollar amount of those opportunities? How did that pipeline compare to, your existing development inventory?
Brian Smith: I do not have the exact number of them, but there is many, I got a couple of dozen of them, they we are working on right now. The returns are above what is our returns are as we talked about. They are now slightly sub nine, in many cases the returns are better, but you know you got put in the ones that stay in, so the net returns are averaging about where they are. We also where we can, connect, exert leverage for the seller and try to boost those returns. So, I see in the short-term over the next 6-12 months we are probably looking again right around nine, maybe a little less than nine, but for some of these opportunities that are further out, we are getting much better returns.
Hap Stein:  Some others are baked into the pipeline. Some are in lower profitability right now as they work their way through.
Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Wishing my best to Mary Lou for a speedy recovery. Thanks.
Hap Stein: Thanks Jay. I know she will appreciate that.
Operator: Next we will go to Jeff Donnelly with Wachovia.
Jeff Donnelly - Wachovia : Good morning and I have concern for Mary Lou as well. A question about occupancy and how you see it pacing out to the end of the year, can you give me a type of net absorption through year end and I was curious, if you could talk a little bit more about that and does your guidance anticipate, any cushion for more retailer losses between now and then?
Lisa Palmer: I will try to be my best Mary Lou. With regards to our occupancy it has remained unchanged, guidance that is and we do expect it to increase by year end. If you recall what we keep reiterating is that move outs are not higher than historic averages, its just taking longer to lease up. The occupancy guidance that we give of 94.9 to 95.1 is at year end the point in time. So, what is going to happen is you are going to, our average occupancy throughout the year is going to be lower than last year, the main driver behind life same store NOI growth is going to be lower than its been in the past years. So, if we execute our plans then we would expect to be within the range for both occupancy and same store NOI growth. As I have said what we believe, we have conservative but realistic expectations for our operations going forward.
Brian Smith: However, obviously things could deteriorate…
Lisa Palmer: They could deteriorate if you do not release it back.
Jeff Donnelly - Wachovia : Great and for my second question this might have two parts to it. I am curious what is happening with the scale, the overall scale of the shadow pipeline and just in Brian's comments he mentioned that I think you have raised your yield requirement to 9%, can you just remind us what it was previously on development?
Brian Smith: We had about 8.5 to 8.75 going forward in the past and now we wanted to be a minimum of 9%. Really what we are just trying to do is maintain about 200 basis points spread over exit cap rates.
Hap Stein: 20% margins what we are trading for on a net basis and I think quarter or two ago we raised the guideline to 8.75 from 8.5 which is where it was in beginning of the year. The other part of the question was the scale, the pipeline as Brian said the pipeline Jeff it is about the same as it is been. However, it is from our prospective the in evaluating opportunities, the cup is now so to speak half empty and the underwriting requirements are tougher, so it is going to be tougher to take that $1.6 billion of developments for them to get though to becomes start.
Jeff Donnelly - Wachovia : Anyway, thank you.
Operator: Next we will go to Paul Morgan with FBR Investments.
Paul Morgan - FBR Investments: Good morning. 
Brian Smith: Good morning.
Paul Morgan - FBR Investments: On the cap rates for the Cincinnati acquisition at 6.4%, I was a little surprised that how low that is and maybe you would talk about that. Then given the market there, what cap rate do you think that would have gone for if it were in DC or California or something and what does that say about where cap rates are generally?
Hap Stein: Well trends that they deal with basically contracts for about I supported though in December, we were the second highest bidder. We were not the highest bidder at the time, and it is taken us in to the quarter to end up closing. However I think that is one important factor as this reflects cap rates four, five months ago and vital throughout projects.
Brian Smith: Yes. It is a pretty great project and it is right at the best mall in that area. However, also there is some up sight in that. There are lots of things we had planned to go out and it has and we knew there is sight in that and then there is also an expensive parking field that allow for some potential new development expansion and then it wiped through that. So we think the returns will be significantly better than fixed rates.
Paul Morgan - FBR Investments: What do you think? How much that market location would have mattered and in this sense it was contracted for earlier, where do you think it would have? What is the difference between then and December and where do you think it would have traded now?
Brian Smith: Probably about 50 basis points and I think in California which still be in the part of the low six, its depending we are in California. The one thing that is happened with the cap rates is we use still and make blanket generic statements as to what they were and property was this. Now it has really become a function of two things, the quality of the asset, the A assets in the top block and the second thing would be which markets they are in. The A assets in the very best California and coastal markets are still trading in the low six's. We have gone after a couple of projects and been incredibly surprised at how low the Cap rates are. However you move after those major markets and they start rising pretty quickly in the B and C properties are well into the mid seven sometimes, the high seven’s simply because financing is so difficult for them and then you have got the lack of interest only debt, which is reducing the cash yield pushing those returns up even more.
Hap Stein: It is also the important to remember as Brian indicated this is the best location in Cincinnati. There is a good amount of embedded growth and there is a some significant upside potential beyond that.
Lisa Palmer: I was just going to add, that it is really difficult to always to look at the Cap rates in isolation, because of all the factors includes the growth profile that will be better.
Operator: Moving on from Banc of America Securities we will hear from Christine Mcelroy.
Christine Mcelroy - Banc of America Securities: Hey, good morning. Lisa just following up on Jeff’s question since I hear you are wearing Mary Lou's hat on today. On leasing, I think I ask this question every quarter but just looking for an update on what are you seeing on the small shop side. Are incrementally more nervous today about bankruptcies and store closings there?
Lisa Palmer: Well first, I will say, I did not dye my hair blonde for the call. No, again, we are certainly monitoring really cost profile of all tenants and specifically moms and pops and our balance is very closely we have seen only a very modest uptick in bad debt expense. So going forward we are not seeing it yet, we are not necessarily expecting to, but again to explain, things could deteriorate further, but at this time we still believe that we are going to be in terms of historical trends, in terms of move assets of small shop space.
Bruce Johnson: Christy, we look at, we talked about move-outs forum and all those are similar but we also look at early move outs which is better indication in terms of – from my perspective in terms of what is going on with those types of tenants and that also has not changed.
Lisa Palmer: In terms of the bankruptcies, yes, of the smaller shops we had no impact and then the bigger boxes that have been announced, Brian, alluded to rentals and things, we had three of our rentals and things actually closing. We had Annie Bergen’s and I think that is really hit up the bankruptcy.
Christy McElroy - Banc of America Securities: Then it seems like the grocers and other need-based retailers have held up fairly well until now. Do you see the potential for any softness there given rising input costs and continued pressure on the consumer?
Hap Stein: First of all I think the industry has been very rationalized and I think where that would be expressed, would be in demand for new stores as it relates to development. However, there it is not like they are growing at fast paces in anyway. However, I think for most part the grocers we have, have dominant shares in the market and even though like the merchants right now, we are being straying a little bit, a lot of gross sales are doing pretty well and being able to withstand the trade-down even as consumers trade now.
Christy McElroy - Banc of America Securities: So, you are still the demand there on the development side?
Hap Stein: We are still seeing a modest amount of demand. Demand was not like, I mean, has moderated significantly from where it was three to five years ago.
Christy McElroy - Banc of America Securities: Okay.
Hap Stein: So its tougher to moderate and I think we would anticipate a continuing when that…
Christy McElroy - Banc of America Securities: Thank you.
Hap Stein: Thank you, Christie.
Operator: Next we will go to Michael Mueller with JPMorgan.
Michael Mueller - JPMorgan: Yes. Hi. Hap the two questions are first can you comment or give us a little more detail on concessions, I think you talked about them picking up moderately and are they more skew toward shops or anchor times and then second question, can you comment on the open end fund, the appetite to take on more grocery anchored centers as opposed to a larger format on community centers?
Lisa Palmer: Sure Mike I think what we used to comment on the call is that we have had a modest increase in credit improvement. We have not really had any rate concessions and we actually disclose our [TIs] on page 24 in our supplemental and you can just see for example second quarter of 2008 which is slightly higher than the first quarter and for the year, when I say modest I mean a modest increase in TI's on the quarter, its nothing significant than we at least look for.
Michael Mueller - JPMorgan: What we are hearing today from the tenants is larger request for TI's that we are sending off to some extent, we are seeing much more of that which is exactly what you just expect?
Lisa Palmer: I think that we expect more in the development.
Brian Smith: Yes as soon as the expense on the projects that some development projects were actually outperforming our pro forma from NOIs and in others not much I see we are right on the rental rates where we have made some concessions would be in the very large projects that have a lot of space to lease and we have areas where we need more activity than we will for the right retailer go ahead and cut a more aggressive deal than we had originally underwritten, example of that would be our BestBuy and our India project or up in Northern California in the [Yap Border] project. Out front there is a lot of space, we needed a good anchor to generate activity there and there is a real demand the community for Jo-Ann Fabrics that went ahead and lowered grant there. That is more on an isolated basis as looking at each projects and what it means.
Lisa Palmer: As to the second question with the co-investment partnerships, they are certainly cautious. We all are, in today's environment, but they are still willing to acquire quality real estate and fortunately when you look at so the return thresholds of the two most active partnerships we have, but they are complimentary. One is very on current cap rates current yield focus and not so much on the actual growth whereas another one of our partners is less focused on the current cap rate and as long as we get the total returns and have the embedded growth in the property. However, again, they are cautious but the appetite is there.
Hap Stein: So they would be open to it but when they are outside, they must offer, must take, they are being very cautious.
Michael Mueller - JPMorgan: Okay, okay, thank you.
Operator: Moving on we will go to Jim Sullivan with Green Street Advisors.
Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors: Hi its [Jim Sullivan] here, just following up on the question about lease concession. Looks like the re-leasing spreads on the new leases that were signed over the past quarter were a lot smaller and narrower than they had been in the past. It also looks like the term that was signed was fairly large in about seven years. Can you talk about the new leases that are being signed and your effort to maintain occupancy if you are giving more concession, can you just talk about little bit more TI and what is your ability to gain that space or get that space back if the market does turn.
Lisa Palmer: Again let me just reiterate that we really have not been given great concession and our TI has only modestly increased. I mean again if you look at growth rate, it just on the margin and in terms of quarter, the rent growth for new leases, I think that was driven by one larger transactions more than other in an regular office set and if that is true, I will followup later, I will have Jamie comment on this. However, we also said is that we do expect rent growth to be in the 8% to 10% range. for the year that remains unchanged. It has been slightly higher on our news here to date and that is because it is just a little tougher to get new tenants into the spaces. So therefore more deliberate in their decision making. We are not just achieving the entire rent growth, we are more focused on the quality of this tenant than the rent growth in the spaces.
Bruce Johnson:  Just a follow up on Lisa's comment there. In some of the markets where we may have been holding out to sustain a higher rate growth that we did historically had, we are going ahead in leasing some of those spaces to quality tenants at a lower growth rate so if they can become rent paying and contribute to our operating portfolio NOI over the next twenty four months.
Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors: Are those tenants getting signed to longer weeks durations than they had in the past or it is somewhere in the trend?
Bruce Johnson:  These are similar in nature, some of those tenants that may be a little but not significantly done with the change in nature of how we have always negotiated lease terms. 
Hap Stein: This part may have been skewed but there are some wider spaces that were either renovated or they new leases signed.
Lisa Palmer:  In some cases especially in some of our newly completed developments that may leasing first, if this would have fall in the rent growth that were releasing first generation space. We are building in greater insteps in anticipation of the economy turning and tenants were willing to do that to get in to the space starting at a slightly lower rent but actually building a higher rent steps Q3 or abouts.
Operator: Next one will go to Michael Gorman with Credit Suisse.
Michael Gorman - Credit Suisse: Thanks good morning. Just a question going back to some of the co-investment programs, if you talk a little bit about plans for more asset sales out of the joint venture, are there any more opening market that are planned for the rest of the year, maybe how producible is the leverage there?
Lisa Palmer: Most comfortable say they have not reported, they have not had their calling yet, I do not think….
Michael Gorman - Credit Suisse: That is correct
Lisa Palmer: For the fiscal year I think it is probably best if, we do that jointly but I mean certainly we have said in the past that they had been focused on selling. We certainly have the same goal, we have joint goal of recycling capital and selling lower growth, higher risk factors, that will always continue throughout of our segment. We will look at that together in terms of selling beyond that I have said in the past and they we were focused on paying down the debt but I will differ until they report their quarter results I think later in this month.
Michael Gorman - Credit Suisse: Okay and this may fall under the same type of category, but can you talk…
Lisa Palmer: Not quite, I am sorry, I mean, our guidance includes our plans for that in term of our operating profits disposition, I mean that is one way for you to look at it. 
Michael Gorman - Credit Suisse: That is it. then just in terms of the earnings power I mean can you a little bit about I mean this is pretty wide spread between what Regency itself is doing what the prior is doing, can you just talk about that, I mean is it function of properties in the portfolio or is that the function of their or that may be the 40% of the portfolio that is not related to your side of things, I mean what is dragging down their earnings growth?
Hap Stein: We have got a significant investments in hedging. It is totally different. The pay out ratios are different and et cetera, et cetera and I just do not think…………..
Lisa Palmer: Yes, I think and again I was just really quickly, I was deferred to their earnings release later this month, again in terms of our results, if you look at our percent lease and our same property NOI and our rent growth, we show both our 100% loans plus our share and that we also show the whole portfolio and it happens to be that this quarter the 100%, the numbers are slightly better which would lead to you believe that the numbers that our total invest partnerships are better which would lead you to believe that MacQuarie our largest partner in the total investment partnerships with 150 plus properties, you would expect that their operating statistics are going to be very strong.
Hap Stein: Right, and the fundamentals and what they earn in the partnership are performing very well and it is just a different vehicle, different structure, etcetera. As Lisa said, its just not appropriate for us to go beyond that.
Operator: Next from Robert W. Baird, we will hear from Chris Lucas.
Chris Lucas - Robert W. Baird: Good morning everyone. Just as a follow-up on that point, what are the contributing factors to the better performance on the same store basis of the co-investment partnerships relative to your pro-rata share?
Brian Smith: The typically one year you may have termination fees pointing into that but one year one portfolio performed better than you are up against higher numbers, the lower numbers and they have redevelopments in there but all in all the portfolio is over a period of time and perform just pretty comfortably.
Chris Lucas - Robert W. Baird: Okay and then just a quick question on G&A, Bruce, what are the contributing factors to the 7% sequential decline in GNA?
Bruce Johnson: Just less expense with respect to; recruiting, it was part of that, some of our travel, some of our non-table related, if you look going forward I would think you would see just so we do not get people using our run rate of whether what we are showing today that basically I think is going to be another $14 million for the next two quarters in net G&A.
Hap Stein: I will say there is a less scrutiny throughout the organization. The controlling and reducing G&A cost we want to do it without impacting the effectiveness of the organization especially as it relates to the leasing of vacant space.
Chris Lucas - Robert W. Baird: Great, thanks a lot.
Hap Stein: Thank you.
Operator: We do have a follow-up from Michael Gorman.
Michael Gorman - Credit Suisse: Thanks. I just had a quick technical question. Looking at the results for the quarter in the development profits, I was wondering what I am missing since the first quarter if I recall it was just zero and in the second quarter, why does the 2Q number not match the year-to-date?
Lisa Palmer: If that was zero I do not know. I have to follow-up on that.
Michael Gorman - Credit Suisse: Okay, thank you.
Hap Stein: Thank you, Michael.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Cynthia and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like welcome everyone to the Regency Centers Corporation first quarter 2008 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Lisa Palmer, Senior Vice President, Capital Markets. Please go ahead, Madam. 
Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Cynthia. Good morning, everyone. On the call this morning are Martin Stein, Chairman and CEO; Mary Lou Fiala, President and COO; Bruce Johnson, Chief Financial Officer; Brian Smith, Chief Investment Officer; Chris Levitts, Senior Vice President and Treasurer; and Jamie Shelton, Vice President of Real Estate Accounting.  Before we start, I would like to address forward-looking statements that may be addressed on this call. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes, and results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on our Form 10-K and our 10-Q, which identify important risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements.  I will now turn the call over to Bruce. 
Bruce M. Johnson: Thank you, Lisa and good morning to you all. Regency posted strong results in the first quarter, which will provide positive momentum in the increasingly more challenging environment. As you will hear from the rest of the team, Regency is proactively taking measures across all areas of our business to address these challenges. Our top three priorities remain maintaining 95% occupancy in the operating portfolio, achieving 95% occupancy in the in-process developments, and preserving a strong balance sheet with ample funding capacity.  We carefully track funding sources in relation to funding requirements. Significant progress has been made ensuring that Regency has a substantial amount of capital to fund the development program and other compelling opportunities which may arise.  In March, we closed an additional three-year bank facility in the amount of $341.5 million. With this, the company now has credit facilities that total over $941 million. Loan maturities through the end of 2009 that are directly on Regency's balance sheet total only $78 million. Regency's commitment to a strong balance sheet and more than sufficient funding capacity allows us to continue to capitalize on attractive investment opportunities.  It is important to remember that our co-investment partnerships have relatively low leverage. In fact, debt to current estimated values is only 52%. Even if cap rates were to rise to 7.5%, loans to value ratio would only be 57%. Although the CMVS market is not a viable option today, insurance companies are still making loans on quality projects with relatively low loan-to-value ratios.  We have turned to the insurance companies to place $286 million of mortgages during the last 12 months. More recently, in April we locked a $62.5 million nine-year interest only mortgage with a coupon of 6%.  Contributions to partnerships and sales of developments and operating property dispositions remain critical elements of Regency's capital recycling. I am comforted that all but two developments represent less than $20 million in proceeds, which are slated for sale this year, are over 95% leased.  It is also important to remember that most of the development sales planned for the year are contributions to our open-end fund, thus minimizing transaction risk. We do expect to close the mid-Atlantic portfolio this quarter. As a result of numerous reverse inquiries, we are cautiously optimistic that we will be successful in achieving our objective for operating property dispositions.  FFO per share in the first quarter was $0.87 compared to $1.13 for this period last year. The FFO in -- the change in FFO per share is primarily related to transaction profits of $2.5 million in the first quarter of 2008 compared with profits of $24.1 million in the first quarter of 2007.  We expect FFO per share in the second quarter to be in the range of $0.88 to $0.92 and feel all of the elements are in place to meet full-year guidance of $4.54 to $4.66 per share.  As a reminder, this guidance includes promote income of $21 million to $23 million from one of Regency's co-investment partnerships that is expected to be earned at the end of the year.  Before I turn the call over to Mary Lou to discuss the operating portfolio results, I would like to point out a few additions we’ve made to the supplemental. We’ve expanded the summary of unconsolidated debt page to include scheduled maturities by year. We have also added additional disclosure on termination fees, capitalized direct development compensation costs, and a footnote has been added in the in-process development page providing additional information regarding phasing of developments.  As Brian will discuss, in an effort to minimize our leasing risk in new developments, we phase construction until leasing has occurred. This has always been an integral part of our development strategy -- nothing new in how we operate, just improved disclosure.  We hope that you find this enhanced transparency helpful. Thank you and Mary Lou. 
Mary Lou Fiala: Thank you, Bruce. Good morning. Regency's operating portfolio results were strong in the first quarter with same-store growth of 3.1% and rent growth of 12.6%. Occupancy remained solid at 94.9%, as 1.7 million square feet of space was leased or renewed in our operating and development portfolio.  As I said on the last call, our top priority is to maintain occupancy at 95%. As evidenced by an 88% renewal rate for the quarter we are proactively working with our retailers on renewals to help achieve this goal. Impressively, [inaudible] rate growth on these renewals was 10% and in line with the previous three quarters. Although we clearly are pleased with this quarter’s results, the economy has softened and we are seeing modest stress in our portfolio.  Consumer confidence continues to deteriorate. The majority of consumers believe that their wealth is less than it was even a year ago. Their home values have dropped and the value of their 401K or stock portfolio are diminished. Negative economic outlooks and political uncertainty dominate the evening news and create fear.  These economic lows are made all too real each week as consumers fill their gas tanks or grocery shop where the price of grains, eggs, and poultry are up over 20%. The result is a jittery consumer that is waiting on the sidelines to spend their money.  This decreased demand is impacting some of our retailers and as a result, we expect small shop attrition will impact occupancy and same-store growth. Additionally, downtime in the portfolio has increased to 8.2 months and we expect termination fees to be half of what they were last year.  It’s the combination of these factors that will cause same-store growth to moderate with full year expected growth of 2.4% to 2.8%. Although retail sales were up over 1.5% in the first quarter, consumers are becoming more price sensitive. As a result, sales and margins will suffer, leading to an increase in the number of consolidations, bankruptcies, and store closings.  As I’ve said in the past, this trend impacts certain categories more than others, as consumers tighten their discretionary spending. They are eating at home more frequently and when they do dine out, they are choose fast casual and value-oriented dining. They are shopping discounters rather than department stores. As a result, grocers continue to see solid comp store sales increases, 5% in the most recent quarter, while department store comps were down over 4%.  Remember, in the Regency portfolio, 90% of our GLA is leased to tenants in retail categories that have seen flat to positive sales in past recessions. We are operating in an environment that market forces will have a moderate impact on our business. Regency's predominantly grocery anchored necessity driven portfolio is built to withstand these economic pressures. We have proactively culled the bottom of our portfolio over the past decade, coupled with a development program that continuously adds new state-of-the-art centers, creating a quality portfolio with dominant anchors in strong markets.  The majority of our grocers have reported their 2007 sales, which on average are up over 3% over 2006, to an average of $24.7 million, or $476 per square foot. In addition, the average age of our portfolio is 12 years versus 14 years just two years ago.  Real estate, as you all know, is a corner business. The best property and the best location is the key to success. Analyzing our operating portfolio on a regional basis, our top performing markets are, as expected, the Northeast, Northern California, the Pacific Northwest, and Texas. And while the Florida and Southern California economies have softened, the quality of our properties in these markets should help sustain performance, as evidenced by our 96% occupancy and first quarter rent growth near or above double-digits in both of these markets.  This week we’ll be hosting our annual customer appreciation event with over 100 attendees. Retailers, as well as brokerage and development companies will be attending. Our long-lasting established relationships are key to sustaining our operating performance goals.  We have already booked over 300 meetings for ICSC in Las Vegas and expect this year’s meetings to be pretty similar to last year’s, a tribute to the expertise of our team and the quality of our portfolio, both in operations and in development. The work that Regency has done in the past through highly disciplined investments and proactive culling of our portfolio to ensure that our centers are in good areas with strong demographics and top tier anchors is paying off. The solid results of the first quarter have built momentum that should carry us through the year. We are positioned to continue to perform in our operating properties to maintain occupancy at 95% and to maximize opportunities in development. Brian will now review our development results and future prospects. 
Brian M. Smith: Thanks, Mary Lou. This was a good quarter for the development teams on all fronts -- pipeline activity, new starts, leasing, construction costs, and in-process returns.  As for starts, we added two new developments totaling $29 million with expected returns in excess of 9%. One of these starts is the second phase of Suncoast Crossing. This project is a good example of strong projects beating soft markets -- in this case, Florida. The combined center is now extremely well-anchored by two of the best retailers in the country in Target and Kohl’s.  The $1.1 billion in-process portfolio also performed well as a whole. Forty-eight projects are in development with same-store construction costs down $3 million on a quarter-to-quarter basis. The Pacific region projects in particular are enjoying very pleasant surprises when it comes to construction costs.  Four projects were stabilized during the quarter and moved off our in-process list. These four completions had an average return on costs of 11.3%. Returns on the in-process projects are eight basis points lower than last quarter on an after JV basis. However, on an apples-to-apples basis, where we add back the completed projects and remove new starts, the returns are actually two basis points better than last quarter.  In the first quarter, we leased 232,000 square feet in our developments. This is 30% more space than we leased in the first quarter of 2007 for the same size portfolio, and in doing so we also beat our own leasing plan by about 10%.  By all accounts, this is a solid showing in any kind of market. We expect these projects to continue to perform and believe we can end the year with them 85% leased.  As Mary Lou pointed out, there gains were accomplished under circumstances that have certainly become more challenging. With the exception of the grocers, many retailers are slowing new store growth and some are trying to push store openings into 2009. Decisions are taking longer and sometimes are unpredictable. The retailers are cautious and require more research before approving projects. So we are very pleased with the results and confident of the long-term performance but recognize that some of the developments may take longer to achieve 95% stabilization in this environment than we had hoped for.  Looking ahead, these market conditions play well to our strengths. We are seeing an increasing number of attractive opportunities in this environment and are well-positioned to capitalize on them. Retailers aren’t closing up shop. While more cautious and deliberate, the top retailers need stores. When they approve new locations, they count on them to be built. In this environment, these retailers are worried about the ability of developers to finance and deliver their stores. Some retailers are going so far as to interview their developers to make sure they can perform.  The fact is many private developers are having a difficult time financing good projects and as they run out of options, they increasingly turn to Regency as a potential development partner. This is creating excellent new opportunities for Regency, allowing us to pick and choose projects we want to pursue.  Construction costs are benign at worse and significantly under budget in many markets. Entitlement difficulties are easing as many cities begin to welcome retail developers and the tax revenue their projects generate.  And finally, sanity again prevails in purchasing land. Terms have improved dramatically and land prices are beginning to soften.  Simply put, at the inflection points of any cycle, there are also greater opportunities, but the environment is different and there are greater risks to accompany the increased opportunities. Our go-forward strategy then must address both. We must reduce risks we face while taking advantage of the opportunities. Ways we will do this include: first, we will continue to phase some projects as appropriate. As Bruce said, phasing of developments has always been an integral part of our development strategy. In today’s market, there is certainly heightened sensitivity.  Nine of the 48 in-process projects have experienced weaker demand with the downturn in housing. We’ve decided to delay the construction of 556,000 square feet of space associated with these projects until additional leasing has occurred. This 556,000 square feet represents only 7% of the building area for the in-process portfolio. About 60% of this space is anchor space, the rest being shops. Without question or exception, these projects enjoy the dominant locations of their respective markets and for that reason will prosper long-term. When demand increases and we are able to lease additional space, we will complete the construction.  Second, there will be even more focus on stronger demographics. The projects we will build are those with proven strong tenant demand with an emphasis on in-fill markets with consumer purchasing power that is based on population densities and income, not home equity.  This means concentrating on new projects with even denser populations and higher incomes. This focus is working, with results that are already evident. Overall, our three mile population for the entire pipeline is almost 62,000 people compared to about 49,000 people a year ago, or a 27% increase in density. On projects in initial due diligence that have not yet hit the pipeline, the average three mile population is almost 142,000 people with an average household income of $82,000.  We will also reduce risk by further limiting the amount of shop space we will build. Again, the changes are already visible. Eighteen months ago, our ratio of shop space to total building area was 28% to 30%. Today our in-process project shop space represents 23% of total area while in the pipeline, the number is only 20%. And for the projects in initial due diligence, the ratio is down to 14%.  Finally, through the relationships that come with development teams in our local offices, we will take advantage of opportunities presented by other developers’ financial limitations. The inability of our competitors to get their projects off the ground is creating more JV possibilities, which increases our ability to be selective as to which ones we choose.  Specifically, 21 such opportunities have come our way. Not only will these -- I’m sorry, not all of these will prove worthy of our investment but several will. So far we have passed on three but four have moved into the active pipeline and the other 14 are currently going through pre-development evaluation. Several look very promising.  This improved selectivity also allows us to accommodate those anchors who want to open in later years while still moving forward on well-conceived developments with strong anchor demand.  In short, we will continue to take advantage of opportunities in these turbulent times, available only to those with the expertise and financial strength to capitalize on them. We will continue to maintain a pipeline of quality projects that the leading retailers still clamor for, and we will do so in a manner that addresses the risks inherent in the market.  In closing, I am pleased with our most recent results and excited about the kinds of opportunities we are seeing, which we will exploit. Despite the increased uncertainty, the in-process projects performed well in the first quarter and there is strong demand for projects in our pipeline. This doesn’t just happen. In any market, weak or strong, great real estate sponsored by formidable companies with highly experienced talent is still a winning formula. In fact, the components of this formula are more important than ever.  While the macro picture is certainly important, the fundamentals supporting each individual project are even more germane. Well-anchored developments in the right locations do thrive even in downturns. It’s all about purchasing power based on densities and incomes. Dominantly located projects in high barrier markets with in-fill demographics and favorable supply/demand forces continue to attract the very best anchors. There is no question the demand for projects with such characteristics remains strong even today.  Today’s environment is not a surprise. We saw warning signs a few quarters ago and began taking steps necessary to prepare for this downturn. That process continues and I believe we are better positioned now than at any time in the past. We are building less shop space, the demographics of the pipeline are greatly improved, the weaker retailers have dropped out, the opportunities we are seeing are rich, the competition is faltering, land and construction costs are moving in the right direction, and returns on new opportunities are improving. Markets like this benefit the strong and the experienced and it is for all these reasons that I am more excited than ever about the future. We’ll take advantage of this slowdown to position ourselves for the inevitable rebound while taking care of what we’ve already started. 
Martin E. Stein Jr.: Thank you, Brian and thank you, Mary Lou, thank you, Bruce, and thank you, Lisa. As you heard from the team, Regency made significant progress in the first quarter. Notable accomplishments include bolstering an already strong balance sheet and reliable access to capital to the closing of a term loan an additional line of credit that brings the company’s total back facilities to over $940 million.  Regency now has access to over $2.2 billion of committed capacity from our banks, our balance sheet, from our co-investment partnerships. High quality operating portfolio produced consistent growth in net operating income yet again of over 3%, and double-digit [rent growth], generating momentum that will sustain results in the more challenging environment ahead.  The development program continues to build financial value. Progress was made on the $1.1 billion of in-process developments, which are expected to generate close to a 9% development return and almost $300 million of future value, assuming a 6.6% cap rate.  We appear to be well-positioned to start $400 million to $500 million of well-conceived new developments with proven tenant demand.  At the same time, as good as recent results look in the rearview mirror, the road ahead promises to include some pretty nasty bumps from both the economy and capital markets. In the more discretionary retail categories, tenant demand for space continues to temper. In my view, it very well could be at least two years before retail sales recover to a level that would translate into a return to robust demand for new store locations.  There have been some improvements in the capital markets, like the tightening of spreads on corporate debentures. And while the worst of the financial crisis is probably behind us, the capital markets are not totally out of the woods and are still a long way from a sense of normalcy.  We are fully cognizant of how these factors might adversely impact the fundamentals of the operating portfolio, the development program, and the balance sheet, and Regency will certainly not be immune to softer tenant demand and higher cost of capital, higher cap rates. While our hindsight and prognostication skills are far from perfect, we do try to incorporate these sobering conditions into our projections, which we share with you through guidance and the color that we are giving you on the call.  You should know that even as I assess the upcoming rigorous test, I continue to be energized and excited by Regency's distinctive assets and a talented and experienced team that is taking proactive measures. These assets and measures that will not only enable us to weather the storm will also position Regency to grow per share funds from operations and intrinsic value.  As Mary Lou explained, Regency's high quality portfolio should continue to deliver growth in net operating income. Regency's shopping centers are primarily anchored by best-in-class operators who again appear to be generating strong sales in another downturn. The vast majority of the portfolio is located in relatively dense areas with above average household income and a few centers in green areas.  There are $520 million of developments with over $150 million of embedded gains, which have already stabilized and are available for sale or contribution to our partnerships.  Despite taking longer to lease and less generous margins, the $1 billion of in-process developments will still create hundreds of millions of dollars of value. Included are $200 million of developments which are expected to be completed by the end of 2008 and over $500 million of projects which are expected to stabilize by 2010, $120 million of which is already over 85% leased.  As Brian articulated, the quality of the $1.5 billion pipeline has been enhanced by an even higher level of scrutiny from both Regency and from our anchor tenants, and will be delivering significant value well into the future.  The pool of opportunities to select from has grown from local developers who are capital challenged and from retailers who are looking to developers to execute.  As Bruce described, the balance sheet is in great shape. We are carefully make sure that we have capital sources to fund compelling developments and other killer opportunities which may arise.  We now welcome your questions. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Christy McElroy from Banc of America.
Christy McElroy - Banc of America Securities: Mary Lou, you talked about small shop attrition a little bit. Can you provide some more color on what tenants you are worried about and have you seen incrementally more distress among some of the local and regional tenants?
Mary Lou Fiala: We are seeing about the same kind of move-outs that we historically have in terms of square footage, but what we are seeing is a lot of them are coming more from the mom and pops, under capitalized retailers. We looked at it by market, we’ve looked at it by sector and it really is -- there’s no trend that I can sit here and say it’s this category versus another category.  But that’s really -- it’s the mom and pop or the franchisee that is in a business that just can’t afford to make it, that they may have been decent operators in very strong economic times but just can’t sustain it or just give up. And the reason why we are tempering our growth is because of the fact that even though we don’t have greater move-outs, it’s taking us longer to find retailers to fill that space.  So it’s the mom and pops, it’s across the board, and it’s the small franchisee who just doesn’t have the capital to stay in business, or it is too much work and they are giving up. 
Christy McElroy - Banc of America Securities: And then with the grocery stores having held up fairly well in this environment, is there a distinction that you are seeing in the performance of some of the higher end, higher priced grocers, like Whole Foods? Are they seeing an impact on sales growth from consumers trying to stretch their dollars further?
Mary Lou Fiala: Not yet. I mean, we see the high-end grocers continuing to perform at high-single-digits and then the traditional grocers performing more in the mid-single-digits. So it’s -- you know, it’s a strong category. I think it’s a combination of the prices going up in food inflation, as well as the fact that people staying home and not going out to eat and entertaining as much. So it’s really been the nesting that happens during a recession, as well as the cost of goods. 
Christy McElroy - Banc of America Securities: Thank you. 
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Christeen Kim with Deutsche Bank.
Christeen Kim - Deutsche Bank: Thanks. Mary Lou, just a follow-up on the longer down time -- you mentioned 8.2 months. What is that up from?
Mary Lou Fiala: You know, it’s only up from eight months last year but 12 to 18 months ago, we had that thing down to about 7 months, so over the past year-and-a-half, it’s significantly gone up. So we are seeing it trend up a little bit every quarter but it has definitely gone up. It is just taking longer to replace those tenants. 
Christeen Kim - Deutsche Bank: Brian, you also mentioned that you guys did about 30% more development leasing than Q107, despite a more difficult operating environment. Could you provide a little bit more color? Is it just the nature of the projects in the pipeline right now?
Brian M. Smith: I think it is. I think we are probably working twice as hard to get the same amount done but the projects are strong and in almost every situation, we do have the dominant locations. For example, Deer Springs in Las Vegas, Las Vegas is a market where residential growth has slowed. We’re north Las Vegas, right on the beltway with a major expressway that leads to downtown, with the best anchors and so that’s -- when people make decisions to go somewhere, they are going to be selective and we just are fortunate that some of these projects are the ones that went out in that kind of competition. 
Christeen Kim - Deutsche Bank: Great. Thanks, guys. 
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Jay Habermann with Goldman Sachs.
Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs: Good morning. Here with Tom as well. You mentioned the $500 million plus or so of assets that are stabilized but not yet sold or contributed and I’m just wondering -- I mean, given the cautious views on the capital markets, et cetera, are you going to consider resizing the absolute size of the development portfolio over the next couple of years, I mean, given your sort of cautious views over that timeframe? And also what gives you confidence about those margins and I guess the $150 million of gains, again given sort of the wide bid/ask spread between buyers and sellers?
Martin E. Stein Jr.: Well, in regard to the margins, I think as we’ve indicated in the past, we’re using relatively conservative cap rate assumptions in the mid to upper sixes. We know what returns are and we are using cap rates in the 6.5% to 6.7% range as far as the margins we are estimating there.  We obviously, as Bruce indicated, are very carefully making sure that we have capital sources out into the future for new developments and any other investment opportunities that are there. Capital is extremely precious today and we want to make sure that the capital is available to fund our growth.  And as far as right-sizing the development pipeline, I think you mentioned related to capital as one reason to do it, and another reason to do it may be even related to risk. And I think as Brian has indicated, the quality of the pipeline has never been better and the underwriting has really never been more conservative. I think he indicated that we have taken our side shop space percentage down from 30% to 14%. We are dealing with best-in-class operators and I think as he said and I said, not only are we being more conservative but our anchor tenants are being more conservative, so you have kind of a double self-selection process.  So I still think -- let me say this; I think that the pipeline is even more -- as attractive as the in-process developments are, the pipeline is even more compelling. And returns seem to be, on the face of it, going up a little bit. We’ll see on that. 
Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs: It’s Tom here with Jay. I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit on the $21 million to $23 million promote you expect to book at the end of the year. If you could just go over the logistics of how exactly that promote will be recognized, whether that is going to be from the sales of some assets currently in your co-investment partnerships. And also, what the potential for slippage on that promote is into 1Q09 if market conditions don’t materially improve over the back half of the year. 
Lisa Palmer: No properties need to be sold for us to be able to recognize that promote. We simply will have to value each property individually and then as long as the returns are over an IRR threshold, we receive the promote. So there will be no slippage either into the first quarter of ’09. 
Martin E. Stein Jr.: And I think as Lisa indicated, we’ve used reasonably conservative -- in our view, conservative cap rate assumptions. And another important thing that she mentioned was the fact that the properties will be individually valued. And in this market, we are still seeing individual properties, cap rates on individual properties being a lot stickier as far as going up than cap rates on larger transactions, which is where you have a lot of investors for investments in size staying on the sidelines. 
Lisa Palmer: And with our co-investment partnerships, really in three of the four major ones, we basically just have a cycle of when the promote is recognized and in this one, this happens to be the seven-year timeframe of when it is going to be valued and a promote recognized 
Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs: Thank you. 
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Paul Morgan with Friedman, Billings, Ramsey.
Paul Morgan - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey: Good morning. On the comments about cutting the shop space percentage from 28% to 30% to 14% for the shadow pipeline, what kind of impact does that have on your yields?
Brian M. Smith: Well, it is going to have some -- there is going to some trade-off. I think it is going to give us a little bit of return for less risk. Right now we are expecting in 2008 that our pipeline returns will be just a shade under 9%, although I did mention that all the increased opportunities we are seeing is allowing us to be more selective and enhance our returns. In 2009, we are looking for that return to go up to about 9.35% and in 2010, about 9.9%. That’s before partner participation but after partner participation, still 9.6% in 2010.  As Hap indicated, it remains to be seen if all that materializes. There will always be cost pressures and things that could bring down the return but the trend is really favorable. 
Paul Morgan - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey: It’s going up despite the fact that there is going to be some offsetting drag from the lower shop space allocation?
Brian M. Smith: Right. We’ve got cost working in our favor in a lot of those -- it is helping some. 
Paul Morgan - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey: Okay, my other question is on, Hap, you provided some color in recent quarters on cap rates and I just wanted to get a sense from you what you’ve seen so far this year in terms of cap rates and maybe -- obviously with not a lot of transaction activity maybe how far apart you think the, how wide the bid/ask spread is at this point and what might happen and how far cap rates need to move to kind of clear the market at this -- right now. 
Martin E. Stein Jr.: Well, there’s not a lot of transactions that are happening out there, number one. Number two, there still appears to be, especially for A properties in better markets, enough demand on an individual property basis, as I said, and I think those cap rates -- Brian, 6.5%, 6% to 6.75% depending on the market for A properties, 6% to 6.75% today. So there’s been -- individual cap rates have been pretty sticky. I think where you seeing -- where investors truly are staying on the sideline is on larger transactions and for core properties, large transactions, there just doesn’t seem to be very much capital [all up there], but as far as individual property transactions, cap rates have been for A properties pretty sticky. I’d say B properties, depending on the market, et cetera, 7.25% to 7.75% and your guess is as good as mine as far as C properties.
Paul Morgan - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey: Are sellers just kind of taking off the market properties that aren’t getting the bids or is it just they are not even -- there is not really much even going on in the market at all?
Martin E. Stein Jr.: I think there is -- just to finalize that thought on the question, transactions for better properties, A quality properties are happening on an individual, one-off basis typically. You are seeing some of that occur for B properties. As Bruce said, we expect to close, and more to come on the next call, on this mid-Atlantic portfolio that we’ve had on the market and it really does appear like that portfolio is going clear in the second quarter of this year. 
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Ambika Goel with Citigroup.
Ambika Goel - Citigroup: On your development profits that are embedded within your guidance, it appears based upon reported 1Q and then guidance for 2Q FFO that gains are going to be back-end loaded. Given that you have about $500 million of stabilized developments that you can sell and an open-end fund that can buy those assets, what is the reason for making those development sales back-end loaded? And are there any contingencies that we should be concerned about that that guidance may not be attainable?
Martin E. Stein Jr.: Two of the properties are contributions to the open-end fund in which the anchor, we have signed leases from the anchor. The anchor, just because of the timing of the construction of the space, just hasn’t moved in. And I think it is more related to factors like that than anything else. I mean, Lisa, I don’t know if you’ve got any other color to give. 
Lisa Palmer: Basically it’s -- we need them to be rent-paying and the rent is scheduled to commence in the third quarter. 
Martin E. Stein Jr.: And they also aren’t as large as -- to meet the open-end fund requirements in terms of size. In certain cases, we have a -- in another case we have a partner buy-out that we can’t commence -- we can’t do until August of this year, so they are reasons like that, Ambika, that whether it’s tenant move-in date where they are going to be rent-paying and occupied, or partnered by our factories like that.  We’re not looking for drama. 
Ambika Goel - Citigroup: Okay, so just to clarify this -- correct me if I’m wrong but there’s about $200 million of development sales that will have to occur in the back-half of ’08 and you are saying about half of those projects are going to be -- are related to anchors that haven’t opened yet, but leases are signed?
Lisa Palmer: No, I mean, I think that that’s an overstatement. Because they are the community shopping centers that we are selling to the fund, they tend to be larger, so each individual transaction will have larger gains than a typical grocery-anchored shopping center that we sell. Like last year when we did Vista Village in the first quarter, the gain on that was close to $20 million. So they are individual transactions that are larger and as Hap explained, there’s really only two of those projects that we just talked about, the one with the buyout and the one where the -- and it’s not -- it’s just a smaller, junior anchor that is not rent-paying yet.  So there is not risk I think is what you are alluding to in terms of that they may not move in and may not begin paying rent. There’s just -- they are larger transactions so there is fewer of them but again the risk is pretty minimal. 
Ambika Goel - Citigroup: And then just one short follow-up -- on that $500 million of assets that are stabilized, what is the expected NOI development yield on those projects? Because I guess you are suggesting that there would be higher than 9%, given that there are these larger projects. So I just wanted to see -- just to back into the profits, what is the development yield of those projects that are stabilized?
Lisa Palmer: I’m sorry, you are talking about the 520 that are already stabilized?
Ambika Goel - Citigroup: Yes. 
Martin E. Stein Jr.: I would say it’s in the above 9%. 
Brian M. Smith: Yeah, above 9%. 
Ambika Goel - Citigroup: Okay. Thank you. 
Brian M. Smith: We just want to confirm the number. 
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Craig Schmidt with Merrill Lynch.
Craig Schmidt - Merrill Lynch: Thank you. This question again focuses on your sort of expecting the tougher environment taking the same-store NOI from 3.1 down to a range of 2.4 to 2.8 and likewise doing for the rental regrowth. That’s about a drop of 20%. I’m wondering what you think the drop will be for the community shopping center industry as a whole. I guess what I am getting at is what degree of protection the PCI program is going to be giving you here. 
Mary Lou Fiala: I think that if you look at some of the studies that have been done, they are saying occupancy could go down to on average another couple of percentage points. And I think that that’s very real. And I to think ours will not go down nearly as much as you’ve seen in the industry. We saw that in the early 2000s when some of our peers went below 90% and we were very well maintained between 94% and 95%. So I think it is going to obviously depend on the quality of the portfolio and the quality of the retailers.  I think we will have a modest decline and actually we are looking at the end of the year average occupancy being about the same. It’s just during the year we’re going to have some downtime that it is just going to take us a little bit longer to get there than historical numbers.  So I think we over time, we could moderate a little bit from where we are but not significantly and depending on the PCI program and the quality of your portfolio, I think you could drop as much as another couple of percent. 
Martin E. Stein Jr.: I think another factor in addition to PCI and the quality of the anchors and the quality of the locations is the fact that we’ve got 21 offices, which really does allow us to be close to our properties and be extremely hands-on. 
Craig Schmidt - Merrill Lynch: Great. And then I guess as a follow-up, the slight tick-up in the yield for the two new developments, is that because of the greater scrutiny or just sort of randomness?
Brian M. Smith: I think it’s random. I don’t think it has anything to do -- one of them is a third phase to a project, so you are dealing with mostly shop space. So you are going to get higher rents and higher returns on that anyway. 
Craig Schmidt - Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thanks a lot. 
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Jeffrey Donnelly with Wachovia.
Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wachovia Securities: Good morning, folks. I do want to clarify -- when you talk about reducing your exposure to shop tenants through your development pipeline, is that because you are exclusively shifting your development mix towards more of a power center product, I guess I’d call it, or are you developing some properties that are more in-fill but just not to their fullest potential, maybe leaving some space behind for a future date?
Brian M. Smith: We are doing a lot more in-fill and we are not shifting our focus exclusively to those kind of projects, community center projects. In fact, if you look at 2008, we have by number about a third of our projects are grocery anchored and about two-thirds would be community centers. In 2009, the grocery anchored centers goes up to 58% and community to about 42%.  So the mix is not changing. In fact, we have 29 grocers in the in-process portfolio right now and our pipeline is right now looking at 29. So there is really no shift. 
Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wachovia Securities: So to be clear, it’s sort of a grocery-anchored center that just happens to have less shop space, but not so much undeveloped?
Brian M. Smith: That’s right. 
Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wachovia Securities: And then I guess for my follow-up, I guess my concern is that maybe in that pursuit of shoring up the visibility of your development yields, do you reduce your future growth prospects by forsaking yourself some of that shop space? I mean, can you talk about how you weigh that decision? Because I would think that you are developing into a product type that has maybe more exposure to a smaller handful of tenants and probably has higher cap rates vis-à-vis the more traditional stuff you had been billing. 
Martin E. Stein Jr.: One thing as it relates to community center portfolio, one of the reasons that the open-end fund makes sense for us as we contribute those larger projects that happen to have a lower growth profile, typically have that lower growth pile into the open-end fund. And we will continue to evaluate any development that we complete and find out whether it is suitable for Regency to own 100%, for one of our partnerships, or if it makes sense for a third-party sale.  An interesting component of the pipeline is buying boxes and we bought three Merman’s boxes and we will ultimately sell all three of those boxes, which we very successfully released and redeveloped. And that also has an impact on the amount of shop space that is being picked. I mean, some of it is yes, we are being a lot more cautious but some of it has to do with the nature of what’s being developed. 
Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wachovia Securities: Great, thanks. 
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan.
Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan: In terms of the development contributions to the open end fund, what’s the exact cap rate floor for the fund? And is it turning out to be any sort of an issue today?
Lisa Palmer: It’s basically -- it’s a ladder on a total dollar value, basically, so the first $225 million in the floor, they basically have to average 6.5% and then after that, it steps up to 6.6 and then it steps up to 6.7 and that’s the -- that is the ultimate floor.  You know, the first four or five assets that we’ve contributed have actually been below that 6.5% so the next one we put in, we’ll probably have to make up that difference a little bit and in that case, it would make a difference. But beyond that, I think with where cap rates have gone and with the dollars that we save on transaction costs and the tax savings, it does not become an issue. We feel that we are getting full value. 
Martin E. Stein Jr.: And we’ve incorporated those factors into our projections. 
Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan: Okay. Thanks. 
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Jim Sullivan with Green Street Advisors.
Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors: Thanks. Brian, the leasing progress you made in the development pipeline seems to have been very concentrated in markets that are less severely impacted by the housing situation. And when I look at housing bubble markets, particularly Southern California and Florida, it looks like the vast majority of your developments did not achieve any leasing progress during the quarter. Are you seeing substantial differences in tenant demand in the housing bubble markets versus those less severely affected?
Brian M. Smith: Yeah, California, I’ll speak to that one because that’s where the bulk of the big projects are. You living there, Jim, know that it depends where you are. The projects that we built more in the growth rates out in the Coachella Valley or the desert or the Inland Empire are the ones that are taking longer. They are definitely experiencing more of a slowdown as the housing stopped. Those that are more in the urban core, certainly Northern California, anywhere near the coast, are doing just fine.  But yeah, we’ve certainly seen the slowdown in both Florida and -- North Las Vegas is another one, of course, though, that has -- I think is one of your bubble markets and that one we’ve seen very strong demand. In fact, that’s where the bulk of the leasing took place. 
Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors: And despite the longer lease-up and some of the softness in tenant demand, you are still reasonably confident about hitting your pro formas with respect to yield?
Brian M. Smith: I do. We adjust those every quarter and we take a look at it space by space and there have certainly been some projects that we’ve had to lower the rents and there’s been other projects that have outperformed. So I think we are in good shape, at least right now based on what we know for the returns and the income. The only issue is some of them are taking longer to reach stabilization than we would have expected. 
Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors: Thank you. 
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Chris Lucas with Robert W. Baird.
Christopher R. Lucas - Robert W. Baird: Good morning, everyone. Brian, could you just give a little more color on the construction costs in terms of what you’ve seen over the past year and what you are seeing in sort of your future expenditures?
Brian M. Smith: Sure. Basically they are as I said, benign. I mean, we’re expecting cost increases going forward of about 5%. And some of the individual materials are down. The ones that obviously remained high would be the petroleum based products, like asphalt and PVC pipe and the like. The labor component, especially in the formerly hot markets, as Jim says, the bubble markets, are way down.  So on a lot of our Pacific region projects, particularly California, we are seeing construction bids come in of 15% below what we had budgeted for those projects, which is accounting for those cost decreases.  But if you strip out the real high growth markets where we are seeing big cost decreases, you are only looking at about on average 5% going forward. 
Martin E. Stein Jr.: And that’s cost increase in relation to budget. 
Christopher R. Lucas - Robert W. Baird: Okay. Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up, again on the issue of the shadow pipeline and the lower shop space allocation, am I to understand that what the future will look like in terms of the projects, the allocation will be to larger spaces. But are you building out the complete FAR on the parcels that you have, or are you setting aside potentially some of that FAR for future phases of a particular project, but leaving your initial shop space allocation at a lower level?
Brian M. Smith: The key thing is we build to the size of the market, not the size of the site. So just because we have 20 acres does not mean we are going to max out to 200,000 square feet. So in some cases, it so happens that we wish we had more space and we can only build what the land allows, in which case we’ve maxed it out. In other cases, there probably will be extra space that we will be able to take advantage of in later years. 
Christopher R. Lucas - Robert W. Baird: Okay, great. Thanks a lot, guys. 
Operator: At this time, there are no further questions. Mr. Stein, I will turn the conference back over to you for closing comments. 
Martin E. Stein Jr.: Once again, we appreciate your time. We appreciate your interest in Regency and hope that everybody has a great rest of the week and weekend ahead of them. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude today’s conference call. We do thank you for your participation and you may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Laurie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. This conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Regency Centers Corporation Fourth Quarter 2007 Conference Call. (Operator Instructions). I'd now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Lisa Palmer, Senior Vice President Capital Market. Please go ahead ma'am.
Lisa Palmer: Thank you Laurie and good morning. On the call this morning are Hap Stein Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mary Lou Fiala, President and COO, Bruce Johnson Chief Financial Officer, Brian Smith, Chief Investor Officer, Chris Leavitt Senior Vice President and treasure and Jamie Shelton Vice President of Real Estate Accounting. Before we start I would like to address forward-looking statements that maybe address on the call. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors, which could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. I will now turn the call over to Bruce.
Bruce Johnson: Thank you, Lisa, and good morning. And congratulations to the Regency's Oregon. As you will hear from me and the rest of team, although the environment and which we operate has become increasingly challenging, Regency continues to execute our strategy and deliver consistent results. FFO per share in the fourth quarter was a $1.16 and $4.20 for the year. This represents over 8% FFO per share growth. Net income for the year was $184 million, compared to nearly $199 million in 2006. This decline was due to a lower level of operating profit sales, and the resulting gain. In this environment, more than ever, balance sheet strength and flexibility is impaired. Regency's strong balance sheet and co-investment partnerships provide the company with financial, flexibility and reliable internal and external sources of capital to profit from attractive investment opportunities. We have a $1.3 billion capacity available in the open-end fund, and our other partnerships, and the capacity under currently under our balance sheet we have excess to over $1.8 billion of capital. Turning to guidance for 2008, we expect FFO per share to be in the range of $0.81 to $0.85 for the first quarter. Given that we are using most cautious assumptions, like more moderate same-store NOI growth, longer development lease times and higher cap rates. We have tightened our range of guidance to 8% to 11% growth, which equate to $4.54 to $4.66 for the year. Let me respond to several note comments regarding pushing out some of our stabilizations past 2008. You need to remember that our shopping centers are significantly leased before they are started, and aren’t moved to operating profits and so they are 93% leased. Of the $200 million of projects that were pushed to 2009, stabilization tenant profit is totaling a $140 million are 86% to 92% leased today, including agro stores. The guidance includes promotional income of $21 million to $23 million from one of Regency's co-investment partnerships, and is likely to be earned at the end of the year. We view this promote this part of our transaction income. Since our goal is to keep transaction related income as a percentage of FFO in the 20% range the promote provides the opportunity to lead and even greater inventory of stabilized developments for future sales and profits, as maintained a sustainable and fair growth rate in access of 8% is a priority for the company. And with $470 million of developments representing over a $150 million of potential gain already stabilized, we are very well positioned to achieve this. Given Regency's low payout ratio and expectation and will be at the upper end of our guidance. We have increased the dividend by 10% to $2.90 annually. This is up 13th consecutive year of dividend increases. I will now turn the call over to Mary Lou, to discuss our operating portfolio results.
Mary Lou Fiala: Thank you, Bruce and good morning. Regency had another strong year of 2007, our operating portfolio have generated same store growth of 3.3% for the quarter and the annual growth of 3%. Rent growth was 11.3% for the quarter and 13% for the year. This is the night year of averaging over 3% growth, occupancy of over 95%, and run-away growth in excess of 10%. At the end of 2007, our tenants were 95% leased. Leasing activity remained strong as 2 million square feet of space was leased or renewed in our operating and development portfolios, bringing the total for the year to 7.2 million square feet, truly a great effort from our team. We've aggressively reviewed the portfolio in light of potential risk of a deteriorating economy, and I've spent a lot of time talking to my guys in the field, and even after incorporating many potential '08 risk factors, like an uptake in early tenant move-outs, slower replacement time, increased bankruptcies and potential store closings and rank lower than historical averages due to economic pressure on our retailers, we still expect occupancy to be pretty close to 95% and same store NOI growth to be in the range of 2.4% to 2.8% and ramp-up would be between 8% to 10%. They have clearly identified the quality and although the majority of the retailers are moderating their growth plans, there is still demand for good tenants. As Rosewell Crossing in Atlanta ,Trader Joe's approached to us for space. We have recently terminated a party supply store and re-leased to trader at a significant renting increase. At Cloppers Mill in Maryland, Hollywood Video tried to downsize our store. We immediately re-leased the space to Stabock, over 1800 square feet, and had a substantial increase of $9 per foot. Although some retailers have announced plans for closures, given the size of the anchors, and the high quality of our portfolio, retain we done on this centers where retail stores at closing. For example, last month, Stabock announced plant closures of 350 units, and as their largest landmark for Stabock in the country, we were able to quickly reach out to them through our relationship and confirm that none of those are in Regency's portfolio. The majority of our retailers are still opening store and in fact they are very aggressive in top market for best centers of PCI relation is key. We had over a dozen retailer meetings scheduled prior to ICS in May, to review portfolios for new store opportunities, and actually most of those meetings have been at the request of the retailer. Retailers comp sales growth for fourth quarter was 3.5%. This was higher than many estimates, but as you know grocers and services business intend to stay well in a recessionary like economy. Those of you who attended our investor day last November will recall how John Frazier, who is the ahead of real estate for public, and founder with the late George Duncan. As refining to the question of how publics will pay in a recession? He stated public chooses not to purchase to pay in a recession. And their sales comp support us. Grocers comps for the quarter were up 5.5% and a majority of service retailer comp were above 4%. Neighborhood centers are more recession resistant than any other product type. If you recall, that July's quarter during the recession of the early 90s both categories typically filed a neighborhood in community centers such as grocery stores, restaurants, drug stores and discount department stores realized continued sales growth. The category that experienced negative growth was conventional department stores, home related goods, shoes and jewelry stores. And Regency's in portfolio, this retail represents only 10% annual pro-rata base runs. And actually downturn of this for all of us. Retailers make better decisions, they protect their comp stores sales, and operate more efficiently, and their improved profitability, and all of those factors work in Regency's favor. There are clearly storm clouds on the horizon in 2008, but Regency is well positioned to weather this storm due to the high quality centers with strong anchors and solid demographics, coupled with our PCI strategy and has been implemented by an exceptional team across the country. I will now turn the call over Brian for an update and Regency's investment program. Brian?
Brian Smith: Thank you, Mary Lou. In the fourth quarter Regency started seven new developments totaling $137 million. The underwritten returns for this fourth quarter's starts, averaged near 9%. Returns really tell the whole story, particularly what kinds of quality retailer demand and risk litigation and that's particularly true this quarter. So let me discuss these starts briefly. The center place is really is the third phase to our very successful existing center, whose first two phases are anchored by Safeway, Target and Colts. Those phases totaled 273,000 square feet and are 100% leased. The third phase will total a 120,000 square feet of which only 22,000 square feet are shop spaces so pretty low risk. The lease is already signed with BestBuy, Sport Authority and we've a signed NOI Paradigm Group. Lower NOI were common. In the Northeast region is a 239,000 square foot center anchored by Target, Sports Authority and PetSmart and shadow anchored by Wegman's. Again there is very little shop space in this project, only 20,000 square feet. Demand from both anchors and shop tenants is overwhelming. So much so, that we are working on a second phase of 250,000 square feet, which is also over subscribed, with three times more quality anchor interest than we have available space. And in the Pacific region, Jefferson Square is another neighborhood grocery anchored center also with limited shop space. As with all the projects, the demographics are excellent with no need for any residential growth. The Three Mile population at Jefferson Square is approximately 87,000 people. For entire year, our development start totaled $379 million with under rate returns on costs a 9.2% net of JV buyout. As you know this level of start is below the guidance that was provided even as recently as last quarter and likely to play in that variance. We decided not to count the start of a $94 million project that all long has been in our development starts plan. The land was purchased in November, and it’s a great location. The project has had tremendous leasing demand, as evidenced by the fact that we currently have 58% of the total GLA or over 200,000 square feet accounted for either as a signed lease or lease that has been fully negotiated and are waiting signature or in active lease negotiation. We won't begin construction until those centers are significantly leased, for given the size of this project, we decided not to consider the project as started until more of the LOIs and lease drafts are converted in to executed contracts. On the acquisition side we closed seven new projects in to Oregon partnership, totaling $77 million. Six of the centers were acquired as a portfolio at a 7% cap rate, which is indicative of the fact that we are able to continue to derive although eight properties in better markets that have impacted to a much lesser degree particularly in California. Retailer weakness, especially among the monotypes, which could lead to starting rent, some longer lease times, lower rents, and price spread loss being offered by banks and restaurants. Major retailer are being cautious in site selection, and anchors wanting to push out opening dates. All these things put pressure on returns, cause delays and increase road value. I think it is important to know that the degree to which these issues are prevalent is the function of geography to a large extent. We are not seeing slowdowns or leasing weakness in those areas with very strong infill demographics or in truly high barrier markets. The areas of weakness are greener markets with lighter population densities. We are also not seeing much slowdown in the Chicago markets, Texas or other areas where the housing markets were never over heated. In any events, we’ve adjusted our models to reflect extended lease-up periods in many of the projects. Conversely there are also factors working in our favor to shore up returns and enhance values. Cap rate is still low for A quality assets, which are the assets we’ve always purchased and developed. On the development side we faced much less competition, which is allowing us not only to be more selective on opportunities we see, but also to structure more favorable terms with land owners, who are now willing to grant contract extensions and otherwise give us the time we need to adequately manage risk. Land prices are beginning to soften, as sellers are now more interested in the buyers ability to close than on getting the highest price. This gives us the major advantage over our competition. Construction costs were down significantly in many of the markets, particularly on the West Coast. Mall developers are having a great yield difficulty financing projects, which has lead to a large increase in the number of joint venture opportunities we’re seeing. All this things are helping offset the negatives and as a result the in-process returns are holding up and we’re able to be the more selective on the investment opportunities. The pipeline is in particularly good shape with some of the most solid projects we’ve ever done. As we’ve discussed previously, we took steps in 2007 to shore up the pipeline in anticipation of the current environment and today we have a pipeline that enjoys solid in-place demographics. Our focus has been on the best opportunities anchored by the best retailers. Accordingly we’ve dropped projects where we feel less confident that the necessary spread will hold or where we’ve concerns that the risks are higher than more in this environment. At the same time we have raised our development return requirements, which reflect an increase in conservatism as we evaluate opportunities. As a result, our overall pipeline is down compared to a year ago, the total high and medium probability pipeline totaled $1.6 billion, compared to $1.8 billion at this time last year. On a quarterly basis, the current pipeline is $80 million lower than it was three months ago, but this number includes the $137 million of fourth quarter starts that were moved from the pipeline and into production. We're particularly bullish on the pipeline for several reasons. First, by the time these projects are delivered in two to four years, we fully expect the retail atmosphere to be much more optimistic, and we know the anchors for these projects feel the same way. Second, the competitive landscape has significantly shifted to benefit Regency. There is less competition and we're able to be more selective and deliberative in our investment opportunities. Third, the pipeline is full of projects that have been in the works for a long time, in many cases, several years. These projects have taken so long because they are in high barrier markets where retailer demand is very high and we've had the time to execute leases on a very high percentage in the space. Thus much of leasing uncertainty has been removed. Finally, the overall amount of shop space in the projects is very low. On average, 18% of our pipeline GLA is shop space. That compares with an average of 31% for the in-process projects. Let me give you a few examples of projects in the pipeline. In Texas, we control a large project at an A+ location, next to one of the very top malls in the state where retailers operate stores that are ranked in the top 10 nationally. Besides very much infill with 104,000 people in three miles, traffic counts are incredible at 230,000 cars per day. This state where barriers to entry are not usually thought of, the barriers here are high. As a result the retail GLA per capita in the area is very low compared to the national average. As you'd expect, demand for this kind of a site is intense. We've received 16 letters of intent from national credit retailers totaling 300,000 square feet, and are working on another 380,000 square feet. Because of the competition for space, we'll be able to have our pick of retailers. In Colorado, we control a priced site with incomes in the area exceeding $120,000. Again, we have more demand than we can accommodate from the best retailers, including Whole Foods Bed, Bath & Beyond. In present in California we are about to start a project we have been working on for five years. This project will be anchored by Target and Fresh & Easy with very little shop space. Incomes in the area exceed $120,000. In moderate part in California there is another project we've been working on for over five years, and this development enjoys sensational retailer demand. This site has over a mile of footage on a major freeway with approximately 230,000 cars passing (inaudible) today. Population is extremely down with over 200,000 people in three miles. Anchors to this project include Home Depot, Target, Kohl's, Best Buy, Toys and Babies"R"Us, Michael's and others. In summary, these pipeline projects are so compelling because of the dense demographics and high incomes. The fact we've been working on them for so long is indicative of the enormous barriers to entry. The long entitlement periods allows to sign for a very large percentage of the space in these centers. And finally, in most of the projects, the percentage of small shops is very low, 10% or so of the total area. Let me close by saying we are well aware of the hurdles in front of us. These challenges are greatest for some of the in-process projects as many of those are set to open in 2008 which will be the most difficult year. I do believe the high quality of projects will hold us in good stead overall. In this environment the best located and best anchored projects will fair the best. Hap?
Hap Stein: Thanks Brian, Mary Lou and Bruce. I'm extremely proud when I look back at the full scope of the accomplishment that Mary Lou, Bruce and Brian described. High quality portfolio again produced reliable growth in net operating income of 3%. Development program again generated extraordinary value. Nearly $330 million of developments were completed at over 9% return, realizing an estimated $120 million of value. Substantial progress was made on the $1.1 billion of in-process developments, which are 55% funded and 80% leased and committed, and are expected to generate close to a 9% return on investment and have a 6.6% cap rate, $300 million of future value. $380 million of new developments were started that are projected to produce returns in excess of 9% and once again is at 6.6% cap rate, which is above what cap rates are today, close to $120 million of net future value. Capital recycling and co-investment partnerships continue to enable Regency profitably grow the portfolio while maintaining a strong balance sheet and reliable access to both external and internal sources of capital. We sold $400 million of 10-year bonds at an interest rate 5.875%. We raised almost $750 million of capital from dispositions of the operating portfolio, contributions from partnerships, sales of developments, partner contributions for acquisitions and have partial and pad sales. We completed the initial capital raise in the open-end fund, transparent takeout vehicle for our community center developments. And S&P upgraded Regency's investment grade rating to BBB+. Regency continues to demonstrate our position as innovative industry leader with our corporate-wide sustainability and green generating initiative. Along with FFO per share growth of 8.2%, these achievements showed off the talent, depth and engagement of Regency's differed management team. However, as Mary Lou, Bruce and Brian have explained, and as you know, the world has changed and it is changed. 2008 will be much more challenging environment. The capital markets, as we all know are in turmoil, adversely impacting the cost and availability of capital. Widening spread from debt has more recovered the lower treasury rates that we currently see. With interest rates being high and many investors on the sideline, cap rate have risen and may rise further, especially for lower quality assets, and especially on portfolio sales. The capital market has moved from being a lush and I believe we are now in a time of low cash capital to now where there is a scarcity of capital. The economy, as we all read, is slowing down, adversely impacting retail sales and tenant demand. There is pressure on occupancy and more store closings, especially Mom & Pop in challenged categories. At the same time, as Mary Lou and Brian described, while most retailers are still opening new stores, they are being much more selective and taking much more time to make a decision. Fortunately, we are blessed with the strong shift that has built not only to weather, but also to take advantage of stormy sea. Anchors and side-shop retailers still want to be located in Regency's operating properties and new developments. These high quality centers benefit from dominant anchors and markets with attractive demographics. The better, change simply want to be, in the better centers. In addition, I expect that that again in the cycle, we are going to see some capacity convenience growth in shopping center will demonstrate the resilience to the economic downturn. $470 million of development, representing over a $150 million of gains, are already stabilized, and currently available for sale or contribution to one of our partnerships. Plus there are $115 million to $240 million of developments, which are expected to be completed by the end of 2008, and as Bruce described another $140 million that are 86% to 90% lease today, and is slight stabilized, or likely to stabilize in 2009. The fact that these developments are completed and we are fast approaching the stage, that there is over $1.3 billion capacity in our co-investment partnerships, providing a huge amount of certainty and counts for regarding its significant portion of Regency's capital recycling plan. I want to reiterate what Bruce said that there is a $1.8 billion of funding capacity in the excess internal funding capabilities in Regency's balance sheet. This is added to what's currently available in the co-investment partnerships. In addition, the gains from lease assets, that are already stabilized or about to stabilized, together with the $21 million to $23 million promote for Regency a great deal of comfort and transparency to sustain a healthy level of FFO for share growth, without putting undue pressure on development sales during next few years. Most important of all, Regency's senior management team, as Brian testified, we've learned many lessons from previous capital market and economic storms. In spite of these great assets in our collective experience this downturn, I believe will be a strong test for Regency's management team. We'll continue to stay focused on executing Regency's proven strategies. And our priorities will be number one; maintaining a strong balance sheet and significant funding capacity and then number two; growing earnings at a rate that is sustainable for the foreseeable future. Mary Lou our operations leasing teams will be keenly focused on maintaining occupancy by leasing space to quality tenants. The development team will be selective, and reflectively concentrate on the best locations where there is strong tenant demand. At the same, as Brian said, we will negotiate more time on land contract, build less shop space, base projects and plan for longer lease up time. Its important to key perspectives, as Brian indicated, to remind everyone that many of these projects that will be closed on this year will not be completed until the end of 2009 for the first half of 2010, where lease are projected 0.4 months later in 2011 or 2012. I believe that the difficulties in the capital markets and economy will provide us with the silver line. Regency's local market expertise and excellent relationships to key retailers will result in numerous opportunities. Our real rest will be to use our experience and good judgments to select those opportunities to invest our precious financial and intellectual capital. I think the Regency team has a pretty good idea of knowing when to hold them and when to hold it. In summary, the next one to two years should offer real challenges, but should also be extremely exciting. With our high quality portfolios, cycle resistant portfolio of operating properties in new developments. Innovative and leading edge operating systems and initiatives, co-investment partnerships, strong balance sheet and large inventory of fully backed development in the promote, Regency is well positioned to weather this storm and take advantage of the current turmoil. With the more conservative assumptions for NOI growth, cap rate and lease up time for developments, we should be able to sustain or committing with the gratifying levels FFO per share growth of 10% to 11%, in 2008 probably 8% in 2009 and 2010. We appreciate your time and now answer questions that you may have.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Jonathan Litt with Citi.
Ambika Goel- Citi: Hi. This is Ambika with John. On both the property management side and development side, Regency appears to be ahead of the curve planning for what's going to happen in the future. I guess if we're talking about the future, how long do we potentially think that these economic headwinds could last? In the sense of the property management side and development side, what gives you confidence longer term that Regency growth will be able to continue, given the potential increase happening?
Hap Stein: I will let Brian address the issues related to the sustainability of NOI growth and our development program and with the headwinds. But I think your guess is as good as mine, but my sense is the current economic dip that we're into is maybe longer rather shorter, and maybe more than a couple of quarters. I mean, who knows, it could be very shallow. But my sense is there will be a recession. This is me talking. And it may last a few quarters, but then I'm not sure if we're going to jump right back out of it with robust economic growth for a while.  But that will happen. The US economy is very resilient, and we'll get on the other side of that, whether its six months from now, or one year from now, or two years from now.
Mary Lou Fiala: Ambika, on the operations side, there are a couple of factors. One is, I think we've taken a very realistic approach as we've scrubbed our portfolio in '08 and going forward, and looking at what we believe could potentially happen. In '07, ICOC reported that there were 4,700 stores that closed and anticipate that number to go to 5,300 in '08. Regency only had 16 of those in '07. And if you use our ratios, it would be about 21. So that's really not been an issue. On one hand, we're pretty comfortable in terms of where we fit in, and all I have to do as a team. And probably equally or more importantly, is our quality real estate with strong anchors producing above average sales, high demos, high incomes. But the other thing that gives us comfort beyond the quality of the portfolio and the team in looking at historical numbers and kind of playing those going forward, is really look at the history of what's happened. And you look even in the early '90s, Regency same store growth was in the 2.5% to 3% range and our occupancy went down to 94.9%. So, even through a difficulty economic time, quality real estate sustains much better. And where you see the debt is in the BNC quality real estate. And I really believe over time, this is our time to shine.
Brian Smith: Ambika, this is Brian. I'll just quickly comment on the development side. I don't have a crystal ball, though I will tell you that the retailers tell us, the anchored tenant, that they will just as soon get past 2008. They view 2009 pretty much as getting back to normal. The fact is they need stores. They may need fewer of them during this period, but the good retailers are going to continue to grow and they've got to have good stores. And they are doing exactly what you and I would do if we were in their shoes. They are being more selective and they are going to the safest projects. And the safest projects are the ones where they face such competition, and where they can take advantage of highest purchasing power. And those are the kinds of projects we're are focusing on.
Bruce Johnson: I don't know whether our people noticed, but last week the interview with the CEO of Penney's in the Wall Street Journal indicated, yes, they are cutting back, but they are cutting back from 50 stores a year in '08 and '09 to 40 stores a year. So I think that's indicative of what's happening, and their people are still opening stores. And these retailers, I pointed out in the last call here, are making decisions, lots of them from two or three years out.
Ambika Goel – Citi: Okay, great. And then just following up on JCPenney example, given that JCPenney did reduce their stores from 50 to 40, are you still seeing retailers that are reducing their store growth plans, but still growing, not really changing their growth plans that they have with Regency?
Bruce Johnson: Ambika, that's very typical. I mean some more are not changing, but some are changing a little bit more dramatically. But I think that 20% cutback in Penney's probably is very indicative of what the lion share of most retailers were doing. They're being a little bit more conscious. They're keeping hold of the (inaudible)
Brian Smith: Yeah. I think it's similar to Target. I think they had 150 stores they are planning on doing, and announced about 118, something like that. But it happened few quarters ago, as you'll recall, and we are not seeing the same kind of adjustments that we saw two, three quarters ago.
Ambika Goel – Citi: Okay, great. Thank you. 
Hap Stein: Thank you, Ambika.
Operator: And we'll go to Christy McElroy with Banc of America. 
Christy McElroy - Banc of America: Hi good morning. Your guidance for 200 to 240 million of contributions to JV's, is that all completed development contribution? Is there any operating properties fixed in there as well? And if that's all development, does that mean that you are projecting 6.6% cap rates on new delivery?
Brian Smith: I think the answer is, yes.
Bruce Johnson: Yes.
Christy McElroy - Banc of America: Okay. And then if that's up from 6.2% last year, does that imply roughly 40 basis points increasing class A cap rate in your view? I think you talked about 25 basis points.
Bruce Johnson: Part of what's happened here is, as you may remember, there is a cumulative cap rate test that we need to make before, and in fact we have certainty of contribution into the open-end fund. And we are doing it, we are just using a little bit more conservative cap rate and using that threshold as a basis to do that. So I think that allowed us to be little bit more conservative in our projection from where cap rates are today.
Christy McElroy - Banc of America: So they could actually come in a bit lower?
Mary Lou Fiala: Yes, also Christy, if you recall, first of all, clearly, especially in times like this, clearly having the fund is a huge benefit for us for certainty of the take out. And when we sell through the fund, we save on transaction cost, as potential for saving from a tax standpoint. So clearly there is a little bit of a spread there that we are willing to take. So, even though these properties maybe worth a little more in the open market to our benefit to have the fund there. And then secondly, the firm buys on in place of income. So, if we sell property that's a 100% leased on under written cap rate that cap rate could drop by 25 basis points. So although, we're projecting it 6.6 we may -- you may see us reporting at the end of the year something lower than that.
Christy McElroy - Banc of America: That’s helpful. Thank you.
Brian Smith:  Thank you, Christy.
Operator: We'll go to Christeen Kim with Deutsche Bank 
Christeen Kim - Deutsche Bank: Hey. Good morning, guys. Following up on Ambika's questions about the retailer extension plans Target, (inaudible) Wal-Mart have share down in terms of their extension plans at this point. Where do you think the retailers are? Do you think they will come back three months from now, and then further contract their growth scenarios, or are they kind of where they need to be for the rest of the year?
Mary Lou Fiala: I'll take the inline retailers. I think that they have been very thoughtful from all of the retailers that we work with, in terms of looking at the '08 openings and, quite frankly, even in some of them into their '09, and have already taken the biggest portion of their hit. I think you have got factors that are difficult factors, that are still strong. And so I don't anticipate another big hit in terms of the inline, and I'll let Brian talk about the anchors.
Brian Smith: I think it's (inaudible) they've already recognized where they are with the hit, and they have made the adjustments, and I don’t think its coming back.
Bruce Johnson: The target is not making commitments today for 2008.
Christeen Kim - Deutsche Bank: Right.
Bruce Johnson: And they are not making commitments today for 2009, we are only making commitments for 2010 and out for the most part. And I think that's the thing that we need to all keep in mind here is that good level of perspective, because the biggest impact that we see is really on the projects that are in process. Once those are to be delivered, they would like to push those out as part of the candidates to get through these times. It's not [going forward] projects.
Christeen Kim - Deutsche Bank: Okay. That's helpful. And just touching on the guidance, and maybe of course assumptions of rent growth and the NOI growth seems fairly conservative, is that just you getting ready for a maybe a more difficult 2008, or is any thing else driving that?
Mary Lou Fiala: To good or bad, I think, I have always been accused of being conservative, and I think we're conservative, but I also think we are being realistic. And the biggest reason that we look at kind of a downturn in same store NOI has to do with lead time. So for instance, yesterday, Movie Gallery came up, said that they were going to close 400 stores, of that we have three locations. I have looked at the locations, and all three are strong. They are really good locations. I am very confident that we’re going to do that. We'll release it. But, because of the slowdown with the retailers, it's going to take us a little bit longer. So, part of the reason why -- the majority of the reason why occupancy is because of increased downtime. And we think that that's real, and we are conservative.
 : So, we felt comfortable with our guidance, but we've also spent a great deal of time going through the portfolio and understanding, the different components and what we are dealing with.
Hap Stein:  From that perspective, if anybody thinks that even in better centers, that’s it’s going to take a little bit longer to reach vacant space, that we can be able to sustain levels of rent growth that we've done in the past, and we are not going to have a few more bankruptcies than we have I think you've got, perhaps they've got ahead, I understand. And I bet our operations team has – they always, once you've gone over the portfolio and dialed in assumptions that are realistic, that I am not going to say that they are overly conservative and I am not going to say, but at the same time that we're still showing a range of 2.4% to 2.8% with those more moderate assumptions, that's pretty great in what could be a pretty difficult year is pretty gratifying. Obviously, the year could get more difficult, or there could be some pleasant surprises there.
Mary Lou Fiala: The other thing I'd say, is we keep in all redevelopments and we've got more redevelopments going on at the end of '07 and '08 than we historically have. So when you're closing down anchors and you're redoing the shopping center, you're taking the hit of NOI and you're taking a hit on occupancy. If you were to look at this past year without our redevelopments, our occupancy would have been just about 96%, and that would hold closely true for next year. So I think that half of our portfolio continues to be strong. But as Hap said, I think we just need to be very realistic and what we've said is what we believe will happen.
Hap Stein: And I will also say where we might be being a little bit overly conservative is that we are, for planning purposes, using that 2.4% to 2.8% range as a growth rate going forward. I would like to think that once we come out of these times, we can get back up to the 3% range.
Mary Lou Fiala: And I believe we can.
Christeen Kim - Deutsche Bank: Great. Thanks for the color.
Operator: Our next question is from Paul Morgan with FBR.
Paul Morgan - FBR: Good morning. Could you really help reconcile all the different cap rates, data points we have? I mean there is a lot of chatter when you acquired the portfolio last quarter at a 7 cap in a JV with some of the other numbers in lower 6s. I mean, maybe you could just pin down for me what the Class A coastal market, [gross ranker] shopping center would be right now?
Bruce Johnson: I think that Class A for most markets in the country is right around 6% to 6.25%. In California it's going to be slightly below 6%, about 5.9%. We see a lot of projects around that we look at, even if we don't buy necessarily, that are about 6%. So I think that B's has increased about 100, 150 basis points from where they were a year ago. I think the C's could be up as high as 300. There are just no buyers for those. And I think also, whereas before, Paul, there was a portfolio premium that buyers would pay to aggregate properties, today, it's a portfolio discount. So I'm a little bit more cautious with my future view of cap rates than Brian is as we continue to see individual transactions. We were selling (inaudible) the same market transaction would be closer to 6.4% -- reported as a 6.4% but it's really a 6%, because that included some prepayment penalties. But where you’ve got to raise of a lot of capital for a transaction, I think that capital is extremely cautious and it is more expensive. But we are continuing to be pleasantly surprised by what cap rates on an individual one-off transaction are trading. Some was off market.
Brian Smith: Yeah. I was going to add that the 7% portfolio, they are probably more A minus properties, some in a few smaller markets. Had it not been off market; it was a marketed transaction, we believe that that probably was in the 6.5% to 6.7% range. But it was prior of the larger portfolios of which the buyer basically wanted to sell these fixed assets and called us, and said will you please take this? It was more concerned with uncertainty of executions and closing by yearend than necessarily getting the highest and best price.
Paul Morgan - FBR: Okay. And then on the retailers, some of them have been consistent with sort of your 20% or less. I mean, the Starbucks number of cutting back new store growth in the US was more than that. And then, a lot of the lifestyle tenants have been one after the other paring back, [bracing their family], their store growth. And I wonder that as you comment on the two of those, and with respect to the lifestyle, guys, whether that makes you a little bit less inclined to pursue new lifestyle developments, given what they've been doing in the past couple of months?
Mary Lou Fiala: As I've gone through other retailers, and I actually listed it for our Board and for our team, and looked at it, you are right. I mean it's been anywhere from 10%, quite frankly, up to the highest, which was 27% decline, which was Starbucks, still being very aggressive, but definitely a pretty substantial number. So we're definitely seeing a cutback in the retailers. As far as the lifestyle, the inline retailers probably -- because as we talked about in the recessions, those (inaudible) is business driven and those are primarily as opposed to necessity-driven businesses that are in our gross ranker portfolio. They are much more cautious than you'll see the service retailers. And then all blows down to comp, and the grosses are comping well, the services are comping well. But when you get into the side shop, they are definitely much more cautious. And Brian can talk to our point of view on lifestyle versus neighborhood or community.
Brian Smith: We've never been a big lifestyle developer, anyway. Highland Village is the only one that's enjoying great success. So we do them on very opportunistic basis, but I do share the concern with that category. The project I told you that we did not count as a starts, is what we would call a power comps because of the significant power component to it, the traditional community center, but also has some lifestyle. It's got a lifestyle section. And I think part of the caution led us to -- let's wait and see how that one goes before we proceed.
Hap Stein:  We want to make sure the leases are invoiced. We are not going to pull it. We are not taking to the bank LOIs and real estate committee approvals. So, there is a, and you're still only talking about that is, a 90 million out of a 1.6 billion pipelines so that -- we are very cautious as far as that category.
Mary Lou Fiala: But there is an increased sensitivity with these retailers not only in terms of being more cautious in openings of stores, but also switching the lifestyle retailers of co-tenancy and definitely that's changed.
Paul Morgan - FBR: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: And we'll go to Jeffrey Spector with UBS.
Jeffrey Spector - UBS: Good morning. Can you just describe again the timeline '08 starts to completion, to stabilization. I think you said 93%, you said that some stores is happening in 2010, 2011?
Brian Smith:  Well, we would expect to close those starts, meaning closing the land in 2008. We'll start construction either some time in 2008 or 2009. So in fact, you'll have construction being completed probably say, sometime in 2009 or early 2010. And then you're figuring, we're dialing in now on a average of 24 months lease up properties. So, you are talking about in effect completing the lease up of these projections in 2011 or 2012.
Jeffrey Spector - UBS: How was that lease up changed? And do you feel at this point your budget, your guidance, for '08, really you are very conservative hearing that, we're not going to have, during next quarter, that change widened further and stabilizations decreasing?
Bruce Johnson:  I think that whatever changed is within the last six months, six months ago our average -- and we go through all of our developments rigorously every quarter. And four to six months ago, that average lease up time was 18 months and that's after completion of construction. I think that we historically have been in like 12 months, we are even conservative four to six months ago. This recent quarter review produced a 24 months average lease up time. I think the guidance that we've given is like a $115 million to $240 million and that assumes -- a few number of this projects are very, very closed and so are even already fully leased, that just got complete construction on. So we feel, I feel very confident that their range is appropriate, the part of region we have the range is some of that lease up, one center it's about 80% leased and committed very well could take a little bit longer that one [Hover] village project that Brian referred to. But within the range, so I would be very surprised and disappointed if we had to change the – you may change the upper end to the guidance the lower end to guidance that's I will be very disappointed if they have.
Jeffrey Spector - UBS: Great. Thank you. 
Operator: We'll go next to [Thomas Feldman] with Goldman Sachs.
Thomas Feldman - Goldman Sachs: Good morning guys. As I look at your leasing activity over the course of 2007, lease renewals as a percentage of total leasing ramps up fairly dramatically in the fourth quarter, by my calculations, to 87% versus an average of 74% in the prior three quarters. Is it what it’s going to take to maintain the 95% occupancy level you are targeting for 2008? And if so, when can we expect a return to more normalized levels of new gross renewal leasing?
Mary Lou Fiala: Tom, it was unusual, and I do think what's happened is not so much that we negotiated lower ramps to keep them, because as you see we had absent rent growth for fourth quarter and we really as of today we have a net back off, but what happened is that the retailers, we had planned for a lot of retailers to move out, thinking that there were other opportunities and in our centers in some cases that we felt they were little bit older and that they move out, but in reality they didn't. And I think what are you seeing in the trend is the fact that, think about it, if you are a retailer and you are producing strong sales and you are going to go out at this time and start a new center and pay higher rent, pay your [TI], lose sales because you have moved, or you are going to stay put. And they are staying put, because of the fact that we have such strong centers. I would anticipate that to occur for awhile. I just think people aren't going to be so anxious to move. So I think when I made the comments about tempering our Rev growth, that you haven't seen that yet and that has nothing to do with first quarter, that's hoping that we anticipate doing a little bit more in '08, based on, if you look at our results.
Thomas Feldman - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thanks a lot Mary Lou. I appreciate that. And then follow-up is, in terms of your development sales program, in 2007 about half of your sales were to third-parties versus to your co-investment programs. I know you've guided to $200 million to $240 million in contributions to your co-investment program in 2008. But, what are your expectations regarding development sales to third-parties? Is there still demand in the open market for you community center product?
Mary Lou Fiala: Before, I let Brian answer that I'll just step in. We are obligated that the fund has exclusive rights to our community center development. So anything compared to 250,000 square feet including anchor own stores is a must offer to open-end funds. So it would be highly unlikely for us. If so, any of those properties is on the third to the unrelated party, would only be the case that if for some reason something happens from the time we started the project to when we completed, that we determine that it's an asset we don't want to maintain our ownership in. I'll let Brian talk to the third-party demands.
Brian Smith: Yeah. Again, if you have an A property in an A market, there's plenty of demand. Where you don't want to be is a B product or in a tertiary market, or sell hundred million dollars of properties in portfolio, right.
Mary Lou Fiala: I think if you look at some of our in-process project, and I'm not sure if they're exactly stabilizing this year, I'm doing this off the top of my head, but we have some underway that were more opportunistic in a single tenant developments where we took a dark anchor and putting in JCPenney or Jim, those are the types of properties that we would sell to a third-party.
Thomas Feldman - Goldman Sachs: Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks a lot guys.
Brian Smith: Thanks
Operator: We'll go to Michael Miller with JP Morgan.
Joe Dazzio - JP Morgan: Good morning guys, Joe Dazzio on the phone with Mike. A question about the size of the promote, relative to three months ago when you first laid out '08, is that what you expected to be or greater or smaller?
Mary Lou Fiala: Its right where we expected to be, I mean the ranges basically. I think last quarter we made the contingent on exceeding the [Necri's] index. This is basically our partnership that's been in place since the year 2000, it's on an eight-year promote cycle. And we performed extremely well with seven years behind us from well in excess of Necri returns. So it's exactly where we thought it would be. The only range is really at yearend, we're going to have to value the portfolio. We've always dialed in a modest increase in cap rates. So, if they increase a little bit further, then that's kind of where the range is.
Brian Smith: One of the things that we're also being a little bit tempered by is the prices are being very cautious today also.
Joe Dazzio - JP Morgan: So that is then safe to say that the top end of the range was pulling a little bit for just a more conservative core growth assumptions?
Brian Smith: It had something to do with the NOI growth that we're using for 2.4% and 2.8% for '08, but also as you look out to, I think as Bruce mentioned and I mentioned, to 9% and 10%. And dialing in and assuming a little bit more conservative assumption for cap rates, and we just wanted to have what we consider to be a reasonable and sustainable level of development sales and we incorporate in a little bit lower growth rate for NOI growth. As far as sustaining in effect that 10% or 11% in '08, 8% seem like a more comfortable number on top of 10% to 11% rather than on top of 11% and 12% for '09 and '10.
Joe Dazzio - JP Morgan: Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: We'll go to Matt Ostrower with Morgan Stanley.
Matt Ostrower - Morgan Stanley: Good morning. I guess just one last question. I think it’s, Mary Lou, for you. Could you just contrast a little bit, is there anything that you're seeing in this cycle so far that looks operationally different materially from the last economic downturn. I guess a couple of things that come to my mind would be local tenants, and are there any issues with credit quality there, given what's happened in the credit markets, and then not to mention the home markets? And then, secondly, I guess a lot of the grocers have gotten into much higher end food, prepared foods and whatnot, is there any evidence even anecdotal at this point that any of those things point to more difficulties this time around?
Mary Lou Fiala: There is a difference this time to some extent than last time, and a lot of it has to do with the slowdown in home. Definitely, as I've mentioned before, the real estate offices and in line mortgage, we're seeing greater move outs in those than we have historically. Mom-and-pops, that's pretty typical of what you've seen in the downtime. Certainly, as far as the move outs, it's greater than it has been, but not greater than other difficult times. I think it's pretty normal. The video category is where we've seen a great deal of move outs, anticipated, some directed by us. And that is definitely a sector issue and not an economic issue. It's really supply/demand and where you can buy videos as well as technology. And the only thing to your point that we have seen, is that for the first time in the fourth quarter is greater move outs in restaurants. And even though their sales, if you look, overall, are still fairly strong softer than they were in the previous quarter in terms of growth and softer than in '06 in terms of growth. We're starting to see just somewhat of a slowdown in the restaurant. I don't necessarily believe that that is prepared food versus that because that's been out for a while. I think it really has to do with people just hunkering down and making their own food and being more cautious in what they spend and making that dollar go a little bit further, especially with gas prices. So that's kind of the color on that.
Matt Ostrower - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then, lastly, I guess I didn't hear you address this specifically, Hap, is there anything obvious (inaudible) you're looking out the next couple of years where you think there is really going to be a compelling investment opportunity that wasn't there before for reasons. Everything that we're hearing is that the higher quality stuff which is what you guys want to own is pretty stable and price in fundamental. I mean maybe a little bit on the margin I'm hearing you say there could be some development opportunities I guess. Anything else that you can think of that might end up presenting opportunity for your company?
Hap Stein: There are obviously some interesting opportunities outside of the US that we're looking at carefully. And there's been a lot of market this location in the Australian market. But we haven't yet figured out how to take advantage of that in a way that makes sense for our shareholders. And we're evaluating as far as moving other markets beyond the US borders, can we profitably utilized our core competency of assets management, operation systems and development, take advantage of the right opportunity there without taking our focus off the current opportunities we have in the US, so.
Mat Ostrower - Morgan Stanley: What's your instinct about that?
Hap Stein:  We've have got some intriguing opportunities there, whether that any of those can come to fruition or not we'll see. It's not something that we feel that we have the kind of right opportunity and the right circumstance as we take advantage of it.
Mat Ostrower - Morgan Stanley: Okay great. Thank you.
Hap Stein: Thank you.
Mary Lou Fiala: Thanks Matt.
Operator: We'll go next to [David Willington] with Merrill Lynch.
Craig Schmidt: Hi. Its Craig Schmidt of Merrill Lynch. I just wanted to touch on the minimum developmental requirements. I am looking at Jefferson Square, which was newly added to your in part fiscal developments. And have NOI yield after participant -- participation is 786. I just want to wondered, at what point is the NOI yield too low, and what makes you take lower yield on certain projects in the geography anchors or anything else?
- Merrill Lynch: Hi. Its Craig Schmidt of Merrill Lynch. I just wanted to touch on the minimum developmental requirements. I am looking at Jefferson Square, which was newly added to your in part fiscal developments. And have NOI yield after participant -- participation is 786. I just want to wondered, at what point is the NOI yield too low, and what makes you take lower yield on certain projects in the geography anchors or anything else?
Brian Smith:  That was too low. Jefferson Square normally, I think we gave up a 145 basis points on that one between the project level return and the return as we after we buyout the partner. That was one of those JVs that was done at a period of time when you required a trendiest in order to get that deal we had to do that. The way we think, which returns we can go to, we do have a band that we've to stay within, for those like the project up in Pacific Northwest where we had no development risk, it was just a redevelopment or retenanting. We would have done that at a pretty lower return, as it turned out that it was one of our highest returns. But truly it’s the function of risk and risk adjusted returns. So, the more self space got the more difficulty area, the worst demographics, neither wouldn’t do it or going to do it at a return that compensates this force.
Mary Lou Fiala: And in fact, in most cases still Brian can speak specifically Jefferson Square, but the partner participation, its often times based on what market cap rates are, when you are buying your partner out. So if cap rates rise between now and then these after partner participation yields will rise with the cap rates.
Brian Smith: Jefferson Square particular, if cap rates increase 50 basis points for example, the net return to us on the Jefferson after the buyout would increase 35 basis points.
Craig Schmidt: What is the going in return on that before partner buyout?
- Merrill Lynch: What is the going in return on that before partner buyout?
Mary Lou Fiala: 9.31%.
Bruce Johnson :  And so, right, this thing, keep in mind as you got a risk adjusted return on that project 9.3.1 under which we have a preference zone. And as Brian and Lisa indicated the lower the cap rate the lower our ultimate return, then in fact the higher the margin the higher the cap rate or higher return, but at the higher margins. But four key points is what protected there, you got 9.3% going in return. Having said all that and given the fact some of the projects are already in pipeline, have already been approved, about the either capital allocation committee, the investment committee, we did raise our minimum return threshold from 8% to 8.25% compare to the last quarter. There may be some stuff, it's already been improved and may come pretty later but.
Craig Schmidt: That's helpful. And another question just for my benefit if I take a look at development starts from '05 through a mid-point '08 estimate, and compare them to development stabilizations, I am getting a development starts of above $1.7 billion, but that development stabilization of $981 million, just overtime wouldn't those numbers be similar?

Mary Lou Fiala: Yeah. What we expect – if you remember we've got 1.1 billion or 1.0 billion or 1.1 billion in process. So, we have to add that to when we stabilize to get to the start. And overtime what you expect is, as long as we maintain the same level of starts, you are going to have the same number of starts as stabilization each year, if all things being equal. But as you heard us saying, we've extended our lease-up times on those that are in process. So, for this year, you are going to see a slightly lower level of stabilizations, which would say that in future years we are going to have a greater number of stabilizations then we'll start, but based on average the same over period of time.
Brian Smith:  It may extend a little bit into '09, at a lower level, but starting at 10 etcetera should be at higher levels.
Bruce Johnson: No some of this year's push out and stabilization had to do with the slower lease up, and also some of it had to do with the entitlement delays that we faced in the entire barrier market.
Brian Smith: And from a stabilization standpoint, as Bruce pointed out and I did, there were $140 million of projects that were expected to be stabilized, previously expected to be stabilized in '08, that are now 86% to 92% leased that we pushed into '09.
Craig Schmidt: So, just looking at the developments starts at $503 million in '06. Could you still have some of those that are yet to stabilize?
- Merrill Lynch: So, just looking at the developments starts at $503 million in '06. Could you still have some of those that are yet to stabilize?
Bruce Johnson: Right, some of those been yet to stabilize.
Hap Stein: Actually some of these may not as part of construction still it done.
Craig Schmidt: Okay, thanks a lot. Hap Stein Thank you, Craig.
- Merrill Lynch: Okay, thanks a lot. Hap Stein Thank you, Craig.
Operator: And at this time there are no further questions in our queue. I will turn the conference back over to our presenters for any additional or closing comments.
Bruce Johnson: We appreciate you taking the time to join us on the call, and your interest in Regency, and hope that everybody enjoys the rest of week and have a very good weekend. Thank you very much.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect.
